            <p><em>This Privacy Policy was last modified on December 16, 2011.</em></p>
            <p>Bannerconnect takes online user privacy very seriously and we recommend you fully read this Privacy Policy, explaining how we collect, protect and use information and under what circumstances we share this information.</p>
            <p>Please keep in mind when leaving our website or using our services that we have no control over our partners, clients or third parties. When using their website, services or when taking advantage of their advertised offers in any way, their privacy policy and terms of agreement apply.</p>

            <strong>What we do</strong>
            <p>Bannerconnect specialises in online display advertising. We buy and (re)sell online display advertising space, from website publishers to advertisers and agencies. We also manage and optimise advertising campaigns, using different forms of targeting. As part of the targeting process, we collect data about online user behaviour and turn this data into anonymous user profiles.</p>
            <p>We respect and adhere to the IAB Europe EU Principles for Online Behavioural Advertising. For more information on behavioural advertising, please visit <a title="Visit Your Online Choices" href="http://youronlinechoices.com" target="_blank">youronlinechoices.com</a>.</p>
            <strong>How we collect information</strong>
            <p>Cookies and pixels allow us to give every device visiting our website or using our services a unique ID. This ID is used to match the collected information to the device without the use of any personally identifiable information (PII).</p>
            <strong>What are cookies</strong>
            <p>Cookies are small text files that are stored on your device by your web browser. Cookies do not contain programmes and are only accessed by your web browser. They ensure a user-friendly web experience by storing information about the use of the website and any preferences for features or functions, such as language preferences, privacy settings, shopping baskets or relevant advertisements.</p>
            <p>If you want to learn more about cookies, please visit the <a title="Visit the IAB Cookie FAQ" href="http://www.iabeurope.eu/cookies-faq.aspx" target="_blank">Internet Advertising Bureau’s Cookies FAQ</a>.</p>
            <strong>What are pixels</strong>
            <p>Pixels are event-trackers for visitations and actions on a website. A pixel can, for example, register a view of this page or confirm an online sale of a product after seeing an advertisement. When a pixel is triggered, it stores its information in a cookie.</p>
            <strong>Data from third parties</strong>
            <p>We may buy data from third parties to expand and update our profile collection or further enrich profiles we already have. As with data collected by Bannerconnect, any bought data from third parties does not include personally identifiable information (PII).</p>
            <strong>What we collect</strong>
            <p><strong>The data we collect does not include any Personally Identifiable Information (PII).</strong> Furthermore, we do not request any information from your device that is unrelated to the use of our website or the use of our services.</p>
            <p>The collected information does typically include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Visited website addresses (URLs),</li>
              <li>Date and time of your visit,</li>
              <li>The type of browser and operating system used,</li>
              <li>How often a certain ad is delivered and clicked.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All collected data helps us build a profile based on behaviour, interests and approximate geographical location.</p>
            <strong>Personally Identifiable Information (PII)</strong>
            <p>We do not knowingly solicit or collect Personally Identifiable Information. Our definition of Personally Identifiable Information is in compliance with the Internet Advertising Bureau’s (IAB) definition:<br>
                <em>We do not collect ‘information that can be traced back to a specific user and provide personal information such as name, phone number, address, etc.’. In other words, personally identifiable information is information that can identify you as a person rather than an anonymous profile.</em>
            </p>
            <p><strong>All of our profiles are anonymous and each profile represents a specific browser on a specific device, not a real person.</strong></p>
            <strong>Why we collect data</strong>
            <p>We use the collected data to match advertisements to profiles of users who are more receptive to the offer. We believe relevant advertisements can be beneficial to both the user and the advertiser, while providing a less disruptive user experience.</p>
            <p>Matching advertisements with individual profiles is a fully automated process and individual profiles are only accessible by a select group of people within Bannerconnect. All available data presented internally or externally consists of totals or averages of the aggregated data.</p>
            <strong>Personalised advertisements</strong>
            <p>On behalf of a client, Bannerconnect can also track viewed products on a website (f.e. webshop) and store these products in a cookie on your pc. Later, when a user lands on a webpage with advertising space, an ad can be served for one or more of the viewed (or related) products.</p>
            <p>The goal is to provide you with relevant ads and unique offers, based on your interests. This process is fully automated and contains no personally identifiable information (PII).</p>
            <strong>User Choice</strong>
            <p>You may change your web browser settings to refuse cookies at all times. However, this may limit your ability to use certain functions on websites you visit. Instructions for removing and refusing cookies can be found under your browser’s help function.</p>
            <p>You can also choose to opt-out from our profiling services. Opting out does not mean you will stop getting ads or see fewer ads. However, the ads that you receive will no longer be tailored to your interests.</p>
            <p>If you do not want to receive any more <strong>personalised advertisements</strong> from Bannerconnect, you may <a href="/opt-out.php" title="Opt-out of personalised advertisements">opt-out of personalised advertisements</a>.</p>
            <p>If you do not want to share <strong>any of your preferences</strong> with Bannerconnect, you may <a href="http://ib.adnxs.com/optout" title="Opt-out of behavioural advertising">opt-out of our data collection altogether</a>.</p>
            <p>Opting out is device and browser specific and requires a cookie to be placed on your device. When switching devices, browsers or after deleting your cookies, this process will need to be repeated. In order for the opt-out to work, your browser must be set to accept third party cookies.</p>
            <strong>Disclosure to third parties</strong>
            <p>We reserve the right to disclose our data to advertisers, clients and partners or others who work on our behalf. The information provided to third parties does not contain personally identifiable information.</p>
            <p>Third parties are obligated to use the information they receive in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.</p>
            <p>Bannerconnect may also share information when compelled by a governmental agency, law, regulation, a court or other legal process.</p>

            <p>The websites and services provided by Bannerconnect are not intended for or directed at persons under 13 years of age. Regardless of age, we do not knowingly solicit or collect any personally identifiable information (PII), nor do we market our products or services to children under the age of 13.</p>
