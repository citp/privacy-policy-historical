At Bank of Ireland we are committed to ensuring the privacy of your information.

We understand that as a customer or visitor using the Bank of Ireland site, privacy and the security of your confidential information when online is very important to you. The purpose of our Privacy Policy is to outline Bank of Ireland's practices in this area. 

Some of the technical terms used in our privacy statement are explained at the end of this section.

 **The Information we collect**

As you browse through our web site, our web server collects information about your visit, not about you personally. We gather and monitor statistics such as: 

  * The number of people who visit our site
  * The date and time of visits 
  * The number of pages viewed
  * The time spent on the site 
  * The most popular sections of our site 



This information is anonymous and no attempt will be made to identify visitors. So, for example, on a specific day we can identify that our site has forty thousand visitors. However we know nothing about these visitors in terms of email addresses or any other personal information. 

We will only ask for personal information from which you can be identified (such as your name, address, email address etc.) where the information is required for a specific purpose e.g. applying online for a Credit Card, Mortgage or Personal loan. This gathering of information is consistent with our branch and telephone practices.

 **Use of "Cookies"**

A cookie is a small piece of information which a web site stores through your web browser on your PC that it can later retrieve when you log back on to the site. This means that the site will remember your preferences and possibly even your name! 

www.bankofireland.ie does not use cookies. This is to further protect the confidentiality, anonymity and security of your personal information.

 **Disclosure of Information**

Bank of Ireland will not divulge customer information to a third party unless: 

  * We have received authorisation from the customer 
  * We are required to do so by law 



**Security of Information**

At www.bankofireland.ie we understand how important the security and confidentiality of your information is to you. Keeping customers' information secure is a top priority for Bank of Ireland. Our goal is to protect your information on the Internet in the same way as we would over the phone, in a branch or at an ATM. 

To ensure the highest level of security of information passing between our customers and ourselves, Bank of Ireland uses what is known as 128 bit SSL. This is an encryption method which scrambles information while it moves from one source to another to prevent the information being viewed or tampered with.
