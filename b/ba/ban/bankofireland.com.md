We only ask and will only ask for personal information from which you can be identified where the information is required for particular purposes e.g. applying online for a credit card, mortgage or personal loan. Examples of details that may be sought include your name, address, e-mail address, etc. (Please note in this regard the paragraph headed Internet fraud below)

All information provided to us by you will be treated with the utmost confidentiality in accordance with all applicable legislative and regulatory standards. If you ever decide that you no longer wish us to keep or use information or you want the information to be revised or updated, please feel free to [contact us](https://web.archive.org/html/gws/help/contact_us/customer_care/index.html#doclink7). We will remove or amend the information as appropriate in accordance with applicable legislative and regulatory requirements.

At Bank of Ireland Group, we understand how important the security and confidentiality of your information is to you. Keeping customer information secure is a top priority for Bank of Ireland Group.

**Internet Fraud**

A number of banking organisations and their customers have recently been the target of hoax e-mails that are aimed at gathering Internet/account details of the customers. Some of these hoax e-mails have encouraged or facilitated contact with hoax websites that purport to be (but are not) the website of the relevant banking organisation. To date the occurrence of such online fraud has not been extensive. However, we would always advise you to be cautious as regards disclosing your personal details. In particular, you should note that we will only ever request your personal details if: (i) you are seeking to initiate e-mail contact with us via this Website; or (ii) you initiate a request for a particular service via this Website and we require certain of your personal details to provide you with the requested service and the requested service is a loan/credit card application, a mortgage application, a request for a telephone call from a sales advisor, or a request for a pensions information pack or other product information.
