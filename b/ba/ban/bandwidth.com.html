										<p>Cookies are small data text files that, if your Web browser permits, can be stored on your computer's hard drive. Bandwidth.com.com and its Web sites use cookies:</p>
										<p></p><ul>
										<li>To help us recognize your Web browser as a previous visitor and save and remember any preferences set while your Web browser visited our Web sites. For example, if you register on our Web sites, we may use cookies to remember your registration information so you do not need
to log into our Web sites each time you visit. We also may save your password in a cookie, if you checked the box entitled "Save this password for automatic sign-in" (or other similar words). Please note that we encrypt for security purposes customer IDs, passwords, and any other account-related data included in cookies.</li>
										<li>To help us customize the content, Web site experience, and advertisements provided to you on our Web sites and on other Web sites across the Internet. For example, when you access a web page, a cookie automatically recognizes your Web browser as you navigate on the Internet and presents you with information and advertising based on your apparent interests.</li>
										<li>To help measure and research the effectiveness of the features, offerings, advertisements, and email communications (by determining which emails you open and act upon) of our Web sites.</li>
										</ul><p></p>
										<p>The Help portion of the toolbar on most Web browsers will tell you how to prevent your Web browser from accepting new cookies, have the Web browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or disable most cookies. However, you may not be able to access some tools and features offered on our Web sites if you refuse to accept cookies.</p>
										<p>Our Web sites also may use Web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags or Web bugs). These Web beacons are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, that we place in the code of a Web page. Web beacons allow us to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our Web sites to another, deliver or communicate with cookies, understand whether you have come to our Web sites from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party Web site, and improve the performance of our Web sites. We also may allow our service providers to use Web beacons to help us understand which emails recipients have opened and track the visitor traffic on our Web sites.</p>
