			<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>						<p style="text-align: left;" align="center"><strong>PRIVACY POLICY / YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="center"><strong>Last updated: October 28, 2013</strong><strong></strong></p>
<p>This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use and share information when you use our Services.&nbsp; The terms “we,” “us,” or “our” mean Bankrate, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its legal subsidiaries and affiliates.&nbsp; The term “Services,” means, collectively, various websites, applications, widgets, email notifications and other mediums, or portions of such mediums, through which you have accessed this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; By accessing or using our Services, you consent to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of Your Information (collectively, “Use of Your Information”) as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>For purposes of this Privacy Policy, “Your Information” means information about you, which may be of a confidential nature and may include personally identifying information, medical and health history information, and/or financial information.</p>

<li>Information collected by any person or entity other than us, even if related to our Services (such as a third-party website, application, widget or lead form).</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to this Privacy Policy, our Services are also governed by our&nbsp;<a title="Terms of Use" href="http://www.bankratecreditcards.com/terms/" target="_blank">Terms of Use</a> and any other documents referred to in this Privacy Policy and our <a title="Terms of Use" href="http://www.bankratecreditcards.com/terms/" target="_blank">Terms of Use</a>. &nbsp;These documents describe information that we collect from you or that you provide on or to the Services and how Your Information may be used and disclosed by us. They also describe the choices available to you regarding our Use of Your Information and how you can access and update Your Information. Please read this Privacy Policy and the <a title="Terms of Use" href="http://www.bankratecreditcards.com/terms/" target="_blank">Terms of Use</a> carefully.</p>
<p><strong><em>Information We Collect and Receive About You </em></strong></p>
<p>We might receive or collect several types of information about you, such as the information described below.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Information You Provide</span></p>
<p>The following are situations in which you may provide Your Information to us:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you fill out forms or fields through our Services;</li>
<li>When you sign up for any newsletters or other materials through our Services;</li>
<li>When you provide information to us through a third-party application, service or website;</li>
<li>When you communicate with us or request information about us or our Services, whether via email or other means;</li>
<li>When you participate in online surveys;</li>
<li>When you participate in any of our marketing initiatives, including, contests, events, or promotions; and</li>
<li>When you participate in forums or provide user generated content or submissions.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Information Third Parties Provide</span></p>
<p>We may collect information about you from sources other than you, such as from social media websites (i.e., Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter or others), blogs, other users and our business partners.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">General Use and Preference Information</span></p>
<p>We may collect, receive and store information regarding your general use of our Services (such as details of how and when you used our Services, interactions with our Services, log in information, resources that you access, your Internet protocol address, your browser type, and your device type), as well as your preferences.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Device Information</span></p>
<p>When you use our Services through your computer, mobile phone or other device, we may collect information regarding and related to your device, such as hardware models and IDs, device type, operating system version, the request type, the content of your request and basic usage information about your use of our Services, such as date and time.&nbsp; In addition, we may collect information regarding application-level events and associate that with your account to provide customer service.&nbsp; We may also collect and store information locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser web storage and application data caches.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Location Information</span></p>
<p>If you enable the collection of location information on your device, then we may collect information about your actual location, such as your mobile device’s GPS coordinates.&nbsp; We may also use other technologies to determine your location (such as through the location of nearby Wi-Fi access points or cell towers), or obtain your location information from third parties.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Phone Numbers</span></p>
<p>We may collect your phone number in several ways.&nbsp; For example, we may collect your phone number: (i) if you submit your phone number to us through our Services; (ii) by capturing your phone number if you call us; or (iii) if a third party provides your phone number to us.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cookies and Anonymous Identifiers</span></p>
<p>We and third parties use various technologies to collect and store information when you use our Services, including sending cookies, pixel tags or other anonymous identifiers to your device.&nbsp; “Cookies” are pieces of data stored on your computer, mobile phone or other device.&nbsp; A “pixel tag” is a type of technology placed within a website or email for the purpose of tracking activity, which is often used in combination with cookies.&nbsp; Other “anonymous identifiers” are random strings of characters used for the same purposes as cookies, such as with mobile devices where cookie technology is not available.&nbsp; These technologies help us know that you are logged on, provide you with features based on your preferences, understand when you are interacting with our Services, and compile other information regarding use of our Services.</p>
<p>The information collected through these technologies, standing alone, cannot be used to determine your identity.&nbsp; Such information may, however, be combined in a way that makes it become personally identifiable information (i.e., information that can identify you).&nbsp; If this happens, we will treat the combined information as personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>Please note that, in most cases, you can remove or block cookies (such as by using the settings in your browser), but doing so may affect your ability to use our Services.</p>
<p>The use of tracking technologies by our service providers, technology partners or other third party assets (such as social media) on the Services is not covered by our Privacy Policy. &nbsp;These third parties may use cookies, clear gifs, images, and scripts to help them better manage their content on our Services.&nbsp;&nbsp; We do not have access or control over these technologies.</p>
<p><strong><em>How We Use Information</em></strong></p>
<p>We may make Use of Your Information for various lawful business purposes.&nbsp; Among others, these purposes may include using Your Information to:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Engage in customer support</em>.&nbsp; For example, we might confirm and complete transactions requested by you, verify information you provide to us and provide you with administrative notices.</li>
<li><em>Contact you and provide you with information</em>.&nbsp; For example, we might provide or contact you through telephone, email, postal or other communications with Service updates, promotional materials, surveys, offers, quotes, personalized information and other information from us or our business partners.</li>
<li><em>Analyze, improve and manage our Services and operations.</em>&nbsp; For example, we might obtain feedback regarding our Services, understand and anticipate your needs and preferences, better understand your use of our Services, customize and tailor Service content and advertising, improve our marketing and promotional efforts, engage in statistical analysis and provide feedback to our vendors, advertisers and other third parties.</li>
<li><em>Resolve problems and disputes, and engage in other legal and security matters</em>. For example, we may use Your Information to comply with, monitor compliance with and enforce this Privacy Policy, our&nbsp;<a title="Terms of Use" href="http://www.bankratecreditcards.com/terms/" target="_blank">Terms of Use</a> and any other applicable agreements and policies, meet other legal and regulatory requirements, and to protect the security and integrity of our Services.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>How We Disclose Information </em></strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">General Disclosure of Your Information</span></p>
<p>We may disclose Your Information:</p>
<ul>
<li>To any person who, in our reasonable judgment, is authorized to receive Your Information as your agent, including as a result of your business dealings with that person (for example, your attorney);</li>
<li>To our third-party vendors so that they may provide support for our internal and business operations, including for the handling of data processing, data verification, data storage, surveys, research, internal marketing, delivery of promotional, marketing and transaction materials, and our Services’ maintenance and security. These companies are authorized to Use Your Information only as necessary to provide these services to us and are contractually obligated to keep Your Information confidential;</li>
<li>To third parties such as insurance providers when you use our Services to request a quote, services, or information from one or more of those third parties (“Requested Service Providers”), such as by clicking “get your quotes” or other similar buttons at the end of a form;</li>
<li>To third parties when you engage in certain activities through our Services that are sponsored by them, such as purchasing products or services offered by a third party, electing to receive information or communications from a third party, or electing to participate in contests, sweepstakes, games or other programs sponsored, in whole or in part, by a third party.&nbsp; When we disclose Your Information to these third parties, Your Information will become subject to the information use and sharing practices of the third party, and the third party will not be restricted by this Privacy Policy with respect to its use and further sharing of Your Information;</li>
<li>To third parties that are interested in contacting you or providing offers to you that may be related to our Services or about products or services you may find of interest;</li>
<li>As required by law or ordered by a court, regulatory, or administrative agency;</li>
<li>As we deem necessary, in our sole discretion, if we believe that you are violating any applicable law, rule or regulation, or are otherwise interfering with another’s rights or property, including, without limitation, our rights or property;</li>
<li>If requested by authorities in the event of any act of terrorism or instance of local, regional or national emergency;</li>
<li>To enforce our <a title="Terms of Use" href="http://www.bankratecreditcards.com/terms/" target="_blank">Terms of Use</a>, this Privacy Policy, and any other applicable agreements and policies;</li>
<li>To enforce or protect our rights;</li>
<li>In connection with a Business Transfer, as defined below (see <strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Business Transfers</span></em></strong> below); and</li>
<li>To our affiliated companies (i.e., companies under common control or management with us).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you do not want Your Information shared as described above, then you should not provide us with Your Information.</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Requests for Quotes and Services from Requested Service Providers</span></p>
<p>As noted above, we may share Your Information with Requested Service Providers when you use our Services to request a quote, services or information from one or more third parties (a “Request”).&nbsp; <strong>IF YOU SUBMIT A REQUEST, REQUESTED SERVICE PROVIDERS MAY CONTACT YOU DIRECTLY WITH QUOTES VIA MAIL, TELEPHONE, TEXT MESSAGE, FAX, EMAIL AND OTHER MEANS OF COMMUNICATION.&nbsp; YOU MAY RECEIVE TELEMARKETING CALLS AS A CONSEQUENCE OF SUBMITTING A REQUEST THROUGH OUR SERVICES, EVEN IF YOU ARE ON THE NATIONAL DO NOT CALL REGISTRY OR ANY OTHER DO NOT CALL REGISTRY.&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>If you are matched with Requested Service Providers, you expressly consent to the Requested Service Providers conducting any research necessary to provide you with quotes for your Request.&nbsp; Requested Service Providers may need to share Your Information to conduct such research.&nbsp; As an example, if you request insurance quotes, consumer reports may be ordered in connection with your insurance application.&nbsp; Such reports may provide information that may assist in determining eligibility for insurance and the price you may be charged for insurance.&nbsp; Consumer reports may also be used for updates, renewal or extensions of this insurance.&nbsp; In addition, insurance companies may use third parties in connection with the development of a “insurance score” for you.&nbsp; <strong>If you do not want Requested Service Providers to conduct necessary research to provide you with a quote for your Request, then you should not submit a Request</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Please note that if you submit a Request through our Services and we share Your Information as described above in connection with your Request, you will not have the opportunity to opt out of the disclosure of Your Information in connection with that Request.</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Aggregation and De-Personalization</span></p>
<p>We may take Your Information and de-indentify it either by combining it with information about other individuals (aggregating Your Information with information about other individuals), or by removing characteristics (such as your name) that make the information personally identifiable to you (de-identifying Your Information).&nbsp; We reserve the right to share, loan, rent, sell, or otherwise disclose such information to third parties at any time, for any lawful purpose, without notice or compensation to you.<strong>&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sharing with Friends</span></p>
<p>If the Services contains any functionality allowing you to send content to a friend, then please be aware that: (a) we may display your email address to your friend; and (b) we may use information you provide about your friend to facilitate the communication and as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sweepstakes</span></p>
<p>If you are submitting information to us pursuant to a sweepstakes entry, we reserve the right to share, loan, rent, sell or otherwise disclose the information that you submit with third parties at any time, for any lawful purpose without notice or compensation to you.&nbsp; Participation in these sweepstakes is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose Your Information. Please refer to the official rules and privacy policy for each individual sweepstakes for our specific policies regarding information sharing and disclosure pursuant to that sweepstakes entry.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Circumvention of Security Measures</span></p>
<p>We cannot ensure that Your Information will only be disclosed as described in this Privacy Policy. No method of transmission or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security. Additionally, by way of example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be forced to disclose Your Information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications.&nbsp; Therefore, notwithstanding anything to the contrary within this Privacy Policy, our Terms of Use or any other applicable agreement or policy, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">you use our Services at your own risk</span> and we do not promise or guarantee, and you should not expect, that Your Information will always remain private.&nbsp; In the event that an unauthorized third party compromises our security measures, we will not be responsible for any damages directly or indirectly caused by an unauthorized third party’s ability to view, use or disseminate Your information.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Business Transfers</span></p>
<p>We specifically and expressly reserve the right to disclose, lease, sell, assign or transfer Your Information collected through our Services, and any of our databases, together with any personally identifiable information contained in such databases, to third parties in connection with a Business Transfer.&nbsp; A “Business Transfer” means a share or asset sale, acquisition, merger, consolidation, reorganization, spin-off, bankruptcy or other corporate change involving us and/or our affiliates, even if the Business Transfer is only being contemplated and regardless of whether the Business Transfer relates to a part or a whole of our business.&nbsp; Nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to interfere with our ability to transfer all or part of our business, equity, and/or assets (including our Services) to an affiliate or independent third party at any time, for any lawful purpose, without compensation to you.</p>
<p><strong><em>Children’s Information</em></strong></p>
<p>You must be at least 13 years of age to register with or use certain portions of the Services.&nbsp; The Services are not intended for children under 13 years of age.&nbsp; No one under 13 years of age may provide any personal information to or on the Services.&nbsp; We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.&nbsp; If you believe that we may have any information from or about a child, please contact us at <strong>Affiliates_Team@bankratecreditcards.com</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Network Advertising</em></strong></p>
<p>From time to time, we may participate in or use advertising networks, such as third-party advertising servers, advertising agencies, technology vendors and research firms.&nbsp; We may use these third-party advertising networks for marketing, advertising and promotional purposes, as well as to serve advertisements to you.&nbsp; Advertising networks often gather data about consumers who view advertisements to make inferences about a consumer’s interests and preferences, which enables their computers to deliver advertisements directly targeted to the consumer’s specific interests.&nbsp; This practice is often referred to as “online behavioral advertising.”&nbsp; For example, a third-party advertising network might collect the type of Internet browser you use, the type of computer operating system you use, the domain name of a website you visit, whether or not you visit specific pages of a website, the location of your Internet service provider’s presence, the date and time of a visit to a website and other interactions between you and a website.&nbsp; Please see the “Online Behavioral Advertising” subsection of <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Choices About How We Use and Collect Your Information</span></strong> below to read about how you can prevent certain third-party advertising networks from collecting information about you.</p>
<p><strong><em>User Generated Content </em></strong></p>
<p>We offer publicly accessible blogs and other interactive media through our Services.&nbsp; To request removal of Your Information from our blog or community forum, contact us at <strong>Affiliates_Team@bankratecreditcards.com</strong>.&nbsp; In some cases, we may not be able to remove Your Information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.</p>
<p>Some comment areas are managed by a third party application that may require you to register to post a comment.&nbsp; We do not have access or control of the information posted to the blog.&nbsp; You will need to contact or login into the third party application if you want the personal information that was posted to the comments section removed.&nbsp; To learn how the third party application uses your information, please review their privacy policy.</p>
<p>You are responsible for any content, including personal information, that you contribute to be published or displayed (“posted”) on our Services, or that you transmit to other users of our Services (collectively, “User Generated Content”).&nbsp; Your User Generated Content is posted on and transmitted to other users of our Services at your own risk.&nbsp; We cannot control the actions of other users of our Services with whom you may choose to share your User Generated Content.&nbsp; We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures of our Services.&nbsp; As a result, we cannot and do not guarantee that your User Generated Content will not be viewed by unauthorized persons.&nbsp; You understand and acknowledge that, even after removal, copies of your User Generated Content may remain viewable in cached and archived pages, or might have been copied or stored by other Service users.&nbsp; Proper access and use of information provided through our Services, including User Generated Content, is governed by our <a title="Terms of Use" href="http://www.bankratecreditcards.com/terms/">Terms of Use</a>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Social Media Widgets</em></strong></p>
<p>Our Services may include social media features, such as the Facebook Like button or interactive mini-programs that run on our Services. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting, and&nbsp;may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.

<p><strong><em>Choices About How We Use and Disclose Your Information</em></strong></p>
<p>We strive to provide you with choices regarding the personal information you provide to us.&nbsp; Below are some mechanisms that provide you with control over certain information:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Cookies</em>.&nbsp; If you do not wish us to collect cookies, you may set your browser to refuse cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent.&nbsp; If you do so, please note that some parts of our Services may then be inaccessible or may not function properly.</li>
<li><em>Email Offers from Us.</em>&nbsp; If you do not wish to receive email offers or newsletters from us, you can opt out of receiving email information from us (other than emails related to the completion of your registration, correction of user data, change of password and other similar communications essential to your transactions through our Services) by using the unsubscribe process at the bottom of the email.</li>
<li><em>Online Behavioral Advertising</em>.&nbsp; Certain third-party advertising networks that deliver behavioral advertising are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”).&nbsp; You can prevent NAI member companies from collecting preference data about you by clicking <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/" target="_blank">here</a> and following the NAI’s directions.&nbsp; <em>Note that if you opt out through the NAI, you will still receive advertising.&nbsp; In addition, if you opt out through the NAI and later delete your cookies, use a different browser or buy a new computer, you will need to renew your opt out choice.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Information You Disclose to Third Parties</em></strong></p>
<p>You may be presented with an opportunity to receive information and/or marketing offers from third parties in connection with our Services.&nbsp; All information you disclose to such third parties will be subject to the privacy policy and practices of such third parties.&nbsp; We are not responsible for the privacy policies and practices of such third parties and, therefore, you should review the privacy policies and practices of such third parties prior to disclosing information to them.&nbsp; If you later decide that you no longer want to receive communications from a third party, you will need to contact that third party directly.</p>
<p><strong><em>Links to Third-Party Websites</em></strong></p>
<p>Our Services, as well as the email messages sent with respect to our Services, may contain links or access to websites operated by third parties that are beyond our control.&nbsp; For example, if you click to apply for a product such as a credit card through our Services, you may be linked to a third-party website to complete an application.&nbsp; Links or access to third parties from our Services are not an endorsement by us of such third parties, or their websites, applications, products, services, or practices.&nbsp; We are not responsible for the privacy policy, terms and conditions, practices or the content of such third parties. These third-parties may send their own cookies to you and independently collect data.&nbsp; If you visit or access a third-party website, application or other property that is linked or accessed from our Services, we encourage you to read any privacy statements and terms and conditions of that third party before providing any personally identifiable information.&nbsp; If you have a question about the terms and conditions, privacy policy, practices or contents of a third party, please contact the third party directly.</p>
<p><strong><em>Third Party Widgets and Plug-ins</em></strong></p>
<p>Our Services include social media features, such as the Facebook Like button, links to our various social media pages and widgets, such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our Services. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly through our Services. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.</p>
<p><strong><em>Operation of our Services in the United States</em></strong></p>
