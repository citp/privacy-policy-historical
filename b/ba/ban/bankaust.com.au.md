## Privacy and Credit Reporting Policy

Bank Australia complies with the provisions relating to privacy and to the collection, use, disclosure, and storage of your information contained in the:

  * _Privacy Act 1988_ ,
  * Australian Privacy Principals (APPs),
  * Credit Reporting Privacy Code, and

Customers and users are concerned about how their information will be used and we recognise these concerns about their privacy and confidentiality.

The APPs provide a set of rules which govern how we collect, use, disclose and store personal, credit and credit eligibility information. The APPs also require us to have a clearly expressed and up to date APP privacy policy about our management of your information (that is, information that allows others to identify you).

We may ask you to explain why your credit report differs from what you have told us about your financial history.

We will advise you at the time how you may contact the external dispute resolution scheme. You can find more information on our complaint and dispute resolution process.
