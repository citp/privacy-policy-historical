Last Updated:  **October 2015

1.    Introduction

**

Your privacy is a serious matter to us.  Please take a few minutes to read this Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) so that you understand how we treat your information.  This Privacy Policy explains how information is collected, used and disclosed by Bandsintown, LLC and its affiliates **** (“Bandsintown” “we” “us” or “our”) with respect to your access to and use of the Services (as hereafter defined), whether as a Fan or as an Artist, through (a) our website, located at www.bandsintown.com, [www.artists.bandsintown.com](http://www.artists.bandsintown.com/) and all corresponding websites associated and affiliated with Bandsintown (the “Sites”) (b) Bandsintown-branded mobile, web, tablet, desktop and other applications, including applications made available through Facebook, iOS and Android (the “Bandsintown App(s)”) or (c) any of the Manager/Analytics Services, Content, Bandsintown’s social networking services and any other content, applications, features, functionality, information and services offered by us whether through the Bandsintown Apps, the Sites or otherwise (each of the above individually and collectively referred to herein as the “Services”).  This Privacy Policy includes examples of the types of information we collect and the kinds of companies with which we share such information.  Please review our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms) **** which governs your use of the Services. Any capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy shall have the meaning ascribed in the [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms).

This Privacy Policy will remain in full force and effect, even if your use of or participation in the Services or any other particular service, feature, function or promotional activity offered on or in connection with the Services terminates, expires, is suspended or deactivated for any reason. If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please do not participate in any of the Services. This Privacy Policy applies regardless of the Device you use to access the Services or whether you are accessing the Services as a registered user (i.e., an end user with a User Account) or otherwise.

This Privacy Policy governs only the information (a) collected by us from you or (b) provided to us by a Third Party Platform (e.g., Apple (iTunes, etc.), Facebook, Twitter, Last.fm, Pandora, etc.) about you, in each instance, on or in connection with your use of the Services, and does not cover any other information collected in any other manner or collected by any other third party, unless specifically stated. Where you have provided your personal information to third parties, including marketing companies, advertisers and service providers and have provided sufficient consent, we may obtain such personal information and combine it with your Information (as defined herein) and, if we do so, our use of the resulting combined Information will be subject to this Privacy Policy.

 **2.** **     ** **Information We Collect About You**

As it is used in this Privacy Policy, the term “Personal Information” means any information that we collect on or in connection with the Services that would allow someone to identify and/or contact you, such as your full name, address, e-mail address, physical address, payment card information, telephone number(s), a unique device identifier assigned to your Device (“UDID”), Third Party Platform anonymous identifiers, your Internet protocol (IP) address (if applicable), and location data (if you enable this feature).  When we use the term “Additional Information”, we mean any information that we collect about you on or in connection with the Services other than Personal Information (Personal Information and Additional Information shall be collectively referred to as “Information”). By accessing and/or using the Services, you affirmatively consent to our collection and use of Information in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.

In order to access and use certain content, features and functionality of the Services, whether as a Fan or an Artist, we may require that you provide and/or make available (e.g., via third party services) to us certain Information, including information we may require you to provide when your register, and use the Services, such as when you RSVP to or purchase tickets to a concert.  Additionally, when you access the Bandsintown App on your mobile device, the Bandsintown App may scan the music library on that mobile device **** including access to music services to which you may be subscribed or are otherwise using and collects data about the contents of your music library.  Bandsintown also collects information regarding your use of and interaction with the Services, whether or not used, operated, or accessed by or through a Third Party Platform, including Artists and concerts you are currently tracking, the total number of Fans tracking a particular Artist or event, content that you share  through such Third Party Platforms or publicly (i.e., events you are attending, profile picture, etc.), total number of RSVPs to a particular event and total number of Fans who have purchased a particular song or album.  If you limit our collection of certain Information, you may not be able to use all of the features of the Services.

We may ask your permission to collect location-based information from you or your Device, including general information (e.g., IP address, zip code) and more specific information (e.g., GPS-based location information, longitude/latitude, etc.).  If you agree to allow access to your location, you agree that we and our service providers may collect such location-based information from your Device.  We may use and share that location-based information with third parties to deliver, market and promote the content, services, features and products (and/or to verify your rights to receive such content, services, features and/or products) that are available through the Services **.  ** 

When you use the Services, we automatically collect certain Information, to assist us in authenticating your usage and/or Device, keeping track of your preferences, creating a more tailored user experience. In addition, the Services and/or third parties may use “cookies” (which are small data files containing information about you that is stored on your device), “embedded scripts”, and other similar tracking technologies (collectively, “Tracking Technologies”) to collect Additional Information automatically as you interact with the Services. 

As part of the Services, we may also use a variety of third parties, including advertising networks, data exchanges, traffic measurement service providers and marketing analytics service providers to, for example, serve advertisements on the Services, facilitate targeting of advertisements and/or measure and analyze advertising effectiveness and/or traffic on or in connection with the Services (“Third Party Advertising Providers”). Such Third Party Advertising Providers may enable us to display advertisements based on your use of the Services and other websites, services and platforms you have used or visited.  These Third Party Advertising Providers may use their own Tracking Technologies (as described above) to collect similar Information.  Bandsintown does not control these Third Party Advertising Providers and/or their use of Tracking Technologies, which is instead governed by the privacy policies of any such Third Party Service.  Please see Section 6 below for more information on how to opt-out of the collection and use of Information collected via certain automatic collection technologies.

We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Personal Information without their consent, he or she should contact us at privacy@bandsintown.com.

### **5.** **     ** **Opting Out; Disabling Certain Features**

At times, you may be presented with the option to opt out of whether to receive, or automatically entered to receive, certain push notifications, marketing and promotional communications from us and others that we think will be of interest to you.  Recipients of such communications can unsubscribe or opt out by either following the specific instructions included in such communications.  Additionally, at any time you may request that we delete your Information and/or your account, or "opt-out" of receiving marketing and promotional e-mails from us, by emailing us at [privacy@bandsintown.com](mailto:privacy@bandsintown.com) detailing your request.  Please note that such requests may not take effect immediately and may take a reasonable amount of time to receive, process and apply, during which time your Information shall remain subject to the prior privacy settings.   We will take steps to delete your Information as soon as is practicable, but some Information may remain in archived/backup copies for our records and as otherwise required by law.  Additionally, you should be aware that any Information provided to third parties prior to your election to opt out, unsubscribe or delete your Information cannot be retrieved or rescinded by us unless required by applicable law, and you cannot retroactively opt out or unsubscribe with respect to such third parties. Also, please note that in order to keep you informed about the operation of our Services and related services, we may always send you emails and announcements that are needed for the proper functioning and administration of our Services, including for the purposes described in Section 3 above, in connection with your use of such Services.  We may also have features that allow you to submit information, questions or feedback to us.

###  **6.** ** ** **Opting Out of Use of Certain Information That May be Collected by Tracking Technologies**

  *  **Set by Third Party Advertising Providers:** For more information about Third Party Advertising Providers and similar entities that use tracking technologies, see [www.aboutads.info](http://www.aboutads.info/consumers)[/consumers](http://www.aboutads.info/consumers), and to opt-out of such Third Party Advertising Providers advertising practices, go to [www.aboutads.info/choices](http://www.aboutads.info/choices) **.**

  *  **Tracking Technologies Set by Third Party Advertising Providers and Similar Third Parties:** Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies (other than Flash cookies) and allow local storage, but you should be able to change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, local storage is being used, and/or to block cookies and/or the use of local storage altogether.  Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for more information.  

  *  **Flash Cookies:** Users can manage the use of Flash technologies, with the Flash management tools available at Adobe’s website, see  
<http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/security/privacy_policy/faq.html>.  

  *  **Do-Not-Track Signals:** Certain browsers transmit "do-not-track" signals to the websites in which such browsers communicate with; however, this feature, and how it is used and activated, varies from browser to browser.  Therefore, it is not clear whether the signals are intentionally transmitted by a user, or whether a user is even aware of this. Despite current efforts, there is still disagreement amongst leading Internet standards organizations, industry groups, technology companies and regulators, concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals and no standard has been adopted to date.  Bandsintown takes privacy and security very seriously.  With respect to “do not track signals”, we currently do not take action in response to these signals, but, if a standard is established and accepted, we may reassess how to respond to these signals. 




Please note that by blocking any or all cookies you may not have access to certain features, content and/or other personalization available through the Services.
