Privacy Policy

</h3>
<div class="content_item">
<p>Bantam Networks, LLC (also “Bantam”) respects your right to privacy with the use of our online product, called Bantam Live, and we are committed to protecting it. Accordingly, we abide by the following privacy principles for all the personally identifiable information we collect from you.</p>

  <h2>Information Collection</h2>

  <p>You may view some areas of our site for free and register for a free or paid account. We collect information such as your name, address, email. We use this information to contact you about the services on our site in which you have expressed interest.
  If you purchase a subscription plan from us, we request certain personally identifiable information from you on our order form. You must provide contact information (such as name, email) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date). We use this information for billing purposes and to fill your order for a subscription to Bantam Live. If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this information to contact you.
  When you subscribe to any plan (free or paid) for Bantam Live you will receive a welcome email. As part of registering for the Service, you may receive email newsletters from us. As a paid subscriber, you will receive emails regarding your account status and billing.
  We do not collect personally identifiable information about you except when you specifically provide this information on a voluntary basis. We will make every effort to ensure that whatever information you provide will be maintained in a secure environment.</p>

  <h2>Log Files</h2>

  <p>As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.
  We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.
  We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information.</p>

  <h2>Cookies</h2>

  <p>“Cookies” are small text files a website can use to recognize repeat users. Bantam Live uses cookies to recognize visitors and more quickly provide personalized content or grant you unimpeded access to the website. Information gathered through cookies also helps us measure use of our website. Cookie data allow us to track usage behavior and compile data that we can use to improve the site. This data will be used in aggregate form; no specific users will be tracked.
  Generally, cookies work by assigning a unique number to the user that has no meaning outside of the Web site that he or she is visiting. You can easily turn off cookies. Most browsers have a feature that allows the user to refuse cookies or issues a warning when cookies are being sent. However, our site will not function properly without cookies. Enabling cookies ensures a smooth, efficient visit to our website.
  We may use a third-party tracking service that uses cookies to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our site in the aggregate to capture usage and volume statistics to help us improve our site. We have no access or control over these cookies.
  This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by www.bantamlive.com only and does not cover the use of cookies by any third party.</p>

  <h2>Information Use</h2>

  <p>Bantam Networks reserves the right to perform statistical analyses of user behavior and characteristics. We do this in order to measure interest in and use of the various areas of the website.
  Bantam collects IP addresses for system administration and record keeping. Your IP address is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the World Wide Web. Our servers record incoming IP addresses. The IP addresses are analyzed only in aggregate; no connection is made between you and your computer’s IP address. By tracking IP addresses, we can determine which sites refer the most people to Bantam Live. (Think of an IP address like your zip code; it tells us in general terms where you’re from.)</p>

  <h2>Communications from the Site</h2>

  <h3>Service-related Announcements</h3>

  <p>We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email.
  Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature. If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account.</p>

  <h3>Customer Service</h3>

  <p>Based upon the personally identifiable information you provide us, we will send you a welcoming email to verify your username and password. We will also communicate with you in response to your support inquiries, to provide some of the services you request. We will communicate with you by email or telephone, in accordance with your wishes related to customer support. (Note: As per the Terms of Service agreement and Refund Policy, to terminate an account on Bantam Live requires the account owner to to so only in the account section of the site and not via email or telephone requests.)</p>

  <h3>Newsletters</h3>

  <p>If you wish to subscribe to our newsletters, we will use your name and email address to send the newsletter to you. Out of respect for your privacy, we provide you a way to unsubscribe in each newsletter. Please see the 'unsubscribe' feature at the bottom of each newsletter.
  Sending Emails on User's Behalf
  We also send Bantam Live invitation emails on behalf of our account owners, at their instruction. The customer’s email list is stored on our system, but is not used by Bantam Live in any other way other than to occasionally remind invited users to join the account that the account owner has registered for. </p>

  <h3>Surveys or Contests</h3>

  <p>From time-to-time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our site. If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information and demographic information (such as zip code).
  We use this information to notify contest winners and to monitor site traffic or personalize the site.</p>

  <h3>Testimonials</h3>

  <p>We post testimonials from time to time. We always receive permission to post prior to posting.</p>

  <h2>Sharing Information</h2>

  <h3>Service Providers</h3>

  <p>We use other third parties such as Authorize.net to provide billing services on our site. When you purchase a service from us, we will share contact and credit card information as necessary for the third party to provide that service.
  These third parties are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose including their own marketing purposes.</p>

  <h2>Opting Out</h2>

  <p>Upon request, Bantam Live will allow any user to opt out of our newsletter. You can unsubscribe  by following the simple instructions included in each promotional email sent to you in the newsletter.
  Links to Other Sites
  This website may contain links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by Bantam Networks. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. This privacy statement applies only to information collected by this Web site.</p>

  <h2>Access to Personally Identifiable Information</h2>

  <p>If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct, update, delete it by making the change on the Account section page. 
  We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our website.</p>

  <h2>General Security Policy</h2>

  <p>The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number) on our sign-up forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).
  We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our website, you can send email us at contact@bantamlive.com.</p>

  <h2>Changes in this Privacy Statement</h2>

  <p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the home page, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. </p>

  <h2>Contact Us</h2>

  <p>If you have any questions or suggestions regarding our privacy policy, please contact us.</p>
