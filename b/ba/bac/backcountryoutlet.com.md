## The Way We Use Information

DepartmentOfGoods does not sell, rent or provide your "Personal Information" to third parties, except as described below. Personal Information is generally kept for DepartmentOfGoods business which is primarily used to assist you in your current or future purchases or in analyzing sales trends.

We use your Personal Information you provide about yourself when placing an order primarily to complete that order. Personal Information from the order form is used to send orders, information about our company, and promotional material from some of our partners to our customers. Personal Information is also used to get in touch with the customer when necessary. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings by following the directions in those mailings.

DepartmentOfGoods sometimes uses online surveys which ask visitors for Personal Information which usually includes contact information (typically the customer's email address) and demographic information (like their zip code, age, or income level). We use Personal Information gathered from our surveys to send the user promotional material from DepartmentOfGoods. DepartmentOfGoods periodically runs contests on our site in which we ask visitors for selected Personal Information such as contact information (typically the customer's email address) and demographic information (like their zip code, age, or income level). We use Personal Information gathered from our contests to send users promotional material from DepartmentOfGoods and at times, to some of our partners. The customer's Personal Information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary (i.e. when someone wins a contest.). Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. We use this data to tailor our visitor's experience at our site, showing them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences.
