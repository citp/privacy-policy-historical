                         Effective Date of Current Policy: May 18, 2018
1.      PURPOSE
Protecting your privacy is really important to us. With this in mind, we’re providing this Privacy
Policy to explain our practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information that
customers provide to us in connection with the creation or administration of their Back4App
Account.
This Privacy Policy is incorporated by reference into the Back4App Terms of Service (the
“Terms”). The terms “Back4App,” “we,” and “us” include Back4App, Inc. and our affiliates and
subsidiaries. This Privacy Policy explains our online and offline information practices, the kinds
of information we may collect, how we intend to use and share that information, and how you
can opt out of a use or correct or change such information. All other terms not defined in Section
13 or otherwise herein will have the meanings set forth in the Terms.
2.      SCOPE
Back4App allows users to build and host Application Programming Interfaces for web, mobile,
and Internet of Things applications. This Privacy Policy applies to Personal Information that is
Processed by Back4App in the course of our business, including on Back4App websites (each a
“Site”), mobile applications, forums, blogs, and other online or offline offerings (together with
any and all future online and offline offerings operated by or on behalf of Back4App, the
“Services”). All individuals whose responsibilities include the Processing of Personal
Information on behalf of Back4App are expected to protect that data by adherence to this Privacy
Policy.
This Policy applies to all Back4App’s operating divisions, subsidiaries, affiliates, and branches,
and any additional subsidiary, affiliate, or branch of Back4App that we may subsequently form.
This Policy does not apply to the content that Account holders or Users store on our system,
including any personal information of their End Users. Back4App will not disclose, move,
access, or use such content except as provided in the Terms or as otherwise permitted by such
Account holders or Users through the functionality of the Services. If you are an End User of an
Application created by a Back4App Account holder or User that is hosted on the Services, please
note that the collection, processing, and disclosure of your information in connection with such
Application will be governed by the privacy policy published by such customer.
3.      TRANSPARENCY/NOTICE—TYPES OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
        WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT
The types of Personal Information we may collect (directly from you or from Third-Party
sources) and our privacy practices depend on the nature of the relationship you have with
Back4App and the requirements of applicable law. Some of the ways that Back4App may collect
Personal Information include:


    •   You may provide Personal Information directly to Back4App through interacting with the
        Services, participating in surveys, during events such as sweepstakes, and requesting
        Services, or information.
    •   As you navigate the Services, certain passive information may also be collected about
        your visit, including through cookies and similar technologies as described below.
We endeavor to collect only that information which is relevant for the purposes of Processing.
Below are the ways we collect Personal Information and how we use it.
3.1     TYPES OF PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT
Back4App collects Personal Information regarding its current, prospective, and former Account
holders or Users, non-Account holders, visitors, and guests, (collectively “Individuals”). Our
primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Services, to administer
your use of the Services (including your Account, if you are an Account holder), and to enable
you to enjoy and easily navigate our Services.
    •   Information You Provide Directly to Us. When you use the Services or engage in
        certain activities, such as registering for an Account with Back4App, responding to
        surveys, requesting Services or information, submitting an inquiry, or contacting us
        directly, we may ask you to provide some or all of the following types of information:
            o Communications with Us. We may collect Personal Information from you such
                as name, email address, phone number or mailing address when you choose to
                request information about our Services, register for Back4App’s newsletter or a
                loyalty program that we may offer from time to time, request to receive customer
                or technical support, or otherwise communicate with us. If you purchase a
                Subscription, we may also collect other information from you, such as credit card
                number, expiration date, and billing address, which will be associated with your
                Account. We may also collect your gender, date of birth, and other information
                that is not considered Personal Information because it cannot be used by itself to
                identify you.
            o Surveys. From time to time, we may contact you to participate in online surveys.
                If you do decide to participate, you may be asked to provide certain information
                which may include Personal Information. All information collected from your
                participation in our surveys is provided by you voluntarily. We may use such
                information to improve our products, Sites and/or services and in any manner
                consistent with the policies provided herein.
            o Posting on the Site. Back4App may offer publicly accessible fun pages, blogs,
                private messages, or community forums. You should be aware that, when you
                disclose information about yourself on Back4App’s fun pages and blogs, or in
                private messages and community forums, the Site will collect the information you
                provide in such submissions, including any Personal Information. These
                communications are considered “public” and will not be subject to the privacy
                protections set forth herein. We may monitor such communications in order to
                ensure the safety of the community and, by using the communication features in
                                                  2


          our Services, you are indicating that you agree to such monitoring. Please use
          your judgment when communicating with other Account holders.
      o Registration for Sweepstakes or Contests. Occasionally, Back4App may run
          sweepstakes and contests. We ask those who enter in the sweepstakes or contests
          to provide contact information (e.g., an email address). If you participate in a
          sweepstakes or contest, your contact information may be used to reach you about
          the sweepstakes or contest, and for other promotional, marketing and business
          purposes. All sweepstakes/contests entry forms will provide a way for
          participants to opt out of any communications that are not related to awarding
          prizes.
      o Automatic Data Collection. We may collect certain information automatically
          through our Services or other methods of web analysis about how a person,
          including a User, uses our Services (we refer to this information as “Log Data”).
          Log Data may include information such as your Internet protocol (IP) address,
          cookie identifiers, mobile carrier, mobile advertising identifiers, MAC address,
          IMEI, Advertiser ID, and other device identifiers that are automatically assigned
          to your computer or device when you access the Internet, browser type and
          language, geo-location information, hardware type, operating system, Internet
          service provider, pages that you visit before and after using the Services, the date
          and time of your visit, the amount of time you spend on each page, information
          about the links you click and pages you view within the Services, search terms,
          the links on our Services that you clicked on, and other actions taken through use
          of the Services such as preferences. We use Log Data to administer the Services
          and we analyze (and may engage third parties to analyze) Log Data to improve,
          customize, and enhance our Services by expanding their features and functionality
          and tailoring them to our Users’ needs and preferences. We may use a person’s
          IP address to generate aggregate, non-identifying information about how our
          Services are used.
• Information Submitted Via Services. You agree that Back4App is free to use the
  content of any communications submitted by you via the Services, including any ideas,
  inventions, concepts, techniques, or know-how disclosed therein, for any purpose
  including developing, manufacturing, and/or marketing goods or Services. Back4App
  will not release your name or otherwise publicize the fact that you submitted materials or
  other information to us unless: (a) you grant us permission to do so; (b) we first send
  notice to you that the materials or other information you submit to a particular part of a
  Service will be published or otherwise used with your name on it; or (c) we are required
  to do so by law.
• Information from Other Sources. We may receive information about you from other
  sources, including through Third-Party services and organizations to supplement
  information provided by you. For example, if you access our Services through a Third-
  Party application, such as an App Store or SNS, we may collect information about you
  from that Third-Party application that you have made public via your privacy settings.
  Information we collect through App Stores or SNS accounts may include your name,
  your SNS user identification number, your SNS user name, location, sex, birth date,
  email, profile picture, and your contacts on the SNS. This supplemental information
                                           3


       allows us to verify information that you have provided to Back4App and to enhance our
       ability to provide you with information about our business, products, and Services.
    •  Location Information. When you use our Services, we may collect and store
       information about your location by converting your IP address into a rough geo-location
       or by accessing your device’s GPS coordinates or coarse location if you enable location
       services on your device.

       be of interest, including new content or Services. Back4App may provide you with these
       materials by phone, postal mail, facsimile, or email, as permitted by applicable law. Such
       uses include:
                                                  4

• Research and Development. Back4App may use Personal Information to create non-
  identifiable information that we may use alone or in the aggregate with information
  obtained from other sources, in order to help us to optimally deliver our existing products
  and Services or develop new products and Services. From time to time, Back4App may
  perform research (online and offline) via surveys. We may engage Third-Party service
  providers to conduct such surveys on our behalf. All survey responses are voluntary, and
  the information collected will be used for research and reporting purposes to help us
  better serve Individuals by learning more about their needs and the quality of the products
  and services we provide. The survey responses may be utilized to determine the
  effectiveness of our Services, various types of communications, advertising campaigns,
  and/or promotional activities. If an Individual participates in a survey, the information
  given will be used along with that of other study participants. We may share anonymous
  Individual and aggregate data for industry research and analysis, demographic profiling,
  and other similar purposes.
• Direct Mail, Email and Outbound Telemarketing. Individuals who provide us with
  Personal Information, or whose Personal Information we obtain from Third Parties, may
  receive periodic emails, newsletters, mailings, or phone calls from us with information on
  Back4App’s or our business partners’ products and Services or upcoming special
  offers/events we believe may be of interest. We offer the option to decline these
  communications at no cost to the Individual by following the instructions in Section 5
  below.
• Services via Mobile Devices. From time to time, Back4App may provide Services that
  are specifically designed to be compatible and used on mobile devices. Back4App will
  collect certain information that your mobile device sends when you use such Services,
  like a device identifier, user settings, location information, mobile carrier, and the
  operating system of your device. Mobile versions of Back4App’s Services may require
  that users log in with an Account. In such cases, information about use of mobile versions
  of the Services may be associated with Accounts. In addition, Back4App may enable
  Individuals to download an application, widget, or other tool that can be used on mobile
  or other computing devices. Some of these tools may store information on mobile or
  other devices. These tools may transmit Personal Information to Back4App to enable
  Individuals to access Accounts and to enable Back4App to track use of these tools. Some
  of these tools may enable users to email reports and other information from the tool.
  Back4App may use personal or non-identifiable information transmitted to Back4App to
  enhance these tools, to develop new tools, for quality improvement and as otherwise
                                           5


         described in this Privacy Policy or in other notices Back4App provides. We may use
         location information to improve and personalize our Services for you. If you do not want
         us to collect location information, you may disable that feature on your device.
    •    Anonymous and Aggregated Information Use. Back4App may use Personal
         Information and other information about you to create anonymized and aggregated
         information, such as de-identified demographic information, de-identified location
         information, information about the computer or device from which you access
         Back4App’s Services, or other analyses we create. Anonymized and aggregated
         information is used for a variety of functions, including the measurement of visitors’
         interest in and use of various portions or features of the Services. Anonymized or
         aggregated information is not Personal Information, and Back4App may use such
         information in a number of ways, including research, internal analysis, analytics, and any
         other legally permissible purposes. We may share this information within Back4App and
         with Third Parties for our or their purposes in an anonymized or aggregated form that is
         designed to prevent anyone from identifying you.
    •    Sharing Content with Friends or Colleagues. Back4App’s Services may offer various
         tools and functionalities. For example, Back4App allows you to provide information
         about your friends through our referral services, such as “Tell a Friend.” Our referral
         services may allow you to forward or share certain content with a friend or colleague,
         such as an email inviting your friend to use our Services. Email addresses that you may
         provide for a friend or colleague will be used to send your friend or colleague the content
         or link you request, but will not be collected or otherwise used by Back4App or any other
         Third Parties for any other purpose.
    •    Other Uses. Back4App may use Personal Information for which we have a legitimate
         interest, such as direct marketing, individual or market research, anti-fraud protection, or
         any other purpose disclosed to you at the time you provide Personal Information or with
         your consent.

4.      ONWARD TRANSFER—BACK4APP MAY DISCLOSE YOUR
        INFORMATION
4.1     INFORMATION WE SHARE
We may share your information as described in this Privacy Policy (e.g., with our Third-Party
service providers; to comply with legal obligations; to protect and defend our rights and
property) or with your permission.
    •   We Use Vendors and Service Providers. We may share any information we receive

                                                  8


  the Site. Back4App has executed appropriate contracts with the service providers that
  prohibit them from using or sharing Personal Information except as necessary to perform
  the contracted services on our behalf or to comply with applicable legal requirements.
• Business Partners. Back4App may share Personal Information with our business
  partners, and affiliates for our and our affiliates’ internal business purposes or to provide
  you with a product or service that you have requested. Back4App may also provide
  Personal Information to business partners with whom we may jointly offer products or

  cases, our business partner’s name will appear, along with Back4App. Back4App

  and does not include use of Cookies by such third parties. We may also share de-
  identified information (such as demographic information and past purchase history) as
