<p>
I recognize that your privacy is important. This document outlines the types of personal information I receive and collect 
when you browse through Backpacking Tips Asia.com, as well as some 
of the steps I take to safeguard information. I hope this will help you make an informed decision about sharing personal information with me. 
</p><p>
Backpacking Tips Asia.com strives to maintain the highest standards of decency, fairness and integrity in all its operations. Likewise, 
I am dedicated to protecting my customers', consumers' and online visitors' privacy on my website.

<b>Use of Cookies and Web Beacons</b>
</p><p>
I may use cookies to help you personalize your online experience. Cookies are identifiers that are transferred to your computer's hard drive

</p><p>
I may serve third-party advertisements that use cookies and web beacons in the course of ads being served on my web site to ascertain how many

In some cases, I may collect information about you that is not personally identifiable. I use this information, which does 
not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the site and to gather 
demographic information about my user 
base as a whole. The information collected is used solely for internal review and not shared with other organizations for commercial purposes. 
</p><p>

you will receive notice through my website of that

<!-- the code below if for the left side column.(the navigation column) Why is it at the end, rather than at the start,
where you might expect it to be? Because of the way SE spiders read tables. They start top left,
and work across each cell in order, to the bottom right.
If we have this cell where you would expect, then the spiders would read your navigation etc
BEFORE they read your content. We dont want that. Thats why we have a spacer cell at the top.
Although this appears to the eye to be the far left column, its actually down the order of cells.-->
