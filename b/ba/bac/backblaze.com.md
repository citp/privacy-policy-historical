# Backblaze - Online backup privacy policy

Updated 4/5/16 

Please read this privacy policy carefully. It applies to all interactions you have with Backblaze's web services and apps.

Note that Backblaze has two different products:

  * [Computer Backup](https://www.backblaze.com/cloud-backup.html) provides unlimited cloud backup for individuals and organizations using Macs or PCs. 
  * [B2 Cloud Storage](https://www.backblaze.com/b2/cloud-storage.html) provides low-cost cloud storage for individuals and organizations. 



When we collect, store, use, or share information differently among these products, we'll note that below.

#### The Information We Collect

**Account Information.** When you create a Backblaze account, we ask for your email address and a password. We may also ask for your phone number for purposes such as two-factor verification and sending you service alerts. If you choose to sign up for one of our services, we'll ask you for billing information. If you order a physical item from us, such as a Restore by Mail, we'll ask for shipping information. At times we may ask for other information such as your name or your company name.

**Your Files.** Our Computer Backup service automatically backs up your files to Backblaze; B2 Cloud Storage allows you to upload your files to our service. Please keep in mind that your files may include personally identifiable information, both in the contents of a file and in metadata.

**Information About Your Use of Backblaze.** We receive some information automatically when you use any Backblaze product. This includes data about your device, software, and the operating system you use when accessing our service, your Internet Protocol address, and the date and time of each request you make to Backblaze. When you use our backup services, we'll also receive information such as the names of external drives, file types transferred, and number and size of files transferred.

**Information We Learn Through Your Interactions with Us.** You may choose to provide us with personal information when you call us, email us, chat with us, answer a survey, comment on our blog, or interact with us through other services like Twitter or Facebook. 

**Referrals.** If you refer a friend to Backblaze, we'll ask you for their email address. You can also choose to upload your contacts stored with others services such as Google and Yahoo in order to refer friends.

**Information from Other Sources.** We may collect additional information about you from third parties to help us figure out how to better serve you.

#### How We Use Your Information

We use your personal information to keep Backblaze running, understand how you use our service, customize your experience, prevent abuse, provide customer support, sell and market our products, and improve Backblaze. We use your information internally only as needed to accomplish these goals.

#### How We Disclose Your Information

We will share your personally identifiable information only in the limited circumstances below. Backblaze does not sell your information or share it with third-party advertisers.

**With your permission.** We may share your information with your consent, after letting you know what information will be shared and with whom.

**In response to the law.** We may disclose your information if we believe it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation, or valid legal process. If we are going to release your information, our policy is to provide you with notice unless we are prohibited from doing so by law or court order (e.g., an order under 18 U.S.C. § 2705(b)). We may disclose your information without providing you with prior notice if we believe it's necessary to prevent imminent and serious bodily harm to a person. Nothing in this policy is intended to limit any legal objections or defenses you might have to demands to compel disclosure of your information, including demands from the government.

**With third parties helping us provide Backblaze.** We may share your information with third-party services helping us provide and improve our products. Those third parties access and use your information only on our behalf. They include companies such as Stripe, Salesforce, Google, Freshbooks, Facebook, Twitter, MailChimp, Slack, SurveyMonkey, SendGrid, and ZenDesk. Please note that this Privacy Policy explains Backblaze's practices only, and doesn't extend to the practices of other services. 

**With group administrators.** If you use our services as part of a business, group, or organization where Backblaze was set up by an administrator, the administrator may be able to access and control your account. Refer to your organization's internal policies for more information. 

**With other internet services.** If you are a B2 Cloud Storage user, you may give third parties the ability to access information and content in your account (e.g., through APIs). When other services access and use your information, their conduct is governed by their own terms and policies.

**With other people, in limited circumstances.** When you use B2 Cloud Storage, your settings give you the option to make information and content available to other people. When you refer a friend to us, we'll share your name and email address with that person. And when you post comments on our blog, of course, other people can read them. 

**Sale or merger.** If all or part of Backblaze is sold, merged, or otherwise transferred to another company in the future, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction. If that happens, Backblaze will take reasonable steps to make sure your information continues to be treated consistent with this privacy policy.

**Aggregate information.** We may disclose aggregate, non-identifying information about how our users use Backblaze products.

#### Web Tracking Policy

**Cookies.** We use cookies to enable our servers to recognize your web browser and tell us how and when you use Backblaze products. We use cookies to identify whether you have logged in and recognize that your web browser has accessed our servers before, and we may associate that information with your account.  
Most browsers have an option for disabling cookies, but if you disable them, some Backblaze services will not work. Some third-party services that we use, such as Google Analytics, may place their own cookies in your browser. This Privacy Policy covers our use of cookies only and not the use of cookies by third parties.

**Do Not Track.** Some browsers make it possible for you to signal that you don't want your internet browsing activity to be tracked. There is not yet a consensus in the internet community about how to best honor these signals, so we don't respond to Do Not Track requests at this time.

#### Data Security

Backblaze products are designed to have several layers of security.

  * We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer Security (TLS) to create a secure tunnel to protect data in transit between Backblaze apps and servers. 
  * We don't retain your actual account password, but [hash and salt](http://goodmath.scientopia.org/2013/03/02/passwords-hashing-and-salt/) it to help protect it against possible compromise. 
  * You have the option to enable two-factor verification, a login feature that adds an extra layer of security to your account. 
  * We narrowly limit the number of Backblaze employees who have access to user data through policy and technical access controls. 
  * For Computer Backup, your files are automatically encrypted by default on your computer before being sent to Backblaze. The encrypted files are sent and stored in encrypted form. By default, Backblaze retains a copy of the encryption key to make data recovery possible if you forget your password. However, you can choose to keep the only copy of the key if you prefer. For B2 Cloud Storage, it is up to you whether you choose to encrypt your files before uploading them. 



You use Backblaze at your own risk, and are responsible for taking reasonable measures to secure your account (such as choosing a strong, unique password and keeping it secret).

We are always on the lookout for vulnerabilities in Backblaze. If you discover a vulnerability in our service, we would be grateful for your report and encourage you to let us know immediately. If you give us reasonable time to respond to your report before making any information public, and make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our service during your research, we will not pursue any legal action against you or ask law enforcement to investigate your actions.

To report a vulnerability, please email security@backblaze.com.

#### Account Cancellation

You are free to stop using Backblaze at any time. If you choose to deactivate your account, we'll delete your backups and files stored in B2 Cloud Storage within a reasonable amount of time. We will continue to keep some information about your use of our service.

#### Changes to This Policy

We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most current version of the policy will govern our use of your information and will always be at <http://www.backblaze.com/privacy>. If we make changes that we believe will substantially alter your rights, we will notify you.

#### Contact

We would love to hear from you. Backblaze welcomes questions, concerns, and feedback about this policy. If you have suggestions for us, let us know at privacy@backblaze.com.
