# | Backroads Privacy Policy |

|   


Our relationship with you is very important to us. We are sensitive to protecting the private information that you provide to us. We also want you to have the opportunity to receive interesting and useful information about Backroads and about related products and services. Here are details on how we use the information you provide us: 

  1. **Name, address, contact, survey and billing information**  
Backroads occasionally shares its mailing list and voluntary survey response information (see below) with companies that offer products or services we think you may be interested in.  
Backroads does not share telephone numbers or e-mail addresses with other companies or organizations.  
Backroads does not share your billing information with any other companies or organizations except to process your credit card for your Backroads vacation payment.  
On our catalog request form, you may check a box if you do not wish to have your name, address and survey responses shared with other companies at any time.
  2.  **Voluntary Surveys**  
We periodically survey our guests and catalog requesters for their vacation interests and related travel patterns. We encourage you to complete these surveys because: a) they provide us with information that helps us improve the types of vacations we offer; and b) they help us direct specific Backroads messages to you that you may find most interesting. Your participation in these surveys is always voluntary.
  3.  **Web Site Use and Navigation Information**  
Each time a user visits our Web site, certain use and navigation information is collected by our servers. This information is aggregate and anonymous. It gives us information such as the number, frequency and duration of visits to each Web page which we use to improve the content and navigation features of our Web site. We may make changes to this policy periodically, which we will post here. 



**If you have any questions, comments or concerns about our Privacy Policy, you may contact our[Marketing department](mailto:backtalk@backroads.com).**
