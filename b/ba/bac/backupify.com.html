	<strong>INFORMATION COLLECTED</strong><br>
	<em>Personal Information</em><br>
	In general, the Personal Information we gather enables us to provide the Sites and Services to you. We collect Personal Information that you submit to us voluntarily. When you register with us and create an Account, we may ask you to provide certain Personal Information, such as your name, email address and phone number. We may request additional optional information to support your access to the Sites or Services. When you communicate with us by sending us an email, we may collect and store any information that is contained in your communications with us. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but this may limit the features of the Sites or Services you are able to use. Please note that if you are a Business Subscriber User, we may receive Personal Information about you from your Employer (such as your name and email address). We also collect certain Personal Information from Subscribers in order to process subscriptions, including credit card numbers and associated billing information, to charge and collect the subscription fees. We refer to this information as “<strong>Billing information</strong>”. If you are a Subscriber that has purchased the Services through one of our resellers, we may receive from them Personal Information they have collected.</p>
<p>
	<em>Backedup Data</em><br>
	The contents of Backed-up Data can include both Personal Information and Anonymous Information such as email addresses, home addresses, telephone numbers and other content communicated over email or inside contact fields, but we treat Backed-up Data differently regardless of its contents. We collect Backed-up Data that you have requested for us to collect from authorized third-party sites. If you are a Business Subscriber User, then your Employer may have designated the Backed-up Sites or authorized our services on your behalf. We will associate your Backed-up Data with your Personal Information.</p>
<p>
	We will access and use your Backed-up Data only when you (or, if you are a Business Subscriber User, your Employer, to the extent permitted by such Employer’s policies) grants us explicit permission to do so for troubleshooting purposes. We will not otherwise view, access or use the contents of your Backed-up Data without your written consent, but may view the related file system information (e.g., file and/or folder names, file extensions and sizes but not your file contents) to provide incremental backups and file comparisons, quality control, and technical support.</p>

Persistent Cookies can be removed by following your Internet browser help file directions. If you choose to disable Cookies, you may experience session errors and may need to log-in again for each page you visit on the Sites.</p>

<p>
	<strong>THIRD PARTY SITES</strong><br>
	The Sites may contain links to other websites. Backupify is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these other websites. This Privacy Statement applies solely to information collected by us through the Sites or Services and does not apply to these third party websites. We encourage our Users to read the privacy statements of each and every website they visit. Users should always use caution and common sense when choosing to provide Personal Information on the Internet, particularly when it comes to information such as credit cards and other payment information. The ability to access information of third parties from the Sites or Services is for your convenience and does not signify our endorsement of such third parties, their services, other websites, locations or their contents.</p>
<p>
	<strong>REGARDING CHILDREN</strong><br>
	The Sites are not directed to children and children are not eligible to use our Services. Protecting the privacy of children is very important to us. We do not collect or maintain Personal Information from people we actually know are under 13 years old, and no part of the Sites or Services is designed to attract people under 13 years old. If we later obtain actual knowledge that a User is under 13 years old, we will take steps to remove that User's Personal Information from our databases immediately.</p>
<p>
	<strong>SECURITY</strong><br>
	We have put in place reasonable security measures to help protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of your Personal Information. When our Sites are accessed using Internet Explorer version 6.0 or later, or Firefox version 2.0 or later, Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology protects information using both server authentication and data encryption. Backupify also implements an advanced security method based on dynamic data and encoded session identifications, and hosts the Sites in a secure server environment that uses a firewall and other advanced technology to help prevent interference or access from outside intruders. These safeguards help prevent unauthorized access, and help to maintain data accuracy and appropriate use of Personal Information.</p>
<p>
	Despite such efforts, however, please note that no company, including Backupify, can fully eliminate risks or guarantee the security of your Personal Information; unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of information about you at any time, and we bear no liability for uses or disclosures of personal data or non-personal data arising in connection with the theft of your data.</p>

	Users who would like to update, delete inaccuracies, or change information associated with their Account may do so at any time by editing their Account profile online or by sending us an email at <a href="mailto:support@backupify.com">support@backupify.com</a>. If you change and/or request changes to your information, subsequent uses or disclosures of that information by us will reflect those changes. Please note, however, that we do not have the ability to update any information previously disclosed to any third party. Certain information is necessary in order for us to provide the Sites or Services; therefore, if you delete such necessary information you may not be able to use the Sites or Services. We will respond to your access request within 30 days.</p>
<p>
	Users can request a copy of their Backed-up Data by emailing us at <a href="mailto:support@backupify.com">support@backupify.com</a>. For your protection, Users will be required to provide proof of identity to obtain a copy of their Backed-up Data.</p>

Within a reasonable time period after we receive your request, we will remove your Personal Information and/or Backed-up Data. Please note, however, that even though you may request the deletion of your Personal Information or Backed-up Data by us, we may be required (by law or otherwise, such as to prevent fraud, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, or enforce our Terms of Services) to keep this information and not delete it (or to keep this information for a certain time) in which case we will comply with your deletion request only after we have fulfilled such requirements).
