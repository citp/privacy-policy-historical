6\. USE OF TRACKING CODE, WEB BEACONS OR GIF FILES

Backwoods Home Magazine’s Web pages may contain tracking code or electronic images known as Web beacons – sometimes also called single-pixel gifs – that allow Backwoods Home Magazine, Inc. to count users who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services. Backwoods Home Magazine, Inc. may include tracking code or Web beacons in promotional e-mail messages or newsletters in order to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon. 

Some of these tracking codes and/or Web beacons may be placed by third party service providers to help determine the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns or email communications. These tracking codes and/or Web beacons may be used by these service providers to place a persistent cookie on your computer. This allows the service provider to recognize your computer each time you visit certain pages or emails and compile anonymous information in relation to those page views, which in turn enables us and our service providers to learn which advertisements and emails bring you to our website and how you use the site. Backwoods Home Magazine, Inc. prohibits tracking codes and Web beacons from being used to collect or access your personal information.
