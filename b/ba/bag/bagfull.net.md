# Privacy Statement

  
**Information Collection and Use**  
Bagfull is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. 

Bagfull collects information from our users at several different points on our Web site. 

**Registration**  
In order to buy services at several parts of this Web site, a user must first complete a registration form. 

During registration a user is required to give their contact information (such as name and e-mail address). This information is used only to contact the user about the services on our site for which they have expressed interest. 

**Cookies**  
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. Once the user closes their browser, the cookie simply terminates. 

For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the user would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. 

If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site. The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in some areas of our site. 

**Log Files**  
We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. 

**Sharing**  
We will share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. 

These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information gathered from our visitors. 

**Links**  
This web site may contain links to other sites. Please be aware that we, Bagfull Interweb Inc., are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. 

This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this web site. 

**Newsletter**  
If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask for contact information such as name and email address. This information is used only for the delivery of our publication. 

**Surveys & Contests**  
From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests.  
Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. 

Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. 

**Suggest this site**  
If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask them for the friend's email address. 

Bagfull Solutions will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site. Bagfull Solutions does not store this information but uses it only for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email. 

**Security**  
This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, your information is protected both online and off-line. 

**Welcome Emails**  
We send all new customers a welcoming email with the order details and other specifications of their order. Established customers will occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, and a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications. 

**Site and Service Updates**  
We also send the user site and service announcement updates. Members are not able to un-subscribe from service announcements, which contain important information about the service. We communicate with the user to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account via email or phone. 

**Choice/Opt-out**  
Our users are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for the information. 

Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter or promotional from us may opt-out of receiving these communications by using the link provided at the bottom of each email. 

**Notification of Changes**  
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it.  
If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email. 

Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
