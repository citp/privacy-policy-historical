## Privacy Policy

Dear Visitor: 

We want you to know how we handle the information you send us via the internet. Our Privacy Policy adapts to the internet's dynamic environment. We keep you informed by updating this Privacy Policy as our procedures change. Please review it occasionally to remain informed. This Policy was last updated on December 28, 2005. This is the way we handle information: 

### Automatic Collection

Our web server automatically recognizes the visitor's domain name (not the email address) and records the visitor's browser and platform type (e.g., Netscape browser on a Microsoft platform). 

### Cookies

We use cookies to:   


  * Record the visitor's session information (such as the visitor's shopping selections when ordering), 
  * Record user-specific information on the pages the visitor selects for viewing, 
  * Retain the country of our site that you last visited. 



### Email Addresses

When a visitor gives us their email address, or sends us email correspondence, we retain their email address. We do not share our email lists with third parties for marketing purposes. We use email addresses to communicate with you regarding your orders and other matters regarding transactions between us or your customer relationship with us. We may also use your email address to share information about Bagsagent products and services that may be of interest to you. You may opt-out of receiving such promotional messages from us at any time. If we do send you a promotional email, you will be given the opportunity to decline receiving similar emails in the future.

On request with verification, we will give the visitor a reminder with unique identifier information (e.g., customer number or password). 

### Mailing Addresses

If you request a catalogue to be mailed to your postal address, you will be placed on our mailing list and you will receive periodic mailings from us. If you purchase through our catalogue, you may also receive mailings from other carefully screened companies to whom we may make such mailing lists available. (These lists do not include Bagsagent charge card account holders). If you prefer, you can have your name put on our do-not-share list by writing to us at our address above. Please include your name and address as it appears on your mailing label. 

### Security

We use industry-standard encryption technologies when transferring and receiving customer data exchanged with our website server. All other data transfer is conducted through a secure phone line. 

### Children's Online Privacy

The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act took effect April 21, 2000, and pertains to websites directed toward children under 13 years of age. Bagsagent.com does not collect information on any person under 13 years. We ask that children do not submit information to us without the consent of a parent or guardian.
