					<br> <b>Website Visitors</b> <br>
					<br> Like most website operators, baggout.com collects
					non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web
					browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser
					type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of
					each visitor request. Baggout.com's purpose in collecting
					non-personally identifying information is to better understand how
					baggout.com's visitors use its website. From time to time,
					Baggout.com may release non-personally-identifying information in
					the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage
					of its website. Baggout.com also collects potentially
					personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP)
					addresses. Baggout.com does not use such information to identify
					its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information,
					other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses
					personally-identifying information, as described below. <br>
					<br> <b>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information.</b> <br>
					<br> Certain visitors to Baggout.com's websites choose to
					interact with Baggout.com in ways that require Baggout.com to
					gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of
					information that Baggout.com gathers depends on the nature of the
					interaction. For example, we ask visitors who use our forums to
					provide a username and email address. In each case, Baggout.com
					collects such information only insofar as is necessary or
					appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction
					with Baggout.com. Baggout.com does not disclose
					personally-identifying information other than as described below.
					And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying
					information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging
					in certain website-related activities. <br>
					<br> <b>Aggregated Statistics</b> <br>
					<br> Baggout.com may collect statistics about the behavior of
					visitors to its websites. For instance, Baggout.com may reveal
					which products were shared and what kind of feedback was received
					on the purchased products. However, Baggout.com does not disclose
					personally-identifying information other than as described below. <br>
					<br> <b>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying
						Information</b> <br>
					<br> Baggout.com discloses potentially personally-identifying
					and personally-identifying information only to those of its
					employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations that (i) need
					to know that information in order to process it on Baggout.com's
					behalf or to provide services available at Baggout.com's websites,
					and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of
					those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be
					located outside of your home country; by using Baggout.com's
					websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them.
					Baggout.com will not rent or sell potentially
					personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to
					anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors, and affiliated
					organizations, as described above, Baggout.com discloses
					potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
					information only when required to do so by law, or when Baggout.com
					believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to
					protect the property or rights of Baggout.com, third parties, or
					the public at large. If you are a registered user of a Baggout.com
					website and have supplied your email address, Baggout.com may
					occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features,
					solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's
					going on with Baggout.com and our products. If you send us a
					request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback
					mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us
					clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other
					users. Baggout.com takes all measures reasonably necessary to
					protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration, or
					destruction of potentially personally-identifying and
					personally-identifying information. <br>
					<br> <b>Cookies</b> <br>
					<br> A cookie is a string of information that a website stores
					on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to
					the website each time the visitor returns. Baggout.com uses cookies
					to help Baggout.com identify and track visitors, their usage of
					Baggout.com website, and their website access preferences.
					Baggout.com visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on
					their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before
					using Baggout.com's websites, with the drawback that certain
					features of Baggout.com's websites may not function properly
					without the aid of cookies. <br>
					<br> <b>Privacy Policy Changes</b> <br>
					<br> Although most changes are likely to be minor, Baggout.com
					may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in
					Baggout.com's sole discretion. Baggout.com encourages visitors to
					frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy.
					Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy
					Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
