# Privacy Policy

**Updated Saturday May 26th 2018**

_bathroomwall.org has created this privacy policy in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy._

**UP FRONT AND TO THE POINT - FAST!**

  * We don't ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.


  * We don't share your personal information [if we have it] with anyone except to comply with the law, to provide a service you have requested, or to protect our rights.


  * Other than your username and email address, we don't store YOUR personal information on our servers. Period.


  * We are not in the business of data mining, exploiting you or knowing your business. bathroomwall.org does not use cookies for online behavioural target advertising.


  * You may have noticed Social Media buttons that you could use to share the content at our site (via Facebook, Twitter etc). We allowed these third party services to be present and used (should you have desired to do so), however, we did not integrate the social media platforms into our database - with our users. We kept things separate.



As of May 26th 2018, we took a deeper step and _removed_ all Social Media share buttons from the site. We feel this is a positive step in protecting your privacy while visiting us. Although we DO encourage you to share the content that you like and discover on bathroomwall.org, we just want you to do it right. This could be embedding our videos, using our _Share via Email_ service (hosted and operated by us), or by the classic way of giving buddy the link!   
The benefit? _YOU_ are in control of _YOUR_ privacy. Sounds pretty straight forward and simple to us! Have it a go? 

_The following tells you our information gathering practices._
