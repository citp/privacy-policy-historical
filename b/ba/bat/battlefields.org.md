## Information Security ** **

We take our users' privacy very seriously. When users submit personal information to the American Battlefield Trust, we take steps designed to ensure the information remains secure both during transmission and while stored. Some of these measures include an enterprise grade firewall and a secured environment for the data storage. All sensitive donor information is stored in this manner and only accessed by authorized American Battlefield Trust staff through a monitored and recorded login process using secure communication and password protection.

For our users' protection, this website uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), the standard of World Wide Web security, whenever financial transactions are being conducted.

However, like other companies, American Battlefield Trust cannot guarantee 100% the security or confidentiality of the information you provide to us. Consequently, while we endeavor to safeguard your personal information against unauthorized access and disclosure, we do not warrant or guarantee the absolute security of any personal information you transmit to, from or through the websites. If you share your computer or use a computer that is accessed by the general public, remember to sign off and close your browser window when you have finished your session. This will help to ensure that others cannot access your personally identifiable information.  In the event of a breach of the confidentiality or security of your personal information, we will notify you as required by law, if reasonably possible and as reasonably necessary, so that you can take appropriate protective steps. We may notify you under such circumstances using the e-mail address(es) we have on record for you or through alternative means. Please note that once you leave our websites, whether independently or via links from the websites, the privacy policies of the site to which you migrate will apply.  This Privacy Policy applies to your interactions with us only.

We do not knowingly permit children under age 13 (in the United States) or age 16 (in the EEA) to register for any content, product, or service.

If children under 13 want to register with the American Battlefield Trust, they will need the consent of a parent or guardian. Our online registration process requires a confirmation via email, which provides the parent or legal guardian to give verifiable consent.

We encourage you to review the privacy policies posted on these third party sites, as these policies will govern treatment of your personal information on those websites.
