When you interact with us through the Site, we may collect Personal Data and other information from you, as further described below:

**Personal Data That You Provide Through the Site:** We collect Personal Data from you when you voluntarily provide such information, such as when you contact us with inquiries or inform us of your business ideas by providing, without limitation, information regarding the stage and sector of your business, your customer and revenue traction and your team. Wherever Battery Ventures collects Personal Data, we make an effort to provide a link to this Privacy Policy.

**Other Information:**

**_Non-Identifiable Data:_** When you interact with Battery Ventures through the Site, we receive and store certain personally non-identifiable information. Such information, which is collected passively using various technologies, including, without limitation, Google Analytics, cannot presently be used to specifically identify you. Battery Ventures may store such information itself or such information may be included in databases owned and maintained by Battery Ventures affiliates, agents, or service providers. This Site may use such information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, and the domain names of our visitors’ Internet service providers. It is important to note that no Personal Data is available or used in this process.

In operating this Site, we may use a technology called “cookies.” A cookie is a piece of information that the computer that hosts our Site gives to your browser when you access the Site. Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the Site and help us analyze Site usage more accurately. For instance, our Site may set a cookie on your browser that allows you to access the Site without needing to remember and then enter a password more than once during a visit to the Site. In all cases in which we use cookies, we will not collect Personal Data except with your permission. On most web browsers, you will find a “help” section on the toolbar. Please refer to this section for information on how to receive notification when you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off. We recommend that you leave cookies turned on because they allow you to take advantage of some of the Site’s features.

In addition, we may use local shared objects, also known as flash cookies, to display content based upon what you view on the Site and to personalize your visit.  Flash cookies are different from browser cookies because of the amount and type of data and how that data is stored.  Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove flash cookies.  To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for flash cookies click [here](http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/526/52697ee8.html).

Battery Ventures and its affiliates may use this information to contact you in the future to tell you about services we believe will be of interest to you.

If Battery Ventures intends on using any Personal Data in any manner that is not consistent with this Privacy Policy, you will be informed of such anticipated use prior to or at the time at which the Personal Data is collected.

**Our Disclosure of Your Personal Data and Other Information :**

Battery Ventures is not in the business of selling your information. We consider this information to be a vital part of our relationship with you. There are, however, certain circumstances in which we may share your Personal Data with certain third parties without further notice to you, as set forth below:
