# Privacy & Security | Bath & Body Works

This Online Privacy Policy ("Policy") explains what personal information is collected through our websites and online services, how that information is used, to whom it's disclosed, and how it's safeguarded. Unless indicated otherwise, this Policy applies only to personal information collected through the websites, microsites, mobile applications, and other online services of the Bath & Body Works brand and lines of business that expressly adopt, and display or link to, this Policy (collectively, the "Services"). By "personal information" we mean information that relates to you, an individual user of our Services, including information that can be used directly to identify you (including name, home address, and email address), as well as other information (like tastes and preferences) when coupled with your identifying information. We refer to Bath & Body Works Direct, Inc. Five Limited Parkway, Reynoldsburg, OH 43068, as "BBW," "we," "us," or "our" throughout this privacy policy.

How is technology used to serve our advertisements on other online services and what choices do you have?  
How do our Services interact with third-party services and content?  
What information do we share with third parties and our sister brands (or what information may they access because of the services they provide to us)?  
What choices do you have over how your information is used?  
How do you update your personal information?  
How do we secure your information on our Services?

### WHAT INFORMATION IS COLLECTED AND HOW IS IT USED?

1\. Information You Actively Provide through our Services

You actively provide personal information when you visit our Services to do all the things typically associated with online services. Examples of the personal information we collect include name, address, phone number, email address, personal preferences, payment card number, purchase and ordering information, demographic information, responses to survey questions, sizing information and any other information you choose to provide. Our Services may also give you the option to upload or share pictures or videos of yourself and others. You know what information you directly provide, because you are affirmatively and actively submitting the information.

This information is collected at various places on our Services: for instance, when you check out with your online order; engage with our mobile applications; subscribe to email offers, and mobile messaging offers; participate in surveys; enter contests or sweepstakes; or interact with special-event or program offers.

We may also collect information that you provide on our Services about people you know. For example, we collect your gift recipient's contact information to process your gift orders. We may also collect contact information about your friends and family members when you participate in one of our refer-a-friend programs. In these instances, we may send a message to your friend or family member on your behalf. Please ensure that you only submit email addresses of individuals with whom you have a personal or family relationship and who would want to receive the message from you.

2\. Information Your Devices Provide Automatically

a. Location Information  
You may provide information about your location when you access or use our Services. For more details, please see "What choices do you have over how your information is used?"

b. Navigational Information  
When you access our Services, your computer, phone or other device provides navigational information, such as browser type and version, service-provider identification, IP address, the site or online service from which you came, and the site or online service to which you navigate.

c. Device Information  
You also provide information about the computer or mobile device used to access our Services, such as the hardware model, operating system and version, identification numbers assigned to your mobile device, such as the ID for Advertising (IDFA) on Apple devices, and the Advertising ID on Android devices, mobile network information, and website or app usage behavior.

d. Cookies, Clear Gifs and Similar Technologies  
To better understand how you interact with our Services, we may collect information using cookies, clear-gifs (also known as web beacons or web bugs) and similar technologies. We deliver a customized experience and do not currently respond to "Do Not Track" signals of web browsers.

A cookie is a small amount of data that's stored by your browser on your device. It's used to do things like see how you navigate our Services, what you click on, remember you and your online purchases when you return, and recognize you and honor a special deal for you, when you redeem one of our offers from a third party’s site. This helps us improve and deliver our Services, provide better customer service, tailor and improve your online experience, and tailor offers to you based on your unique tastes and both your online and offline (e.g., in-store) interactions and purchase history.

A clear gif is a nearly invisible pixel-sized graphic image on a web page, web-based document or email message. It helps us do things like view the URL of the page on which the clear gif appears and the time the site, document, or email in question is viewed; and recognize you and honor a special deal for you when you navigate from a third party’s site to redeem one of our offers that may have appeared there. Clear gifs in emails help us confirm the receipt of, and response to, our emails, including those that you forward to friends and family; and they help deliver a more personalized or better online experience.

In addition to cookies and clear gifs, we may also use device identifiers, web storage, and other technologies to collect information about your interactions with our content and Services.

The above technologies may be used to help us see which of our interactive experiences online users like most: for example, by keeping track of the number of times a video, widget, or other media is accessed or embedded on social networking sites; and on which social networking sites it is embedded, based on inquiries that are sent to our Services. Cookies, clear gifs, and similar technologies also allow us to associate your online navigational information, or purchases and interactions (both online and offline), with any personal information you provide (such as name, address, phone number, survey responses, and email address). We'll associate this information to deliver products and services to you; to improve our business; to transact business; and to market our products and services on this and other online services through a variety of media like email, mobile advertising, and direct mail. As an example, we may use cookies to keep track of what you put into your shopping bag. That can help us contact you if your online session is disrupted in mid-purchase, resulting in an abandoned cart. We can also use this technology to determine whether you'd be interested in participating in special events, given your preferences. The end result is a more personalized experience that's tailored to your needs and tastes.

For information about your options with respect to cookies, see "What choices do you have over how your information is used?"

3\. Purposes of Information Collection

We use personal information about you, which is collected through the Services to:

  * Process your online orders.

  * Enable you to interact with third-party content service providers, whether by linking to their sites, viewing their content within our online environment, or by viewing our content within their online environment.
  * Market our products and services that may be of interest to you—for instance, we may add you to the BBW email list when you make an online purchase or sign up to receive emails; or we may add you to BBW print-catalogue list when you make an online purchase.
  * Create aggregated, pseudonymized or anonymized information for statistical purposes.

Please take note of who's running the event in question; and the terms, conditions, and policies that apply.

3\. Social Networking and other Third-Party Sites and Services

We may at times facilitate easy access to third-party sites and online services, like social networks and other services that host user-generated content. This may include easy click-through access, the ability for you to share content on third-party services, or even "single sign-on" to these services. The third-party's privacy policy applies to any information or content you provide through these services.

The legal basis for our processing of your personal data in connection with our Services is Art. 6.1(b) EU GDPR, which allows processing of personal data as necessary for the performance of a contract. When you access our Services, you form a contract with us based on our Terms of Use, and we need to process your personal data to respond to your requests, ship products to you and satisfy our obligations with respect to the other purposes listed in our Online Privacy Policy.

As exceptions, we rely on your consent with respect to cookies and direct marketing emails per Art. 6.1(a) EU GDPR, and legitimate interests under Art. 6.1(f) EU GDPR, especially with respect to situations where we must process your personal data to comply with applicable laws (as a U.S. based company, we are subject to U.S. laws and must comply, just like EEA-based companies have to comply with EEA laws).
