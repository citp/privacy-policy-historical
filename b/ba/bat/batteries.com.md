In general, we will only use the information you provide to us for the purpose for which such information was provided. We may also use this information to deliver to you information about our company and promotional material from some of our partners and affiliates, trend analysis, pattern detection, and site administration.

**Cookies**

Cookies are an industry standard used by most major Websites. When you view our Website we may store some information in the form of a "cookie" or similar file. Cookies are small pieces of information stored on your hard drive, not on our site. Cookies do not spy on you or otherwise invade your privacy, and they cannot invade your hard drive and steal information. Rather, they help you navigate a Website as easily as possible. We use cookies to improve the quality of our services, deliver content specific to your interests and to prevent you from reentering all your registration data at each connection.

Some of our business partners (e.g, advertisers) use cookies on our site. We have no access to or control over these cookies. This privacy policy covers the use of cookies by batteries.com only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.

Batteries.com uses OwnerIQ to place advertisements for our products and services and those of third parties on our Website and third-party sites. OwnerIQ uses cookies and other technologies such as Web beacons or tags to measure the effectiveness of our ads and to determine the display of content and advertising to you based on your interests both on our site, as well as on third-party sites where you may visit. To support this interest based advertising solution, OwnerIQ may use anonymous information about your visits to our and other Web sites. The information collected and used by OwnerIQ is always anonymous, and does not enable any third-party to identify you individually. For more information about OwnerIQ's Privacy Policy, please [click here](http://www.owneriq.com/privacy-policy).

Although it is our hope that you find the display of advertising to you based on your anonymous interests valuable, if you would prefer not to participate in the services offered by OwnerIQ, you can always opt-out of this activity by visiting OwnerIQ's Opt-Out page by [clicking here](http://www.owneriq.com/privacy-policy).

**Log Files**

We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. We keep this information for our internal use. We do not share it with others.

**Links**

Our Website contains links to other companies' websites. Because this Policy only applies to Batteries.com's Website and not linked websites, you should examine the privacy policy of any other websites that you access via a link from the Batteries.com Website. Batteries.com is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such other companies' websites.

**Third-Party Relationships**

When you purchase from us, we send your credit card information, name, and billing address to credit card companies for verification and to authorize your purchase. We give your name and shipping information to third-party shippers who use this information to deliver your purchase. 

We do not sell, rent, or otherwise share your personal information with third parties. 

Batteries.com may send offers to you on behalf of third party partners. If you want to take advantage of the offer, you will provide your information to our third party partner directly. Batteries.com will not share your information with these third party partners. Please review the privacy policies of our third party partners about how they will use your information and how to contact them.

If you sign up to be a Batteries.com affiliate, you will be directed to our third party affiliate relationship manager's site to complete the affiliate application. For more information on how our third party affiliate relationship management service uses your information, please review their privacy policy.

**Choice/Opt-out**

We give you the opportunity to 'opt-out' of receiving marketing information from us. The My Account signup form has an 'opt-out' mechanism so if you create an account with us, but don't want any marketing material, you can keep your email address off of our lists. 

If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter or promotional materials from us you may opt-out of receiving these communications by replying to unsubscribe in the subject line in the email or email us at [info@batteries.com](mailto:info@batteries.com).

If you do not wish to receive any catalog or postcard mailings in the future, you can contact [info@batteries.com](mailto:info@batteries.com) and request removal from our mailing list. Because customer communications are often prepared well in advance of deployment (sometimes months before the communication is made), you may continue to receive some communications after you send us a request not to use your information. We appreciate your patience during this time. 

**Correction/Updating Personal Information**

If you need to correct or update your personal information (such as your email address), or you no longer desires our service you can let us know on our member information page accessible by logging into your account or by emailing our customer support at [info@batteries.com](mailto:info@batteries.com).

**Notification of Changes**

If we change our Privacy Policy, we will post a notice of the change on our homepage, so you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify you via email or by posting a prominent notice on our Website 30 days prior to implementing the change. You will have a choice as to whether or not we use your information in this different manner. 

**Legal Disclaimer**

Batteries.com uses encryption technologies when transferring and receiving data from you through our site. We also have appropriate security measures in place in our physical facilities to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information that we have collected from you. When you submit personally identifiable information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with encryption software - (Secure Socket Layer). While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'.

For example, we store the personal information you provide on computer systems with limited access that are located in secured facilities. Batteries.com's employees are trained and kept up-to-date on our security procedures. If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email to [security@batteries.com](mailto:security@batteries.com).
