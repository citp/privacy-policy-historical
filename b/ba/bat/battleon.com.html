                  <p>* Artix Entertainment games are unique in a sense that we design and run numerous special events that keep the game constantly fresh, challenging, fun and interesting for our users. Some of these events coincide with actual real life holidays, such as Valentine’s Day, other events are made up as we go along. We use the newsletter to notify our users of all the current events, changes, improvements, upgrades, new characters, etc. In addition, occasionally we may notify our users of new products and services that Artix Entertainment has designed and made available exclusively to our users. In addition, Artix Entertainment may send promotional items and advertisements from the sponsors, however Artix Entertainment will not divulge your personal information to the sponsor directly.</p>

                    Artix Entertainment encourages parents and legal guardians to spend time online with their children. We urge parents and legal guardians to instruct their children to never give out their personal information online without permission. We also recognize a special need to protect personal information obtained from children. In compliance with Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act ('COPPA'), we have adopted the following policies regarding children under the age of 13 ('Children'):</p>
                  <p><strong>Type and Use of Information Collected from Children</strong><br>
                    To create a Free Account, Artix Entertainment does not collect or require for the child to provide any personally identifiable information if the child is known to Artix Entertainment to be under the age of 13.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    To create a Subscriber Account, Artix Entertainment does require an e-mail address as well as the parent’s correct billing information as outlined under the Subscriber Accounts section.<em> </em><br>
                    <br>
                    For Subscriber Accounts, we use your Subscriber e-mail address for the following purposes:</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li> To send a confirmation notice to the parent of their child's character registration and password information.<br>
                      <br>
                    </li>
                    <li>Upon the parent’s request, to send the user password information when the child has lost or forgotten their password.<br>
                      <br>
                    </li>
                    <li> In response to any questions, concerns or problems that a subscriber has contacted Artix Entertainment about.* <br>
                      <br>
                    </li>
                    <li>To contact the parent about any problem with the child’s account or conduct in the game.<br>
                      <br>
                    </li>
                    <li>To send out a newsletter to the subscriber email account**.</li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>*We recognize that young children may inadvertently give out personal information including their e-mail address when contacting us with any questions, problems, or concerns they have encountered while playing the game. We do not collect or use any such additional personal information acquired in this manner unless it is necessary for us to respond to the problem or question or concern. We reserve the right to disclose your child's personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web Sites.                    </p>
                  <p>** Artix Entertainment games are unique in a sense that we design and run numerous special events that keep the game constantly fresh, challenging, fun and interesting for our users. Some of these events coincide with actual real life holidays, such as Valentine’s Day, other events are made up as we go along. We use the newsletter to notify our users of all the upcoming events, changes, improvements, upgrades, new characters, etc. In addition, occasionally we may notify our users of new products and services that Artix Entertainment has designed and made available exclusively to our users. <br>
                  </p>
                  <p>If a child desires to upgrade his/her account to Subscriber Status, a parent or legal guardian will be required to divulge additional reasonably necessary information as described above under Subscriber Accounts. <br>

                    At this time, whenever Artix Entertainment is aware that a user is under the age of 13, Artix Entertainment requires the child submit the parent’s email address. We will then provide proper parental notice of the child’s use of the site, including their username and password. For Subscriber Accounts, the receipt of payment is considered actual, verifiable consent from the parents to the child’s use of our website and to any information that was divulged as reasonably necessary to process payments, verify and maintain the account.</p>
