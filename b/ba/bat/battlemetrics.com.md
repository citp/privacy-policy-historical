**Online Tracking Information**

Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret web browser-based “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) signals other than cookies, BattleMetrics, LLC does not currently respond to “DNT” signals to its US websites.

Most browsers can be configured not to accept cookies; however, this may prevent you from having access to some functions or services on our sites.

See Sections 5 and 7 for more information.

### 3\. Personally Identifiable Information We Collect From You

When you visit this site we will not collect any personally identifiable information about you unless you provide it to us voluntarily. For purposes of this Privacy Statement, “personally identifiable information” is information that identifies you as an individual, for example your name, street address, telephone number, e-mail address and credit card number. If you opt not to provide us with personally identifiable information you can still access our website, however you will be unable to create login credentials which are necessary to access certain functionalities on the site. Furthermore, you may not be able to activate or use a service, have a purchase order fulfilled, or receive product information.

**BattleMetrics.com - Saving Content**

### 4\. How We Use the Personally Identifiable Information We Collect

Personally identifiable information collected on this site may be used to:

  * Fulfill a site user request (e.g., create log in credentials, brochure fulfillment, send marketing or promotional materials including e-mails, price quotes, send alerts, send updates, and/or to save or share content)
  * Fulfill and deliver an order for goods or services
  * Respond to your comments or requests for information

  * Compile user data that is stored in our database
  * Match personal data collected here with data about you that we collect through other sources
  * Comply with legal requirements
  * Send SMS alerts subject to user requested conditions



### 5\. Other Information We Collect From Site Visitors

This site collects other information from site visitors. This means that we do not track these items on an individual basis that identifies the site visitor, but rather gather and collect this information on an aggregate [or anonymous] basis that includes all site visitors. Non-personally identifiable information may include information such as tracking the site pages that are visited, the amount of time spent on our site, clicks, mouse movements, scrolls, page views, events (which shopping tools you interacted with), and zip code. This includes aggregate data provided by a third-party that surveys site visitors on our behalf.

Information that we collect from RCON users is for the sole use of the RCON user and those who the RCON user authorizes to view such information. However, we will use some of the information we obtain over the RCON connection to create more accurate player and server data for the public. In no event will we disclose information obtained over the RCON connection to unauthorized users unless that information is already publicly available. For example, player names are always public, whereas IPs are not. In that situation we would only display the player name to the public and not the IP.

We may use session and persistent “cookies,” session logs, spot light ads/web beacons/GIF/pixel tags, banner ads or links, third-party networks that serve user-requested emails (e.g., a third party email service provider for Tell-a-Friend user-customized emails), and third-party click tracking analytics tools (such as Adobe, DoubleClick, Efficient Frontier, Keynote, Google Analytics and ClickTale; these companies may also use such tools) to collect aggregate or other non-personally identifiable information about site visitors. An explanation on collection methods and how they work is included in Section 7 - Methods to Collect Information, below.

We also use your data for advertising purposes.

We use third-party advertising companies who serve ads to help keep content free. For these partners, we put additional restrictions on how your data can be used to prevent it from misuse. For instance, we do not allow these partners to take your information for profiling and personalizing ads on other sites.

Please review the following for a full list of partners and purposes: -[PubGalaxy (Titan Gate AD)] (<https://www.pubgalaxy.com/privacy-policy.html>)

### 6\. How We Use the Aggregate or Non-Personally Identifiable Information We Collect

Non-Personally identifiable information collected on this site may be used to:

  * Compile aggregate and statistical data to help in website design and to identify popular features
  * Measure site activity to allow us to update our site to better meet user wants and needs
  * Make the user experience more customer friendly



This site utilizes non-personally identifiable information for the purpose of performing analytics on the users' experience while visiting this site. This analysis:

  * Is performed on an aggregate level and does not identify you or your information personally
  * May involve the use of a third-party vendor acting on behalf of this site
  * Is performed in order to improve our website and the user experience



### 7\. Methods to Collect Information and Interest-Based/Online Behavioral Advertising

A “cookie” is a small text file that helps us in many ways to make your visit to our website more enjoyable and meaningful to you. For example, cookies avoid you having to log in every time you come back to one of our websites. They also allow us to tailor a website or advertisement to better match your interests and preferences. There are a couple different types of cookies.

A “session” cookie is stored only in your computer's working memory (RAM) and only lasts for your browsing session. When you close all your browser's windows, or when you shut down your computer, the session cookie disappears forever.

A “persistent” cookie is stored on your computer's hard drive until a specified date, which could be tomorrow, next week, or 10 years from now. Persistent cookies stay on your computer until either a) they expire, b) they are overwritten with newer cookies, or c) you manually remove them. Most browsers can be configured not to accept cookies, however, this may prevent you from having access to some site functions or features.

This site may use a third party to activate and/or deliver a service, or deliver site functionality such as fulfilling your request to purchase a product or service, including items from our online store. In performing this function the third party may place a persistent cookie on your computer or have to gather personal information from you in order to activate and deliver the service, or facilitate the processing of your purchase.

This site may use a third-party click tracking analytics tool (such as Adobe, DoubleClick, Efficient Frontier, Keynote, Google Analytics and ClickTale) to capture clickthrough statistics.

This site may use spotlight ads/web beacons/GIF/pixel tags which are site instrumentation tools that help us to determine, for instance, whether a page has been viewed or not and, if so, how many times. Emails or electronic newsletters we send may use tools (e.g., pixel tags or web beacons) to gather email metrics and information to improve the reader’s experience such as how many of the emails are opened, if they were printed or forwarded, the type of device (e.g., mobile or PC) from which they were opened, and the city, state, and county associated with the applicable IP address. In general, any electronic image viewed as part of a webpage, including an ad banner, can act as a web beacon.

This website may generate a “session log” when you visit our site. We use session logs to help us determine how people travel through our site. In this way, we can structure our pages so that the information most frequently visited is easier to find. By tracking page visits, we can also determine if the information we're providing is being used. The only data gathered is the Internet Protocol (IP) address from which you came (which contains no personal information), the website that referred you, the pages you visited and the date and time of those visits.

Users may be provided the opportunity to integrate with third-party social media sites, and this site may track on an aggregate level the number of items “liked” on this site, or items on this site that you choose to share with a third-party social media site.

Users may be directed to this site via banner ads, site links or QR Codes. Ads, site links or QR Codes may use tools such as cookies or web beacons to deliver metrics on the effectiveness of the ads or links. They do not collect personally identifiable information from the user.

This website also utilizes Google Analytics and its associated cookies. If you wish to opt-out of the tracking associated with Google Analytics, you can download [this](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/) addon. Additionally, you may opt-out by adjusting your Ads Settings, Ad Settings for mobile apps, or any other available means (such as the NAI consumer opt-out).
