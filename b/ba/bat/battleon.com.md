# Adventure Quest RPG - PBW

| **PRIVACY POLICY OVERVIEW**  
---  
  
Dear Adventurers,

We are one of the few remaining good guys on the internet. We will absolutely not sell your email address to anyone else. We hate spam as much as you do. We employed an evil Necromancer *coughs* I mean attorney to write up the detailed policy below for those of you who enjoy reading legalese. Read on (they made me do it.) 

Battle on!  
Artix   
  
   
**PRIVACY POLICY** (REVISED MARCH 17, 2006)  
  
AdventureQuest (created and run by Artix Entertainment, LLC) provides family friendly entertainment to our users. We are committed to protecting the safety and security of its online visitors and are sensitive to our user's concerns about the safety of the personal information provided to us. We encourage all our users to read this Privacy Statement carefully in order to understand how any personal information collected about you is used. 

We are also aware, that due to our content we may have some younger users on our site. We recognize the need to provide additional protection to those younger users. The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) requires that we inform parents and legal guardians about how we collect, use, and disclose personal information from children under 13 years of age; and that we obtain the consent of parents and guardians in order for the children under 13 years of age to use our website. We explain this information under the Kids' Privacy Policy section below.

Information You Provide to Us And How We Use This Information  
I. Free Accounts   
AdventureQuest has a large portion of the game available to the users for free. In order to register a character for the free version of the game, the only information that AdventureQuest collects is the user's e-mail address. The e-mail address is used for the following purposes: 

  * To send a confirmation notice to the user of their character registration and password information. 
  * Upon the user's request, to send the user password information when the user has lost or forgotten the password. 
  * In response to any question, concerns or problem that the user contacted AdventureQuest about. 
  * To contact the user about any problem with the user's account or conduct in the game. 
  * To send out a newsletter*. 



* AdventureQuest game is unique in a sense that we design and run numerous special events that keep the game constantly fresh, challenging, fun and interesting for our users. Some of these events coincide with actual real life holidays, such as Valentine's Day, other events are made up as we go along. We use the newsletter to notify our users of all the current events, changes, improvements, upgrades, new characters, etc. In addition, occasionally we may notify our users of new products and services that AdventureQuest has designed and made available exclusively to our users. Please note, that the products and services are from AdventureQuest only and will not come from any advertisers or third parties.   
  
   
II. Guardian Accounts   
  
A Guardian Account is a paid membership account that provides our users with additional access and privileges while playing AdventureQuest. The Guardian Account requires and uses all of the information listed under the Free Account in the same manner. In addition to the above, however, we will require you to provide the following information: 

  * First and last name 
  * Address, city, state and zip code 
  * Home telephone number 



We are copied with this information by PayPal (see Security and Credit Card Use below) and require this information for the sole purpose of verifying your account and payment information.   
  
   
What We WILL NOT DO With Your Personal Information   
AdventureQuest is 100% supported by its Guardian Account Users. Therefore AdventureQuest does not sell or knowingly divulge your information to advertisers or any other third parties, unless we are required to share your information with a third party in order to comply with law, to comply with a court order or subpoena; to enforce our site or game rules; to protect the safety and security of our users and our Web sites.   
   
What Are Cookies?   
A cookie is a little piece of information handed to a web browser to a web server that contains information that can be retrieved from the server later. AdventureQuest uses cookies only to the limited extent of recognizing the registered user and pairing that user with the character that the user created and the account preferences set by that user within the game.   
   
Message Boards  
The AdventureQuest message board is a place for users of the game to interact by posting messages. The message board must be signed up for separately from the game and is subject to TERMS OF USE.   
   
Security and Credit Card Use

KID'S PRIVACY POLICY   
AdventureQuest encourages parents and legal guardians to spend time online with their children. We urge parents and legal guardians to instruct their children to never give out their personal information online without permission. We also recognize a special need to protect personal information obtained from children. In compliance with Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”), we have adopted the following policies regarding children under the age of 13 (“kids”):   
   
Type and Use of Information Collected from Kids   
  
AdventureQuest does require all users to provide us with his/her e-mail address in order to set up a free account and register a character in our game. If we are aware that the user is under the age of 13, at this time we require for the parents to set up the account for their kids. The setting up of the account by the parents is considering an actual verifiable consent by the parent for the kid to use this website as required by COPPA. 

We use your child's e-mail address for the following purposes:

  * To send a confirmation notice to the kid of their character registration and password information. 
  * Upon the kid's request, to send the user password information when the kid has lost or forgotten the password. 
  * In response to any questions, concerns or problems that the kid contacted AdventureQuest about.* 
  * To contact the kid about any problem with the kid's account or conduct in the game. 
  * To send out a newsletter**. 



* We recognize that young children may inadvertently give out personal information in addition to their e-mail address when contacting us with any questions, problems, or concerns they have encountered while playing the game. We do not collect or use any such additional personal information acquired in this manner unless it is necessary for us to respond to the problem or question or concern. We do not divulge any such information to any third parties unless we are required to do so by law, court order or subpoena.

** AdventureQuest game is unique in a sense that we design and run numerous special events that keep the game constantly fresh, challenging, fun and interesting for our users. Some of these events coincide with actual real life holidays, such as Valentine's Day, other events are made up as we go along. We use the newsletter to notify our users of all the upcoming events, changes, improvements, upgrades, new characters, etc. In addition, occasionally we may notify our users of new products and services that AdventureQuest has designed and made available exclusively to our users. Please note, that the products and services are from AdventureQuest only and will not come from any advertisers or third parties.

If a kid desires to upgrade his/her account to Guardian Status, a parent or legal guardian will be required to divulge additional reasonably necessary information as described above under Guardian Accounts.

AdventureQuest does not sell or knowingly divulge your kid's information to advertisers or any other third parties, unless we are required to share your kid's information with a third party in order to comply with law, to comply with a court order or subpoena; to enforce our site or game rules; to protect the safety and security of our users and our Web sites.

Also, please note that AdventureQuest does not condition a kid's participation in an online activity on the kid providing more personal information than is reasonably necessary for the activity.   
  
   
Notification and Verifiable Parental Consent   
  
At this time, whenever AdventureQuest is aware that a user is under the age of 13, AdventureQuest requires for the parents to set up the account for their kid. The setting up of account by the parent is considered an actual verifiable consent by the parent to the kid's use of our website as required by COPPA. 

For Guardian Accounts, the receipt of payment is considered actual, verifiable consent from the parents to the child's use of our website and to any information that was divulged as reasonably necessary to process payments, verify and maintain the account.   
  
   
How can parents access, change or delete personally identifiable information about their kids?   
  
Once again, we would like to assure you that we do not keep any information other than what is listed above. However, parents are welcome to contact us about any personally identifiable information about their child by emailing aq.privacy@battleon.com. Parents can then request to purge either all or specific portions of that information by e-mailing aq.privacy@battleon.com.   
  
   
Revision Information   
  
AdventureQuest reserves the right to change, modify, or revise this Privacy Policy in order to comply with any applicable laws or changes within the game or for any other reason at any time. Therefore our users are encouraged to check the Privacy Policy periodically to read about any changes, modifications, or revisions.
