## For Parents/Guardians: Keeping Your Children Safe

We recognize a special need to protect personal information received from children. This section explains your rights as a parent or legal guardian, the measures we take to provide children with additional protections, and the steps we take to comply with both the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ('COPPA') the EU’s GDPR-K (‘General Data Privacy Regulation-Kids) acts. To learn more about COPPA, please see this information guide from the [kidSAFE Seal Program](https://www.kidsafeseal.com/knowaboutcoppa.html).

In compliance with Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ('COPPA') and the EU’s GDPR-K (‘General Data Privacy Regulation-Kids) act, we have adopted the following policies regarding children under the age of consent in their country of residence. The “age of consent” is 13 years old within the United States and 16 within the European Union:

  * We do not collect or require the child to provide any personally identifiable information to create a Free Account if we know the child to be under the age of consent within their country of residence.
  * Whenever Artix Entertainment is aware that a child is under the age of consent, we require them to submit a parent/guardian’s email address for account creation and communication.
  * We do not collect or store any additional personal information given by underage users contacting us with questions or issues, and will only use the information while/if it is necessary for us to respond.
  * Artix Entertainment does not share, sell, rent or trade, your child's personal information to any third parties for their promotional purposes. Giving us consent to use your child’s information does not automatically grant consent for its disclosure to third parties.
  * To create an upgraded Subscriber Account, we require a parent or guardian’s email address and correct billing address. ( _Additional reasonable information may be requested if we encounter issues with processing your upgrade._ )
  * The receipt of payment is considered actual, verifiable consent by a parent/legal guardian to the child’s use of our website, and to any information that was divulged as reasonably necessary to process payments, verify, and maintain the account.
  * We reserve the right to disclose your or your child's personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on Artix Entertainment.



**Your email address may be used:**

  1. To send a confirmation notice of your child's character registration and password information.
  2. To send the user or password information when your child has lost or forgotten their login information
  3. To respond to any questions, concerns or problems that you or your child has about a subscription.
  4. To contact you about any problem with your child's account or conduct in the game.
  5. To send out a newsletter to the subscriber email account



If we make material changes to how we collect information from children under 13, we will notify parents by email to obtain verifiable parental consent.
