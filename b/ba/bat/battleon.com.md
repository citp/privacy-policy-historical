Some of these events coincide with actual real life holidays, such as Valentine’s Day, other events are made up as we go along. We use the newsletter to notify our users of all the current events, changes, improvements, upgrades, new characters, etc. In addition, occasionally we may notify our users of new products and services that Artix Entertainment has designed and made available exclusively to our users. In addition, Artix Entertainment may send promotional items and advertisements from the sponsors, however Artix Entertainment will not divulge your personal information to the sponsor directly.

We are copied with this information by PayPal (see Security and Credit Card Use below) and require this information for the sole purpose of verifying your account and payment information.

**What We WILL DO With Your Personal Information**  
We use third-party service providers (“Service Providers”), such as a shipping company to fulfill orders, and a credit card processing company to bill you for goods and services. When you sign up with the website, we will provide your personal information (e.g. name, address, phone number and email address) to Service Providers as necessary for such Service Providers to provide their respective services. Service Providers to whom Artix Entertainment discloses your personal information all have agreed to abide by this Privacy Policy, and Service Providers are specifically prohibited from using your personal information for promotional purposes. Please note that Service Providers (e.g., PayPal)may have separate privacy policies that govern their collection, use and storage of information that you provide to them directly. 

**What We WILL NOT DO With Your Personal Information**

Therefore Artix Entertainment does not share, sell, rent or trade your or your child's personally identifiable information with any third parties for their promotional purposes. We reserve the right to disclose your or your child's personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web Sites. 

**Other Provisions**  
**What Are Cookies?**  
A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. Each cookie can only be accessed by the web site that created the cookie. We use cookies on this site. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.

We use both temporary session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate on our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your web browser's help information.

We set persistent cookies to store your game account login and/or password, so you don't have to enter it more than once. Persistent cookies also enable us to detect new users, and track referals to the site to reward users that refer their friends to the site.

If your browser rejects all cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site including purchasing membership, will be limited.

**Third Party Tracking Technologies**  
Third party partners, affiliates, and advertisers employ a software technology called Web beacons, that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Web beacons are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, Web beacons are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. 

The use of cookies and Web beacon by our partners, affiliates, and advertisers is not covered by our privacy statement. We do not have access or control over these tracking technologies. Our partners use persistant cookies and Web beacons to track users that visit our site through their advertising networks.

Flash cookies are different from browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored.  Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies.

**CHILDRENS’S PRIVACY POLICY**  
Artix Entertainment encourages parents and legal guardians to spend time online with their children. We urge parents and legal guardians to instruct their children to never give out their personal information online without permission. We also recognize a special need to protect personal information obtained from children. In compliance with Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act ('COPPA'), we have adopted the following policies regarding children under the age of 13 ('Children'):

**Type and Use of Information Collected from Children**  
To create a Free Account, Artix Entertainment does not collect or require for the child to provide any personally identifiable information if the child is known to Artix Entertainment to be under the age of 13. 

To create a Subscriber Account, Artix Entertainment does require an e-mail address as well as the parent’s correct billing information as outlined under the Subscriber Accounts section. __

For Subscriber Accounts, we use your Subscriber e-mail address for the following purposes:

  1. To send a confirmation notice to the parent of their child's character registration and password information.
  2. Upon the parent’s request, to send the user password information when the child has lost or forgotten their password.
  3. In response to any questions, concerns or problems that a subscriber has contacted Artix Entertainment about.* 
  4. To contact the parent about any problem with the child’s account or conduct in the game.
  5. To send out a newsletter to the subscriber email account**.



*We recognize that young children may inadvertently give out personal information including their e-mail address when contacting us with any questions, problems, or concerns they have encountered while playing the game. We do not collect or use any such additional personal information acquired in this manner unless it is necessary for us to respond to the problem or question or concern. We reserve the right to disclose your child's personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web Sites. 

** Artix Entertainment games are unique in a sense that we design and run numerous special events that keep the game constantly fresh, challenging, fun and interesting for our users. Some of these events coincide with actual real life holidays, such as Valentine’s Day, other events are made up as we go along. We use the newsletter to notify our users of all the upcoming events, changes, improvements, upgrades, new characters, etc. In addition, occasionally we may notify our users of new products and services that Artix Entertainment has designed and made available exclusively to our users.   


If a child desires to upgrade his/her account to Subscriber Status, a parent or legal guardian will be required to divulge additional reasonably necessary information as described above under Subscriber Accounts.

Parents may consent to the website’s use of their child’s personal information, but request that such personal information is not disclosed to third parties, by emailing us at 

**Notification and Verifiable Parental Consent**  
At this time, whenever Artix Entertainment is aware that a user is under the age of 13, Artix Entertainment requires the child submit the parent’s email address. We will then provide proper parental notice of the child’s use of the site, including their username and password. For Subscriber Accounts, the receipt of payment is considered actual, verifiable consent from the parents to the child’s use of our website and to any information that was divulged as reasonably necessary to process payments, verify and maintain the account.
