# Bartleby.com Privacy Policy

**Bartleby Communications Privacy Policy.**   April 26, 2001   


> We use third-party advertising companies to serve our ads on the Internet. These third-party advertising companies employ cookie and 1x1 pixel .gif technology to measure and improve the effectiveness of ads for their clients. To do so, these companies may use anonymous information about your visits to our Web site and other Web sites. This information can include: date/time of banner ad shown, the banner ad that was shown, their cookie, the IP address. This information can also be used for online preference marketing purposes. 
> 
> If you want to prevent a third-party advertiser from setting and/or reading cookies on your computer, currently you may either visit each ad network's web site individually and opt out or visit the NAI gateway opt-out site to opt-out of all network advertising cookies. [Click here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/) for the NAI gateway opt-out site. This site will also allow you to review the third-party advertising companies' privacy policies.
> 
> **Consumer Information**   
> During the process of delivering an ad to you, Bartleby does not collect any personally identifiable information about you—such as name, address, phone number, or e-mail address. However, Bartleby does obtain some types of nonpersonally identifiable information—such as the Internet Service Provider you use to connect to the Internet, your browser type, or the type of computer operating system you use (Macintosh or Windows, for example). The information collected by Bartleby is used for the purpose of targeting ads and measuring ad effectiveness on behalf of our advertisers. In some cases, you may voluntarily provide personal information in response to a specific ad (the advertiser may ask you to fill out a survey or provide your zip code). If this does occur, Bartleby may collect this information on behalf of an advertiser. This information is used by an advertiser to respond to your request. In addition, Bartleby may combine this information with other users’ information and review it in an aggregate form to understand the type of people who view a specific type of ad or visit a particular kind of website.
> 
> **Data Collection**   
> Bartleby—as well as most sites on the Internet—use “cookies” to enhance your experience on the web. What are cookies and why do we use them? First, Bartleby cannot use these cookies to identify you personally in any way. A cookie is a unique number that is provided to you the first time Bartleby—or any site that uses cookies—serves an ad to you. This unique number, which is stored in a cookie file on your computer, helps Bartleby target ads to you. This cookie can help Bartleby ensure that we do not serve you the same ad multiple times and help our advertisers understand what you like and do not like about their offerings so they can cater better to your needs the next time you are interested in their products or services. While we believe cookies enhance your Internet experience by limiting the number of times you see the same ad and delivering more relevant content to you, they are not required for Bartleby to deliver you an ad.
> 
> If you do not want the benefit of cookies, there is a simple procedure to delete your cookies manually. Please consult your web browser’s help documentation for more information.
> 
> If you have any additional questions about Bartleby’s dedication to consumer privacy, please contact us at [bartlebycom@aol.com](mailto:bartlebycom@aol.com).
