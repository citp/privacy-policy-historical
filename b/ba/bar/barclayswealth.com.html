<p>Please read our Privacy Policy carefully before using this website ("the Site"). In this Policy "we", "us" and "our" means Barclays Bank PLC and “you” means the individual who is using the Site. </p>
<p><strong>Cookies</strong><br>To make using our website as straightforward as possible and to improve the service we offer you, we use cookies. </p>
</dt><dt target="target_blank">
<p><strong>What are Cookies?</strong><br>Cookies are harmless text files that web servers can store on your computer’s hard drive when you visit a site. They allow the server to recognise you when you revisit. There are two main types: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<div target="target_blank"><strong>Transient (or per-session) cookies </strong>- these only exist for your site visit and are deleted on exit. They recognise you as you move between pages, for example, recording items added to an online shopping basket. These cookies also help maintain security.</div></li>
<li>
<div target="target_blank"><strong>Persistent (or permanent) cookies</strong> - these stay on your machine until expiry or deletion. Many are built with automatic deletion dates to help ensure your hard drive doesn’t get overloaded. These cookies often store and re-enter your log-in information, so you don’t need to remember membership details.</div></li></ul>

<p>We use both types of cookie. </p>
</dt><dt target="target_blank">
<p>Additionally, cookies can be first or third party cookies. First party cookies are owned &amp; created by the website you’re viewing. Third party cookies are owned &amp; created by an independent company, usually a company providing a service to the website owners. <br><strong></strong></p>
</dt><dt target="target_blank">
<p><strong>What we use cookies for</strong><br>Internet cookies are common and do not harm your system – they just store or gather site information. They help you do things online, like remembering logon details so you don’t have to re-enter them when revisiting a site. </p>
</dt><dt target="target_blank">
<p>We use cookies to: </p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Gather customer journey information across our sites </li>
<li>Ensure your privacy in our secure sites </li>
<li>Store login details for our secure sites </li>
<li>Temporarily store details input into our calculators, tools, illustrations and demonstrations </li>
<li>Store details of your marketing, product and business unit preferences to improve our targeting and enhance your journey through our sites </li>
