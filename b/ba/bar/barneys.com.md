## Your Choices

_Online Account Information_

Registering for an account on our Services will make your online shopping experience faster and easier. We can store your shipping addresses and billing information so that you don’t have to enter them each time you shop. You will also be able to save your shopping basket, check your order status, and review your order history. In addition, you can seamlessly shop your favorite designers and products by saving them to your account. You can add, delete, or change your online account information at any time by logging into your account. If you wish to deactivate your account, please email us at privacy@barneys.com, but note that we may retain certain information as required by law or for legitimate business purposes. 

_Location Information_

Barneys New York offers mobile applications that allow you to shop online, discover in-store happenings, browse editorial content, or receive other communications. When you first launch any of our mobile applications that collect location information, you will be asked to consent to the application’s collection of this information. Although you do not have to provide your location to use our mobile applications, allowing Barneys New York to collect precise location data enables us to deliver relevant content within our stores and to enhance your overall shopping experience. If you allow us to collect location information, we may collect your location at your request (such as when you tap “Enable” on a location services prompt). We may also collect location information when your device is near our in-store content personalization systems, even if you are not actively using the app. We use your location data to enhance your shopping experience, as well as to assist with foot traffic measurement and service improvements in our stores. If you initially consent to our collection of location information, you can subsequently turn off this location tracking at any time in your device settings, or by disabling Bluetooth. 

_Promotional Communications_

You may opt out of receiving promotional emails from Barneys New York by following the instructions in those emails. If you opt out, we may still send you non-promotional emails, such as those about your account or our ongoing business relations. 

_Mobile Push Notifications/Alerts_

With your consent, we may send promotional and non-promotional push notifications or alerts to your mobile device. You can deactivate these messages at any time by changing the notification settings on your mobile device. 

_Your California Policy Rights_

California law permits residents of California to request certain details about how their information is shared with third parties for direct marketing purposes. Under the law, a business must either provide this information or permit California residents to opt in to, or opt out of, this type of sharing. Barneys New York qualifies for this alternative option. To opt out of having information about you shared with third parties for direct marketing purposes, you may do so by writing to Barneys New York, Attn: Legal, 575 Fifth Avenue, New York NY 10017 or e-mailing privacy@barneys.com.
