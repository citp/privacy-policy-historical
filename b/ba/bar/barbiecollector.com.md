**Does Mattel Collect Any Personal Information About Me if I'm over 18 or My Child who is 13 or Over?**   
Mattel doesn't require anyone to share any personal information about themselves in order to enjoy any of our Web sites. That means you can visit our sites without any need to register with us. However, most of our sites contain special sections and privileges for members that register. We do not collect any personal information from you or your teenager unless it is voluntarily provided, for instance when signing a guest book, registering for contests, downloads, or free demos, completing our online customer surveys or purchasing products. The personal information we ask for is usually first and last name, mailing address, phone number and an email address. See below for how we use this information. Remember, only people who are 18 or older may purchase products from our online stores.

**What Ordering Information Does Mattel Collect Online in the E-store?**   
Our Barbie Collector E-store offers a range of products available for purchase online, as well as a chance to get our catalog. Customers must be over age 18 with a valid credit card. When a customer places an order or requests a catalog online, we collect information associated with the transaction. This information includes the customer's name, mailing address, products ordered, shipping addresses, and credit card information. We ask for this information so that we may fulfill the order or catalog request. We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to protect credit card data during transmission, and adopt careful internal procedures to safeguard this information in our system. 

Customers have the option of registering certain information for future orders while completing their online order. For the customers who choose to register, we will capture their login name, password, name and mailing address, alternate ship-to addresses, and credit card information. When registered customers return to the site to place subsequent orders, they can identify themselves with login name and password. 

If a customer includes a child's birth date and e-mail address, this information will only be used to help us provide products and services that meet customer needs. 

When a customer places an online order, we will send a confirming e-mail message if the customer includes an e-mail address. We may also send an occasional e-mail featuring a special promotion or product that may be of interest to our customers. Any customer who prefers not to receive an online order confirmation or promotional e-mails should indicate this preference on the E-store order form. If you do receive an e-mail from us that you would rather not receive, simply follow the unsubscribe instructions included in the e-mail. 

When a customer requests a catalog or places an order online, we add the customer's name and address to our print catalog mailing list. If a customer does not wish to receive our mailings, they can send the mailing label from their catalogue to the following address: 

Barbie Collector: Mail Order Processing Dept.   
8400 Fairway Place P.O. Box 620040   
Middleton, WI 53562-0040. 

Customers who have recently moved or are planning a move in the near future should let us know by filling out the attached online Change of Address. For all mailing questions and changes, you may also call 1-800-491-7514.

**Does Mattel Collect Any Personal Information About My Child Under 13?**   
Barbie Collector offers information, and opportunities to sign up to obtain our catalog or to shop online for our adult fans. We use age-screening devices to avoid collecting personal information from children. Visitors must be over 18 and have a valid credit card to place an online order.

**What Does Mattel Do With the Information We Collect?**   
We use the personal information we collect for the purposes indicated at the time you or your teenager or child (with your consent) provides such information. For instance, if you register in a contest, we will use the registration information to notify contest winners, or if you purchase a product, we will use the information to fulfill the order. Occasionally, and only with consent at the time we ask for information, we might also email or mail you or your teenager or your child to provide information on upcoming Mattel products, Web site updates and promotions. With your consent, we may also share information with other Mattel brands and Mattel family companies so that they can let you and your family know about their products which might be of interest. If you want to stop receiving such updates and product information from Mattel or our affiliates at any time, just email us at [Service@mattel.com](mailto:Service@mattel.com) or call us at 800-524-TOYS. Our mailings and emails will also include information allowing you to ask not to receive such information in the future.

**Does Mattel Share Information About Me With Others?**   
If you consent, Mattel may provide your information to outside companies that offer products or services that may be of interest, and if your teenager 13 or older consents, we may likewise provide their information. Except as described in this policy, we never share personal information that we receive online from children under 13 with other companies outside the Mattel family of companies. We will remove your name from the list we provide to outside companies, if you just email us at [Service@mattel.com](mailto:Service@mattel.com) or call us at 800-524-TOYS and we will do the same for your teenager's name if they request removal. In special circumstances, Mattel may give other companies access to our information database, but only if necessary to allow them to provide database or server maintenance or security, help us process and fulfill orders or requests, or provide other similar services to Mattel. If we do provide access, we require those other companies to sign confidentiality agreements promising to keep secret any information they see. If Mattel believes that anyone's behavior on our sites may damage us or our sites or anyone else, we may disclose the relevant personal information in order to prevent this harm. In that case, we might try to identify the wrongdoer, contact them or bring legal action against them. We may also disclose personal information if we believe that the disclosure is required by law, or in response to a legal request.

**How Does Mattel Use Cookies?**   
A "cookie" is a small file that we save on your computer's hard drive which contains non-personal information. Our cookies help to give you faster access to pages you have already visited; they allow you to personalize your pages; and they help you to participate in some activities or events on the site. For instance, some of our sites have scavenger or treasure hunts, and we need to use cookies to keep track of your progress. If you leave the site and then return, cookies will tell us what things you have already collected so that you do not have to start all over again. Cookies keep track of items in your shopping cart and wish list. We also use cookies to help us figure out how many people visit our sites, which of our Web pages they stop at and how long they stay there. This information helps us figure out which of our Web features are a smashing success and what sites might need improvement! For administrative purposes, we collect IP addresses, which is the automatic number assigned to your computer when you surf the Web. The IP address allows us to count total number of "hits" on our sites. However, your IP address and cookie is not connected to any personally identifiable or online contact information like a name and address, so you and your family remain anonymous. We also use other technology, called clear GIFs, to provide us with other important anonymous information, such as when an e-mail has been opened.

**Does Mattel Ever Collect Personal Information without Consent?**   
Mattel does not collect information passively through cookies or other tracking mechanisms except in the circumstances described above. Cookies DON'T contain any personal information about a specific user. We don't use cookies or other non-consensual methods to take personally identifiable or online contact information about you or your family off of your computer. Except for certain activities like treasure hunts, which we talked about above, Mattel doesn't use cookies for direct marketing or promotional purposes. Cookies are also not used to collect information specifically about you or your family for sharing with third parties.
