### Compliance Reporting

When you instruct us to provide Compliance Reporting to a Company (or their appoint representative),  the information will be transmitted in accordance with Barclays Privacy Policy, which is updated regularly and can be found on this page. This information may change from time to time. Information we consider relevant to personal account dealing includes but is not limited to, account transactions, holdings and related personal information. 

You should instruct us on each Barclays Stockbrokers Account you hold separately.  If we establish that you have more than one Account but you have not specified that it should be included in the Employee Trading Reports, we may provide information to the Company, on all such account(s).

The Company may tell us that the employee to which the reports relate have left their employment. Should you want us to stop reporting on your Account(s) you must contact us to do so.

The Company will process the information received in accordance with their own policies and this may mean that your data is processed outside of the United Kingdom. Barclays Stockbrokers will only send data to jurisdictions where we are confident similar Data Privacy legislations would be applied as here in the United Kingdom. For more information on how your data will be processed and the implications, please refer to your employers PA Dealing Policy or contact your Compliance / HR function.

If an employer is no longer a participant of this service, Barclays will reduce the information provided to the employer by  issuing a copy contract note only. Therefore, the employer may require further information directly from you the employee/account holder.
