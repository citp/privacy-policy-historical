1\. The information we collect  
  
When you use the Barnes & Noble.com site, we receive and collect certain information. The information that we receive and collect depends on what you do when you visit Barnes & Noble.com. 

  * _Automatically Collected Information_. Some information is automatically received and sometimes collected from you when you visit the Barnes & Noble.com site. We receive and collect the name of the domain and host from which you access the Internet; the Internet protocol (IP) address of the computer you are using; the browser software you use and your operating system; the date and time you access our site; and the Internet address of the web site from which you linked directly to our site. We use this information to monitor the usage of our site. Also, when we send emails to you, we may be able to identify information about your email address, such as whether you can read graphic-rich HTML emails. All of the information we automatically capture provides us with the ability to enhance our customers' search and shopping experiences and to determine aggregate information about our user base and usage patterns.
  *  _Information Collected via Cookies_. We use cookies to enhance the browsing and shopping experience on the Barnes & Noble.com site. "Cookies" are small files or records that we place on your computer's hard drive to collect information about your activities on the Barnes & Noble.com site. The cookies transmit this information back to the computers at Barnes & Noble.com or our third-party distributors of banners and newsletters; these computers are, generally speaking, the only computers which are authorized to read such information. The information captured makes it possible for us (i) to speed navigation, keep track of items in your shopping cart, and provide you with custom tailored content; (ii) to remember information you gave to us so you don't have to reenter it each time you visit the Barnes & Noble.com site; (iii) to monitor the effectiveness of certain of our marketing email campaigns; and (iv) to monitor total number of visitors, pages viewed, and the total number of banners served. 

 Most people do not know that cookies are being placed on their computers when they visit the Barnes & Noble.com site or most web sites because browsers are typically set to accept cookies. You can choose to have your browser warn you every time a cookie is being sent to you or you can turn off cookie placement. If you refuse cookies, you will not be able to open a Barnes & Noble.com Shopping Cart and therefore will not be able to complete an order with us online. Also, by not using cookies, your overall Internet browsing experience will be affected. 

 If you would like to obtain more information about the third-party distributor of banners on the Barnes & Noble.com site and to know your choices about having such distributor's cookies turned off, please visit [www.privacychoices.org](http://www.privacychoices.org/). If you turn off the third-party distributor's cookies, you will still see banners on our site; however, the banners will not be tailored to your shopping experience.

  *  _Information Collected Using Pixel Tags or Clear GIFs_. To help us understand the effectiveness of certain of our email marketing efforts, Barnes & Noble.com may use "message format" and "message open" sensing technologies. Both technologies require the use of pixel tags or clear GIFs (also called web beacons). The "message format" sensing technology allows us to recognize whether you have enabled your email program to receive HTML emails; if so, this information is then associated with your email address so that subsequent messages can be sent to you in HTML format. The "message open" sensing technology allows us to recognize whether you have opened our email message. We can only detect this if you have enabled your email program to receive HTML emails.
  *  _Information You Actively Submit to Barnes & Noble.com_. For most of the browsing services we provide, we neither require nor collect "Personal Customer Information" -- your name, email address, billing address, shipping address(es), phone number and credit card information. You can browse the Barnes & Noble.com site and take as much time as you want to review our books and other products, services and reviews without having to submit such Personal Customer Information. Even when you use our shopping cart as you browse, there is no need to submit Personal Customer Information. 

 In the following instances, however, we do need you to actively submit Personal Customer Information: when you want to (i) create an account; (ii) complete an order; (iii) subscribe to our Keep Me Posted! Newsletters or Alerts, (iv) submit customer reviews or (v) participate in courses in our Barnes & Noble University. 

    * **Creating a Barnes & Noble.com Account.** You can create a password-protected Barnes & Noble.com account to complete an order or to save items in your Wish List. To create an account, we require that you provide us with the following Personal Customer Information: your email address (which may not be associated with another active Barnes & Noble.com account), and your first and last names. You will also have to create a password, select a security question and input a security answer. 
    * **Completing an Order.** If you have a Barnes & Noble.com account that you want to use to complete an order, we will require you to access that account. We will then use the Personal Customer Information stored in that account to complete the order, or require you to input additional Personal Customer Information such as payment information. If you want to complete an order without using a Barnes & Noble.com account, we will ask for certain Personal Customer Information to complete the order. [See "Placing an Order Without a Barnes & Noble.com Account"]
    * **Keep Me Posted! Newsletter and Alerts.** You may sign up for free email Keep Me Posted! Newsletters and Alerts filled with recommendations and reviews for books, music, movies, and more. To do so, you will need to supply your email address in the [Keep Me Posted! Preference Center](http://www.barnesandnoble.com/newsletters/newsletters_send.asp?z=y&cds2Pid=8104). Please note that this Keep Me Posted! Preference Center registry is different from the Barnes & Noble.com Account and password which you set up to make purchases. You can sign up for our Keep Me Posted! Notices whether or not you have a Barnes & Noble.com account. Furthermore, the contact information collected in the Keep Me Posted! Preference Center is only used to forward the Newsletters and Alerts you select. [See "Keep Me Posted! Communications" below].
    *  **Customer Reviews.** When you submit a _customer review_ , we ask you to disclose your email address in addition to your review and other optional information. You can choose not to have your email address displayed with your review. We only use the information you provide to us to chronicle your review; we do not use such information for marketing purposes. Because your email address at your election can be displayed with your reviews, we can make no assurance that others will not use the information you have provided.
    *  **Barnes & Noble University Submissions.** When you participate in a course in the Barnes & Noble University we have bulletin boards that ask you to disclose your email address in addition to your review and other optional information. We only use the information you provide to us to chronicle your submission; we do not use such information for marketing purposes.

Security Policy

1\. Protecting your information

  
  
The **Personal Customer Information** you provide -- including your credit card information -- to create and access an account with us and to make purchases from us (whether or not you use an account) is secured using industry standard e-commerce security technology such as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology. We use this SSL technology to prevent such information from being intercepted and read as it is transmitted over the Internet. The encrypted data goes to a secure site where your information is stored on restricted-access computers located at restricted-access sites.  
  


* * *

2\. Unique E-mail, Password & Security Answer for Barnes & Noble.com Account  
  
When you create a Barnes & Noble.com account, we secure your Personal Customer Information in the following manner: 

> We cross check an e-mail address with the submitted password to validate access to any Barnes & Noble.com customer account. 
> 
>  We do not allow any e-mail address to access more than one Barnes & Noble.com account. When a new Barnes & Noble.com account is created, we require you to submit an e-mail address that is not associated with an existing Barnes & Noble.com account. 
> 
>  We require you to select a security question and input a security answer which you can use to access your account in the event you forget your password. (Customers who created a Barnes & Noble.com account without selecting a security question and respective answer, are urged to do so by logging into your account and on the page headed " **Account Management Options** ", select "
> 
>  _Change Your Security Question/Answer_ " under " _Account Settings_ " and follow the instructions.) 

We encourage you to use a password and a security answer that is not easily determinable (e.g., don't use your name or street name). Keep your password and security answer secure; do not share it with anyone. The password and security answer are the "keys" to your account; anyone who gets these "keys" can, along with your e-mail address, gain access to your account. 

If you forget your password, to gain access to your account you will need to know your security answer and have access to your e-mail account. On the [Account Sign In Page](http://cart2.barnesandnoble.com/account/op.asp?step=mainStage&z=y&cds2Pid=8104&linkid=754777) click on the [Forgot your password?](http://cart2.barnesandnoble.com/account/op.asp?step=forgotPassword&z=y&cds2Pid=8104&linkid=754778) link and then type in the e-mail address of the account you would like to open. A message will be sent to your e-mail address with instructions on how to access your account and change your password. (If you have not yet selected a security question and submitted a security answer, you will be prompted to contact Customer Service for further assistance.)

If you want to change your password, security answer or other account information, simply log onto your account and follow the instructions on the page headed " **Account Management Options**."
