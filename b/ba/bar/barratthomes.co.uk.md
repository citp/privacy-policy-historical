We collect certain basic information about you when you visit our website. We recognise the importance both of keeping that information secure and of letting you know what we intend to do with that information.

We may amend our privacy statement to reflect changes to our business, website or to data protection legislation. We therefore ask you revisit this privacy statement on a regular basis to ensure you are familiar with its terms.

This privacy statement only applies to this website; if you follow a link out of our site or leave our site in some other way, this privacy statement will no longer apply.

The privacy statement sets out (1) who we are and describes (2) the information we collect (3) how we use your information (4) how you can find out more.

**(1) Who we are**  
We are Barratt Developments PLC, a Public Limited Company incorporated in England . Our company number is 00604574 and our registered office address is Barratt House, Forest Hill Business Park, Cartwright Way, Leicestershire, LE67 1UF. In these terms, we refer to ourselves as “we”, “us”, “our” and “Barratt”. The user of the website is referred to as “you” and “your”.

If you have any queries about the information we hold on you, please contact our Data Protection Compliance Officer, who you may write to at the address above.

We are entered in the Register of Data Controllers with registration number: Z541067X.

**(2) The information we collect**  
We collect information from you when you use our website. In addition to basic traffic data, we also use persistent cookies to provide insight on website activity. Please see our [Cookie Policy](https://web.archive.org/Footer/Cookie-policy/) for further details of cookies used on this website.

Through the analysis of anonymous statistical information, we can provide you with an enchanced website user experience.

**On-line forms**

We collect information you give us when you register for ‘My Area / My Barratt’, when requesting brochures, update requests and when requesting a call from one of our advisers to book an appointment. We require only the information we need to provide a service to you, such as your name, postal address, telephone number and email address. Where we would like more information to help us improve our services, over and above the basic required information, it will be clear that your response is voluntary and you are free not to provide us with more information if you would prefer not to do so.

**Traffic data**  
We keep a record of traffic data which is logged automatically by our ISP's servers, and which we analyse. This includes your IP address, the URL you visited before ours, the URL you visit after leaving our site and which pages you visit on our site. We do not store or analyse this traffic data in a way that identifies you as an individual.

**(3) What we do with your information**

**How we use your information**  
We use your information to provide you with the website and to contact you to provide information about our homes and schemes available from our other brands [David Wilson Homes and Ward Homes] that could help you move home. We may also contact you for market research purposes (to include regular polls) or to help improve customer service.

You may ask us to remove you from our email alert lists at any time by writing to our Data Protection Officer at the address above. We will also offer you the option of correcting your details and of being removed from future email alerts when we send you an email alert. You can ask to stop receiving emails by using the unsubscribe links contained within the acknowledgement emails when you register on the site, request updates, book an appointment or request a brochure. You can ask to stop receiving SMS messages from us by replying 'STOP' to any message you receive.

**When we share your information**  
We may disclose your information to third parties in certain circumstances but we will not sell, rent or trade your personal information.

We may share your information with another organisation that buys our company or our assets, or with another organisation from which we acquire a company or business, and in the course of any preceding negotiations with that organisation, which may or may not lead to a sale.

We may share your information with our funders or potential funders, such as our bank and with our professional advisors who have a reasonable need to see it.

We may share your information with any group companies of ours so that they can provide any products and services to you where you have personally requested them.

We may provide anonymous aggregated data to reputable third parties on a commercial basis.

Where relevant, we may give third party providers who supply services to us, or who process information on our behalf, incidental access to your information. Where doing so, we will always take steps to confirm that that their security measures are adequate to protect your information.

We may disclose your information to enforcement authorities if asked to do so, or to a third party in the context of actual or threatened legal proceedings or if otherwise required to do so by law.

**How we keep it secure**  
Only authorised personnel and contractors have access to your information.

We will keep your information secure by taking appropriate technical and organisational measures against its unauthorised or unlawful processing and against its accidental loss, destruction or damage.

**Transfers outside Europe**  
Data protection legislation is harmonised throughout the European Economic Area (‘EEA’) which comprises the EU member states, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. Countries outside the EEA do not generally have the same level of protection for personal information as those within the EEA.

If you are from outside the EEA, we will transfer that information to your home country or territory for the purposes set out in “How we use your information” above. If you provide us with your information, we will assume you agree to this transfer, unless you have purchased a property from us using the NewBuy Government scheme, in which case your data may be transferred to Guernsey or other country which is the subject of a finding of adequacy by the European Commission.

If you are from the EEA, we will not transfer any personal information we collect from you outside the EEA, unless you have purchased a property from us using the NewBuy Government scheme, in which case your data may be transferred to Guernsey or other country which is the subject of a finding of adequacy by the European Commission.

**(4) Finding out more**  
If you have any questions about our privacy statement or the information we hold about you, please contact our Data Protection Compliance Officer at the address above.

You have a legal right to see a copy of the information we hold about you on payment of a fee, which is currently £10.

Further information about data protection issues including the online Register of Data Controllers can be found at the Information Commissioner's website.
