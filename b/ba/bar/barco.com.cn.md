## When does this Privacy policy apply?

This Privacy policy applies to the processing of personal data obtained via the websites of Barco.

## Who is responsible for the processing of your personal data?

Barco is the party responsible for the processing of your personal data. This means that Barco determines for what purposes and with what means your personal data will be processed.

Barco has appointed a Data Protection Officer (DPO) who will be your point of contact for any questions or requests regarding the processing of your personal data. The contact details of the DPO can be found under point 9 of this Privacy policy.

## Which personal data do we process about you?

We collect your personal data in three ways:

### a. Information provided by you

We receive your information in the first place if you share it with us by:

  * contacting us via the contact form
  * filling in a form on our website
  * creating a “myBarco” account
  * requesting content or software (e.g. brochures or drivers)
  * signing up for email communications 
  * participating in a survey
  * ordering a product online
  * logging a ticket for technical questions (“eSupport”)
  * asking for service support
  * applying for our certified training program
  * registering our products (for remote connectivity)



In these cases, we usually receive information such as your first name, last name, e-mail address, telephone number, address details (street, number, postcode, city, country), the project or the region in which you are interested, your position, your correspondence with Barco, your partner types, your market and application segments and other personal and/ or contact details.

### b. Automatically obtained information

When you browse our website, we receive data from cookie providers about your activity on our website such as the time and duration of your visit, the hyperlinks that you clicked which brought you to our website and the hyperlinks on our website which link to other websites, your IP address, the pages you visit, the browser you use, geographical data such as your location and your preferred language. 

We do this by using cookies. More information on the use of cookies by Barco can be found in our [cookie policy](https://www.barco.com/about-barco/legal/cookie-policy). 

### c. Information obtained from third parties

Sometimes we also receive your information from affiliated companies or from professional data suppliers. 

If you are an end user of a Barco product, we may collect your data if a dealer provides your information in the context of promotions or business opportunities. 

## For what purposes do we process your personal data?

### a. In order to respond to your requests and keep you informed

We process your personal data when you request a brochure, order a product, ask to be kept informed of our activities, projects, offers, events, actions and so on.

For this purpose we may process data such as your name, your address, your e-mail address, your telephone number, your preferred language and the project or the region in which you are interested.

These data are processed on the basis of your unambiguous consent, the performance of a contract to which you are a party, or your request to take steps prior to entering into a contract. 

If you have previously sent us a request to receive a brochure or ordered a product, we will keep you informed about our products. All our emails contain an “unsubscribe” button. You can also contact our DPO at any time for more information (see point 9 of the Privacy Policy in connection with your right to object).

### b. In order to answer your questions and exchange information

If you ask us questions by telephone or e-mail, we will process your personal data in order to respond to your question.

For this purpose we may process data such as your name, your company name, your position, your e-mail address, your telephone number, your correspondence with Barco and all other personal data that you provide to us that can be relevant for answering your question.

These data are processed on the basis of your request to take steps prior to entering a contract, the performance of a contract to which you are a party, or Barco’s legitimate interest in informing you about its activities. 

### c. In order to set up and manage a myBarco account

We process personal data when you create a personal myBarco account. When you sign into your myBarco account, we create a record of your sign-in, which includes the date and time, your sign-in name and the unique number assigned to your account.

For this purpose we may process data such as your name, your e-mail address, your telephone number, your preferred language, your company name, your Barco contact, your partner types and your market and application segments.

For this purpose we may process data such as your IP address, the pages you visit, the browser you use, the websites you visited earlier, geographical data such as your location, your preferred language and the time and duration of your visit. 

These data are processed on the basis of your unambiguous consent or Barco’s legitimate interest in improving its websites and protecting itself against cyber-attacks.
