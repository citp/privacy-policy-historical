Additionally, several of our functions use cookies. A cookie is a small piece of information sent by a website that is saved on your hard drive by your computer’s browser. The cookie holds information a site may need to personalize/enhance your experience and to gather website statistical data, such as which pages are visited, the internet provider’s domain name and the addresses of the sites visited immediately before coming to and immediately after leaving www.barkingirons.com. However, none of this information is associated with you as an individual. It is measured anonymously and only in the aggregate. The information in the cookies lets Barking Irons Ltd., trace your “clickstream” activity (i.e., the paths taken by visitors to our site as they move from page to page) to enable us to better serve our customers by revealing which portions of our site are the most popular. Cookies contain absolutely no personal information. You may disable cookies on your browser. Please review your browser’s instructions for doing so.

#### YOUR SECURITY

Barking Irons Ltd., goes to great lengths to keep your financial information private and safe. We use Secure Socket Layers (SSL), the industry standard in transferring information to process your orders. The SSL encrypts, or translates, your order information into highly indecipherable code, which is processed immediately. All credit card transactions occur in a secure area of our site, to protect you from any loss, misuse or alteration of information collected. When you have finished shopping and begin the checkout process, you will move into the secure area of our site. Once you’ve entered, the page address (URL) will change from http to https, to let you know you are in a secure area. Also, a key or a closed lock will appear in the lower right hand corner of your screen to notify you of this change. You will remain in the secure zone for the entire checkout process. You acknowledge, however, that no transmission of data over the internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, despite our best efforts. Thus, while we will use every means possible to ensure the security of information you transmit to us, we cannot guarantee that such information will not be intercepted by third parties.

#### SPOOFING AND PHISHING

A common internet scam is known as spoofing or phishing. This occurs when you receive and email from what appears to be a legitimate source requesting personal information from you. Please be aware that Barking Irons Ltd., will never send you an email requesting you to verify credit card information, bank information, or any other personal information. If you ever receive and email that appears to be from us requesting such information from you, please DO NOT respond to it, and DO NOT click on any links appearing in the email.
