    		<p class="marginLarge">BarebackBastards allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the BarebackBastards Sites. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the BarebackBastards Sites.

    		<p class="marginLarge">You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks. BarebackBastards's privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites.</p>
