**This policy was last updated on 2 August 2017.**

The Barbican (we) are committed to upholding your privacy and taking care with the personal information that you may volunteer as part of ticket bookings, online purchases, membership or donation forms, e-newsletter or event sign-ups and visitor surveys.

The personal information we collect, process or use is treated securely and in accordance with our privacy policy (described below) the Data Protection Act 1998, and the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003.

Whenever you give us personal information, you are consenting to its collection and use in accordance with this policy, including our use of cookies (as explained below).

**What personal information do we collect and process?**

You will be asked for personal information when you register, join as a member, make an enquiry, make a donation, sign up for a learning activity, or order products and services from us.

**When you buy from us**

We will retain your name, contact details and contact preferences when you make a purchase from our box office or otherwise buy products from us. We will keep a record of your bank or credit card details used to make the purchase, but only temporarily and solely to process your transaction.

**When you make a donation, join as a member, or otherwise provide us with your information**

We will record details when you sign up to our mailing list, become a member or make a donation. Where you make a donation, we will keep a record of the details of the gift (amount, date, purpose) and your Gift Aid status. We may also ask you to provide details about your current interests and activities, and the details of your family and spouse/partner details where appropriate.

**When you provide us information in relation to an event that you are attending with us, we may ask you about your access requirements and dietary preferences**

As part of your participation in some of our programmes we may use your data differently than is set out in this policy. 

**When you use our website**

We log your Internet Protocol (IP) address, in order to receive and send information from and to you over the internet. Our website also uses cookies to enable online transactions, understand how people use our website and inform our digital advertising.  

Whenever we ask you to provide your personal information we will let you know why we are asking, and how we will use your information, by directing you towards this notice.

**What information we collect about you and from other sources**

We may combine the information above which you provide to us with the information we collect about you from external sources in order to gain a better understanding of our audiences, members, learning participants and supporters and to improve our membership and fundraising methods, learning programmes, or other products and services. The personal information we collect from you or public sources may (depending on the purpose for which you initially provide us with your information) include:

  * ticket purchases (and other online retail purchases from us) and event registration/attendance
  * details of correspondence we send to you, or we receive from you;
  * education, employment and professional information and activities; 
  * information relating to charitable interests and activities, as well as inclination and capacity to support the Barbican Centre Trust a registered charity;
  * where not otherwise available, the information listed in the "personal information we collect and process" section above.



**Sensitive Information**

Some of the information which we collect from you (for example where you apply to take part in one of our projects) may constitute sensitive personal data. We will only ever use this in accordance with this policy and shall maintain necessary measures to protect this information and its confidentiality.

**What we use your information for**

Depending on the preferences you have indicated and your relationship with the Barbican Centre, we will use the personal information you have provided to:

  * provide goods and services to you or your organisation or process donations that you make to us
  * send you communications by post, telephone or electronic means in order to inform you of other products, services or events related to the Barbican, which may include emails containing relevant news or competitions from our sponsors
  * ask you to participate in surveys and market research
  * conduct fundraising activities and ensure our fundraising resources are used in the most effective and efficient manner and that any communications we may send are appropriate and of interest to you.
  * improve our understanding of our audience through basic profiling, tracking of your activity on our site and your response to emails (or other communications) that we send you
  * notify you of changes and improvements to events, services, website and this privacy policy.



You can opt out of any or all of the above communications at any time simply by selecting "unsubscribe" at the bottom of any email communication, or by contacting [tickets@barbican.org.uk](mailto:tickets@barbican.org.uk). Alternatively you change your preferences at any time by changing the relevant settings in the "My Account" section of our website.

**Building an understanding of audiences, members and supporters and improving communications**

We use various techniques including market research and audience profiling techniques to help us understand our audiences, customers, members, donors and potential supporters. This includes gathering information from you as well as publicly available resources to give an insight into your interests and inclination to attend the Barbican more frequently, join as a member, or make a donation to support the Barbican.

We do this because it allows us to understand our audience members and the people who support us, and helps us to send appropriate communications and make appropriate requests to those who may be able and interested in attending or giving more than they already do. 

When building a profile we may analyse geographic, demographic and other information relating to you in order to better understand your interests and preferences in order to contact you with the most relevant communications. 

**Opting into and out of marketing and other fundraising communications**

With your consent, we will contact you to let you know about upcoming events, offers from our shop and restaurants, updates on our plans and progress we are making, and to ask you to join as a member, make a donation or give other types of support.  Occasionally, we may include information from our partner organisations or organisations who support us in these communications.

We make it easy for you to tell us how you want us to communicate, in a way that suits you. Our forms have clear marketing preference questions and we include information on how to opt out when we send you marketing. If you don’t want to hear from us, that’s fine.  Just let us know when you provide us with your information, change your preferences at any time by changing the relevant settings in the "My Account" section of our website or contact tickets@barbican.org.uk.

**Who we might share your personal information with**

Your personal information might be passed to a third party if they need it to fulfil your order(s) for our goods and services, to execute the communications we send to you, to process a donation, or where you have otherwise consented to being contacted by selected third parties, such as artistic partners and associates. We do comprehensive checks on these companies before we work with them, and put a contract in place that sets out our expectations and requirements, especially regarding how they manage the personal information they have collected or have access to.

Examples of these third parties include our bank (in order to process Direct Debit and other payments), mailing houses (for distributing our events guides), our bulk email distribution service provider, and audience analyses and data cleansing suppliers, for example to access the Post Office National Change of Address (NCOA) database.

Except as set out in this policy, we shall not disclose your personal information unless obliged to, or allowed to do so by law, or where we need to in order to run our business (e.g. where other people process information for us). In such circumstances, we ask those people to give us confidentiality or non-disclosure undertakings.

We may also share your personal information with the Barbican Centre Trust, a registered charity, for the purposes of processing and administering any donations or gifts that you make, processing claims for Gift Aid. The Barbican Centre Trust may then update you on the impact of your donation, send you event invitations, and send other relevant communications based on your relationship with us and the Trust.

We will not share your information other than as described above without your express consent.

**How do we keep your personal information safe?**

We ensure that there are appropriate technical controls in place to protect your personal details.  The personal information that you provide will be held securely and will not be used for any other purpose than as provided for in this policy. We ensure that there are appropriate technical controls in place to protect your personal information; for example, any information which we transfer is encrypted and password protected, and all of our staff receive data protection and security training.

Some of our suppliers run their operations outside the European Economic Area (EEA).  Although they may not be subject to same data protection laws as companies based in the UK, we will take steps to make sure they provide an adequate level of protection in accordance with UK data protection law. By submitting your personal information to us you agree to this transfer, storing or processing at a location outside the EEA (including in the United States).

Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your information transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.

**How do we keep your information up to date?**

We endeavour to keep your personal information accurate and up to date. If you become aware of errors or inaccuracies, please email tickets@barbican.org.uk or update the information we hold about you by using the ["My Account" section of our website].

Where possible we use publicly available sources to keep your records up to date; for example, the Post Office National Change of Address (NCOA) database and information provided to us by other organisations as described in this policy.

We would really appreciate it if you could let us know if your contact details change.

How can you access the information we hold about you?

You have the right to know what personal information we hold about you, and request to receive a copy of that information. Any access request will be subject to a fee of £10 to meet our costs in providing you with details of the information we hold about you.

**Creative Learning**

Where we are working with you individually, or over a sustained period of time, for example in one of our Creative Learning projects, we may need to collect additional information from you including, for example, medical details, educational attainment, details of prior artistic experience and details of any learning difficulties or special access requirement. This information will be used by our project team in order to plan and deliver the very best artistic and educational experiences for you, to keep participants safe throughout their experience with us, and may be passed to emergency services for use should any emergency situation arise.

  We will always seek your consent for the above at the time we collecting your information, and, where we need to collect this information in respect of children or young people we will ask parents or guardians to provide the information and consent to its use for the purposes described.

**Other artistic organisations**

Many of the events at the Barbican are presented in partnership with other organisations such as the London Symphony Orchestra, our Resident Orchestra, and other artistic organisations and promoters. If you select ‘Keep me up to date with news from the artists, companies or producers whose events I’ve booked’ [in your account settings], we will tell the relevant organisations that you would like to hear from them, and we will let them know about your booking. This means that we will give them your name and contact details and that they may contact you again to re-affirm your consent to receive communications directly from them. We will not share sensitive information or your payment details.

We sell tickets on behalf of the London Symphony Orchestra (LSO) and we share our customer relationship database with them. If you buy a ticket from barbican.org.uk for an LSO performance, your name, contact details and a record of the tickets you have bought will be visible to the LSO. The LSO will use your data for customer services and analysis and, if you select the option under ‘Keep me up to date with news and offers from the Barbican and the London Symphony Orchestra’ [when making a booking], the LSO may also contact you for marketing purposes.]
