# Bartercard International - World News

Bartercard understands how important your personal information is to you. We have adopted the National Privacy Principles contained in the Privacy Act (Cth) 1988 as part of our standard operating procedures for the protection of your personal information.

This policy explains how we collect personal information and how we maintain, use and disclose that information. 

**Personal Information**

Personal information means information or an opinion about you from which your identity is apparent or can reasonably be ascertained. This is whether the information or opinion is true or not and whether it is recorded in a material form or not.

**Collection of your Personal Information**

We will only collect personal information from you that is necessary for us to be able to provide our services to you. We will seek to ensure that we do not collect information from you in any way that is unlawful or unreasonably intrusive. Whenever it is reasonable and practicable to do so, we will collect that information directly from you. If we have to collect personal information about you from someone else, we will take reasonable steps to ensure that you are aware of that fact.

We do not collect information about your political, philosophical, or religious beliefs or sexual preferences. 

If you do not provide us with the personal information we request, we may not be able to provide you with our services.

Use of your Personal Information Your personal information will be used:

  *  to provide our services;
  *  to enhance our customer service;
  *  to answer your queries;
  *  for client research;
  *  to facilitate trade transactions.



We will not use your personal information for purposes unrelated to our products and services. We will not sell or trade your personal information.

We may use your personal information for direct marketing purposes to advise you of special offers, items which may be of interest to you and exclusive opportunities relating to our services. If at any time you do not wish to receive our marketing communications, then please tell us. You can do this by selecting the opt-out option in the marketing communication or by contacting our marketing department at

Disclosure of your Personal Information We will only disclose information about you if required or permitted by law, if we have your consent, or to detect and prevent fraud or other criminal activities. Your personal information may be disclosed to other related companies or to third parties required to assist us in providing services to you, including Bartercardd franchisees (Brokers). Only so much of your information as is required to enable these organisations to provide their services is disclosed. These organisations are bound by confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements and the information at all times remains the property of Bartercard. Your personal information may be disclosed to other Bartercard members to facilitate and encourage trade transactions. Accuracy of Personal Information

We try to ensure that the personal information held by us about you is accurate, complete and up to date. To assist us, we ask that you notify us promptly if there are any changes to your personal information. You may ask us to correct any inaccurate information we hold about you and we will address your concerns within a reasonable period. 

**Data Security**

We will take reasonable steps to protect your personal information from misuse and loss and from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. For example, personal information stored electronically requires login and passwords for access and is only utilised by staff whose job requires access. Your personal information where not stored electronically, is stored in our secure office premises with restricted access. If we no longer require the use of your personal information, we will take reasonable steps to destroy or permanently de-identify it.

**Access to Personal Information**

We will provide you with access to your personal information upon request. We will endeavour to provide the information to you in a timely manner. You may be charged a fee for servicing your request which we will advise you at the time. There is no fee for lodging a request for access.

There may be circumstances in which we cannot provide you with access; for example, where it is required or authorised under the law, would have an unreasonable impact upon the privacy of other individuals or the request for access is frivolous or vexatious. We will advise you of the reasons if we deny you access.

**Cookies**

In order to provide better customer service and to enhance our relationship with our members, Bartercard collects statistical information on website activity such as the number of users who visit Bartercard's website, the date and time of visits, the number of pages viewed, time spent on website, navigation patterns and origin of the user. In common with most websites, we use "cookies". A cookie allows us to identify and more effectively interact with your computer. A cookie does not identify the individual user although they do identify the user's browser type and Internet service provider. You may be able to configure your browser so that it does not receive cookies but in doing so some of the functionality of Bartercard's website may be lost.

**Consent**

By continuing to use your Bartercard account you consent to Bartercard maintaining, using and disclosing your personal information in accordance with this policy.

**Complaints Resolution**

We will try to answer any question and address any complaint you have about the information we hold about you, or about our information-handling practices. You may contact us at the following address:

The Privacy Officer  
Bartercard Australia Pty Ltd  
PO Box 582

If we are unable to resolve your request, you may refer the complaint to the Federal Privacy Commissioner. We will provide you with the Commissioner's contact details if required.
