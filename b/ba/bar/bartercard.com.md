We collect information about you that we reasonably need for our business functions and activities and which is required by law. Our business functions and activities include:

• Providing you with Bartercard Australia products and services – these are described generally on our website,  our corporate brochures, advertising, and our letter and emails and communications to customers and members  
• activities in support of those functions including administration, management, marketing, online and mobile marketing, IT, legal, security, customer support (including the Bartercard Australia Customer Support  Centre), finance (including credit control) and human resources  
• activities we plan for the future including new ways of communicating, new products and services, new business models and new businesses

Generally we collect the following personal information about you:

• your name  
• your contact details including residential or business address, telephone number and email address  
• date of birth  
• financial information such as bank account and credit card details, employment details and information about your credit worthiness and credit history

  
We may combine your contact details above with other information about you, for example:

• we collect details related to your Bartercard transactions including products and services, retailer (or service provider), Bartercard franchisee (if applicable), payment details and other details;  
• if your business or employer supplies us or Bartercard members with products or services, or if your business or employer distributes, sells or services our products, we collect information about your trading with us (for example the products you buy or sell or the services you provide), your trading history and account history  
• if you apply for a position with us, we collect information to help us decide your application, including your date of birth, tax-file number, work history and similar details  
• if you request information from us (for example about a product or service or a franchise) or register a complaint, we collect information about your request or complaint  
• if you enter a promotion or competition, visit us at an event or enquire about Bartercard, we may collect your contact details so that we can follow up on your enquiry or interest by sending you marketing material.

We record this information (personal information) in our database whilst we deal with you. We will remove this information from our database when we have no further need to keep a record of it, except if we are required to keep it by law (for example, for tax or for superannuation purposes).

**3.  How we collect information about you**

_**How do we collect personal information?**_  
We collect personal information directly from you. We may record your contact details when you call our Customer Support Centre, when you fill out an application form, when you purchase a product or service using Bartercard, when you participate in a trade transaction, when you provide your contact details via web, mobile or email or when you ask us for information or request something from us.

Sometimes we collect personal information about you from another person or business, or from a publicly available source. For example:

• A retailer or franchisee may give us your details in relation to a product or service;  
• if you are an employee of one of our business partners (e.g. a franchisee, supplier, repairer or contractor), we may be given your name and contact details by your employer  
• if you enter a networking event, promotion or competition organised by us, we may be given your name and contact details by the promoter of the event  
• our service providers may provide us with your personal information from websites, social media sites, mobile, and other technology based sources  
•  credit reporting bodies  may provide us with information if we request a credit history

We use lawful and fair means to collect your information. We will collect personal information about you from another person or from a publicly available source only if it is unreasonable or impracticable to collect it directly from you, and we will take reasonable steps to inform you that we have collected your personal information. Those reasonable steps may include informing you through this statement.

_**Unsolicited information**_  
If we receive personal information about you that we have not requested, and if we determine that we could not have lawfully collected that information under privacy law if we had requested it, we will destroy or de-identify the information, if it is lawful and reasonable to do so.

  
**4.  Do I have to provide you with my personal information?**

You can deal with us anonymously (without giving us your name and contact details) or by using a pseudonym (a name that does not include your real name, for example an email address or a user name that you use in an online forum (nickname)).

If you choose to deal with us anonymously or using a nickname, we can give you general information about our products and services, and you may be able to participate in any online forum we provide, but there are some things we cannot do, for example:

If you do not give us your personal information we cannot give you information about transactions you may have made using Bartercard, the status and balance of your account, other Bartercard members or deal with a complaint you may have, provide you with a service or deliver a product to you at an address. You cannot attend one of our networking events, or enter into one of our promotions anonymously or using a nickname

You can deal with us using a nickname together with your real name and contact details. If you choose to deal with us in this way, we may collect your personal information together with your nickname. When you identify yourself to us using your nickname only, we can deal with you only as described above. We may ask you to provide proof of your identity if you use a nickname.

**5.  Why we collect personal information about you (purpose of collection)**

  We collect and record personal information about you so that we can carry out our functions and activities described above. The primary purposes for which we collect your personal information include:  
• so that we can provide our services to you and to our franchisees and suppliers  
• so that we can administer our dealings with you, to provide you with information and to respond to any requests that you may have (for example, so that we can administer your account, provide you with marketing and sales opportunities or introduce you to other members)  
• so that we can function as a business, for example, we may collect your personal information for research, marketing or so that we can offer new products, reconcile transactions, or if you are a supplier so that we can record your dealings with us  
• so that we can facilitate trade transactions  
• so that we can comply with agreements we have entered into with our suppliers, franchisees and licensors

We also collect your personal information for certain secondary purposes that are related to the primary purposes outlined above. Secondary purposes may include so that we can run our business efficiently, for example, our advisors can provide us with customer research, or so that we can use technology to automate our business and to understand how our business is performing, to allow us to operate efficiently and to lower costs by outsourcing services (such as collecting or paying money). Other secondary purposes may include so that we can sell or transfer our business or merge with another business and the sale and transfer of franchises.
