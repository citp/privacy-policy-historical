### Credit Reference Agencies and Fraud Prevention Agencies

If false or inaccurate information is provided to us and fraud is identified, details may be passed to credit reference and fraud prevention agencies to prevent fraud and money laundering and to verify your identity.

The Credit Reference Agency Information Notice (CRAIN) describes how the three main credit reference agencies in the UK each use and share personal data. The CRAIN is available on the credit reference agencies’ websites:

  * [www.callcredit.co.uk/crain](https://www.callcredit.co.uk/crain "View CRAIN information on Callcredit website, opens in a new window, third party site")
