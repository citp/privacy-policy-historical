## BAREWEB PRIVACY POLICY

BareWeb has developed this privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) which details important information regarding the use and disclosure of user information collected on BareWeb owned or controlled websites, mobile sites and applications, and related services, communications and tools that link to this Privacy Policy, and when you interact offline with BareWeb regarding those sites, applications and related services and tools (collectively referred to as the "Services"). BareWeb provides this Privacy Policy to help you make an informed decision about whether to use or continue to use the Services and the choices we offer for you to manage the information we collect related to the use of the Services. Each time that you access or use the Services, you are agreeing to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy or Terms of Service (“Terms”), which are incorporated into this Privacy Policy by reference and govern your use of our Services, please discontinue accessing or using the Services.

## 1\. INFORMATION WE COLLECT.

### Information Collected Directly From You.

You can browse our Services without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information. If you create an account, contact us or purchase any of our Services, you are choosing to give us your personal information, including but not limited to your name, email address, phone number, mobile telephone number, or physical contact information about yourself. When you create an account, or use certain of our Services you may provide certain additional personal information such as username and e-mail address. You may also provide payment information such as credit or debit card information, name and billing address to purchase our products and services. 

### Information Imported from Social Networks. 

We will collect information when you interact with our Services through third party social networking services (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Google +) (each and collectively, a "Social Network"). You may also have the option to consent to connecting your activity on our Services with your Social Network information and activity. If you permit a connection, we and that Social Network may be able to identify you and associate information received pursuant to the connection with information we already have about you. Please review the Social Network’s privacy policy and choices for sharing information of any Social Network connected to our Services.

### Surveys and Promotions. 

From time-to-time we may request information from you and other users via surveys, or contests, sweepstakes or other promotions. Participation is completely voluntary. Information collected may be used as set forth in this Privacy Policy and as set forth in the applicable terms or official rules, including without limitation to notify the winners and award prizes, and file winners’ information as required by law. Survey information will be used for the purposes of the survey.

### Information You Post/Social Networks. 

The Services are designed to enable you to communicate with others and any information or content you post when participating with the Services and Social Networks, plug ins or other applications becomes public information, depending upon your privacy settings, and is subject to redistribution by BareWeb and other third parties. There is no expectation of privacy when posting content or otherwise participating in such interactive forums and we have no control over how those users may use the information you make public. Therefore, you should exercise caution and discretion when deciding to disclose your personal information in a submission or posting. 

### Mobile Devices. 

We may collect additional information from you if you access our Services through a mobile device; for example, your unique device identifier, device’s operating system, mobile carrier and location, and geo-location (but solely for anti-fraud or other internal, non-marketing purposes). The degree to which your location can be identified depends on the device you are using, e.g. laptop, smartphone, tablet or other access device (each a “Device”) and how you are connected to the internet (e.g. via cable broadband connection, WiFi, etc.). 

### Information about Others/Inviting Friends. 

From time to time you may choose to submit personal information about other people to invite them to join a Service. Inviting friends is always optional. Please be aware that when you use any send-to-a-friend functionality on the Services, your e-mail address may be included in the communication sent to your friend.

## 2\. INFORMATION COLLECTED THROUGH TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES.

### Tracking Technologies. 

In addition to any information that you choose to submit to us, we and our business partners may use a variety of tracking technologies such as cookies, flash cookies, web beacons/GIFs, HTML5, embedded scripts, e-tags/cache browsers/web logs ("Tracking Technologies"), that automatically (or passively) collect certain information from your Device whenever you visit or interact with the Services or third party websites. This information may include your Device identifier, the type and version of Internet browser software you use, and your operating system. We may also collect password information from you when you log in, as well as computer and connection information. During some visits, we may use these tools to measure and collect session information, including page response times, download errors, time spent on certain pages and page interaction information. Certain features of our Services are only available through the use of Tracking Technologies. You may encounter tracking technologies/cookies from our third party service providers that we have allowed on our Services who assist us with various aspects of our operations and Services. We use Google to serve first party cookies (such as Google Analytics cookie) to report how our ad impressions, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to visits to the Services. To learn about Google Analytics’ current available opt-outs for the web, click [here](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout). To learn more about how Google uses cookies in interest based advertising, you can visit the Google ad and content network privacy policy located [here](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/). You can opt-out of receiving interest based Google ads, or customize the ads Google shows you by clicking [here](https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en). You can opt-out and find out more information about other third party analytics providers and their practices and your choices for data collection by clicking [here](https://web.archive.org/thirdpartyproviders.aspx). Please be aware that if you choose to block certain cookies, you may not be able to sign in or use those cookie dependent features, and preferences that are dependent on cookies may be lost. Tracking Technologies are used for a variety of purposes, including the following:

#### Operationally Necessary.

We may use Tracking Technologies for system administration, to prevent fraudulent activity, to improve security or to allow you to make use of our Services.

#### Operationally Necessary.

We may use Tracking Technologies to assess the performance of our Services, including as part of our analytic practices to improve content offered through the Services.

#### Functionality Related. 

We may use Tracking Technologies to tell us, for example, whether you have visited the Services before or if you are a new visitor and to help us identify the features in which you may have the greatest interest.

#### Targeting Related. 

We may use Tracking Technologies to deliver content, including ads, relevant to your interests on the Services and third party sites based on how you interact with our advertisements or content, as well as to track the content you access.




### Location and Geo-location Functionality. 

Information gathered from your use of the Services may be combined with information from third-party sources to identify your location by state and region (“Regional Location”). If you enable location services for our Services, we may collect regional location data periodically as you use or leave open our Services. For most mobile Devices, you are able to withdraw your permission for us to acquire geo-location (which we do not use for marketing purposes) through the Device settings. If you have questions about how to disable your mobile Device's geo-location services, we recommend you contact your mobile Device service provider or the Device manufacturer.

## 3\. TARGETED ADVERTISING. 

### Interest Based Advertising. 

We may use Tracking Technologies to collect information about your visits over time and across the Services and other third party web sites, as well as information received from other sources, in order to serve more targeted advertising to you. To serve our ads, we use a variety of third party advertising service providers, including networks, data exchanges, ad servers, analytics providers and others. These third parties may use Tracking Technologies to send directly to your Device the advertisements and links that appear on the Services. They automatically receive your Device identifier when this happens. Their tools may also limit the number of times you see the same ad and help measure the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns. These third parties may also use information gathered from your use of the Services to serve targeted, interest based advertisements to you on third party websites and applications. Some of the advertising service providers may be members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offers a single location to opt-out of ad targeting from member companies. If you opt-out of receiving targeted ads in this manner, you will continue to receive advertising messages, but they will not be customized to you based on your use of the Services and third party websites. If you would like more information about advertisers’ use of tracking technologies and about your option not to accept them, you can go to [ www.networkadvertising.org](http://www.networkadvertising.org/). To learn more about how interest-based information is collected, whether the companies we use are part of an industry network regarding behavioral advertising, or to know your choices about not having information used in this manner, you can go to [www.aboutads.info](http://www.aboutads.info/). Some newer mobile device operating systems allow you to limit the use of information to deliver interest-based advertising in mobile applications. You can check the settings on your device for such options in your devices’ operating system. Alternatively, you may wish to download the TrustE mobile application and/or the Digital Alliance “App Choices” mobile application and follow the instructions provided. 

Please note that the opt-out is cookie-based and will only affect the specific computer or mobile application, and browser or operating system, on which the opt-out is applied. You can also accept or decline cookies through your browser settings. To learn more, please look at the cookie settings available in your specific web browser(s). 

### Cross Device Tracking. 

To better understand your purchasing preferences, we may use third party vendors (such as Coremetrics) that provide tracking tools that recognize and collect Usage Information and information about your Devices that you may use to connect with our Services and the Internet. When these tools are enabled, the data that we and our third party service providers collect about these Devices is used to enable delivery of product recommendations, advertising or other promotional materials across Devices to deliver more relevant information to you, or to measure the effectiveness of our Services and advertising. When you visit this website on a specific Device, a unique ID is created for that Device which allows us and our third party vendors to deliver relevant product recommendations, personalized content and advertising based on your interests gathered across multiple sites. This data may be combined with the same information from another browser or Device if you use multiple browsers or Devices. You may opt-out of this tracking information collection for use in serving interest based ads by [clicking here](http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/). Please note this does not opt you out of being served ads. This opt-out applies to the specific Device/browser combination on which you are browsing. To opt-out of other Device/browser combinations you will need to opt-out of those as well. You will continue to receive generic ads.

### Browser “Do Not Track” Signals. 

Some third party browsers provide “do not track” machine readable signals for websites, which are automatically applied by default and therefore do not necessarily reflect our visitors’ choice as to whether they wish to receive advertisements tailored to their interests. As a result, we do not respond to these signals.

## 4\. HOW WE USE AND SHARE YOUR INFORMATION.
