# Privacy Policy - barre3

Last modified: March 14, 2010

At B3 Studios we recognize that privacy is important and we are committed to protecting your privacy rights (“Policy”). We use the information we collect about you to process orders, to improve the content of the Website and to provide a more personalized experience. We may also use it to periodically inform you about changes on our Website and new products and services. We do not sell, trade or rent your personal information to others. This Policy applies to all of the products, services and websites offered by B3 Studios, LLC (the “Website” or “B3 Studios”), any B3 Studios software that you have embedded on a website or are about to embed (“B3 Studios Widgets”), any applications created by B3 Studios and available through social networking sites (“B3 Studios Apps”) or its subsidiaries or affiliated companies (collectively, B3 Studios’s “Service”).

If you have any questions about this Policy, please feel free to [contact us](mailto:chris@barre3.com).

By using the Service, you consent to the collection and use of your personal information as outlined in this Policy. As this Policy may be amended from time to time, you should visit this page periodically to review any changes to the Policy.

In addition to information about yourself, you may submit other content (“Content”). To protect your privacy, the Service allows you to mark your Content as “Private”, in which event it can only be seen by you and people with whom the unique URL of your Content has been shared, or in accordance with the terms applicable to social networking sites on which you include Content through B3 Studios Apps. However, B3 Studios has no responsibility for how people you allow to view your Content (or the public if you make any information available to the public) use that material, or to whom they may forward it. Moreover, if you “embed” a B3 Studios Widget on another web page or share Content through a B3 Studios App, it will be visible to the public in accordance with the policies of that web page, regardless of whether you have restricted access to that Content on B3 Studios.

When you install a B3 Studios App on your social network page or use a B3 Studios App on someone else’s page, we may record information regarding the use of that B3 Studios App, and we may collect other information that is visible on your social network page in accordance with the relevant terms of use associated with that page. When you invite new members into your network or send messages through the B3 Studios Service, we collect and maintain on secure servers the information associated with those messages, including email addresses and content.

Finally, in order to provide the best possible service and to allow us to make certain internal reports and make recommendations, we collect aggregate information about the use of the Service, including information about users accessing the Website or viewing B3 Studios Widgets or using B3 Studios Apps on other sites, such as internet protocol addresses, browser type, browser language, referring / exit pages and URLs, other browser history, platform type, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, and the date and time (“Activity Information”).

By using the Service, you consent to our retaining all the above-described information in anonymous form indefinitely.

### INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT

**Information You Provide**  \- When you sign up for a B3 Studios account we ask you for personal information (such as your name, e-mail address and an account password and may require your date of birth, gender and zip code). After your 15 day free trial period, we also request credit card or other payment account information which we maintain in encrypted form on secure servers. We may combine the information you submit under your account with information from other B3 Studios services or third parties in order to provide you with a better experience and to improve the quality of our services. For certain services, we may give you the opportunity to opt out of combining such information.

We make your profile available to other users according to the privacy settings you set for yourself as part of your profile. Your user name will be identified to us and to any recipient of messages you send through the Service.

We also use your name, e-mail address and other information on our system to notify you of new product releases, service notifications, and to solicit your feedback and input. In the event that we decide to allow you to submit other information about yourself, the availability of that information to other users will also be controlled by privacy settings you will set for yourself. In the event that you make your B3 Studios Widgets publicly available, or “embed” them on another publicly available web site (such as a social networking site), we may include links to those shows or web sites or otherwise identify them in our marketing materials as places where B3 Studios Widgets that may interest other users can be found.
