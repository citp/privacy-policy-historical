**Use of social plugins from Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Google+**

Social plugins are integrated on the website of Basler AG. These plugins enable the visitors of Basler websites to recommend the page contents via social media services such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Google+. 

The social plugins deployed on the Basler website follow the so-called 2-click principle in which users' data may only be transmitted to social media services after the agreement of the user.   
The social plugins on the Basler website are deactivated by default and have no contact with the servers from Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Google+. The plugins are only made active and establish a connection to the social media services after the user has activated the social plugin with a click and thereby declared agreement to communication with Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Google+. The user may then transmit the recommendation with a second click. The click on the button of the social plugin thus means that the user has given consent to transmit data to the respective operator of the social media service.  
Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Google+ do not provide specific information about which data is transmitted in the use of their social plugins. Basler AG therefore has no knowledge regarding the content and scope of the transmitted data or its use by Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Google+. Please refer to the further information about this in the data protection regulations of the social media services which are found here:   
[Facebook](https://en-gb.facebook.com/about/privacy/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/privacy?lang=en), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy) and [Google+](http://www.google.de/intl/en/policies/privacy/).

By using the gear symbol within the social plugin bar on the Basler website you may permanently activate the social plugins. After permanently activating a social plugin, only one click is required to further recommend the page contents. Please note that if you do decide to permanently activate the social plugins, data is transmitted to the corresponding social media service immediately upon calling up the page.

**Your rights as the user**

According to § 34 and § 35 of the German Federal Data Protection Law, as the user you ("affected person") have the right to demand information at any time about which data has been saved by us and for what reason this has been saved. You may furthermore report incorrect data or have such data deleted which is invalidly stored or no longer required.  
 **  
Data protection requests**

Our external operational data protection officer is responsible for the compliance and monitoring of our data protection obligations. He is also available to you for further information at any time regarding data protection.
