# Baseball Express - Privacy Policy - (800) WE-PITCH

**BASEBALL EXPRESS PRIVACY POLICY:**

Baseball Express takes your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy. 

**What this Privacy Policy Covers**. 

This Privacy Policy covers Baseball Express' treatment of personally identifiable information you enter into our baseballexpress.com site and when you use Baseball Express’ services. Be assured that your registration information is handled confidentially and privately and we will protect this information. 

**Links.**

This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by our Web site.

**Information we store on your computer.**

In order to customize baseballexpress.com to your needs and offer you personalized services, we use "cookies". A cookie is a small piece of data that most browsers accept and store on your computer's hard drive. We use cookies solely to let us know when you are visiting our site and to remember your past visits. Browsers are designed so that we cannot look at other sites' cookies and they cannot look at ours. If you configure your browser to not accept cookies, you can still visit baseballexpress.com and place orders online, but some of our helpful site enhancements may not work for you. 

**Web Site Security.**

All orders submitted through baseballexpress.com are **completely secure**. Credit card information that you provide during the checkout process is encrypted using the latest 128 bit SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) technology. This protection means it may actually be safer for you to use your credit card over the Internet rather than using it in a store where your card number appears on multiple hard copies and receipts. When your browser is in secure mode, you will see an unbroken key or padlock icon near the bottom of your browser window. 

**Changes to this Privacy Policy.**

Baseball Express may amend this policy from time to time. If we make any substantial changes in the way we use your personal information we will notify you by posting a prominent announcement on our pages. 

**What you can do.**

If you feel that this site is not following its stated privacy policy please [contact us](http://www.baseballexpress.com/cust_serv.html) immediately. You may also contact The Direct Marketing Association’s Committee on Ethical Business Practices at [mgoldberger@the-dma.org](mailto:mgoldberger@the-dma.org), state or local chapters of the Better Business Bureau, state or local consumer protection office, The Federal Trade Commission by phone at 202.FTC-HELP (202.382.4357) or electronically at  www.ftc.gov/ftc/complaint.htm.
