We encrypt your credit card number, ordering and shipping information and other personal information, including your favorite flavor, through our industry-standard security software. Please read on for more details about our Privacy Policy. 

Baskin-Robbins reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time. Be sure to check this page periodically for updates. This policy applies only to personal information collected online at BaskinRobbins.com and does not apply to information collected offline by Baskin-Robbins. 

###

This information will be used to create new flavors and treats, plus improve the overall experience on BaskinRobbins.com. 

Franchise Applications. If you choose, you may submit an electronic application seeking consideration as a prospective franchisee via the Franchise Opportunity Web site. If you submit an electronic application, we will collect your name, date of birth, social security number, address, email address, other contact information and certain financial and employment information that you must enter on the form. By submitting this information, you agree that Baskin-Robbins may retain, use and disclose the information to respond to your inquiry and to help us conduct our franchise marketing efforts. Information on your online form will become part of any application for a Baskin-Robbins franchise that you might later submit. We may disclose your personal information to our business units, agents, parent company, other affiliates and to other third parties as part of our consideration of your inquiry or any subsequent franchise application.

### 

Baskin-Robbins recognizes the need to provide additional privacy protection to children. Children 12-years-old and younger may visit BaskinRobbins.com without disclosing any personally identifiable information. However, it is sometimes necessary to collect some personally identifiable information about children in order to allow them to use a feature of our site (like joining the Baskin-Robbins Birthday Club). In addition, be aware that all sites that are targeted to children 12 and younger are prohibited by law from collecting more information than they need. 

Only a parent or guardian may register a child 12 or younger for the Baskin-Robbins Birthday Club. When a parent registers a child for the Birthday Club, we request the child's name, date of birth and parent's e-mail address. We collect this information in order to verify the child's age, send personalized Birthday Club emails, and provide other Birthday Club benefits (such as promotions and special offers). Parents may review and edit this information at any time by going to their Birthday Club account on BaskinRobbins.com. 

We will not disclose any children's information to anyone outside of Baskin-Robbins, our sister brand, Dunkin' Donuts, and our agents and franchisees. Our sister brand has access to children's information and is jointly responsible for protecting children's privacy, but please direct all communication concerning children's information to Baskin-Robbins (contact information is given below). Our agents may need children's personal information in order to fill an order, respond to a request or help provide Birthday Club support, prevent fraud, or assist us in the management and improvement of our Web site. Our franchisees may need children's personal information in order to help us provide Birthday Club services and prevent fraud. We require our agents and franchisees to respect our privacy practices concerning children's information and not use children's information for purposes other than to carry out our instructions. 

Parents may request at any time that we delete information about their children from our databases. If you would like to deactivate your child's Birthday Club account, please visit your account and remove your child from the registration list. 

### 

When you enter your credit card number or personal and financial information, we use a sophisticated software program (Secure Socket Layer Technology or SSL) to encrypt or scramble that information before it's sent so that even if anyone intercepts the information, it is highly unlikely that they will be able to read or use it. In addition, we take appropriate security measures to safeguard your personal information once we have received it. 

### 

If you would like to view your account information online, simply visit your account in the Birthday Club section of BaskinRobbins.com. You can also correct any factual inaccuracies in the information you provided to us when you edit your account.
