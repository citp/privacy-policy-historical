## Your Financial Information

Songsterr.com is designed to provide a safe and secure environment for making payments. When you subscribe to Songsterr Plus account, our systems redirects your browser software on your computer to establish a secure, encrypted connection using an Internet-standard technology called SSL with a third-party payment processing system. This encrypted connection prevents information from being intercepted as it travels the Internet between our systems. You can verify that you are viewing a secure web page by checking your browser’s lock icon — on a secure page the lock will appear in the “locked” position.

If for any reason these systems fail and unauthorized charges are made to your account, the Fair Credit Billing Act stipulates that your bank cannot hold you liable for more than $50 of fraudulent charges. This protection applies only to credit cards (not debit cards) issued under the laws of the United States of America. Credit cards issued in other countries may afford similar protection.
