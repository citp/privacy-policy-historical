This is the Privacy Policy for the United States of America, which applies to you if you live outside the European Union or Canada.

Thank you for visiting Bassmaster.com, a site within the network of sites of B.A.S.S., LLC, each of which have adopted this Privacy Notice. Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used by B.A.S.S., LLC. By visiting this website, you are agreeing to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.

 **The Information We Collect**

Through B.A.S.S. websites, you can order publications and products and engage in various activities, like registering for Bassmaster fishing tournaments, entering contests or sweepstakes, playing games, taking quizzes, voting in polls or otherwise expressing an opinion, subscribing to one of our services, such as newsletters, or participating in one of our online forums or communities. Your personally identifiable information may be required to engage in these activities as well as to receive products and services that you may have requested. The types of personally identifiable information that may be collected at these pages and elsewhere include but are not limited to: name, address, gender, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number and credit or debit card information. We may also collect information about your personal or professional interests and use of or opinions about various products, programs and services. For instance, we may ask you to identify your job or number of days you fish to qualify you for new products and services.

At some B.A.S.S., LLC sites and through certain promotions, you can submit information about other people. For example, you might submit a person’s name and mailing and/or e-mail address to send a gift membership, electronic greeting card or similar item. The types of personally identifiable information that may be collected about other people at these pages include: recipient’s name, address, e-mail address and telephone number.

We may also collect certain non-personally identifiable information when you visit our Web pages or use our applications, such as the type of browser and operating system you are using, your device type, IP address and your Internet service provider, and location-based information.

 **How We Use the Information**

We may use the information you provide about yourself or others to fulfill requests for our publications, products or services, to respond to inquiries about offerings and to offer other products, programs or services that may be of interest. We may combine information we receive with outside records and share such information with third parties to enhance our ability to market to you those products or services that may be of interest to you. We may disclose personally identifiable information we receive from you and from third party sources to third parties whose practices are not covered by this privacy statement (e.g., other marketers, magazine publishers, retailers, participatory databases and nonprofit organizations) that want to market products or services to you.

When you request a magazine, service or other product, we will forward the information you give us to the publisher or provider for fulfillment. They may contact you with special offers of possible interest.

We sometimes use this information to communicate with you, such as to notify you when you have won one of our contests or sweepstakes, or when we make changes to subscriber agreements, to fulfill a request by you for an online newsletter or to contact you about your account.

If you choose to submit content (e.g., photos, videos, stories, online reviews, or communications to our editorial staff), we may publish your name, screen name and other information you have provided to us on our website, social media accounts or the websites and social media accounts of affiliated B.A.S.S., LLC sites.

The information we collect in connection with our social media accounts, online forums and communities is used to provide an interactive experience. We use this information to facilitate participation in these online forums and communities and, from time to time, to offer you products, programs or services.

We sometimes use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the design and content of our publications and websites, and to enable us to customize your Internet experience. We also may use this information to analyze site usage, as well as to offer you products, programs or services.

We will disclose information we maintain when required to do so by law; for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena. We also may disclose such information in response to a law enforcement agency’s request.

Agents and contractors of B.A.S.S., LLC that have access to personally identifiable information are required to protect this information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Notice by, for example, not using the information for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for B.A.S.S., LLC. We may transfer your personally identifiable information to other B.A.S.S., LLC offices for internal management and administrative purposes. Your personal data will be transferred to other B.A.S.S., LLC offices where necessary for the performance or conclusion of our contractual obligations to you or for your benefit. To the extent allowed by applicable law, transfers of personally identifiable information may also be made where necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.

Please note that if B.A.S.S., LLC or any of its subsidiaries or lines of business is sold or otherwise disposed of, including through merger of, consolidation or sale of assets, the relevant customer database, including personally identifiable information we may possess about you, may, in whole or in part, be sold, disposed of, transferred or otherwise disclosed as part of that transaction. Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information, we cannot assure you that personally identifiable information that we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Notice. Inadvertent disclosures may result, for example, when third parties misrepresent their identities in asking the site for access to personally identifiable information about themselves for purposes of correcting possible factual errors in the data.

 **Your California Privacy Rights: Notice to California Customers**

California’s “Shine the Light” law, Civil Code section 1798.83, requires certain businesses to respond to requests from California customers asking about the businesses’ practices related to disclosing personal information to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. Alternately, such businesses may have in place a policy not to disclose personal information of customers to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes if the customer has exercised an option to opt-out of such information-sharing. As discussed above, if you wish to find out more about your opt-out rights, or opt-out of our sharing of your information with third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes offline, please contact us at [ online@bassmaster.com](mailto:%20online@bassmaster.com).

 **Collection of Information by Third-Party Sites and Sponsors**

When you visit some of our sites you may be able to connect via link or other action on your part, to other sites whose information practices may be different than ours. You should consult the other sites’ privacy notices, as we have no control over information that is submitted to, collected by, or used by these third parties.

B.A.S.S., LLC sites sometimes may offer contests, sweepstakes, promotions, editorial features or other activities or offerings that are sponsored or co-sponsored by or presented with identified third parties. By virtue of your participation in such activities or offerings, your IP Address and the personally identifiable information that you voluntarily submit may be provided to both the B.A.S.S., LLC site and the third parties. B.A.S.S., LLC has no control over a third party’s use of this information.

B.A.S.S., LLC sites may use or allow reputable third parties to present or serve advertisements, including online behavioral advertisements, that you may see on the web pages, conduct research about the advertisements and collect non-personally identifiable information, such as your IP addresses. This privacy notice does not cover any use of information that such third parties may have collected from you (e.g., type of browser, operating system, domain name, date and time of visit, browsing or transaction activity, or advertising viewed, clicked or scrolled over) or the methods used by the third parties to collect that information (e.g., cookies, web beacons and clear gifs).

 **Cookies**

To enhance your online experience, we use cookies. Cookies are small text files we place in your computer’s browser to store your preferences. Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your e-mail address or other personally identifiable information unless you choose to provide this information to us by, for example, registering at one of our sites. However, once you choose to furnish the site with personally identifiable information, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie. We may also match information collected from you through different means or at different times, including both personal information and website usage information, and use such information along with offline and online information obtained from other sources (including third parties) such as demographic information and updated contact information (where that information has been lawfully disclosed to us) for the purposes of learning more about you so we can provide you with relevant content, offers, promotions and advertising.

We use cookies to understand Internet usage and to improve our content, offerings and advertisements. For example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience at our web pages (e.g., to recognize you by name when you return to our site, save your password in password-protected areas and enable you to use shopping carts on our sites). We may also use cookies to offer you products, programs or services. Similarly, as part of an arrangement with third parties (including but not limited to business partners, sponsors and those who present or serve the advertisements that you see on our web pages) we may also access cookies placed by others and allow others to access certain cookies placed by us.

We may also use small pieces of code such as “web beacons” or “clear gifs” to collect anonymous and aggregate advertising metrics, such as counting page views, promotion views or advertising responses. These “web beacons” may be used to deliver cookies that conform to our cookie policy.

Cookies and similar tracking technologies may be deployed by us and/or by our service providers or partners on our behalf. These technologies enable us to identify/assign a unique number to you, and relate your usage information on the site to other information about you, including your personal information. Most browsers automatically accept cookies and by using this site you consent to our use of cookies and similar tracking technologies as described in this Privacy Policy.  If you do not want cookies, you can set your browser option so that you will not receive cookies and you can also delete existing cookies from your browser. However, if you set your browser to refuse cookies, you may find that some features of the site will not function properly and you should be aware that disabling cookies or similar tracking technologies might prevent you from accessing some portions of our website.

 **Our Commitment to Security**

We have put in place appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security and correctly use the information we collect. However, as no system is entirely secure, we do not guarantee that unauthorized access and disclosures cannot or will not occur.
