# Base Gear | Privacy Policy

**BaseGear.com Privacy Policy**

BaseGear.com takes your privacy seriously. We respect your right to enjoy a private and secure online shopping experience. We have developed this privacy policy in order to inform you of our privacy practices. We strictly adhere to the privacy guidelines adopted by Yahoo! as detailed above. We have adopted the following additional policies to further protect your privacy rights.

**Information We Collect**

When you place an order with BaseGear.com, we ask for your name, address, phone number, e-mail address and credit card information. This information is used to process and to fill your order. All information we collect from you is stored in a secure Yahoo! database. 

**Information Policy**

We never make your personal information or e-mail address available to any other company or organization without your permission. Simply placing an order with us does _not_ mean that you are giving us permission to disclose your personal information to another company or organization.

**About Children**

For their protection, we ask that children not submit any information to us without the consent of a parent or guardian. **About Shopping Carts & Cookies**

Yahoo!'s ordering system uses cookies to keep track of each shopper's shopping cart. When a shopper arrives at a store, Yahoo! assigns that shopper a unique cookie. When the shopper clicks on an Order button, we use the cookie to decide what shopping cart to put the product into. 

Without using cookie technology, there is simply no way to make any online shopping cart work. Using cookies does not give the server _any_ personal information about the person visiting the website.

To learn more about cookies, please see Netscape's document entitled Cookies and Privacy or their technical specification for cookies if you would like a more in-depth treatment.

**About Web Beacons**

We use web beacons from Yahoo! (our e-commerce provider) to help analyze where visitors go and what they do while visiting our website. Yahoo! may also use _anonymous_ information about your visits to this and other websites in order to improve its products and services. 

If you would like more information about this practice and and/or to opt out, please [click here](https://reports.web.analytics.yahoo.com/optout,OptOut.vm?domain=a.analytics.yahoo.com) (will open in a new browser window or tab).

**About Security**

All online transactions at our store are processed with the latest industry-standard, high-grade 256-bit SSL encryption. When you enter your credit card number into the order form, it is transmitted across the Internet in an encrypted (scrambled) form, then decoded only when it arrives to us.

For added security, Yahoo!'s ordering system also encrypts the credit card number when it is stored on disk, and when we receive it. In addition, your credit card number is permanently deleted from Yahoo!'s ordering system 30 days after the date you place your order.

According to CNN, "The prevalent opinion...is that on-line credit card use is actually no riskier for consumers than traditional 'low-tech' transactions."

**Notification of Changes**

If we decide to make changes to our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
