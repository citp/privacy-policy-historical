# Basics 4 Life Network - Privacy Statement

**General Information**  
At Basics 4 Life we're committed to protecting the privacy and safety of our users. We have created this privacy policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy and to explain our information gathering and dissemination practices for the Basics 4 Life Network of web sites (Basic Music, Basic Free Stuff, Basic Weather, Basic Jokes, Basic Eating, Basic Christian Living). 

Currently, we do not require that anyone become a member of our Network. We do not require anyone to disclose more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in any activity and we will not intentionally post, sell, rent or trade your personal information with third parties. 

Sometimes, you may also be asked to create a screen name and/or password in order to participate in certain areas or activities. If you are asked to create a screen name, please do not use your real name. Try to think of something special and different that you'll be able to remember. We will not use this information to contact you, only to make your time on the Network easier. 

As with most sites, certain non-personally identifiable information is recorded by the standard operation of our server. Such information may include: the name of the ISP from which you access the Internet, the date and time you accessed the Network, the Internet address of the Web site from which you entered our Network and where you've gone after leaving. This information is used to measure and monitor the use of our web sites and to improve their content. Data that would personally identify a visitor is known only when voluntarily submitted. 

**Use Of Information**  
Email addresses that are submitted will only be used for the purpose stated when submitted. 

We may also use email addresses for internal Network administration purposes, to respond to specific inquiries initiated by visitors, and to comply with a law or legal action as directed by a court, regulatory agency or other entity acting with governmental authority. 

**Cookies**  
Cookies are small pieces of information stored on your computer which may be used to access information relating to your past use of the Network. The Basic Music Network does not store any personal information in cookies. Our cookies simply contain a unique number for each member that identifies who is visiting our website. The information that the cookie number relates to is what we have gathered from visitors. The cookie number does not relate to any kind of personal tracking, surfing, browsing, clicks, etc. Some features of the Basics 4 Life Network may not function properly if you disable cookies in your browser. Most Internet browsers include preference settings that allow visitors to be notified and control whether cookies are transferred to their computers. Please review your browser's documentation or "help" feature for more information on that functionality. 

**Security**  
The Basics 4 Life Network uses industry standard security measures to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. While there is no such thing as "perfect security" on the Internet, we will try our best to make sure that your transmissions to and from the Site are kept secure. 

**Links**  
The content of the Basics 4 Life Network is designed to be family friendly. In addition to our own content, we also provide links to many other sites. We do screen the other sites initially, but in the end, we cannot be responsible for what appears on other sites. We are also not responsible for the privacy policies of those other sites.
