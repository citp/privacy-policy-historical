                  <br>
      Because we want to demonstrate our commitment to your <br>
      privacy, this privacy statement will notify you of:<br>
      <br>
      - What personally identifiable information of yours or third <br>
      party personal identification is collected from you through <br>
      the website. <br>
      - Who is collecting the information. <br>

      - With whom the information may be shared. <br>
      - What choices are available to you regarding collection, <br>

      - The kind of security procedures that are in place to protect <br>

      <br>
      <span class="staticTextBold">Information Collection and Use </span><br>
      The BassShoes.com website is operated by Shoes.com, Inc. <br>
      which is a subsidiary of Brown Shoe Company (NYSE: BWS). <br>
			      Shoes.com, Inc. is the sole owner of all information collected <br>
			      on this site. This information will not be shared with, sold<br>
      or rented to others in ways different from what is disclosed <br>
                  in this statement. This information is collected from users at <br>
                  several different points on the Shoes.com website. <br>
                  <br>
                  <span class="staticTextBold">Preferred Customers </span><br>
      In order to become a <a href="/stores/bass/login/login.asp" class="staticLink">Preferred Customer</a>, you must first <br>
      complete the registration form. During registration you are <br>
      required to give personal contact information (such as <br>
      name and email address). This information is used to <br>
      reward loyal customers for their business. By becoming a <br>
      Preferred Customer, you are able to take advantage of <br>
      special offers we make available to Preferred Customers <br>
      about new promotions, fashion trends, etc. It is also more <br>
      convenient for a Preferred Club Customer to make <br>
      purchases online.<br>
      <br>
      <span class="staticTextBold">Orders </span><br>
      We request information from you on our order form. Here <br>
      you must provide contact information (like name and <br>
      shipping address) and financial information (like credit card <br>
      number, expiration date). This information is used for <br>
      billing purposes and to fill customers' orders. If we have <br>
      trouble processing an order, this contact information is used <br>
      to get in touch with you. <br>
      <br>
      <span class="staticTextBold">Cookies </span><br>
      A cookie is a piece of data stored on the hard drive of your <br>
      computer, containing information about you. Usage of a <br>
      cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable <br>
      information while on our site. Once you close your browser, <br>
      the cookie simply terminates. For instance, by accepting a <br>
      cookie from our site, you will not have to log in your <br>
      password more than once, thereby saving time while on our <br>
      site. If you reject the cookie, you may still use our site. <br>
      The only drawback to this is that you will be limited in some <br>
      areas of our site. Cookies can also enable us to track and <br>
      target the interests of our customers to enhance the <br>
      experience on our site. <br>
      <br>
      <span class="staticTextBold">Log Files </span><br>
      We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, <br>
      track users' movements, and gather broad demographic <br>
      information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked <br>
      to personally identifiable information. <br>
      <br>
      <span class="staticTextBold">Sharing </span><br>
      The personal information you have provided us and <br>
      information about your order will never be shared with third <br>
      parties. This information may, however, be combined with <br>
      other information (such as demographic information and <br>
      past purchase information) and used to make our future <br>
      marketing efforts more efficient.<br>
      <br>
      <span class="staticTextBold">Links</span> <br>
      From time to time, BassShoes.com may contain links to other <br>
      websites. Please be aware that we cannot be responsible for <br>
      the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our <br>
      users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the <br>
      privacy statements of each and every website that collects <br>
      personally identifiable information. This privacy statement <br>
      applies solely to information collected by this site. <br>
      <br>
      <span class="staticTextBold">Surveys and Contests </span><br>
      From time to time our site requests information from users <br>
      via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or <br>
      contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a <br>
      choice whether or not to disclose this information. <br>
      Information requested may include contact information <br>
      (such as name and shipping address), and demographic <br>
      information (such as zip code, age level). Contact <br>
      information will be used to notify the winners and award <br>
      prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of <br>
      monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.<br>
      <br>
      <span class="staticTextBold">Security </span><br>
      BassShoes.com takes every precaution to protect our users' <br>
      information. When you submit sensitive information via the <br>
      website, your information is protected both online and <br>
      off-line.<br>
      <br>
      When our registration form or order form asks you to enter <br>
      sensitive information (such as credit card number), that <br>
      information is encrypted and is protected with Secure <br>
      Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology. While on a <br>
      secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the <br>
      bottom of web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and <br>
      Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to <br>
      un-locked, or open, when you are just "surfing."<br>
      While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information <br>
      online, we also do everything in our power to protect user <br>
      information off-line. All of our users' information, not just <br>
      the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in <br>
      our offices. Only employees who need the information to <br>
      perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a <br>
      customer service representative) are granted access to <br>
      personally identifiable information. Furthermore, all <br>
      employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy <br>
      practices. Our employees are regularly notified and <br>
      reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and <br>
      what they can do to ensure our customers' information is <br>
      protected. Finally, the servers on which we store personally <br>
      identifiable information are kept in a secure environment. <br>
      If you have questions about the security of our website, <br>
      <a href="/stores/bass/contactus.asp" class="staticLink">email us</a>.<br>
      <br>
      <span class="staticTextBold">Special Offers </span><br>
      Established Preferred Customers will occasionally receive <br>
      information on products, services, and special promotions. <br>
      Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the <br>
      option to not receive these types of communications. <br>
      Please see "Choice and Opt-Out" below. <br>
      <br>
      <span class="staticTextBold">Site and Service Updates </span><br>
      We also send our users site and service announcement <br>
      updates. We may communicate with you to provide <br>
      requested services and, in regards to issues relating to <br>
      your account, via email or phone. <br>
      <br>
      <span class="staticTextBold">Correcting or Updating Personal Information </span><br>
      If your personally identifiable information changes (such as <br>
      your zip code), or if you no longer desire our service, we will <br>
      endeavor to provide a way for you to correct, update or <br>
      remove your personal data provided to us. This can usually <br>
      be done at the <a href="/stores/bass/login/login.asp" class="staticLink">Preferred Customer Account</a> maintenance <br>
      page or by <a href="/stores/bass/contactus.asp" class="staticLink">emailing us</a>.<br>
      <br>
      <span class="staticTextBold">Choice and Opt-out </span><br>
      Our users are given the opportunity to "opt-out" of having <br>
      their information used for purposes not directly related to <br>
      our site at the point where we ask for the information. For <br>
      example, our Preferred Customer Account information form <br>
      has an 'opt-out' mechanism so users who register with us, <br>
      but don't want any marketing material, can keep their <br>
      email address off of our lists. If you no longer wish to <br>
      receive our promotional materials you may opt-out of <br>
      receiving these communications by either visiting our <br>
      Preferred Customer Account information page or by <a href="/stores/bass/contactus.asp" class="staticLink">sending <br>
      us an email</a>.<br>
      <br>
      <span class="staticTextBold">Notification of Changes </span><br>
      If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those <br>
      changes on our homepage so our users are always aware of <br>
      what information we collect, how we use it, and under what <br>
      circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we <br>
      decide to use personally identifiable information in a <br>
      manner different from that stated at the time it was <br>
      collected, we will notify you by way of an email. You will <br>
      have a choice as to whether or not we may use your <br>
      information in this different manner. We will use information <br>
      in accordance with the privacy policy under which the <br>
      information was collected.</td>
