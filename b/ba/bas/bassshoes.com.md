**Information We Collect and How We Use it**

**Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”)**. When you visit the Site or engage with our mobile programs, we will not collect any PII about you (such as your name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address), unless you specifically provide such information. You may supply us with PII when you sign up for email and mobile text alerts, request information concerning investor relations, sign up for the Bass Rewards Program, place an order on the Site, establish an account, contact us with a question or comment, utilize a “Send to a Friend" feature, or sign up to receive emails about our latest products and services. By providing PII to us, we are better able to match your interests. When you join the Bass Rewards Program, you will receive club benefits as described in the terms and conditions of such program and as we may offer from time to time. We will use customer information in connection with purchases to better tailor and personalize special offers for your benefit. We may use your PII to process and fulfill orders, send emails to confirm your order status and shipment, if you have purchased any products via the Site. We may also communicate with you and to send you information by email, postal mail, text message or other means about our products, services, contests, and promotions and enable our parent, PVH Corp. and its subsidiaries to similarly communicate with you about their products, services, contests, and promotions] if you have opted in to receive such promotional communications. PVH Corp. and its affiliates (including us) may also use this information to improve your customer experience such as to help us improve the Site and to better tailor our products, services and marketing efforts. In addition, G.H. Bass & Co. may from time to time conduct surveys on the Site where users can voluntarily participate and provide PII. 

**Non-Personally Identifiable Information (“Non-PII”), Cookies, Web Beacons, and Pixel Tags.** By visiting the Site, you make available to us and we collect through the use of cookies certain Non- PII (such as the domain name and type of your Internet server and browser, the web pages accessed, and the length of access). While the Site uses cookies, it does not require the use of cookies. Cookies are messages written in your browser. The cookie messages store Non- PII to help us gauge the success of the Site, help us increase the value and benefits of the Site, and tracks session information such as what pages you access and for how long. While it may be possible to correlate this information to particular individuals, we do not do so, and we limit our use of this information to its aggregate form reflecting all visitors to the Site. Most Internet browsers enable you to erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block all cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored.
