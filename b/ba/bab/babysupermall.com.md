# BabySuperMall.com - Privacy Policy

We collect two types of information from you: information you submit to us and data our site gathers automatically. 

**1.  Information You Submit to Us:**  
Everyone is welcome to browse our site and there is no requirement to purchase anything at any time. If you decide to make a purchase, we will gather several pieces of information from you during the checkout process. 

Our order form uses required and non required fields. We require only the most basic contact information needed to process your payment and properly ship your order, such as name, address, phone number, and e-mail address and payment information. You may choose to not submit payment information online if this makes you uncomfortable. Simply fill out the basic information on the order form and then choose "Off-line Payment" to pay by phone, mail, or fax. 

There are also non required fields on our order form that you may use to provide more data and instructions so that your order can be handled in the way you want. Some non required information would be a separate shipping address, gift wrapping information, special shipping instructions, etc. 

**2.  Information Gathered Automatically:**  
Just like most web sites, our server automatically gathers some usage information from you so that we can improve and enhance our site based on user patterns. 

We may use the information you provide during the check-out process for any or all of the following: to process your payment, to process and ship your order, to send you e-mail about your order, and/or to call you on the phone if we have questions about your order. 

If you submit credit card information, we use that information to collect payment for your order which may include verifying your name, address, and phone number with your Card Issuer (this is a fraud protection measure required by the Credit Card companies). 

If you submit information to pay by check online, we use that information to collect payment for your order which may include verifying your name, address, phone number, routing number, and account number with your bank. For fraud prevention, our Online Electronic Check processor, CHEXpedite, will also collect driver's license number and the IP address of your computer.
