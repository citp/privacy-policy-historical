Use of retargeting-technology is made in adherence to valid legal data protection provisions.  Therefore, baby-markt.com cooperates with the Kupona company, which specializes in retargeting technology.

There, the systematics of retargeting-technology is explained to you again and the option of signing off (“Opt-out“) is offered. If you sign off with the provider, a so-called “Opt-out“cookie is stored on your computer that prevents display of the provider’s advertising banners in the future. Please note that this signing off can only be conducted from your computer if you do not wish to be shown any personalized advertising banners by baby-markt.com in the future.
