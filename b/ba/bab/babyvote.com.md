#### What is a cookie?

A cookie is a piece of data sent to your device from a website. This means the website can recognise your device if you return to the same website.

A cookie often includes a unique identifier, which is an anonymous number (randomly generated) and is stored on your device. Some expire at the end of your website session; others remain on your computer for longer.

These pieces of information are used to improve services for you through, for example:

  * enabling a service to recognise your device so you don't have to give the same information several times during one task, e.g. filling out a web form or a web survey

  * recognising that you may already have given a username and password so you don't need to do it for every web page

  * measuring how many people are using services, so they can be made easier to use and there's enough capacity to ensure they are fast

  * analysing anonymised data to help us understand how people interact with the different aspects of our online services so we can make them better
