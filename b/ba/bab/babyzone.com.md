BabyZone and ParentZone take your online privacy seriously and we are fully committed to ensuring that your privacy is respected and protected. Our Privacy Policy below outlines the type of information we may collect and/or request from you while you are using BabyZone's web sites, as well as ways in which we process and, sometimes, disseminate information collected. You are, of course, free to use the majority of our site features without providing any personal information. This Privacy Policy covers all web sites and web pages owned, controlled and/or operated by BabyZone.com, Inc., including ParentZone.com.

These sites are not intended for children under the age of 13. We will not knowingly collect personally identifiable information via this site from visitors under 13. We do, however, collect information about children and babies from their parents. We ask that our users not provide information about a baby or child without first getting the parents' consent. We encourage parents to talk to their children about their use of the Internet and the information they disclose to Web sites.

In order to participate in certain partner and/or advertiser supplied services and tools you may be required to provide personally identifiable information to the advertisers and partners whose tools and services you have chosen to interact with. Each advertiser and partner may request different information from you. If you have additional questions about how one of our advertisers, partners or sponsors use information about you, we urge you to contact them directly.

## Third-Party Cookies

In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique "cookie" on your browser.

## Membership Registration/Personal Information

Many areas of BabyZone and ParentZone are reserved for BabyZone/ParentZone members who have registered with us; for example, chats, message boards and access to special services such as My BabyZone/My ParentZone, special offers and sweepstakes. We may use personally identifiable information from this registration form to send members newsletters, information about our company and promotional material from some of our partners via email and/or postal mail. All emails will contain simple instructions on how to unsubscribe. In certain instances we may sell or otherwise provide certain members' postal addresses to third parties for postal mailings. To opt out of postal mailings please send a request to BabyZone Postal, 288 Walnut Street, Newtonville, MA 02460. Additionally, we may also disclose personally identifiable information you provide via this site in connection with the sale, assignment, or other transfer of the business of this site, or to respond to law enforcement requests, or where required by applicable laws, court orders, or government regulations.

## Edit Member Information 

BabyZone and ParentZone provide you with the ability to access, correct or change certain information in your member profile at any time, including contact information or other information you've provided to us. Please be advised that BabyZone and ParentZone currently archive information the sites collect on its members and visitors.

## Shopping at BabyZone/ParentZone E-Commerce Partners

When you provide personal financial and other personally identifiable information to one of BabyZone's or ParentZone's e-commerce partners, this transaction will occur on the e-commerce partner's site, not BabyZone or ParentZone, and as such the financial and personally identifiable information you provide is collected by and controlled by the Privacy Policy of that e-commerce partner. It is important therefore that you familiarize yourself with the Privacy Policy of the e-commerce site you transact with.

## Message Boards, Chat Rooms, Birth Stories, Birth Announcements, E-mail Sent to BabyZone, Journals and Baby Books

Throughout our various public forums such as chat rooms, message boards, "ask the expert" areas and various question and answer areas are available to you as a BabyZone visitor or member. Please remember that any information you disclose in these public forum areas becomes public information and is immediately accessible on the Website, so it is important for you to exercise discretion and appropriate caution when deciding to reveal personal information in these areas. When entering journal or baby book entries, you have the choice to make these entries public or private. BabyZone and ParentZone may decide to utilize the content of Q&A's, interactions with experts, birth stories, public journals, public baby books, email sent to us and chat room and message board content in order to enhance the editorial, advertising, promotional aspects of BabyZone and ParentZone.

## Surveys and Polls 

Our surveys ask for opinions on various issues and very often these surveys and polls are sponsored by or associated with BabyZone/ParentZone advertisers and partners. Occasionally, we may request demographic information (like zip code, age or gender). Most information obtained through surveys and polls is aggregated and used internally or shared with advertisers and partners only in the aggregated form. In the event personally identifiable information is requested as part of surveys or polls about any BabyZone member or visitor, such personally identifiable information is never provided to third parties without informing you. In these instances you may expressly choose to receive information from a sponsor, in which case your information is provided to that sponsor only. Some survey answers may be added to your member portrait so that we can better provide you with content, ads and offers that are most appropriate for you.

## Contests and Sweepstakes

We occasionally operate sweepstakes, contests and giveaways throughout BabyZone/ParentZone sites. We typically ask you for your email address to notify you if you've won. We also ask for first and last names, and sometimes postal addresses in order to verify the entrant's identity. In some situations, we need additional information as part of the entry process, such as a prize selection choice. This information is shared with a third party: When you choose to receive information from a third party sweepstakes sponsor; when a sweepstakes is hosted by BabyZone/ParentZone but administered by a sponsor, again, we will advise you of this in the sweepstakes rules; or sweepstakes and contests will also ask you to consent to the release of information contained within the entry form for tax purposes if you become a winner.

You should carefully review the rules of each sweepstakes, contest and giveaway which you enter as they may contain additional important information about BabyZone's or a sponsor's use of your personally identifiable information.

## E-mail to a Friend and E-Cards

BabyZone offers the ability to forward an article to another person via e-mail or to send an electronic card. If you use either of these services, we will use the recipient's email address in order to send the article or e-card and it will also ask for your email address. In the case of e-cards, we will ask for your email address and each may be stored so that we can ensure delivery and that the recipient can retrieve the e-card. We do not use the recipient's email address for any other purpose unless such recipient gives us permission to do so.

## IP Address 

Your IP address is a number that is assigned by your ISP (Internet Service Provider) to your computer to identify its location. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, administer our website and provide locally relevant content.

## Cookies

Our site uses a feature of your browser to set a "cookie" on your computer. BabyZone/ParentZone can then read the cookies whenever you visit the BabyZone/ParentZone websites. We use cookies to save your ID and password so you don't have to re-enter them each time you visit our site, to deliver content specific to your interests, to track the pages you've visited and to make sure you don't see the same ads repeatedly. You may modify your browser preference to provide you with choices relating to cookies. You have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is set or to reject all cookies. If you choose to reject cookies you may be unable to use those BabyZone services that require registration.
