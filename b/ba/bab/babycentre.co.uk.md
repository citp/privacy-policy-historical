# Privacy Policy

**Babycentre Privacy Policy**

**BabyCentre respects your privacy**

BabyCentre respects your privacy. Any personal information you give us is held with the utmost care and security, according to the guidelines set forth in the UK Data Protection Acts of 1998, and will not be used in ways to which you have not consented. We will not sell or disclose any information that identifies you to a third party without your approval. Information is stored at our US data processing centre. Please continue to read our privacy policy for more details.

**Your personal information**

BabyCentre will not collect any personal information about you except when you specifically and knowingly provide such information. For example, if you would like to register on our site to take advantage of certain features, like a customised personal page, then we ask for your e-mail address.

If you register, you can also sign up to receive other offers and information from BabyCentre and other qualified companies. These qualified suppliers are prescreened organisations or companies whose products or services we believe are of interest to parents and parents-to-be. If you sign up to receive the offers but later decide you don't want them, then follow this [link](https://web.archive.org/register/unsubscribe) to unsubscribe to any mailings. Obviously we will not give your email address to these companies unless we obtain your consent.

Our site has public areas such as message boards. Please remember that any information you share in these areas becomes public, so you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information. If you post comments about BabyCentre products or services on our site, there's a chance we may publish them for editorial purposes or in promotional advertising and/or marketing materials (especially if you say nice things about us). However, anything we do use will not identify you as an individual.

* BabyCentre Newsletter - our general newsletter with updates, news and polls  
* My Baby this Week - a personalised newsletter, written for your stage of pregnancy or your baby's age.

To unsubscribe to any of our e-mail newsletters, follow the instructions at the end of the newsletter(s) or click [ here.](https://web.archive.org/register/unsubscribe)

**E-mail this to a friend service**

You can choose to electronically forward a story from our site to a friend by entering their e-mail address. We do not use the e-mail address for any purpose other than to send your e-mail. We do not rent or sell these e-mail addresses.

**Cookies**

BabyCentre uses a feature of your Internet Web browser called a "cookie" to assign a unique identification to your computer. Cookies are files that your Web browser places on your computer's hard drive. BabyCentre creates and then uses these cookie files to track your clicks as you go through the BabyCentre Web site. BabyCentre only uses cookies to tell us whether you have visited BabyCentre previously, and to help us determine whether you came to BabyCentre from a particular Internet link or banner advertisement. Cookies can also be used to help to save and retrieve passwords used on the BabyCentre site and information on past purchases and other preferences, saving you from having to re-enter this information upon every visit to the BabyCentre Web site. BabyCentre does not and cannot use cookies to retrieve personal information about you from your computer unless you knowingly and willingly provided such information.

**Online surveys and contests**

Sometimes we conduct user surveys to improve our site for you. We may share aggregate, or summary, anonymous information about our users with partners or other third parties. For example, we might disclose that a certain percentage of our users are female. But we will not sell or share any information at the individual user level. Sometimes we offer contests and sweepstakes in which we request certain personal information. For example, we might require your name and e-mail address. Because the rules and terms of each promotion can vary, all information about the contest is posted during the event.

**Online birth announcements**

If you create a BabyCentre online birth announcement, we will send you a URL specific to you alone. Your birth announcement is not searchable on our site. However, some people might be able to guess your URL and see your announcement. So if you are concerned about some people seeing certain information in your announcement, don't add it to your page.

**Sponsored promotional pages**

Babycentre sometimes hosts sponsored promotional pages for advertisers who offer product and promotional information that might be of interest to you, including contests, free samples, discounts, etc. These pages are clearly identified. Sometimes the advertiser or BabyCentre will request personal information to enter the promotion. Because the rules and terms of each promotion can vary, all information is posted during the event. And, the personal information that is obtained is only used in relation to the promotion.

**Reviewing and changing your personal profile**

Once you register, you will be able to review and change your personal profile at any time.
