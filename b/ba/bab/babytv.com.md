**Privacy Statement for Baby Universe Inc.**  


We value your security and privacy and have done everything possible to ensure the safety and security of the information you provide to us and the transactions you do with us online.

The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website: www.babyuniverse.com.

BabyUniverse gathers two types of information about users: data that users provide through optional, voluntary registration on our site and in certain contests and sweepstakes and data BabyUniverse gathers through aggregated tracking information derived mainly by tracking page views throughout our site. Such information enables us to better tailor our site and products to our customer's needs.   
This site may contain links to other sites. BabyUniverse is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. Please note that when you visit one of these links, you are 'clicking' to another Web site. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of these linked sites as their policy may differ from ours.

Our site's Order and Gift Registry forms require users to give us contact information (like their name and e-mail address). We use customer contact information from the registration forms to send the user information about our company. The customer's contact information is also used to contact the visitor when questions about orders or registry selections arise.

Our site uses an order form for customers to request information, products, and services. We collect visitor's contact information (like their e-mail address) and financial information (like their account or credit card numbers). Contact information from the order form is used to send orders information. Financial information that is collected is used to bill the user for products and services.

Our optional online survey asks visitors for contact information (like their e-mail address) and demographic information (like their zip code, age, or income level). We use contact data from our surveys to send the user promotional information about our Company. The customer's contact information is also used to contact the visitor if they so request.

Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. We use this data to tailor our visitor's experience at our site.

We also collect some information anonymously, in the form of Log Files, in order to analyze how people use our site and what we can do to improve their shopping experiences. Our website automatically recognizes IP addresses and browser type but you cannot be identified as an individual. For customers who make a purchase at BabyUniverse, we record which pages you visited and any other information volunteered during the ordering and registration process.

**Secure Shopping**  
This site has strict security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Whenever you make a purchase or provide any personal information (e.g. completing and e-mail form), we use SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) technology to make sure that it is encrypted. This means that no one else can read it while it is being transmitted over the Internet. We keep all personal information EXCEPT for credit card numbers safely stored behind a firewall. We store this type of information (such as name and address) so that you do not have to reenter it each time you make a purchase or log in. Credit card numbers are encrypted and forwarded to a third party authorization company. No one has access to your credit card information and it is kept secure at all times.

We guarantee that every online transaction you make will be 100% safe. This means you pay nothing if unauthorized charges are made to your card as a result of shopping at BabyUniverse. Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, your bank cannot hold you liable for more than $50.00 of fraudulent charges. If your bank does hold you liable for any of this $50.00, we will cover the entire liability for you, up to the full $50.00. We will only cover this liability if the unauthorized use of your credit card resulted through no fault of your own from purchases made while using the secure server. In the event of unauthorized use of your credit card, you must notify your credit card provider in accordance with its reporting rules and procedures.

Should these privacy policies be altered at any time in the future, we will immediately implement the changes to this information page. BabyUniverse encourages users to check this statement periodically.

Please note that e-mail is not encrypted and is not considered a secure means of transmitting credit card numbers.
