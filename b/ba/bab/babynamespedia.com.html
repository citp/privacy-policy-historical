      <p><b>COMMITMENT TO YOUR
PRIVACY</b></p>
      <p>
        Your privacy on the Internet is of the utmost importance to us. At Baby Names Pedia, 
        we want to make your experience online satisfying and safe.</p>
      <p>Because we gather certain types of information
          about our users, we feel you should fully understand our policy and
          the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and use of that information.
          This
          privacy statement discloses what information we gather and how we use
          it.</p>
      <p><b>INFORMATION Baby Names Pedia GATHERS AND TRACKS</b></p>
      <p>Baby Names Pedia gathers two types of information
          about users:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Information that users provide through
            optional, voluntary submissions. These are voluntary submissions
            to receive our electronic newsletters, to participate in our message
            boards or forums, to email a friend, and from participation in polls
            and surveys:<br>
       <br>
        </li>
        <li>Information Baby Names Pedia gathers through
            aggregated tracking information derived mainly by tallying page views
            throughout our sites. This information allows us to better tailor
            our content to readers' needs and to help our advertisers and sponsors
            better understand the demographics of our audience. Because Baby Names Pedia
            derives its revenue mainly from sponsorships and advertising, providing
            such aggregated demographic data is essential to keeping our service
            free to users. Under no circumstances does Baby Names Pedia divulge any information
            about an individual user to a third party. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Baby Names Pedia Gathers User Information In
          The Following Processes:</p>
      <p>Optional Voluntary Information</p>
      <p>We offer the following free services,
          which require some type of voluntary submission of personal information
          by users:</p>
      <p>1. Electronic newsletters policy (Dispatches)</p>
      <p>We may offer a free electronic newsletter
          to users. Baby Names Pedia gathers the email addresses of users who voluntarily
          subscribe. Users may remove themselves from this mailing list by following
          the link provided in every newsletter that points users to the subscription
          management page. Users can also subscribe to the newsletters at the
          time of registration.</p>
      <p>2. Message boards/forums policy</p>
      <p>We may offer message boards/forum services to users.  Users 
          must register separately for these services (both are free of
          charge) in order to post messages, although they needn't register to
          visit the site. During registration the user is required to supply
          a username, password, and email address.</p>
      <p>3. "E-mail to friend" policy</p>
      <p>Our site users can choose to electronically
          forward a link, page, or documents to someone else by clicking "e-mail
          this to a friend". The user must provide their email address, as well
          as that of the recipient. This information is used only in the case
          of transmission errors and, of course, to let the recipient know who
          sent the email. The information is not used for any other purpose.</p>
      <p>4. Polling</p>
      <p>We may offer interactive polls to users
          so they can easily share their opinions with other users and see what
          our audience thinks about important issues. Opinions or other responses
          to polls are aggregated and are not identifiable to any particular
          user. Baby Names Pedia may use a system to "tag" users after they have voted,
          so they can vote only once on a particular question. This tag is not
          correlated with information about individual users.</p>
      <p>5. Surveys</p>
      <p>Baby Names Pedia may occasionally conduct user
          surveys to better target our content to our audience. We sometimes
          share the aggregated demographic information in these surveys with
          our sponsors, advertisers and partners. We never share any of this
          information about specific individuals with any third party.</p>
      <p>Children</p>
      <p>Consistent with the Federal Children's
          Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), we will never knowingly
          request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age
          of 13 without requesting parental consent.</p>
      <p>Usage tracking</p>
      <p>Baby Names Pedia tracks user traffic patterns
          throughout all of our sites. However, we do not correlate this information
          with data about individual users. Baby Names Pedia does break down overall usage
          statistics according to a user's domain name, browser type, and MIME
          type by reading this information from the browser string (information
          contained in every user's browser).</p>
      <p>Baby Names Pedia sometimes tracks and catalogs
          the search terms that users enter in our Search function, but this
          tracking is never associated with individual users. We use tracking
          information to determine which areas of our sites users like and don't
          like based on traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual
          users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps
          us continue to build a better service for you.</p>
      <p>Cookies</p>
      <p>We may place a text file called a "cookie" in
          the browser files of your computer. The cookie itself does not contain
          Personal Information although it will enable us to relate your use
          of this site to information that you have specifically and knowingly
          provided. But the only personal information a cookie can contain is
          information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your
          hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. Baby Names Pedia uses
          cookies to track user traffic patterns (as described above). Our advertising
          system delivers a one-time cookie to better track ad impressions and
          click rates.</p>
      <p>We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on this site. Their DART cookie enables them to serve ads to you based on your visit to this and other sites on the Internet. You may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html" ref="nofollow">Google ad and content network privacy policy</a>. </p>
      <p>You can refuse cookies by turning them
          off in your browser. If you've set your browser to warn you before
          accepting cookies, you will receive the warning message with each cookie.
          You do not need to have cookies turned on to use this site. However,
          you do need cookies to use the "My Shortlist" function and to participate 
          actively in message boards, forums, polling and surveys.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h2>Privacy Policy Use</h2>
      <p><b>USE OF INFORMATION</b></p>
      <p>Baby Names Pedia uses any information voluntarily
          given by our users to enhance their experience in our network of sites,
          whether to provide interactive or personalized elements on the sites
          or to better prepare future content based on the interests of our users.</p>
      <p>As stated above, we use information that
          users voluntarily provide in order to send out electronic newsletters
          and to enable users to participate in polls, surveys, message boards,
          and forums. We send out newsletters to subscribers on a regular schedule
          (depending on the newsletter), and occasionally send out special editions
          when we think subscribers might be particularly interested in something
          we are doing. Baby Names Pedia never shares newsletter mailing lists with
          any third parties, including advertisers, sponsors or partners.</p>
      <p>When we use tracking information to determine
          which areas of our sites users like and don't like based on traffic
          to those areas. We do not track what individual users read, but rather
          how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build
          a better service for you. We track search terms entered in Search function
          as one of many measures of what interests our users. But we don't track
          which terms a particular user enters.</p>
      <p>Baby Names Pedia creates aggregate reports
          on user demographics and traffic patterns for advertisers, sponsors
          and partners. This allows our advertisers to advertise more effectively,
          and allows our users to receive advertisements that are pertinent to
          their needs. Because we don't track the usage patterns of individual
          users, an advertiser or sponsor will never know that a specific user
          clicked their ad. We will not disclose any information about any individual
          user except to comply with applicable law or valid legal process or
          to protect the personal safety of our users or the public.</p>
      <p><b>SHARING OF THE INFORMATION</b></p>
      <p>Baby Names Pedia uses the above-described information
          to tailor our content to suit your needs and help our advertisers better
          understand our audience's demographics. This is essential to keeping
          our service free. We will not share information about individual users
          with any third party, except to comply with applicable law or valid
          legal process or to protect the personal safety of our users or the
          public.</p>
      <p><b>SECURITY</b></p>
      <p>Baby Names Pedia operates secure data networks
          protected by industry standard firewall and password protection systems.
          Our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced
          as necessary and only authorized individuals have access to the information
          provided by our customers.</p>
      <p><b>OPT-OUT POLICY</b></p>
      <p>We give users options wherever necessary
          and practical. Such choices include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Opting not to register to receive
              our electronic newsletters.<br>
       <br>
        </li>
        <li>Opting not to participate in certain
              interactive areas, which completely alleviates the need to gather
              any personally identifiable information from our users</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>YOUR CONSENT</b></p>
      <p>By using this site, you consent to the
          collection and use of this information by Baby Names Pedia. If we decide to
          change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page
          so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we
          use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.</p>
