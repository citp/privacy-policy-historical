# BabyList Privacy Policy

#### Baby List, Inc.

Effective Date: March 24, 2016

#### Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy explains what information will be collected by Baby List, Inc. (“Baby List,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) when you access our Website, software, applications, products or related services (collectively, the “Service”) and how the information will be used. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.  Each time you use our Service you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy at that time. 

#### DEFINITIONS

This Privacy Policy uses certain capitalized terms that have particular meanings. Sometimes, those terms are defined when they are first used. In addition, and for ease of reference, the following terms are defined in this section: 

  * “ _App_ ” means any Baby List software application, including, but not limited to, the Baby List Android and/or iPad and/or iPhone software application. 
  * “ _Browsing Information_ ” means information about your use of the Service, or your computer’s (or other access device, such as an iPad or smartphone) interaction with the Service. Browsing Information also includes certain of the information described in the “Information Collected Automatically” section below.  This information is linked to a device identifier, such as the Internet Protocol (IP) address of your computer or device.  The App transmits information to us that we use to provide our services, assist you in troubleshooting, and improve our products, services, Website and App.  In general, Baby List does not use Browsing Information to identify you, but such information may be paired with Personal Information, or with other information that together, could be used to identify you. Additionally, third parties, such as analytics companies and advertising service providers may access, collect, store, and use Browsing Information, and they may use it to identify you.  
  * “ _Personal Information_ ” means information that directly identifies you, or that can directly identify you, such as your shipping and/or billing address, e-mail address, phone number, credit card information and/or your baby’s name and/or expected birth date.          

  * “ _Website_ ” means any websites, web pages, and any subpages (including mobile websites, web pages and subpages) under Baby List’s control, whether partial or otherwise. This includes but is not limited to www.babyli.st, any subpages, and the website from which these terms of use were accessed from. 



#### INFORMATION WE COLLECT

_Personal Information We Affirmatively Collect From You_

We may collect Personal Information about you, such as your first and last name, phone number, email address, physical address or credit card information, through our Service when (i) you register for an account on our Website or App, (ii) you sign up for our newsletter, (iii) you order from our Website or App, (iv) you give or receive a cash gift through our cash registry service or (v) you include Personal Information in User Content (as defined below).  Other information you may affirmatively provide to us is generally maintained along with Personal Information. You can choose not to provide any information that is requested of you by us. However, this may limit your ability to use the Service.  

Additionally, if a friend refers you to us by providing us with your e-mail address, we may send you a message.  However, we use your e-mail address only to send the friend’s message unless you otherwise affirmatively provide information to us. When you sign up for e-mails or register an account, we may ask you for your birthdate to make sure you are 18 or older and may use a technical measure, such as a cookie, to restrict your ability to change your age.  

In addition to collecting information on the Service, we may collect information from you when you communicate with us over the phone, including via text messages, or via e-mail. This information may include Personal Information. This information may be matched with, and stored in connection with Personal Information provided or collected in connection with the Service. 

We also may now or in the future receive Personal Information about you from third parties. For example, if you access our Website or Service through a third-party connection or log-in, including social networking services such as Facebook where you have a registered account, that third party may pass certain information about your use of its service to Baby List. This information could include, but is not limited to, the user ID associated with your account, an access token necessary to access that service, any information that you have permitted the third party to share with us, and any information you have made public in connection with that service. You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to the Baby List Service. 

_Information Collected Automatically_

#### HOW WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION

_Personal Information:_  Baby List will not rent or sell your Personal Information to others except with your explicit consent. To operate the Service, however, we may share your Personal Information with our agents, representatives and contractors so they can provide us with support services and other features and fulfill your orders.  We require these third parties not to use your Personal Information for any other purpose.  We may store Personal Information in locations outside the direct control of Baby List (for instance, on servers or databases co-located with hosting providers).

Non-personally identifiable information may be stored indefinitely. 

_Instances where we are required to share your information_ : Baby List will disclose your information where required to do so by law or subpoena or if we reasonably believe that such action is necessary to (a) comply with the law and the reasonable requests of law enforcement; (b) to enforce our Terms of Use or to protect the security or integrity of our Service and our property (including our intellectual property); and/or (c) to exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Baby List, our users or others.

#### YOUR CHOICES ABOUT RECEIVING MARKETING MESSAGES 

Baby List offers you the choice of receiving different types of communication and information related to our company, products and services. You may subscribe to e-newsletters or other publications or you may also elect to receive marketing communications and other special offers from us via email. To help us understand whether we are providing information of interest to you, we may include software code or other tracking technologies in our emails to monitor whether you opened a particular email, whether you have clicked on the images and/or links in the email, the date and time the message was opened, and whether your computer is capable of receiving HTML-based email. We endeavor to allow you to unsubscribe at any time from our email programs by clicking on the unsubscribe link at the bottom of any email message.  You may also access and manage your preferences from your account, when available, or by contacting us directly at support@babyli.st. We reserve the right to send you service announcements or similar administrative messages, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them. 

_HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION; SECURITY AND PASSWORDS_

Baby List takes what it believes to be commercially reasonable physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect Personal Information. However, since no security system is impenetrable and "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet, we cannot guarantee the security of Personal Information or Browsing Information. 

If you create an account to use the Service, you may be asked to choose a password for your account, which can be used to access information associated with your account (including Personal Information). You should choose a password that is not easy to guess, and does not use words that you would find in a dictionary. Do not disclose your password to any other person. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and account, and we will attribute activities that occur using your account information (e.g., through the use of your password) to you. If you suspect that your password has been compromised contact us immediately at support@babyli.st. 

#### COMPROMISE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

In the event that Personal Information is compromised as a result of a breach of security, Baby List will promptly notify those persons whose Personal Information has been compromised, in accordance with the notification procedures set forth in this Privacy Policy, or as otherwise required by applicable law. In the event that we or our Service suffers a data security breach that requires us to provide you with notice, such as under applicable law, you consent to allow us to provide you with such notice by sending an e-mail to the primary e-mail address that is associated with your account. 

#### NOTIFICATION PROCEDURES

It is our policy to provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business related purposes, to you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through conspicuous posting of such notice on the Service, as determined by Baby List in its sole discretion. We reserve the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to you, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification as described in this Privacy Policy. 

#### HOW YOU CAN UPDATE YOUR INFORMATION

Baby List believes strongly in giving you the ability to access and update or correct your Personal Information. You may update your Personal Information by logging into your account on Baby List’s Website, when available, or by contacting us directly at support@babyli.st.

Baby List is not designed for children and does not provide privacy measures to protect children. If you believe your child has provided Baby List with personally identifiable data and you would like to have the data removed, please contact us at support@babyli.st. Baby List does not knowingly target children under 18, and makes reasonable efforts to ensure that the targeting of children under 18 does not occur.  We urge parents to monitor their children’s use of all digital media.
