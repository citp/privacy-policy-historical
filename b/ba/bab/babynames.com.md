# Your Privacy

This site is owned and operated by Moss Gathering Partners, herein referred to as "Moss Gathering".

We take great care in making sure our users are not bombarded with email, and we will **_never_** sell or share your personal information with any other company. When you receive a special offer from one of our advertisers, it will come from our server, as we send them out on the advertiser's behalf.
