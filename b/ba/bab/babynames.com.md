# BabyNames.com Privacy Policy

rev. March 2009

 **BabyNames.com** has created this statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to protecting the privacy of our visitors. The following summarizes our information-gathering and dissemination practices for our website.

## Opt-In Mailing List

You have the option to add or remove yourself from the monthly newsletter and mailings for special discounts and offers from our partners. To change your subscription, login and go to MY PROFILE.

We take great care in making sure our users are not bombarded with email, and we will **_never sell_** or share your personal information with any other company. When you receive a special offer from one of our advertisers, it will come from our server, as we send them out on the advertiser's behalf. We also ensure that every email you receive from BabyNames.com contains a link to remove yourself from the mailing list, just in case you change your mind.

To add or remove yourself from the mailing list, go to your [MY PROFILE](http://www.babynames.com/user/myprofile.php).
