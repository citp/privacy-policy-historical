# BabyNames.com Privacy Policy

This site is owned and operated by Moss Gathering LLC, a Nevada Limited Liability Company. 

rev. April 25, 2018

**BabyNames.com** has created this statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to protecting the privacy of our visitors. The following summarizes our information-gathering and dissemination practices for our website.

## Your Personal Information

You may use many features on the BabyNames.com website without inputting any personal information into the website. To become a basic member, we only ask for your e-mail address, a unique username, and password. No other information is required. Registered users may choose to enter more information like first and last name and baby's due date by going to **My BabyNames** in the menu and then **My Settings**. On the My Settings page, you may enter or change your personal information and choose which of these are viewable to the public by clicking on **Privacy Settings**.

## User Profiles

Upon registration, BabyNames.com creates a public user profile page for you. Each part of your profile can be hidden from public view by logging in and going to MY PROFILE and then PRIVACY SETTINGS. The following fields are set to public by default, but can be changed at any time: 

  * Your Profile Picture
  * Username
  * Gender
  * Parent Type/Family Type
  * Interests
  * Online Status
  * Community Title & Badges
  * # Message Board Posts
  * Last Message Board Activity
  * VIP Expiration Date



## Making a Purchase

When you make a purchase on the BabyNames.com, we interface with our merchant provider, Stripe.com. Your name and credit card information is sent securely with encryption to the Stripe.com server. No credit card information is stored on BabyNames.com whatsoever, and is completely unrelated to your BabyNames.com user profile.

## Your IP Address

**BabyNames.com** records user IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our server, administer our site and identify malicious visitors on the message boards. IP addresses remain private, and are not displayed or posted on the site to any other user.

## Links

This site contains advertising and links to other sites, however we assume no liability and are not responsible for any practices of such third party Web sites, including their privacy practices or content.

## Security

**BabyNames.com** has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information by third parties. We use SSL encryption, firewall intervention, software and hardware redundancy and a comprehensive data backup schedule. Nonetheless, we cannot guarantee the protection of such information against loss, misuse or alteration.

## Opt-In Mailing List

You have the option to add or remove yourself from the monthly newsletter and mailings for special discounts and offers from our partners. We take great care in making sure our users do not receive unwanted email. BabyNames.com sends a periodic newsletter to our members who have opted in to receive it. We will never opt you into our email communications without your permission and we will never sell your information to third parties. IF you receive a special offer from one of our partners, it will always come from our server, as we send them out on the advertiser's behalf. We also ensure that every email you receive from BabyNames.com contains a link to remove yourself from the mailing list. To manage your BabyNames.com email settings, go to our [Newsletter Page](http://www.babynames.com/newsletter/).

## Children's Guidelines

**BabyNames.com** discourages users under the age of 13 from entering any personal information without consent from a parent or legal guardian. **BabyNames.com** does not condone posting or distribution of personally identifiable contact information of any individual, including baby's surnames. BabyNames.com does not entice (by the prospect of a special game, prize or other activity) any person to divulge more information than is needed to participate in any given activity.
