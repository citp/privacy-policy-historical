  <h1>Privacy Statement for Babbel</h1>

  
  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  
    
      <p>“Babbel” is a service offered by Lesson Nine GmbH, Bergmannstr. 5, 10961
Berlin, Germany. Through this privacy statement, Lesson Nine wishes to
inform you of how your personal data are processed and in what form some
of these data are made accessible for other users. All personal data are
treated with the utmost care at Lesson Nine. All the necessary steps are
taken to guarantee the security of these data. This privacy statement
supplements the General Terms and Conditions of Business of Babbel.
Please write to <a href="mailto:privacy@babbel.com">privacy@babbel.com</a> if you have any queries relating to this document.</p>

<h3 id="which-data-are-stored">1. Which data are stored?</h3>

<h4 id="personal-data">1.1. Personal data</h4>

<p>When you register with us, we record and save your basic data such as
name and email address together with other contact information such as
user name and password. We may receive further information from you via
the website (e.g. if you fill in your personal profile) or if you
communicate with us. The following registration data are accessible for
other Babbel users:</p>

<ul>
  <li>selected language combinations</li>
</ul>

<p>Other data provided voluntarily are also generally accessible for other
users of Babbel; however, you can disable such access at
<a href="http://www.babbel.com/users/profile/edit">http://www.babbel.com/users/profile/edit</a>. This concerns first name,
surname, gender, age and any other voluntary details that you can save
in your profile.</p>

<h4 id="cookies">1.2. Cookies</h4>

<p>After you have logged in (with user name and password), Babbel uses
cookies with which you can be identified for the duration of your visit.
Cookies are also used generally on the website, e.g. to show ads or to
measure the success rates of advertising. Cookies are small files stored
on your computer or mobile device which identify the device to our
server and also provide additional data. Other technologies such as
pixel tags, web bugs, web storage and similar files fulfill the same
purpose. A cookie is saved on your computer.</p>

<p>One type of cookie automatically expires after your session has ended.
This is called a session cookie. Your user settings, in particular, are
saved as session cookies so that Babbel can always be used in the form
you require. Another permanently stored anonymous cookie contains the
version number of your Flash player. When you log in, you also have the
option of saving your user name and password locally in encrypted form
on your computer. You can save this cookie permanently for automatic log
in with the function “Log me in automatically on this computer”. In
addition to this, user settings, such as language selection, language
recognition settings, user IDs for various applications, are saved in
both session cookies and permanent cookies by Babbel in order to
facilitate the use of Babbel.</p>

<p>You switch off the use of cookies for our website or in general in the
settings of your Internet browser. You can find out how this functions
from the website of your Internet browser supplier. For the Internet
Explorer you can find the relevant instructions at
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Block-or-allow-cookies">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Block-or-allow-cookies</a>,
for Firefox at
<a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/enable-and-disable-cookies-website-preferences">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/enable-and-disable-cookies-website-preferences</a>,
for Apple Safari at
<a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/index?page=search&amp;fac=all&amp;q=cookies%20safari">http://support.apple.com/kb/index?page=search&amp;fac=all&amp;q=cookies%20safari</a>
and for Google Chrome at
<a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?hl=en">https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?hl=en</a>. However,
deactivating cookies will mean that a number of functionalities, e.g.
automatically logging in to the website, will no longer operate as
intended.</p>

<h4 id="log-files">1.3. Log files</h4>

<p>Each time a page is called up, access data are saved in a protocol file,
the server log. The data record thus saved contains the following data:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your IP address (by means of which your computer can be
unambiguously identified)</li>
  <li>the remote host (name and IP address of the computer requesting
the page)</li>
  <li>the time, the status, the quantity of data transferred and the
Internet page from which you accessed the requested page (referrer)</li>
  <li>The product and version information of the browser used (user agent)</li>
</ul>

<p>Lesson Nine uses a standardized webserver logfile format for this
purpose. Provided these data are not urgently required for the technical
maintenance of the system or for the system security, they are
anonymized instantly and the original protocols are deleted.
Anonymization takes place by removal or truncation of the IP address by
allocating a code not assigned to a user. Any allocation to an
identified or identifiable person is therefore no longer possible.
Lesson Nine therefore uses the protocol data (logs) exclusively in
anonymized form for statistical evaluations, hence without any
allocation or references to your personal details. In this way, Lesson
Nine determines, for instance, on which days and at which times Babbel
is particularly popular and what volume of data is generated on the
Babbel web servers. Furthermore, Lesson Nine can detect possible errors
through the log files, e.g. faulty links or program errors, and thus use
the log files for the ongoing development and refinement of Babbel.
Lesson Nine does not link the page requests and usage information to
individual persons.</p>

<h4 id="google-analytics">1.4. Google Analytics</h4>

<p>This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by
Google, Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics uses “cookies”, which are text
files placed on your computer, to help the website analyze how you use
the site. As anonymization is activated for the data we collect, your IP
address is truncated by Google within member states of the European
Union or in other signatory countries to the Treaty creating the
European Economic Area and only then is it transferred to the USA.</p>

<p>Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transferred to a
Google server in the USA and truncated there. On behalf of the operator
of this website, Google will use this information for the purpose of
evaluating your use of the website in order to compile reports on
website activity for the website operator and to provide other services
relating to website activity and Internet usage. The IP address
transferred by your browser within the scope of Google Analytics will
not be combined with other data from Google. You may prevent the saving
of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser;
however, please note that if you do this, you may not be able to use the
full functionality of this website. Furthermore, you can prevent the
data captured by the cookie and relating to your use of the website
(incl. your IP address) from being captured and processed by Google by
downloading and installing the browser plugin available at the following
link : <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en">http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en</a>.</p>

<p>Further information on the use of the data and privacy policy at Google
Analytics is available at
<a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html">http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html</a> or
<a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=en">https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=en</a>. Babbel uses
Google Analytics exclusively in connection with the gat._anonymizeIp();
extension so that IP addresses are only recorded in truncated, i.e.
anonymized form.</p>

<h4 id="exchange-of-data-with-facebook-only-applies-to-registered-facebook-users">1.5. Exchange of data with Facebook (Only applies to registered Facebook users)</h4>

<p>We are taking part in a statistical program of the company Facebook,
1601 South California Avenue, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA, via which
Facebook users who display a similar usage profile to our existing
customers are detected (“Facebook Custom Audiences – Statistical
Twins”). As part of this program, email addresses of customers are
transferred in an anonymized form (known as a “hash”) to Facebook. The
email addresses cannot be derived from the data transmitted. Using the
same method, Facebook itself produces a hash of its users’ email
addresses, correlates these with the anonymized data and determines
whether one of our users with the same email address is registered with
Facebook.</p>

<p>Facebook guarantees that it does not store this correlation or use it
outside of the program. This is then employed as the basis on which to
determine any third parties who use Facebook in a similar way to the
customer, and we obtain an opportunity to address these people directly.
You do not receive any additional advertising or messages from us or
from Facebook as a result. If you are not registered at Facebook with
the same email address as you use for us, Facebook will not receive any
information about you. Under no circumstances do we find out whether you
are registered with Facebook and do not otherwise receive any data about
you.</p>

<p>You hereby give your consent to the anonymized transfer of your email
address in the form described previously. Although we do have every
reason to trust the assurances provided by Facebook, we wish to point
out that Facebook is not subject to German data protection law. You will
find further information on the purpose and scope of the data capture
and the further processing and use of the data by Facebook as well as
optional settings for protecting your privacy in the Facebook data
protection guidelines at: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/">https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/</a>.</p>

<h4 id="social-plugins">1.6. Social Plugins</h4>

<p>In some cases we also use social plugins on our website. This is done
using a technology supplied by “ShareIt”. In the process, social plugins
are incorporated from Facebook, Twitter and Google+. In the next section
we will tell you about the social plugins used here.</p>

<p><strong>Facebook Social Plugin</strong></p>

<p>Social plugins (“plugins”) from the social network facebook.com
(“Facebook”) are used on our website. Facebook is run by Facebook Inc.,
1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304 in USA.</p>

<p>If you call up a page on our website containing such a plugin, your
browser will establish a direct connection with Facebook’s servers. The
contents of the plugin are transferred by Facebook directly to your
browser which incorporates it in the website.</p>

<p>By incorporating the plugin, Facebook receives the information that you
have called up the relevant page on our website. If you logged into
Facebook, it can match your visit to your Facebook account.</p>

<p>The purpose of capturing data and the quantity of data collected
including the way in which they are processed and used by Facebook and
your rights in this regard and setting options to protect your privacy
can be taken from Facebook’s data protection information at:
<a href="http://www.facebook.com/policy.php">http://www.facebook.com/policy.php</a> If you are a member of Facebook and
you do not wish Facebook to collect data on you through our website and
link them to your membership data stored by Facebook, you must log out
of Facebook before visiting our website.</p>

<p>It is also possible to block Facebook social plugins through add-ons for
your browser, e.g. through “Facebook Blocker”.</p>

<p><strong>Use of the Twitter widget</strong></p>

<p>We also use so-called “widgets” from Twitter on our websites. When these
web pages are called up, a connection is established with Twitter
servers. The Twitter servers are in USA.</p>

<p>When a web page is called up containing a Twitter “widget”, Twitter
receives information that you have called up the page. The information
includes your IP address, the type of browser, the operating system and
the address of the website where the Twitter widget is located.</p>

<p>The Twitter widget also installs a cookie in the browser of your
terminal. In connection with the cookie, Twitter can theoretically see
which other pages you have visited if there are Twitter widgets
implemented on these pages too. Twitter itself states that it may also
use these data - if you have a Twitter account - to give you better
suggestions on suitable users. According to Twitter, it begins to delete
the data after a maximum of 10 days. The deletion itself is then to be
completed after a further week at the latest. If you have a Twitter
account, you may be able to make further settings on the use of your
data in your user account settings.</p>

<p>You will find further information in Twitter’s data protection notice
which you can call up here: <a href="http://twitter.com/privacy">http://twitter.com/privacy</a></p>

<p><strong>Use of Google “+1 button”</strong></p>

<p>We also use Google’s “+1 button”. When a web page containing a “+1
button” is called up, a connection is established with Google’s servers.
Google’s servers are predominantly to be found in USA. When the page is
called up, Google receives the information that you have called up the
relevant web page. This applies in particular if you happen to be logged
into one of Google’s various services at the time when you call up the
web pages.</p>

<p>According to Google, the +1 button is not used to record your visits to
websites. In particular, Google states that the browser history is not
permanently stored. However, they also say that the data regarding your
visit are kept for a period of (normally) two weeks.</p>

<p>If you click on the +1 button, according to Google, information on your
Google profile, the address of the website on which the +1 button was
selected, your IP address and further information are stored by Google.
If you withdraw your recommendation by clicking again on the +1 button,
these data are deleted again.</p>

<p>Google also uses cookies to process information on the use of websites.
To find out how to handle cookies, please read the relevant passage on
cookies in our data protection notice.</p>

<p>We have no influence ourselves over the data which Google collects,
processes and uses when you call up a page. Please consult Google’s data
protection notice, therefore, which you can call up here:
<a href="http://www.google.com/intl/de/policies/privacy/">http://www.google.com/intl/de/policies/privacy/</a></p>

<h4 id="further-external-suppliers">1.7. Further external suppliers</h4>

<p>We use further external service providers for the purpose of optimizing
our services, carrying out advertising activities or for analyzing our
website for errors and in terms of its performance. Such service
providers may vary. For the sake of clarity, we have listed these
service providers in tabular format at the end of this data protection
notice under Clause 8, and in each case we have supplied further
information on the processing of data and on any opt-outs.</p>

<h4 id="personal-vocabulary">1.8. Personal vocabulary</h4>

<p>To enable Babbel users to conveniently revise their vocabulary, all
practiced words and sentences together with all results of exercises are
saved in the user’s personal vocabulary. These data can be viewed by
other users only in the form of high scores, which do not indicate which
specific words or sentences are being practiced but merely reveal how
many exercises have been successfully completed.</p>

<h4 id="image-uploads-and-image-scores">1.9. Image uploads and image scores</h4>

<p>Babbel users can upload images for general use in areas such as the
forum.</p>

<h4 id="messages">1.10. Messages</h4>

<p>All private messages between Babbel users via the Babbel website are
saved on the Babbel servers. These private data are not made accessible
to other users under any circumstances. The messages are deleted as soon
as both communicating parties have deleted them from their mailboxes.
Public messages in discussion forums are saved permanently provided you
do not delete them yourself. The files remain saved even after you have
terminated the service. Other users are able to recognize whether you
take part in any activities within the discussion forum. Users with whom
you are friends may also receive a message about your activities.</p>

<h4 id="newsletter--emails">1.11. Newsletter &amp; emails</h4>

<p>We send you emails for a variety of reasons. These may include
confirmations of an order or of a registration. However, communication
may also concern information about our services, provided you have not
revoked your consent for such usage, which you can of course do at any
time at <a href="http://www.babbel.com/users/settings/edit">http://www.babbel.com/users/settings/edit</a>. Any email messages
we send are saved by us and any emails that may be regarded as business
letters will not be deleted during the statutory retention period. We
also record any email addresses to which a message could not be
delivered in order to request an updated email address. Furthermore,In
the case of our newsletter emails, we record (e.g. by means of a
so-called “tracking pixel”) whether an email is opened and which links
in the email are clicked on; we do so to optimize our offers and tailor
their design to meet your needs. We use these data to enable us to send
newsletter contents to match your profile. If you wish to object to this
use of your data, you can do so by
<a href="http://www.babbel.com/users/settings/edit">canceling</a> our newsletters.
We also use service providers from USA for sending our emails. We make
sure that the statutory conditions for the cross-border use of personal
details as defined by §§ 4b, 4c BDSG (German Federal Data Protection
Act) are fulfilled.</p>

<h4 id="apps">1.12. Apps</h4>

<p>As well as our website, we also offer apps for various smartphone
operating systems. Here too we collect data on the use of the
application by means of software from external suppliers for the purpose
of detecting and correcting errors and to improve our applications.
However, no data are collected in the process from which any external
supplier could directly establish any personal connection. In this way
we receive aggregated information on how the apps are used and which
features are especially popular, and from this information we can draw
conclusions for future improvements in product development. You can
prevent this analysis by “opting out”:
<a href="http://optoutmobile.com/optout/index.html">http://optoutmobile.com/optout/index.html</a> In addition, we will also be
informed if apps crash - if you have enabled this through your device
settings. These so-called crash reports are provided by external
suppliers. However, no data are processed from which any external
supplier could derive any personal connection.</p>

<h3 id="purpose-of-storing-the-data">2. Purpose of storing the data</h3>

<p>The purpose of gathering, saving, processing and using the data is
solely to facilitate, maintain and develop the “Babbel” service provided
by Lesson Nine. This also comprises winning new customers and sales to
existing ones. In particular, part of the ongoing development involves
the use of anonymous statistics on the usage of the services. Movement
profiles of individual users on the website are not created.</p>

<h3 id="no-forwarding-of-data-to-third-parties">3. No forwarding of data to third parties</h3>

<p>Lesson Nine does not forward the personal data of its users to third
parties unless the user has given his/her explicit consent or there is a
legal requirement to forward the data. Personal details may also be
passed on to third parties if this is legally permissible, and it is
necessary to pass them on for the fulfillment of our contractual
obligations towards our customers. In the case of payment processing,
the data for processing the payment transaction are forwarded to the
payment services provider if you do not supply the data directly. If you
send your payment data directly to the payment services provider, we
receive only very limited data. In such cases, we are merely informed
whether or not the transaction relating to a specific transaction number
has actually taken place. In such cases we do not receive your account
data. If any third-party rights have been violated (in particular rights
relating to copyright, trademarks, names and symbols) by the user, the
user data will not be forwarded to the rights holder unless the latter
conclusively demonstrates his/her claims to Lesson Nine.</p>

<h3 id="minors">4. Minors</h3>

<p>As a matter of principle, Babbel is directed towards users who have
reached the age of majority. Any use by minors without the consent of
their legal guardians is prohibited. Lesson Nine therefore reserves the
right to delete all data relating to underage users if no consent from
the legal guardians is available.</p>

<h3 id="data-security">5. Data security</h3>

<p>Lesson Nine employs safety precautions to guarantee that your data are
protected against loss, modification or misuse. To this end, Lesson Nine
works with constantly updated firewalls meeting the industry standard as
well as other security systems. At the same time, the user should be
aware of the fact that one hundred per cent protection against attacks
cannot be guaranteed because of the continual appearance of new viruses
and other means of attacking the protected data systems of Internet
services. Lesson Nine will instigate civil and criminal proceedings
against any attack by hackers and the like and will inform the users of
any cases in which their data have been compromised.</p>

<h3 id="information-correction-and-deletion">6. Information, correction and deletion</h3>

<h4 id="right-to-information-on-stored-data">6.1. Right to information on stored data</h4>

<p>Every user has the right to obtain information from Lesson Nine on the
personal data that has been saved in relation to him/her. If the request
for information is not conveyed to Lesson Nine in writing, hence
particularly in the case of enquiries by telephone or email, the user
must provide a postal address to which the information can then be sent.
In the request for information, the user must additionally provide the
following details for identification purposes: user name, first name and
surname, maiden name (if appropriate), email address, postal address and
date of birth. The information is sent by post to the address provided
by the user.</p>

<h4 id="corrections">6.2. Corrections</h4>

<p>If the user alters or corrects the details that he/she has provided and
deletes old entries, the data previously entered by the user will be
completely deleted automatically. An application for correction or
deletion is not required. You can edit your personal data at any time at
<a href="http://www.babbel.com/users/about/edit">http://www.babbel.com/users/about/edit</a>. This notwithstanding, the user
has the right at all times to demand the correction of any inaccurate
data concerning him/her stored with Babbel. However, the easiest option
is for users to correct any such entries themselves.</p>

<h4 id="deletion-of-data">6.3. Deletion of data</h4>

<p>Should the user demand any alteration, correction or deletion of his/her
personal data, this may take place by email or letter. To ensure correct
identification of the user, the request must at least contain the
following details:</p>

<ul>
  <li>User name</li>
  <li>First name and surname</li>
  <li>Email address</li>
  <li>Postal address</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note that due to caching systems, search engines, the
interposition of proxy servers and the like, deleted data may continue
to remain accessible even though they are no longer present within our
systems.</p>

<h3 id="contact">7. Contact</h3>

<p>The trust of our users is important to us. Lesson Nine therefore wishes
to provide its users with full information on the processing of their
personal data at all times. If any queries remain unanswered by this
privacy statement or if more detailed information is required on any
point, please contact the following address at any time:</p>
