# Privacy Policy | Immediate Media Co – The Special Interest Content and Platform Company

Immediate Media Company Limited (‘Immediate’ or ‘we’) is committed to protecting your personal information when you are using our websites and applications (our ‘services’). Whenever you provide such information, we are legally obliged to use your information in line with all laws concerning the protection of personal information, including the Data Protection Act 1998.

We collect and use different information depending on whether you are using our websites or mobile apps and this Privacy Policy explains how we use that information and in particular the following:

  * TYPES INFORMATION WE MAY COLLECT ABOUT YOU
  * HOW WE LOOK AFTER YOUR INFORMATION
  * HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION
  * SHARING YOUR INFORMATION WITH OTHER PEOPLE
  * YOUR RIGHTS AND FURTHER INFORMATION



Please note that our services may contain links to websites or apps that are owned and operated by third parties. These websites and apps will have their own privacy policies that govern the collection and use of your personal information which you should review. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of third party websites so your use of such websites is at your own risk.

### **Types of information we may collect about you**

When you sign up to our services, such as our website forums, mobile applications, regular newsletters, enter competitions, buy a magazine subscription, order products or take up a reader offer we may ask for personal information about you. This can include information such as your name, e-mail address, postal address, telephone or mobile number or date of birth. Different services may ask for different types of information.

If you are aged 16 or under, you must get your parent/guardian’s permission before you provide us with your personal information. Unless you have this consent you are not allowed to give us your information.  
Here is some more specific detail about the information we may collect:

  * **Information you give to us:  **information that you provide by filling in forms on our services. This includes information provided at the time of registering to use an app or website, subscribing to any services, posting material, filling in a survey or requesting further services. We may also ask you for information when you enter a competition or promotion and when you report a problem with our services. 
  * **Information about your use of our websites:**  we may collect your IP address and use cookies on our websites. For full information about our use of cookies please see our [ **Cookies Policy**](http://www.immediate.co.uk/cookies-policy/). 
  * **Information about the device you are using** : if you download one of our apps we may collect information about the device you use to access the app, including, where available, the device’s unique identifiers, operating system, browser type and mobile network information as well as the device’s telephone number, for system administration and to report statistical information to our advertisers.  
  * **Information about your use of our app:**  We may also collect  information about your use of the app such as what pages you look at and what elements you tap or pages you interact with. 
  * **Information about your location** : when you use one of our location-enabled services, we may collect information about your actual location but we will always ask you about this first. You can change your mind at any time by updating your preferences on your device.

### **How we look after your information**

The information that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area (this includes the EU, Iceland, Norway and Lichtenstein). Your information will be processed by staff where it is necessary to fulfil an order, process payment details or provide you with other support services.

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your information, we cannot guarantee its security and when giving us your information you do so at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.

We will hold your information on our systems for as long as is necessary for the relevant service, or as long as is set out in any relevant contract you hold with us. If you change your registration profile to opt-out of receiving communications from us, your record will stay on the system so we can ensure that we do not contact you in the future. If you wish to cancel your registration with any of Immediate’s websites, you may do so by contacting us using the details available in the ‘Contact Us’ section of the website or by emailing dataprotection@immediate.co.uk.
