BabyCenter L.L.C. cares about your privacy and wants you to be familiar with how we collect, use, and disclose information. This Privacy Policy describes our practices in connection with information that we or our service providers collect through the website, emails, or application (hereinafter the "Service") operated and controlled by us from which you are accessing this Privacy Policy. By providing personal information to us or by using the Service, you acknowledge that you have read and understand this Privacy Policy.

## Use by minors

If your child has submitted personal information and you would like to request that such personal information be removed, please contact us as explained below under "Contacting us." 

## Information collection

We may ask you to submit personal information in order for you to benefit from certain features (such as newsletter subscriptions, tips/pointers, or order processing) or to participate in a particular activity (such as sweepstakes, surveys, or other promotions). You will be informed of which information is required and which information is optional.

We may combine information you submit with other information to provide better service to you, customise the Service based on your preferences, compile and analyse statistics and trends, and otherwise administer and improve the Service for your use. We may combine personally identifiable information with passively collected information in order to personalise offers and the Service for you (for example, combined information may allow us to recommend products or features to you based on what you have liked in the past). We also have a direct relationship with the following ad technology partners who may have information about you that may be used to personalise the advertisements you receive when using our Service:

If you submit any personal information relating to another individual to us, you represent that you have the authority to do so and to permit us to use the information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. 

## Sensitive information

Unless we specifically request or invite it, we ask that you not send us, and you not disclose, any sensitive personal information (e.g., National Insurance numbers, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or philosophical beliefs, health, sex life or sexual orientation, criminal background, trade union membership, or biometric or genetic data for the purpose of uniquely identifying an individual) on or through the Service or otherwise to us. 

## Automatic information collection and use

We and our service providers may collect certain information automatically as you navigate around the Service. Please read the [Cookie Policy](https://web.archive.org/e25023540/cookie-policy) for detailed information about the cookies and other tracking technologies used on the Service.

We and our service providers may also automatically collect and use information in the following ways:

  *  **Through your browser** : Certain information is collected by most browsers, such as your Media Access Control (MAC) address, computer type (Windows or Mac), screen resolution, operating system name and version, and Internet browser type and version. We may collect similar information, such as your device type and identifier, if you access the Service through a mobile device. We use this information to analyse statistics and trends, and to ensure that the Service functions properly.
  *  **Through email** : We use email-tracking pixels, which are small image files embedded within an email, that allow us to understand your engagement with our emails and to serve you interest-based advertising.
  *  **IP address** : Your IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider. An IP address is identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever a user visits the Service, along with the time of the visit and the pages visited. Collecting IP addresses is standard practice and is done automatically by many online services. We use IP addresses for purposes such as calculating Service usage levels, diagnosing server problems, and administering the Service. We may also derive your approximate location from your IP address.
  *  **Device Information** : We may collect information about your mobile device, such as a unique device identifier, to understand how you use the Service.

## Do Not Track signals

Web browser Do Not Track (DNT) settings are not enabled on the Sites. Therefore, no action will be taken with respect to "do-not-track" configurations in your Internet browser. By default, you will receive a personalised experience while browsing our website. 

## Ad choices

The majority of advertisements on our Sites is served to you on our behalf by our third-party ad-serving contractor Doubleclick. However, we do allow third parties (such as advertisers, ad agencies, and ad networks) to serve some of the advertisements on our Sites. Please remember that BabyCenter does not have access to, or control over, the placement of cookies or other tracking mechanisms that these third parties may use or the information these third parties may collect. Such third parties may use cookies that have been placed on your computer to gather information about you and understand the types of pages visited by you and content that you view on our Sites and other websites. These third parties may associate your browser with relevant interest categories and use these categories to show you interest-based advertisements. For example, if you frequently visit travel websites, they may direct to you ads related to travel.

You do have choices about the collection of information by third parties on our website. Many, but not all, third parties engaged in interest-based advertising participate in an industry-wide self-regulatory program that has developed consumer-friendly standards for interest-based advertising. You can [opt out](https://www.aboutads.info/) of interest-based advertising offered by participating third parties. With respect to third parties that do not participate in this program, they may or may not offer a mechanism for opting out of interest-based advertising.

In addition to the foregoing, you can set your browser to notify you when a cookie is sent or to refuse or delete cookies altogether, but certain features of the Sites might not work without certain cookies. 

## California privacy rights

If you are a California resident, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits you to request information regarding the disclosure of your personal information by BabyCenter L.L.C. to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please [submit a request to our customer service team](https://web.archive.org/e536987/contact-us). Please allow thirty (30) days after receipt of your request for a response to be provided. 

## Cross-border transfer

Your personal information may be stored and processed in any country where we have facilities or service providers. And by using our Service or by providing consent to us (where required by law), your information may be transferred to countries outside of your country of residence, including to the United States, which may provide for different data protection rules than in your country. Appropriate contractual and other measures are in place to protect personal information when it is transferred to our affiliates or third parties in other countries.

Some non-European Economic Area (EEA) countries are recognised by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of data protection according to EEA standards (the full list of these countries is available [here](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection_en)). For transfers from the EEA to countries not considered adequate by the European Commission, we have ensured that adequate measures are in place, including by ensuring that the recipient is bound by [EU Standard Contractual Clauses, EU-US Privacy Shield Certification, or an EU-approved code of conduct or certification], to protect your personal information. You may obtain a copy of these measures by contacting our data protection officer in accordance with the "Contacting us" section below. 

## Security

We seek to use reasonable organisational, technical, and administrative measures designed to protect personal information under our control. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or data storage system can be guaranteed to be 100 percent secure. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you have with us has been compromised), please immediately notify us in accordance with the "Contacting us" section below. 

## Retention period

We will retain your personal information for as long as needed or permitted in light of the purpose(s) for which it was obtained. The criteria used to determine our retention periods include: (i) the length of time we have an ongoing relationship with you and provide the Service to you; (ii) whether there is a legal obligation to which we are subject; and (iii) whether retention is advisable in light of our legal position (such as in regard to applicable statutes of limitations, litigation, or regulatory investigations). 

## Third-party sites and services

This Privacy Policy does not address, and we are not responsible for, the privacy, information, or other practices of any third parties, including any third party operating any site or online service (including, without limitation, any application) that is available through this Service or to which this Service contains a link. The availability of, or inclusion of a link to, any such site or property on the Service does not imply endorsement of it by us or by our affiliates.
