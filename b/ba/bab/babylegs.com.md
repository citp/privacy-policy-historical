**Types of Information Gathered:** Through your use of our Services, we gather the following types of information:

**Use of Cookies:** "Cookies" are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable us to customize your experience and store your preferences.

**Security of Personal Information:** BabyLegs® takes reasonable measures to secure your personal information from unauthorized use and disclosure both online and offline. Whenever we collect personal information (such as credit card data), that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way. You may verify this by looking for a closed lock icon at the bottom of your web browser, or looking for "https" at the beginning of the address of the Web page. While we use encryption to protect personal information online, we also protect your information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computer(s) and servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment. With respect to credit card numbers, only the last four digits of your credit card number are visible on our system to our employees. However, please note that no website is completely immune from potential security breaches. In order to increase the security of your personal information, we highly recommend that you vigilantly guard your password. If you have reason to believe that your personal information has been accessed without your permission, please change your password immediately and notify us at info@babylegs.com.

While we reserve the right to share aggregated non-personally identifiable information with third parties for any reason, we will not share your Personally Identifiable Information without your express consent. We may use your personal information without your prior consent when we have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable Terms of Use, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against imminent harm to the rights, property or safety of BABYLEGS®, its users or the public as required or permitted by law.
