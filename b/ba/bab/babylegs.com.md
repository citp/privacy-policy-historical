BABYLEGS LLC Privacy Policy
The information we obtain from you is primarily for communication purposes and to
assist us in serving you. Additionally it helps us to personalize and continually improve
your user experience with BABYLEGS LLC products and services.
Scope of Privacy Policy: This Privacy Policy applies only to the personal information
you provide and we collect through our Services. By “personal information,” we mean
information that identifies you personally.
This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and hereby made a part of the BABYLEGS LLC
Terms of Use. You can view the Terms of Use at:
http://www.babylegs.net/newWeb/BLTerms.pdf
Types of Information Gathered: Through your use of our Services, we gather the
following types of information:
        Information You Give Us: We receive and securely store any information you
        enter on our Website or voluntarily provide to us in any manner, including your
        name, email address, mailing shipping and billing addresses and, for online
        purchases, credit card or other payment information. We may use this
        information to communicate with you. If you wish not to receive
        communications from us, please notify us via email at info@babylegs.com.
        Automatic Information: By accessing our Website, certain information, such as
        Internet protocol (IP) addresses, navigation through the Website, the software
        used and the time spent, along with other similar information, will be stored on
        our servers. These will not specifically identify you. The information will be used
        internally only for Website traffic analysis.
        Use of Cookies: “Cookies” are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your
        computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable us to customize your
        experience and store your preferences.
Security of Personal Information: BABYLEGS LLC takes reasonable measures to
secure your personal information from unauthorized use and disclosure both online and
offline. Whenever we collect personal information (such as credit card data), that
information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way. You may verify this by
looking for a closed lock icon at the bottom of your web browser, or looking for “https”
at the beginning of the address of the Web page.
While we use encryption to protect personal information online, we also protect your
information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job
( for example, billing or customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable
information. The computer(s) and servers in which we store personally identifiable


information are kept in a secure environment. With respect to credit card numbers, only
the last four digits of your credit card number are visible on our system to our employees.
However, please note that no website is completely immune from potential security
breaches. In order to increase the security of your personal information, we highly
recommend that you vigilantly guard your password. If you have reason to believe that
your personal information has been accessed without your permission, please change
your password immediately and notify us at info@babylegs.com.
Information Shared with Third Parties: We will not share your personal information
with any third party. While we reserve the right to share aggregated non-personally
identifiable information with third parties for any reason, we will not share your
Personally Identifiable Information without your express consent. We may use your
personal information without your prior consent when we have a good faith belief that
access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a)
satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request,
(b) enforce applicable Terms of Use, including investigation of potential violations
thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d)
protect against imminent harm to the rights, property or safety of BABYLEGS LLC, its
users or the public as required or permitted by law. From time to time, we may
supplement Personally Identifiable Information collected on our Website with
information collected by third parties.
Your Access and Control Over Information: You may opt out of any future contact
from us at any time. You may do the following at any time by contacting us via the e-
mail address or phone number given on our Website:
      • See what data we have about you, if any;
      • Change or correct any data we have about you;
      • Have us delete any data we have about you; or
      • Express any concern you have about our use of your data.
Changes and Updates to Privacy Policy and/or Terms of Use: As our business
changes, our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use will change as well. You should check
our Website regularly for changes.
