We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers.

Our Commitment To Data Security: 

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. 

The online transactions at BabyHopes.com are handled with industry-standard SSL encryption. It's easy to tell when you are protected by encryption -- the lock or key at the bottom of your browser changes color or is no longer broken. This may vary depending on your browser. If you see https:// instead of http:// at the top of the browser, this also means that what you are doing is being encrypted.

All credit card numbers are encrypted and stored in the secure server until the transaction has been authorised. Once authorised, the encrypted credit card number is totally erased from the server.

Our Commitment To Children's Privacy:   
Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.

You can access all your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain by [contacting us](http://www.earthsmagic.com/support-center/) via our contact form. We use this procedure to better safeguard your information. 

You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable information by sending us a request that credibly shows error. 

To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.
