We review our information collection, storage and processing practices, as well as restrict access to personal information to a limited set of company employees or service providers that are subject to the obligation of strict confidentiality as relates to that information, and who will be subject to discipline, including termination, if they violate that obligation.

### **How will you know whether BabyPips.com’s Privacy Policy has changed?**

We may change this Privacy Policy at any time, but we will give notice of any material changes (or any notices that we are required to give you) on our website and/or in email messages.  When required by law, we will obtain your consent or reconsent of this Privacy Policy.
