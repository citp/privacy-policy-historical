      <p><strong>BabyPips.com does not send SPAM or sell email addresses.</strong></p>
      <p><b>We will NOT rent, trade, or   release your name to <em>any </em>third party for <em>any</em> reason - ever. </b></p>
      <p><strong>We respect YOUR email privacy and <em>hate spam with   a passion.
      </em></strong></p>
      <p>BabyPips.com LLC ("BabyPips.com" or "babypips.com"  or "we" or "us") is committed to protecting and respecting  your privacy. This Privacy Statement sets out our privacy policy and explains  what we do with the personal information that we collect from you. Please read  the following to understand our practices regarding personal information and  how they affect you as you use our features and services. This statement  discloses our current privacy practices; if we make material changes to these  practices, we will announce them. If you have any questions or concerns  regarding this statement, you should contact babypips.com site coordinator at <a href="mailto:legal@babypips.com">legal@babypips.com</a>.</p>
      <p>        This Privacy Policy answers the following questions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What information does BabyPips.com gather about you? </li>
        <li>How does BabyPips.com use your personal information? </li>
        <li>How do we use "IP addresses"? </li>
        <li>Will BabyPips.com disclose any of your personal  information? </li>
        <li>How do we respect children's privacy? </li>
        <li>What else should you know about your privacy? </li>
        <li>How will you know whether BabyPips.com's privacy policy  has changed? </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>What Information Does BabyPips.com Gather About You?</strong><strong><br>
        </strong><br>
        BabyPips.com collects information about our readers so that we can provide a  more interesting and useful service, as well as more appropriate advertising.  We ask for your name and email address if you sign up for special or  personalized services, such as our discussion boards or email newsletters. We  may also  ask for this information at other times, such as when you enter  contests or other promotions sponsored by BabyPips.com. We  sometimes conduct surveys as well, although you do not have to respond to them.</p>
      <p>        If you use our recommendation service to email one of our  articles to a friend, you will need to provide us with your friend's email  address and your email address as a return address. We will automatically send  this person a one-time email, with the recommended article attached, as well as  invite your friend to visit and register with our site. We will not use these  email addresses for any other purpose.</p>
      <p>        We collect IP addresses for site security and to help us  understand how people use our sites so that we can improve our sites and our  users' respective experiences. </p>
      <p><strong>How Does BabyPips.com Use Your Personal Information?</strong><strong><br>
        </strong><br>
        BabyPips.com collects personal information to provide you, the user, with the  best and most personalized experience possible, and to provide our advertisers  with an efficient way to reach the right audience. In short, by knowing a  little about you, BabyPips.com can deliver more relevant content and  advertisements to you.</p>
      <p>        We conduct research on our users' demographics, interests,  and behavior based upon the information you provide us when you register or  participate in contests or other promotions on our site, or based upon the  information on our server log files. This research is compiled and analyzed on  an aggregated basis. We may also notify you of products, services, or areas of  our site that we think may interest you based on the information we've  received. If you would prefer us not to contact you for these purposes, simply click  the "unsubscribe" link found in our email messages.</p>
      <p><strong>How Do We Use "IP Addresses" and  "Cookies"?</strong> </p>
      <p><strong>IP Addresses</strong> <br>
        Your Web browser or email application automatically provides your Internet  Protocol address ("IP address") to other computers with which you  communicate over the Internet, so that they know where to send you information.</p>
      <p>        We receive an IP address each time you view one of our Web  pages, because the browser automatically reports it to us. We also may store  the IP address when you register with BabyPips.com, post a message, or buy  something from us.<br>
        We may use IP addresses for various purposes, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Diagnosing service or technology problems. </li>
        <li>Assessing and maintaining system security. </li>
        <li>Displaying the most appropriate advertising or content. </li>
        <li>Studying how people use our site and how we can improve  it. </li>
        <li>Reporting to advertisers about aggregate, but not  individual, information derived from IP addresses. </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Will BabyPips.com Disclose Any of Your Personal  Information?</strong><strong><br>
        </strong>&nbsp;<br>
        BabyPips.com will not disclose any personally identifiable information about  individual users, except as described in this Privacy Statement. We do not  give, rent, lend, or sell individual information to our advertisers, although  we do provide aggregate information. For example, we might tell an advertiser  that there are 20,000 registered email subscribers in Gotham City,  but we will not tell them that Batman is one of them, nor will we tell them  that his email address is bruce@statelywaynemanor.com. </p>
      <p><strong>How Do We Respect Children's Privacy?</strong><strong><br>
        </strong>&nbsp;<br>
        Our sites are not directed at children under the age of 13. We operate our  sites in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act and will  not knowingly collect or use personally identifiable information from anyone  under 13.</p>
      <p><strong>What Else Should You Know About Your Privacy?</strong> <br>
        <br>
        Many of our advertisers or partners link from our site to areas on their own  sites where they sell their own products and services. &nbsp;If you follow  links from our site to others, you should be aware that you are doing business  with those other sites, which have their own privacy and data collection  practices. BabyPips.com has no responsibility or liability for these  independent policies (and we may not even know what they are). For more  information regarding a site and its privacy policies, check that site. </p>
      <p><strong>How Will You Know Whether BabyPips.com's Privacy Policy  Has Changed? </strong> <br>
        We may change this Privacy Statement at any time, but we  will give notice of any material changes (or any notices that we are required to  give you) on our websites and/or in email messages.</p>
