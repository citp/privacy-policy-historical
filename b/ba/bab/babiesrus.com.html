The Sites are operated by Toys"R"Us-Delaware, Inc. ("Toys "R" Us") and other third-parties that own a portion of and/or participate in the operation of the Sites (the "Developers"). Toys"R"Us and the Developers are referred to together as the "Operators,"" "we," or "us."</li>

Certain weights, measures and similar descriptions are approximate and are provided for convenience purposes only. The Operators make all reasonable efforts to accurately display the attributes of our products, including the applicable colors; however, the actual color you see will depend on your computer system, and we cannot guarantee that your computer will accurately display such colors. The inclusion of any products or services on the Sites at a particular time does not imply or warrant that these products or services will be available at any time. It is your responsibility to ascertain and obey all applicable local, state, federal and international laws (including minimum age requirements) in regard to the possession, use and sale of any item purchased from the Sites. By placing an order, you represent that the products ordered will be used only in a lawful manner. All movies, videos, games, apps, and similar products sold, rented, or otherwise distributed or available through the Sites are for private, home use (where no admission fee is charged), non-public performance and may not be duplicated.</li>
                <li><span class="twd_avenirHeavy" style="display:inline;">Shipping Limitations</span>: When an order is placed, it will be shipped to an address designated by the purchaser as long as that shipping address is compliant with the shipping restrictions contained on the Sites. All purchases from the Sites are made pursuant to a shipment contract. As a result, risk of loss and title for items purchased from the Sites pass to you upon delivery of the items to the carrier.

For example, products included on the Sites may be unavailable, may have different attributes than those listed, or may actually carry a different price than that stated on the Sites. In addition, we may make changes in information about price and availability without notice. The price displayed on the website may differ from the price for the same item sold as in-store merchandise. While it is our practice to confirm orders by email, the receipt of an email order confirmation does not constitute our acceptance of an order or our confirmation of an offer to sell a product or service. We reserve the right, without prior notice, to limit the order quantity on any product or service and/or to refuse service to any customer. We also may require verification of information prior to the acceptance and/or shipment of any order.</li>

                  <p class="twd_margin20">The Toys"R"Us Sites, including the Tabeo tablet, do not knowingly solicit or collect personally identifiable information online from children under the age of 13 without prior verifiable parental consent. If Toys"R"Us learns that a child under the age of 13 has submitted personally identifiable information online without parental consent, it will take all reasonable measures to delete such information from its databases and to not use such information for any purpose (except where necessary to protect the safety of the child or others as required or allowed by law). If you become aware of any personally identifiable information we have collected from children under 13, please contact us at contactus@toysrus.com or by calling 1-800-TOYSRUS (1-800-869-7787) or 1-888-BABYRUS (1-888-222-9787).</p>

Certain apps may permit in-app purchases or include social network features. You should review the privacy policy of each application before you allow your child to access or download an app on the Tabeo. </p>
                  <p class="twd_margin20">We encourage you to actively use the parental control features of Tabeo to monitor and control your child's use of Tabeo, including which apps they have access to. You should make sure you keep your parental password safe and not give it to your child. If you change your mind about an app and want to opt-out of allowing an app to collect information, you can block the app at any time through use of the parental controls feature of Tabeo. In those circumstances you may also want to contact the developer to ask them to not use and/or delete prior information collected regarding your child. </p>
                  <p class="twd_margin20">For more information on the preloaded apps available on Tabeo, including the privacy policy for a particular app, please contact Toys"R"Us at: <a href="mailto:contactus@toysrus.com" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:underline;" class="twd_blue">contactus@toysrus.com</a>; by calling 1-800-TOYSRUS (1-800-869-7787) or BABYRUS (1-888-222-9787); or by writing Toys "R"Us Customer Service, One Geoffrey Way, Wayne, NJ 07470.

              <p class="twd_avenirHeavy twd_margin10"> Arbitration and Class Action Waiver</p>
              <p class="twd_avenirHeavy twd_margin10">Please read this carefully.  It affects your rights.</p>
              <p class="twd_avenirHeavy twd_margin10">Any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of Toys”R”Us or Babies”R”Us recurring messages will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than court.</p>
              <p class=" twd_margin20">This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted, and expressly includes claims, disputes, or lawsuits brought by Toys “R” Us or you under any statute, regulation, or legal or equitable theory, including the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, 47 U.S.C. § 227 et seq., or.  It does not, however, apply to any claims brought by either party on an individual basis in small claims court, consistent with the jurisdictional limitations that may apply.  You and Toys”R”Us hereby agree that the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. 1, et seq. (“FAA”) applies to this agreement to arbitrate, and governs all questions of whether a dispute is subject to arbitration.  Unless you and we agree otherwise in writing, arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association’s Consumer Arbitration Rules in effect at the time of filing of the arbitration (the “AAA’s Rules”).  However, just as a court would, the arbitrator or arbitrators must honor the terms and limitations in this Agreement, and can award damages and relief (including any attorneys’ fees) authorized by law and/or the AAA’s Rules.  Arbitration shall take place in the County where you reside, as determined by your address on file with Toys“R”Us, unless agreed to by the parties otherwise in writing.  The arbitration decision and award is final and binding, with some exceptions under the FAA, and judgment on the award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. <strong>YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND TOYS”R”US ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY AND THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR COLLECTIVE PROCEEDING.</strong></p>
              <p class="twd_margin20">THIS AGREEMENT DOES NOT ALLOW FOR CLASS ARBITRATIONS EVEN IF THE PROCEDURES OR RULES OF THE AAA WOULD.  RATHER, YOU AND WE ARE ONLY ENTITLED TO PURSUE ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL, BILATERAL BASIS.  FURTHER, AND UNLESS YOU AND TOYS”R”US AGREE OTHERWISE IN WRITING, THE ARBITRATOR(S) MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE INDIVIDUAL PARTY’S CLAIMS WITH ANY OTHER PARTY’S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR COLLECTIVE PROCEEDING.</p>
              <p class="twd_margin20">You and Toys”R”Us are each responsible for our respective costs relating to counsel, experts, and witnesses, as well as any other costs relating to the arbitration.  Toys”R”Us however, will pay for the arbitration administrative or filing fees, including the arbitrator and/or other AAA case management fees, for any claim seeking $75,000 or less, unless the claim is determined by the arbitrator to be frivolous.  Otherwise, the AAA’s Rules regarding costs and payment apply. </p>
               <p class="twd_margin20">This agreement to arbitrate does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf.</p>
                <p class="twd_margin20">If any term of this Section <strong>(Arbitration and Class Action Waiver)</strong> is to any extent illegal, otherwise invalid, or incapable of being enforced, such term shall be excluded to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability; however, to the extent the class action waiver portion of this Section is found to be unenforceable, the entire Section shall be null and void.  </p>
              <p class="twd_avenirHeavy twd_margin10">Applicable Law</p>
              <p class="twd_margin20">Except as otherwise provided herein, your use of this Service under this Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New Jersey.</p>
              <p class="twd_avenirHeavy twd_margin10">Severability</p>
              <p class="twd_margin20">Except as otherwise provided herein and without applying to the Arbitration and Class Action Waiver Section, if any term of these terms is to any extent illegal, otherwise invalid, or incapable of being enforced, such term shall be excluded to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability; all other terms hereof shall remain in full force and effect; and, to the extent permitted and possible, the invalid or unenforceable term shall be deemed replaced by a term that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of such invalid or unenforceable term.  If application of this Severability provision should materially and adversely affect the economic substance of the transactions contemplated hereby, the Party adversely impacted shall be entitled to compensation for such adverse impact, provided the reason for the invalidity or unenforceability of a term is not due to serious misconduct by the Party seeking such compensation.</p>
              <p class="twd_avenirHeavy twd_margin10">Changes to Terms</p>
              <p class=" twd_margin10">Except for material and retroactive changes to the Arbitration and Class Action Waiver, these terms and conditions are subject to change at any time without notice.</p>
