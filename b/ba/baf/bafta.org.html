Making sure you can buy safely online is a priority for us and certain links accessible from our Site offer items and services online. We have made strenuous efforts to ensure that security is one of our highest priorities and we have devoted a great deal of effort to ensure that our online security measures help to safeguard your information. Where possible we use industry-standard Secure Sockets Layer (Verisign) technology to allow for the encryption of:</p><ul><li>10.1	potentially sensitive information such as your name and address; and critically-sensitive information like your credit card number. </li></ul><ul><li>10.2	We hope that once you understand the measures we take to help ensure secure transactions and privacy, and the steps you can take yourself, you will be as happy about the safety of your online transaction and order information as we are.</li></ul><h4>COOKIES<br></h4><p>11.	A cookie is a text-only string of information that a website transfers to the cookie file of the browser on your computer's hard disk so that the website can remember who you are. A cookie will typically contain the name of the domain from which the cookie has come, the "lifetime" of the cookie, and a value, usually a randomly generated unique number. Two types of cookies are used on this website:</p><ul><li>11.1	Session Cookies: which are temporary cookies that remain in the cookie file of your browser until you leave the site.</li></ul><ul><li>11.2	Persistent cookies: which remain in the cookie file of your browser for much longer (though how long will depend on the lifetime of the specific cookie). </li></ul><ul><li>11.3	Cookies can help a website to arrange content to match your preferred interests more quickly. Most major websites use cookies. Cookies cannot be used by themselves to identify you. </li></ul><h4>HOW WE USE COOKIES ON OUR SITE AND WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h4><p>12.	Session Cookies </p><ul><li>12.1	To allow you to carry information across pages of our site and avoid having to re-enter information.</li></ul><ul><li>12.2	To allow you to maintain a shopping basket. </li></ul><ul><li>12.3	Within registration to allow you to access stored information. </li></ul><p>13.	Persistent Cookies </p><ul><li>13.1	To help us recognise you as a unique visitor (just a number) when you return to our website and to allow us to tailor content or advertisements to match your preferred interests or to avoid showing you the same adverts repeatedly.</li></ul><ul><li>13.2	To compile anonymous, aggregated statistics that allow us to understand how users use our site and to help us improve the structure of our website. We cannot identify you personally in this way.</li></ul><ul><li>13.3	Within research surveys to ensure you are not invited to complete a questionnaire too often or after you have already done so.</li></ul><h4>DISABLING/ENABLING COOKIES<br></h4><p>14.
