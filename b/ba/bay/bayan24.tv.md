We use both your personally identifiable information and certain non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous User usage data, cookies, IP addresses, browser type, click stream data, etc.) to improve the quality and design of the Bayan24.TV Sites and to create new features, promotions, functionality, and services by storing, tracking, and analyzing User preferences and trends.

(WHEN Bayan24.TV DISCLOSES INFORMATION) We provide personally identifiable information and non-personally-identifiable information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies, or other businesses or persons for the purpose of processing such information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to process such information in compliance with our privacy policy, and we use reasonable efforts to limit their use of such information and to use other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. We do not share your personally identifiable information (such as name or email address) with other, third-party companies for their commercial or marketing use without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. We do share non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous User usage data, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third parties to assist them in understanding the usage patterns for certain content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality on the Bayan24.TV Sites. We may release personally identifiable information and/or non-personally-identifiable information if required to do so by law, or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with local laws or respond to a court order, subpoena, or search warrant. Bayan24.TV also reserves the right to disclose personally identifiable information and/or non-personally-identifiable information that Bayan24.TV believes, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to enforce our Terms of Use, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend itself against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, to protect the security or integrity of our web site, and to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Bayan24.TV, our Users or others.

(THIRD PARTY ADVERTISERS, LINKS TO OTHER SITES) Bayan24.TV allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the Bayan24.TV Sites. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on Bayan24.TV Sites. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content you see. Bayan24.TV does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. However, please note that if an advertiser asks Bayan24.TV to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men ages 18-34) or audience segment (for example, men ages 18-24 who have viewed certain channels of content) and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. The advertiser may also use information regarding your use of the Bayan24.TV Sites, such as the number of times you viewed an ad (but not any personally identifiable information), to determine which ads to deliver to you. You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks (see links below) for more information on their practices and for instructions on how to opt-out of certain practices. Bayan24.TV's privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites. (OUR COMMITMENT TO DATA SECURITY) Bayan24.TV uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Bayan24.TV and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, Bayan24.TV makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. If Bayan24.TV learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. Bayan24.TV may post a notice on the Bayan24.TV Sites if a security breach occurs. (OUR COMMITMENT TO CHILDREN'S PRIVACY) Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important.
