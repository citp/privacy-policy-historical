Some functions of our Web sites may not work or may work slowly if a cookie is refused.
    * For clients booking at a property located in Germany: We may use cookies to create usage profiles under pseudonyms for marketing and market research purposes and to tailor this Website to your needs. The usage profiles will not be merged with personal information about the holder of the pseudonym and the information will not be used to identify you. If you object to the creation of usage profiles at any time, contact us at [privacy.policy@wyn.com](mailto:privacy.policy@wyn.com) to opt out. The opt-out information will be stored in your browser for use during future visits to this Website. In addition, see above for how to delete or block cookies at any time.
