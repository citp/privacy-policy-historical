**Your IP address**

For each visitor to the bakersfield.com site, bakersfield.com's servers automatically collect information about which pages are visited and the IP address or domain name of visitors. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web Site. Your IP address is not linked to personally identifiable information but is used to gather broad demographic information. This information helps us tailor and improve your experience on the Web Site.  


**Information we collect**

General: Portions of bakersfield.com require visitors to provide personally identifiable information that may include your name, age, address, e-mail address, credit-card number and facts about your consumer-buying habits. We do not, however, knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13.   


Surveys: We conduct periodic online surveys. For example, visitors to bakersfield.com may see a pop-up window asking them to voluntarily participate in a user survey.   


Web site usage: We automatically collect IP addresses and web site usage information from you when you visit our site. This information helps us evaluate how our visitors use and navigate our web sites on an aggregate basis, including the number and frequency of visitors to each web page, the length of their visits, their browser type and their operating systems.  


**How we use information that is collected**

Bakersfield.com may use information collected from visitors in the following ways:

  * To improve existing features or develop new features, products and services by analyzing how site features are being used.   

  * To award prizes in contests or promotions. Participation in some contests or promotions may require visitors to agree to be contacted by bakersfield.com or _The Bakersfield Californian_ for commercial purposes, such as to subscribe to _The Bakersfield Californian._  

  * To provide advertisers or other third parties with aggregate information about our user base and usage patterns. Personally identifiable information is kept private and not distributed to third parties.   

  * To send e-mail notifications about new or existing products and services, special offers, or to otherwise contact you. These contacts are on an opt-in basis only, based on the preferences you have specified with bakersfield.com. 



**Children/direct notice to parents**  


Bakersfield.com will not knowingly collect any personal information from individuals under 13 years of age without parental consent. Where appropriate, bakersfield.com will specifically instruct children not to submit such information on our site and/or will take reasonable steps to ensure parental consent to such submission.  


Parental consent will be required in the event bakersfield.com provides a feature or event such as a contest or promotion that requires submission of information by children. Notice may be provided in a number of ways, including sending an e-mail message or notice by postal mail. At any time, you may write to us at [webmaster@bakersfield.com](mailto:webmaster@bakersfield.com) to request a summary of any information we have retained as part of such activities or to ask that it be deleted.  


Parents should be aware that bakersfield.com’s Privacy Policy will govern our use of personal data, but that information which is voluntarily given by children (or others) in chat sessions, e-mail exchanges, bulletin boards or the like may be used by other parties to generate unsolicited mail. Bakersfield.com encourages all parents to instruct their children in the safe and responsible use of their personal data while using the Internet.

**Cookies**

Bakersfield.com or its affiliated sites may place a "cookie" on the browser of your computer. Cookies are pieces of information that a web site transfers to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. The use of cookies is common in the Internet industry, and many major web sites use them to provide useful features to their customers. The cookie itself does not contain any personally identifying information, but may be used to tell when your computer has contacted the bakersfield.com site. Bakersfield.com and its affiliates use the information for editorial purposes and for other purposes such as delivery of features and advertisements, so that bakersfield.com can customize delivery of information specific to your interests without compromising privacy. For example, cookies may be used to ensure that you will not see the same ads too often in a single session. We also may use cookies to save your passwords so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit portions of our site.   


**Registration**  


Various areas of bakersfield.com require voluntary registration. These forms require you to give us personally identifiable information, which may include contact information (like your name and e-mail address) and unique identifiers. If you so signify beforehand, we may use your contact information from the registration form to send you information about our company and promotional material from some of our partners. Unique identifiers are collected only for use as account numbers in our record system. We do not disclose any unique identifiers to any third parties.   
The information collected from these registration forms is used to improve existing features or develop new features, products and services by analyzing how site features are being used. Such information may be shared with third parties on an aggregate basis.   


**Demographic and profile data  
**

We also may collect demographic and profile data from you as part of the registration process (i.e., your ZIP code, sex, income level, interest in certain topics). We may use this data to tailor your experience at our site, showing you content that we think you might be interested in, displaying the content according to your preferences and informing you of upcoming events on our site. We also share certain demographic and profile data with advertisers and business partners on an aggregated basis.   


Bakersfield.com will disclose account information only in special cases, such as (i) to comply with valid legal requirements, such as a law, regulation, search warrant, subpoena or court order; or (ii) when bakersfield.com has reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who, intentionally or unintentionally, may be causing injury or harm to bakersfield.com users or other persons or violating the [Terms of Use](http://www.bakersfield.com/terms/) of this site.   


**Links**  


This site contains links to other sites. Bakersfield.com is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites, including any sites that may indicate a special relationship or partnership with bakersfield.com (such as co-branded pages and "powered by" relationships) or the sites of bakersfield.com advertisers that you go to by clicking on a banner ad on the bakersfield.com site. Bakersfield.com does not disclose unique identifiers to those responsible for the linked sites. The linked sites, however, may collect personal information from you when you link to their site.

Our advertising is delivered by a company called RealMedia Open Ad Stream. In the course of delivering an ad to you on bakersfield.com, RealMedia does not collect any personally identifiable information about you, such as your name, address, phone number or email address. RealMedia does, however, collect non-personally identifiable information about you, such as the server your computer is logged onto, your browser type (for example, Netscape or Internet Explorer), and whether you responded to the ad delivered.   


The non-personally identifiable information collected by RealMedia is used for the purpose of targeting ads and measuring ad effectiveness on behalf of RealMedia's advertisers and Web publishers who specifically request it.   


**Security**   


This site has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. For example, credit-card information provided by a visitor is made available only to bonded billing personnel or technical staff responsible for server security.

**Your role in protecting your privacy**  


If you share a computer terminal with others, you may want to consider establishing an anonymous e-mail account. In this way, e-mails that you receive from bakersfield.com, such as password reminders, will be seen only by you. If you access bakersfield.com through an e-mail account maintained by your employer, please note that it is possible that your employer may monitor your e-mail communications.   


**Notification of changes**  


This Privacy Statement may be revised over time as new features are added to bakersfield.com or as Internet security and privacy standards evolve. We will post those changes prominently so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information and whether we will disclose it to anyone. We do, however, recommend that you read this Privacy Statement each time you use bakersfield.com, in case you missed our notice of changes to the Privacy Policy.
