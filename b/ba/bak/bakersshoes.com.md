We collect both personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information. The non-personally identifiable information is categorized as General Tracking Information and Click Path Tracking, as further described below.

Security Information  
We understand that many consumers are concerned about security on the Internet. The web server here at www.BakersShoes.com is designed for Internet commerce, and employs industry standard methods of protecting the security of information sent over the site. This statement describes the technologies we use and provides additional information about how we handle your credit card information. We want you to be able to shop at the Bakers Footwear Group site with confidence. Of course, if you would rather order products by telephone, you can call us toll free at 1-314-641-0381.

Is the information I send to you secure while it is being sent?  
We strive to protect the security of the information you send to us while it is en route to our site. Every page of the site on which information is exchanged between you and us employs technology, and is a secure and encrypted method of communicating between your browser software and our web server.

Is the information I am sending really going to Bakers?  
Our web provider for the web store is Virid. They obtained a digital security certificate for BakersShoes.com. They confirm that we are the recipient of this information, but how the information is handled after it arrives is every bit as important to maintaining security. Once you are finished shopping, your encrypted information is sent to our server.

We are committed to providing a secure, friendly site where customers can shop without undue concern over security. When we receive your information, we use commercially reasonable efforts, including the measures described above, to protect the security of your information on our systems. However, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be absolutely secure. Therefore, we do not warrant or ensure the security of any information sent to us online.
