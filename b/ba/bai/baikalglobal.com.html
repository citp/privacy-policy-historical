<br>
2.3 How will we use any personal information that we collect?<br>
<br>
2.3.1 Where we collect personal information, we will use it for administration and to tailor our service and/or products to match your needs.

<strong>3. HOW DOES BAIKAL PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?<br>
<br>
</strong>3.1 We will hold your personal information securely and will only keep it for as long as is reasonably necessary in the circumstances you are registered to use the Website or for as long as you use the service that you have requested, unless you have provided us with your consent to use the data for any additional purposes. We take the security of the Website and the information you provide very seriously and we will take all appropriate technical measures using recognized security procedures and tools in accordance with good industry practice to protect your personal information.<br>
<br>
3.2 Whilst we use all reasonable endeavours to protect your security in the manner described above, we consider that it is only appropriate to advise users that data transmission over the Internet and the World Wide Web cannot always be guaranteed as 100% secure, and therefore that you use the Website at your own risk.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>4. DOES BAIKAL USE COOKIES?<br>
<br>
</strong>4.1 Your Internet browser has a feature called "cookies" which store small amounts of data on your computer about your visit to the Website, in particular when you complete the “welcome form” on our homepage to indicate the user type which best describes you and also when you complete the “user poll”. You do not need to have cookies turned on to visit most of the Website. A cookie does not provide us with any personal information. Therefore, if you have not supplied us with any personal information, you can still browse our site anonymously.<br>
<br>
4.2 We do not automatically capture or store personal data from browsers to the site, other than to log your IP address and session information such as the duration of the visit to our site and the nature of the browser used. This information is used only for administration of the site system and in the compilation of statistics used by Baikal.<br>
<br>
4.3 Cookies may be required to allow you to access and participate in certain areas of the Website. Once you have closed your browser, this type of cookie is deactivated.<br>
<br>
4.4 Baikal also uses cookies when you complete the “welcome form” on our homepage to indicate the user type which best describes you. This cookie remains activated after you finish your current session and is used solely to enable us to provide content on our Website which is more relevant to you. Like all cookies, you are able to remove or block this particular cookie at any time (see 4.5 below).<br>
<br>
4.5 Baikal also uses cookies when you complete the “user poll” on various pages across the Website. This cookie remains activated after you finish your current session and is used solely to show you the poll results once you have cast your vote. Like all cookies, you are able to remove or block this particular cookie at any time (see 4.6 below).<br>
<br>
4.6 The majority of browsers will allow you to alter the settings used for cookies and to disable and enable them as you require. If you do not want cookies then please refer to the help menu on your browser for instructions on disabling them. For further general information on cookies and more detailed advice on how to disable and enable them please go to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org./">http://www.allaboutcookies.org./</a>.<br>
