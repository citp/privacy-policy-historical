Bain has implemented generally accepted standards of technology and operational security in order to protect your personally identifiable information from loss, misuse, alteration, or destruction. Despite these precautions, however, Bain cannot guarantee that unauthorized persons will not obtain access to your personally identifiable information. 

When you request information from Bain and/or supply information that personally identifies you and/or allows us to contact you, including but not limited to, when you opt in to receive emails from Bain or agree to participate in surveys, you are agreeing to share such information with Bain, its agents, representatives and affiliates and you should know that Bain may disclose such information to its agents, representatives and affiliates for marketing and promotional purposes.

In addition, certain message boards and similar user forums may display IP addresses along with the message poster's name and message. Bain bears no responsibility for any action or policies of any third parties who collect any information users may disclose on the message boards, chat areas or other user forums, if any, on the website.
