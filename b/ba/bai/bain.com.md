# Privacy Policy - Bain & Company

This Privacy Policy pertains to the website(s) hosted in the United States by Bain & Company Inc. ("Bain"), a company headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts USA. This includes www.bain.com and additional Bain & Company produced and managed websites (together, the "Site"). Please note that our employment site, www.joinbain.com and the Alumni Career center website, careercenter.bain.com, are governed by separate policies.

The Bain Extranet accessible from this Site is governed by a separate policy contained in our agreements with our clients that are provided access to the Extranet, and not by this Privacy Policy. 

Bain takes user privacy very seriously because we know that your privacy on the web is important to you. Bain has implemented generally accepted standards of technology and operational security in order to protect your personally identifiable information from loss, misuse, alteration, or destruction. Despite these precautions, however, Bain cannot guarantee that unauthorized persons will not obtain access to your personally identifiable information. Bain reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to alter and update this Privacy Policy from time to time; therefore, we urge visitors to our Site to review the current version of the Privacy Policy each time they return to our Site. The date of the more recent update is reflected at the bottom of this document.

When you request information from Bain and/or supply information through the Site that personally identifies you and/or allows us to contact you including any and all materials submitted by you in connection with applying to Bain for employment, including but not limited to, when you fill out a subscription form or consulting expertise inquiry, opt in to receive emails from Bain, or agree to participate in surveys, you are agreeing to share such information, including your name, e-mail address, title, occupation, company or university affiliation, industry, region, relationship to Bain, reason for contacting Bain, and any message you submit, with Bain, its agents, representatives and affiliates, and you should know that Bain may disclose such information to its agents, representatives and affiliates for marketing and promotional purposes. Bain may aggregate personally identifiable information and may disclose such information in aggregate for marketing and promotional purposes. However, in these situations, we do not disclose to these entities any information that could be used to personally identify you. We may collect the e-mail addresses of those who send us e-mail messages; however, we will not send unsolicited e-mail to any of the addresses we collect or share those addresses with any unaffiliated third party, except in the limited circumstances set forth below. Note, however, that you will have the ability to opt out of receiving future emails from Bain, to unsubscribe from participating in our programs through the "preferences" page to which you may direct yourself from every email you receive from Bain, and to correct or change personally identifiable information you have provided to Bain by replying to any Bain email. Bain would like to keep your personal information accurate. We may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (1) comply with law or comply with legal process served upon us or our agents, representatives and affiliates, (2) protect and defend our rights or property or those of our users or (3) protect the personal safety of our users or the public.

If you elect to submit an employment application to us online through our Site, all of the information you submit becomes the property of Bain and may be used for any and all purposes ordinarily associated with processing an employment application, as well as for marketing and promotional purposes.

If you elect to register as a Bain alumnus on our Site, your data will be placed in a file controlled by Bain, and such data will be processed for the purpose of managing the alumni file of Bain and its affiliates. Management of the alumni file may involve, without limitation, conducting alumni mailings and surveys, and maintaining and sharing marketing & career development contacts. We also inform you that your data may be transferred to entities belonging to the Bain & Company group, information about which may be obtained on our Site. Further, we inform you that your personal data may be disclosed to other alumni, who may be located in other countries, including countries that may not have data protection laws. In the event that you do not wish your data to be processed or disclosed for the aforementioned purposes, or if you wish to access, rectify, cancel or oppose the same, you should not register as a Bain alumnus on our Site or, if you have previously registered, your should contact [alumni.relations@bain.com](mailto:alumni.relations@bain.com "Bain Alumni Relations").

We may use cookies or other technology to obtain certain types of information when your web browser accesses our Site. "Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Our Site may use cookies and other technology to store pertinent user information during a session to speed navigation and keep track of items and to collect anonymous traffic data that we may use to enhance our Site and for marketing and promotional purposes. The "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive new cookies, and how to disable cookies altogether. 

This Privacy Policy does not apply to any information you may disclose publicly in any chat rooms, message boards, or similar web pages, including those hosted on or linked to our Site. You should keep in mind that whenever you publicly disclose information about yourself online—for example, via message boards or chat rooms—that information could be collected and used by people whom you do not know. In addition, certain message boards and similar user forums may display IP addresses along with the message poster's name and message. Bain bears no responsibility for any action or policies of any third parties who collect any information users may disclose on the message boards, chat areas or other user forums, if any, on the Site. 

This Site is not directed at children 13 years of age or younger. Bain, therefore, will not intentionally collect information about anyone under the age of 13, and requests that no such information be submitted to us.
