After the beta period, you will be able to opt out of receiving these communications through this website.  
Bambuser will not distribute, sell or rent any of your User Information to other people or nonaffiliated companies (other than a business that acquires Bambuser or its assets and that will undertake to materially comply with this Privacy Policy) except to enable the provision of services or products you have requested or when we have your permission to do so.  
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, you acknowledge, consent, and agree that Bambuser may access, preserve, use, and disclose your User Information, including content uploaded to or accessed from Bambuser's website, software and/or services, if required to do so by law or in a good faith belief that such access, preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) enforce the Bambuser Terms of Service and/or end user license agreement(s) with respect to our software; (b) respond to claims that any uploaded materials violate the rights of third parties; (c) respond to your customer service requests; (d) comply with legal process; and/or (e) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Bambuser, its users, or the public.  
The Bambuser website, software and services are constantly evolving and changing in content and in features. User Information helps guide such changes and evolution.

## THIRD-PARTY ADVERTISERS AND THIRD PARTY WEBSITES

Bambuser allows third-parties including users of the Bambuser service, to serve advertisements within the Bambuser website or services. These third-parties may send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the Bambuser websites and/or service. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content you see.

However, please note that if an advertiser asks Bambuser to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men ages 18-34) or audience segment (for example, men ages 18-24 who have viewed certain channels of content) and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser may conclude that you fit the description of the targeted audience. Such third parties may also use information regarding your use of the Bambuser website, service and/or software (such as the number of times you viewed an ad to determine which ads to deliver to you) but are restricted from using any personally identifiable information).  
You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third parties for more information on their practices and for instructions on how to opt-out of certain practices.
