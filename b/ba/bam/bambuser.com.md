By providing any Personal Data to us on the related web site(s) or in our applications (for the purpose of this Privacy Policy, referred to as “Site” or “Sites”), you fully understand and consent to the collection, use, and transfer of Personal Data on the terms and conditions outlined in this privacy notice (“Privacy Policy”). If you don’t agree to this Privacy Policy, please choose not to provide Personal Data to us on our Sites. In addition, we reserve the right to change or modify the Privacy Policy at any time as posted, following, for example, changes in local legislation.

## Collection of Personal Data and other user information

Bambuser AB will only collect Personal Data when it’s necessary for us to carry out one or more requested functions or activities, or for you to get access to our products or services, and we will only collect it by lawful and fair means. At or before collection we will take reasonable steps to ensure that you are aware of which Bambuser AB entity is collecting the Personal Data and for what specified purposes we need such Personal Data.

For each visitor to the Site, Bambuser AB’s web servers automatically recognise and store information which is not normally deemed to be Personal Data, such as the visitor’s IP address and domain name. We use user information to understand visitor traffic patterns through the Site for purposes such as enhancing their usability. Your computer provides this user information automatically each time you log on, unless you’ve activated blocking technology available in some browsers. When you visit the Site we may use so called “cookies” which stores certain user information on your computer and allow us to customise your experience to better match your interests and preferences, or to simply facilitate your signing in to use the services. Most browsers will allow you to erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block acceptance of cookies or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. However, if you block or erase cookies, we may not be able to restore any preferences or customisation settings you have previously specified, and our ability to personalise your online experience would be limited. Please refer to your browser instructions to learn more about these functions.

## Use and disclosure of Personal Data

The Personal Data provided to us on the Site will be handled in an appropriate and considerate manner. Without limiting the foregoing and in order to provide you with the best service, Bambuser AB may have to collect, use and disclose your Personal Data for the purpose of, for example (i) the requested function or activity that you choose; (ii) for you to get access to certain products or services; (iii) for us to provide you with customer services; or (iv) or for a purpose specifically stated on the relevant area of the Site that you visit.

Bambuser AB always reserves the right to use and disclose Personal Data for the purpose of conducting direct marketing.

Bambuser AB may use or combine the Personal Data you provide on the Site with other information that we may collect from you or from third parties in order to more effectively tailor, improve and develop the Site, functions, activities, products, services, applications and offerings to you, and to overall enhance the user experience.

In order to provide you with updated services at all times, Bambuser AB may share the Personal Data with certain third parties. Any such third party is required to treat your Personal Data with no less restrictive terms as set out in these privacy terms.

Bambuser AB´s Privacy Policy does not apply when you are using third party applications. Such third party applications may contain their own privacy policies that you should review.

Should the Personal Data held by us no longer be required by us for any of the purposes set out in the section “Use and Disclosure of Personal Data” above, we undertake to take reasonable steps to destroy or de-identify the Personal Data after a reasonable period of time has elapsed. If you provide Bambuser AB with Personal Data, you will have the right, on reasonable prior written notice, to request inspection, change, amendment, or deletion of such Personal Data. However, we reserve the right, subject to applicable law, to charge a reasonable fee for inspection of your Personal Data held by us. Instructions on how to request inspection, change, amendment, or deletion of your Personal Data will be given at the point of collection, and if not given at the point of collection, specific instructions may be provided by you to our contact set out below.

## Transfer of Personal Data

Unless it’s for any of the purposes set out under the section “Use and Disclosure of Personal Data” above, Bambuser AB will not transfer (other than for routing purpose) the Personal Data you provide on the Site to any third party, except (a) with your consent; (b) as may be required by law or court order; (c) to persons or companies with whom Bambuser AB has contracts to carry out the internal operations of the Site or our business; or (d) we reasonably believe that they are subject to law, binding scheme or contract which upholds principles for fair handling and adequate level of protection of Personal Data.
