<p>13. Integration of Services and Contents of Third Parties</p>

GDPR), TEO make use of content or services offered by third-party providers in order to provide their content and services, such as including videos (hereinafter collectively referred to as "Content").</p>
<p>This always presupposes that the third party providers of this content perceive the IP address of the users, since they could not send the content to their browser without the IP address. The IP address is therefore required for the presentation of this content. TEO endeavors to use only content whose respective providers use the IP address solely for the delivery of the content.

The "pixel tags" can be used to evaluate information such as visitor traffic on the pages of this website. The pseudonymous information may also be stored in cookies on the user's device and may include, but is not limited to, technical information about the browser and operating system, referring web sites, visit time, and other information regarding the use of TEO Sites.</p>
