**Information from Other Sources**

We may also receive information about you from other sources, including third parties that help us update, expand and analyze our records and identify new customers. 

We collect data that's publicly available. For example, information you submit in a public forum (e.g. a blog, chat room, or social network) can be read, collected, or used by us and others, and could be used to personalize your experience. You are responsible for the information you choose to submit in these instances. 

We may also obtain information provided by a third party. For instance, we obtain information from companies that can enhance our existing customer information to improve the accuracy and add to the information we have about our customers (for example, adding address information). This improves our ability to contact you and increases the relevance of our marketing by providing better product recommendations or special offers that may interest you. 

**Automated Information Collection**

We collect information related to your interactions with our website and apps to create a superior, personalized shopping experience, whether you are online or in our stores.

This information, which includes the pages you visit on our site, which web address you came from, the type of browser/device/hardware you are using, search terms and IP-based geographic location, helps us recognize you, customize your website experience and make our marketing messages more relevant. 

This information is collected and stored using a variety of common technologies, including but not limited to various types of cookies, web beacons, and tags. Our website is not designed to respond to "do not track" requests from browsers. These technologies may also allow us to identify you as a particular Badcock retail store customer when you visit our website, and to link your activities on our website to your interactions with us in our stores. 

To help us understand and enhance our interactions with you, we may permit web analytics and other providers to collect and process information on our website using the technologies described above. We also may share personal information with those providers. 

**Location Information**

Our website may collect certain information such as the type of mobile device you're using or your specific location to help you search for one of our stores. To allow any application to identify your location, you must enable this functionality through your mobile device's settings to allow the use of technologies such as Wi-Fi, GPS signals, cell tower position, or other technologies.

How We Protect the Information We Collect

**Security Methods**

We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect your personal information.
