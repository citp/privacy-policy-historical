**W.S. Badcock Corporation Privacy Policy**

**COMMITMENT TO OUR CUSTOMERS:**

Today, data is transported at speeds and through avenues that in earlier years we could never have imagined. But technology, with all its wonders, does not diminish W.S. Badcock Corporation’s (“Badcock”) ongoing responsibility to our customers. Keeping customer information secure is a top priority for all of us at Badcock. At Badcock, we are dedicated to protecting your privacy and handling your information in a secure and confidential manner. The privacy of your information is protected not only by state and federal laws, but even more importantly, by Badcock's commitment to you. We know that having trust and confidence in the companies you do business with is important to you. And we value the trust you have placed in us to protect your information. We are sending you this privacy notice to help you understand how we handle the personal information about you that we collect. Unless we indicate otherwise, the term "information" in this Privacy Policy means information that specifically identifies you. This Privacy Policy applies to all current and former customers of Badcock. 

**We are committed to the privacy of your customer information and will use strict security standards to protect it.**

Badcock is committed to the security of customer information. All Badcock employees and others associated with us are held accountable for adhering to strict policies and procedures to prevent any misuse of your information. Our operational and data processing are in a secure environment that protects customer information from being accessed inappropriately by third parties. We maintain customer information only in accordance with Badcock's internal security standards. We regularly review our processes and keep abreast of new technology. 

**We collect only information that is needed to serve you and administer our business.**

In the process of serving you, we become aware of certain "nonpublic personal information"  information about you that is not available publicly. This information comes to us from a variety of sources including:   
· Information you provide directly to us on applications or otherwise (such as Social Security number, assets and income).   
· Information related to your transactions with us, or others (such as your account balance, payment history, parties to transactions and account usage).   
· Information we receive about your transactions with nonaffiliated third parties.   
· Information that we receive from a consumer reporting agency. 

**We carefully limit and control the sharing of your information.**

Regardless of the customer relationship and in order to protect customer privacy, we carefully control the way in which any information about customers is shared. We do not disclose information about our customers or former customers to anyone, except as outlined in this policy or as permitted or required by law. We limit the collection and use of information about our customers to that which is necessary to administer our business, provide superior service and offer opportunities that we think will be of interest to our customers. We also use customer information for identification purposes to protect customer accounts and guard against unauthorized access to information. In accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act, we share customer information with reputable information reporting agencies. We may also report customer information to government regulators, law enforcement agencies, as permitted or required by a variety of federal and state laws, such as in response to a subpoena, or in connection with legal process. We do not share information with nonaffiliated companies unless you have given us permission to do so or unless we provide you, in advance, the opportunity to “opt-out” and direct us not to make thes disclosures of your personal information. As your personal information is not shared in this manner by us, there is no need for you to opt-out of this practice. Federal law allows us to share the types of information described in the preceding paragraph in certain circumstances:   
· We may disclose information we collect, as described above to companies that perform marketing services on our behalf or to other financial institutions with whom we have joint marketing agreements.   
· We may share your information with companies that we hire to perform necessary account-servicing functions at our direction to manage, service and maintain your account. In these circumstances, we have written agreements that require the parties we are sharing your information with to keep it safe and confidential and to use it only for the purposes we specify.   
Please note that third parties may have access to information related to Badcock customers that has been obtained independently of Badcock (through credit rating agencies or public records such as deeds of trust, for example). Mailings and solicitations based on this information are not within Badcock’s control. 

**We do not sell any information.**

We do not permit list brokers, mail-order businesses, telemarketers, or other marketing companies to contact you to promote their products or services, and we do not sell, lend, or give out your information for this purpose. If you are a former customer, we maintain the confidentiality of your personal information as if you were still a customer. 

**We limit employee access to your information.**

Only authorized Badcock employees, who are trained in the proper handling of customer information, are authorized to access or use customer information. We restrict access to your personal and financial information to those employees who need to know that information to provide product of services to you. All Badcock employees are governed by a code of conduct that includes the responsibility to protect the confidentiality of customers' financial and other personal information. Employees are bound by this Privacy Policy and are educated on implementing Badcock's security principles and practices. Employees who violate our Privacy Policy will be subject to our normal disciplinary process. 

**We strive to maintain the accuracy of your information.**

We work to ensure that the information concerning you is accurate in all aspects. If we become aware of inaccuracies in our records, we will take prompt steps to make appropriate corrections. 

**We are committed to customer privacy on our website.**

Badcock is equally committed to protecting the privacy of customer information on the Internet. 

**We encourage you to partner with us in safeguarding your information.**

Badcock's commitment to protecting your customer information is a company-wide priority that shapes our daily actions. We encourage you to be just as diligent as you follow steps to protect against unauthorized access to information. This Privacy Policy and our practices are subject to change. As significant changes occur, we will update this policy, and we will let you know about them.
