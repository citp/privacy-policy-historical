Badgeville, Inc. ("Badgeville", "we" or "us") knows that you care about how your information is collected, used and shared. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect when you use the [www.badgeville.com](http://www.badgeville.com/ "www.badgeville.com") website (the "Site"), how that information may be used, and how you can control the collection, and/or deletion of that information.

We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

We may store personal information in locations within the U.S. but outside the direct control of Badgeville (for instance, on servers or databases co-located with hosting providers).

Except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, Badgeville will not disclose personal information to any third party unless required to do so by law or subpoena or if we believe that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the law, comply with legal process served on us or our affiliates, or investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities; (b) to take precautions against liability, investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations, assist government enforcement agencies, protect the security or integrity of our site; or (c) to exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Badgeville, our users or others.

Non-Personally Identifiable Information: We may share non-personally identifiable information (such as anonymous usage data, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third parties.

**HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION**

Badgeville uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is completely secure or error-free. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absoute security.

In the event that personal information is compromised as a result of a breach of security, Badgeville will promptly notify those persons whose personal information has been compromised, in accordance with the notification procedures set forth in this Privacy Policy, or as otherwise required by applicable law. If you suspect that your Badgeville user account has been compromised, you should notify us immediately at [marketing@badgeville.com](mailto:marketing@badgeville.com).
