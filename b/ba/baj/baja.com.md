**7.     SECURITY.**

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.

b.   **    EU Safe Harbor:** We participate in the [EU](http://export.gov/safeharbor)[ & ](http://export.gov/safeharbor)[Swiss](http://export.gov/safeharbor)[Safe](http://export.gov/safeharbor)[Harbor](http://export.gov/safeharbor)[Privacy](http://export.gov/safeharbor)[Frameworks](http://export.gov/safeharbor) as set forth by the United States Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union and Switzerland. Information regarding the U.S.-E.U. & U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework can be found at: [http](http://export.gov/safeharbor)[://](http://export.gov/safeharbor)[export](http://export.gov/safeharbor)[.](http://export.gov/safeharbor)[gov](http://export.gov/safeharbor)[/](http://export.gov/safeharbor)[safeharbor](http://export.gov/safeharbor).

**10.     SECURITY**.

The importance of security for all personally identifiable information associated with our guests is of utmost concern to us. We exercise great care in providing secure transmission of your information from your PC to our servers. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we can’t ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems. When credit card information is transmitted we use industry standard, SSL (secure socket layer) encryption.

Your Baja.com account is password protected so that only you can access it and view the member information relevant to the account. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. We will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or email. Ultimately, you are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and any account information. Remember to sign out of your account and close your browser window when you have finished your work. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if your computer is accessible to others or if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place.

****We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most current version of the Privacy Policy will govern our use of your information and will be located[ here](http://baja.com/privacy-policy/).
