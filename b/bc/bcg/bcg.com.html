<p>The Boston Consulting Group and its affiliates ("BCG") understands that your privacy is important to you. BCG is strongly committed to protecting your privacy and the personal information that you may provide as you access and use the materials on BCG.com (the "Site"), including the subscription pages of the Site. In this
written Privacy Policy, BCG describes the scope and breadth of our commitment
to privacy. BCG may, in its discretion, amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any material changes to our policy will be reflected on this page, so
						that you remain informed about the information we collect and how we use it. By exploring and using this Site, and by submitting information as you use this Site, you agree to BCG's use of such information as described herein. This Site may contain links to external sites, which sites are not governed by this
						privacy policy, and BCG does not take responsibility for the privacy practices of any third party sites to which we link. We encourage you to review the
						privacy policies of any such sites before you submit information there. </p>
						
						
						<div class="contenttitle">Information That We Collect, and How We Use It</div>
						<p>BCG collects information
						from our users when they create their account for this Site, when they request
						copies of publications, seek additional information regarding our services or
						employment opportunities, or register for conferences and other BCG-sponsored
						events. Some of our Site's registration, enrollment, account setup and other
						forms may ask users to give us contact information, unique personal
						identifiers, financial information, subject areas of interest and/or
						demographic information. We may use this data to tailor the visitor's
						experience at our Site. We sometimes aggregate demographic information, and the
						types of systems and browsers of users for internal purposes, so that we may
						better understand the user population of our Site, identify subject areas of
						interest, and determine whether the Site is designed to work with the computer
						settings of a majority of our visitors. BCG also may conduct user surveys on
						the Web, which usually are intended to provide BCG with information on a number
						of areas, such as user identity, user viewing habits, whether or not users
						found what they were searching for, whether the Site content is relevant to
						user needs, and the like. BCG uses the information gathered from such surveys
						to improve our web content, navigation, and overall visitor experience.</p>
						
						<p>Any personal information that you provide, such as your name, address, e-mail address, phone number,
						subject areas of interest, etc., allows BCG to inform you about updates to the
						service and to notify you about other products and services offered by BCG that
						may be of interest to you. We will not sell, share, or rent or otherwise make
						available any of that information to other parties, except that we may disclose
						the information to third parties who perform services on our behalf in
						connection with the Site and have a need to access the information in
						connection with those services. In addition, BCG may disclose contact
						information for you in response to inquiries by bona-fide rights owners in
						connection with allegations of infringement of copyright or other proprietary
						rights arising from information that you have posted on the Site or otherwise
						provided to BCG. Individuals that subscribe to e-mail newsletters are given the
						opportunity to opt-out of promotions, news, and information at the time of sign
						up. Our Site also provides users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving
						communications from us at the points where we request information. You may also
						feel free to contact us as indicated below. </p>
						<div class="contenttitle">E-Mail Addresses </div>
						<p>We may collect the e-mail
						addresses at the point of subscription, of users who wish to receive e-mail
						notification of publications and press releases in identified subject areas of
						interest, and of those who send us e-mail messages. We will not, however, share
						any e-mail addresses with any third party or send unsolicited e-mail to any of
						the addresses we collect, except in very limited circumstances as set forth in
						this policy. </p>
						<div class="contenttitle">Cookies</div>
						
						<p>BCG may use browser cookies
						on this Site to keep track of your visit to our Site. A "cookie" is a
						small amount of data that is sent from a Web server to your browser and stored

						quality, more relevant, customer experience. Use of cookies may also allow BCG
						to automate entry into password protected portions of the Site so that you will
						not need to re-enter your password each time you visit our Site. We may also
						use cookies to track which areas of the web site are most popular with our
						users and to further BCG's understanding concerning overall use of the

						authorized employees and contractors will have access to any data provided by
						you, and that access is limited by need. Each employee or contractor having
						access to any personally-identifiable information is obligated to maintain its
						confidentiality. Although we take steps that are generally accepted as industry
						standard to protect your personally-identifiable information, BCG cannot
						guarantee that your personally-identifiable information will not become
						accessible to unauthorized persons. </p>

						personal user or customer information to United States or other legal
						authorities without express user consent if presented with a court subpoena or
						similar legal order, or as required or permitted by the laws, rules and
						regulations of any nation, state or other applicable jurisdiction. Also, in the
						event of a violation of the terms and conditions of use of this Site or a
						violation of any restrictions on use of materials provided in or through this
						Site, we may disclose personal user information to our affected business
						partners or legal authorities. </p>
