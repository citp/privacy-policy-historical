Personal information that we collect includes: names, addresses, e-mail addresses, phone numbers, unique personal identifiers, financial information, subject areas of interest and/or demographic information.

In addition, we sometimes aggregate demographic information and the types of systems and browsers of users BCG also may conduct user surveys on the Web or use technologies to provide BCG with information on a number of areas, such as user identity, user viewing habits, whether or not users found what they were searching for, whether the Site content is relevant to user needs, and the like.

 _How do we use personal information?_

You may withdraw your consent at any time.

(iii) for compliance with a legal obligation. This includes anti-fraud and anti-money laundering measures as well as tax and social security requirements.

We will not sell, share, or rent or otherwise make available your personal information to other parties, except that we may disclose the information to third parties who perform services on our behalf and have a need to access the information in connection with those services.  Any third parties will only process this information to the extent to which and within the limits that BCG itself is permitted to process that data. In addition, BCG may disclose your contact information in response to inquiries by bona-fide rights owners in connection with allegations of infringement of copyright or other proprietary rights arising from information that you have posted on the Site or otherwise provided to BCG.

Because BCG is a global organization we need to transfer personal information which is collected on the Site or through other means across the BCG group of companies (<http://www.bcg.com/about/offices/default.aspx>) to help operate our business efficiently. This also includes third parties located in different countries around the world, including outside of the EEA. These arrangements may involve your personal information being located in various countries around the world e.g. USA where privacy laws differ. We only make these arrangements or transfers where we are satisfied that adequate levels of protection are in place to protect information held in that country. In addition, the Site may be viewed and accessed anywhere in the world including countries that may not have laws regulating the use and transfer of personally identifiable information. By using the Site, submitting information through this site, or submitting personal information to BCG through other means you voluntarily consent to such international transfer and hosting of such information to those countries and parties.

### Retention of your Personal Information

BCG retains your personal information for so long as is necessary to fulfil the purpose for which it was collected. We may retain your personal information for longer if they may be the subject of a legal claim, or may otherwise be relevant for future litigation.
