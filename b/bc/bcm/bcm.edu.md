#### *Session Cookies and Persistent Cookies

A cookie is a small piece of information that is sent to your browser, along with a Web page, when you access a Web site. A cookie might track the pages you've visited, and the date when you last looked at a specific page. There are two kinds of cookies. A session cookie is a line of text that is stored temporarily in your computer's memory. Because a session cookie is never written to a drive, it is destroyed as soon as you close your browser. A persistent cookie is a more permanent line of text that gets saved by your browser to a file on your hard drive.

Baylor College of Medicine uses cookies to count the number of visitors and to improve the usability of our websites. We have set our software so that your browser will only return cookie information to the domain where the cookie originated (in this case, bcm.edu). No other site can request it. Note: Regardless of the particular uses for cookies on Baylor College of Medicine web sites, we will not share any cookie information with any third parties.
