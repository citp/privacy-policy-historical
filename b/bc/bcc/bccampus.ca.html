<h3>Disclosure of Personal Information</h3>
<p>BCcampus does not and will not sell, rent, share or disclose your Personal Information without first receiving your permission or as disclosed in this policy.</p>
<p>Under certain circumstances, BCcampus will disclose your Personal Information:</p>
<ul><li>when you have consented to the disclosure; </li>

<li>when we are required or authorized by law to do so.</li>
</ul><p>Except where we are required by law to disclose Personal Information, where commercially practicable we will make arrangements by agreement, instruction, or otherwise to protect Personal Information disclosed to third parties.</p>
<h3>Summarized Data</h3>
<p>We may also use your Personal Information to generate Summarized Data for internal use and for sharing with educational institutions and government bodies with which we do business. Your identity and Personal Information will be kept anonymous in Summarized Data. Summarized Data may be used for research, marketing, or planning purposes.</p>
<h3>Consent</h3>
<p>By providing Personal Information to us and by using our services, you voluntarily consent to the collection, use and disclosure of Personal Information as specified in this policy. Without limiting the foregoing, we may on occasion ask you to consent when we collect, use, or disclose your Personal Information in specific circumstances, in which case we may ask for your consent in writing although in some circumstances we may accept your oral consent. Sometimes your consent will be implied through your conduct with us if the purpose of the collection, use, or disclosure is obvious and you voluntarily provide the information. In addition, we may collect, use, and disclose Personal Information without your consent when we are required or authorized by law to do so.</p>
<h3>Opting Out</h3>
<p>You may wish to opt out of receiving certain information and marketing or promotional materials from BCcampus. You may do so by contacting us at the address at the end of this policy or at another address we may provide for that purpose.

<h3>Access to and Correction of Personal Information</h3>
<p>Individuals have the right to know what Personal Information BCcampus has collected about them, how that information is being used and to whom it has been disclosed, as well as to verify and amend that information if it is incorrect. Upon receiving a written access and/or correction request, and where the identity of the requestor can be confirmed, information held by BCcampus that is identifiable to the requestor, as well as information on all use and disclosures of that information, will be released to the requestor within 30 days, except where that release is not required or is prohibited by law, and if necessary BCcampus will correct the Personal Information of the requestor.</p>
<p>Where appropriate, BCcampus may instead transfer your request to a third party government body or educational institution if the information was provided by or for that third party, that third party was the first to obtain the information, or the information is in the custody or control of that third party.</p>

<h3>Retention of Personal Information</h3>
<p>Personal Information, including any such information in Summarized Data, will be retained in accordance with this policy only for as long as may be necessary or relevant for the purpose of collection, or as may be required or permitted by law, after which time it will be made anonymous, destroyed or transferred to a relevant government body or educational institution with which you are registered, unless you further consent to its continued retention by us.
