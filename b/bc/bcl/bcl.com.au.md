# Privacy Policy

For information on Australian Privacy laws, see [www.privacy.gov.au](http://www.privacy.gov.au/) 

##  BCL - Web Site Cookies and Statistics

We ask for no personal details from users of BCL.com.au web pages. Our server registers the following information which is used for general statistical purpose only.

  * Your server or ISP (not your computer)
  * The number of pages visited
  * Versions of browsers used (Netscape, Microsoft IE etc)
  * The country of origin
  * The referring web page (if any and if not blocked) 



We do not track individual readers or check to see when they revisit. 

Cookies are used to pass our ID to some of our affiliate links (eg hotels, shopping sites) so that pages will be displayed properly and we can be paid appropriate commissions on sales. We receive click-through figures but do not receive any personal information about the person who followed the link. 

**We ask readers to allow these cookies to be set** as the funding from this advertising makes it possible to provide this service free to readers and supports the free advertising for non-profit and community groups. 

We do not receive the names of people who book hotels or buy from online shops through our site. We receive names only for some tour bookings but do not use, sell or share them.

##  BCL - Contextual Advertising Cookies

We do not use Adsense, Netratings or other third party tracking on any of our sites. They may be present on co-branded sites (eg Viator tours, Domain real estate, etc)

##  BCL  \- Email newsletter

The only information required to receive the BCL email newsletter is a valid email address. We do not sell, share or give our mailing list to any other party. All newsletters include details on how to unsubscribe from the newsletter. 

From October 2006, we will be using an impressive new mailing service which will provide better newsletters and additional information about how you read them. We aim to use this information to improve the service - give you more of what you are interested in and stop boring you with what you aren't interested in. 

It will tell us if you open the newsletter and what links you click on. You can avoid passing this information using the steps below. (You can do this with other emails and newsletters too.)

  * **if you open the newsletter.** If you don't want us to know, just keep your email program set so that it doesn't load images automatically. 
  * **if you forward the newsletter to a friend.** If you don't want us to know, just use standard email forwarding.
  * **if you click on a link.** If you don't want us to know, don't click on a link. We provide the URLS (web addresses) in the newsletter so you can copy and paste them into your browser.
