<h1><!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Title" -->Blue Cross and Blue Shield of
    Alabama
Internet Privacy Statement<!-- InstanceEndEditable --></h1>
<a name="content"></a><!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Content" -->Because we value your relationship with us, we have detailed below our privacy
objectives for our Web site:
<h2>Security Practices</h2>
<p>We recognize and respect your desire for privacy when it comes to your personal
  and health care affairs. We attempt to protect online information according
  to established company security standards and practices, and we continually
  evaluate new technologies for safeguarding information.</p>
<h2>Use of E-Mail</h2>
<p>Please use your own best judgment when sending information via the Internet
  to an e-mail address. E-mail sent via the Internet may pass through private
  and public networks with varying levels of security. Some networks may have
  taken steps to secure e-mail transmissions while others have not, thereby compromising
  the privacy and integrity of an e-mail. An e-mail may be copied, altered or
  destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>If you have personal or confidential information to relay to our company,
  please call the appropriate member service phone number that you will find
  in our <a href="customers/phone/index.cfm">Important Customer Phone Numbers</a>.</strong></p>
<p>We preserve the content of your e-mail, your e-mail address and our response
  so that we can efficiently respond to questions you might have. We also do
  this in an effort to meet legal and regulatory requirements. </p>
<p>We will respect your request to be, on not to be, contacted by e-mail.</p>
<h2>Surveys and Forms</h2>
<p>You may have the opportunity to provide information to us through online surveys
  and forms. We use this information to better understand health care needs and
  to provide quality products, services and other opportunities. </p>
<p>BCBSAL wants your visit to our Web site to be informative and enjoyable. We
  plan to use any information we obtain from you to help us continually improve
  the content, functionality and overall usefulness of our Web site; but in no
  way will make specific and individually identifiable information given to us
  available without your specific consent.</p>
<h2>Updates to the Statement</h2>
<p>Evolving technology will continue to provide us with new and better ways to
  collect and use information so that we may better serve your health coverage
  needs. We may revise or update the BCBSAL Privacy Statement in the future to
  reflect these technological advances, and we encourage you to return to this
  page from time to time for any updates.</p>
<h2>Confidentiality</h2>
<p>Again, please use your own best judgment when sending information via the
  Internet to an e-mail address. </p>
<p><strong>If you have personal or confidential information to relay to our company and
  have concerns about the security of your e-mail, please call the appropriate
  member service phone number that you will find in our <a href="customers/phone/index.cfm">Important
  Customer Phone Numbers</a>.</strong></p>
<p>If you do provide personal information, such as an e-mail, telephone or fax
  number, or other identifying information, we do not plan to disclose it without
  your consent. We maintain this information, as well as all web based transactions,
  according to our usual high, government regulated, security and confidentiality
standards.</p>
