# BCBE Online Privacy Policy

                                                                    BCBE Online Privacy Policy
The Baldwin County Board of Education (BCBE) respects your privacy and is committed to
protecting it. BCBE provides this Online Privacy Policy to inform you of our privacy practices
regarding the use of your information collected by BCBE online. This notice is readily available
on our websites. Our websites are generally structured so that you can visit us without
identifying yourself or revealing any personal information.
Sites Covered by this Online Privacy Policy
This Online Privacy Policy applies to all official websites managed by BCBE including
individual school sites. This statement does not apply to websites managed by individual staff,
faculty, researchers, students, student organizations, or the like.
Some BCBE web pages may provide links to third-party web sites for your convenience and
information. If you access those links, you will leave the BCBE website. BCBE does not control
those sites or their privacy practices, which may differ from our own. We do not endorse or make
any representations about third-party web sites. The personal data you choose to provide to
unrelated third parties is not covered by the BCBE Online Privacy Policy. We encourage you to
review the privacy policy of any web site before submitting your personal information.
Types of Online Information We Collect and How We Use It
Personal information is information that is associated with your name or personal identity. BCBE
collects no online personal information without your consent or permission. BCBE’s “NotifyMe”
service allows users to receive important announcements from individual schools and/or the
district. The notifications are done through e-mails. The information requested for the
“NotifyMe” service does not include first or last name, but only e-mail address and user type.
This is the extent of personal information collected online. That information resides with our web
content management provider for the sole purpose of facilitating these notifications. It will not be
sold, rented, leased, or shared with any other entity. You may remove yourself from our
“NotifyMe” service at any time via the website or a link provided within every “NotifyMe” e-
mail.
Non-personal information is data related to usage and service operation that is not associated with
a specific personal identity. BCBE collects and analyzes non-personal information to evaluate
how visitors use the district’s websites. This data may include the number of visitors to particular
sites, the number of “NotifyMe” subscribers overall or at a school and the like.
With Whom Do We Share Your Online Information?
The BCBE does not sell, rent, lease or share your online personal information to any entity. The
BCBE contracts with a third-party service provider to deliver web content management and web
hosting services. This provider is required to maintain the online personal information (your e-
mail address) you may provide and may not use it for any purpose other than to carry out the
notification services required by the BCBE.
Changes to this Statement
This document will be updated and posted online to reflect any changes to the terms of the BCBE
Online Privacy Policy.
