Privacy Authorization Forms
    

Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Georgia is fully committed to the spirit and letter of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), including but not limited to the Privacy Rule that was issued pursuant to HIPAA. A major provision of the Privacy Rule is to safeguard sensitive, personal information about members. This information is referred to as Protected Health Information (PHI), and includes individually identifiable health care and demographic data.

HIPAA allows Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Georgia to use and disclose certain member information for clearly defined treatment, payment and health care operations (TPO). However, members have the right to restrict the release of information about them beyond these uses. The Individual Authorization Form provides the means for members to identify who can see their PHI and what specific PHI can be seen for purposes other than TPO. If you need to have your PHI disclosed to someone outside of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Georgia for purposes other than TPO, complete the form and submit it to your local Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Georgia office. This address is located on the back of your Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Georgia identification card. If you have questions, please contact your local customer service unit. The telephone number is on the back of your identification card.

If you do not have an Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Georgia identification card, please contact us at 317-488- 6000.

We, including our affiliates or vendors, may call or text you using an automated telephone dialing system and/or a prerecorded message. But we only do this in accordance with the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA). The calls may be to let you know about treatment options or other health-related benefits and services.

Web Privacy Statement
    

Your privacy is very important to us and we will make every reasonable effort to safeguard any information we collect.

What information will we collect?
    

Information may be collected in the following ways on this website:

  * If we provide user account access, you may elect to establish an account so that you can gain additional access to on-line service applications, health tools, health information, subscriptions or other services where it is important for us to know who you are in order to best meet your needs. Providing personal information is always voluntary.
  * We may use “cookies” to help us improve this website by tracking your navigation habits and to store some of your preferences. A cookie is a small file created by a website to store information on your computer. Cookies do not allow websites to gain access to other information on your computer. Once a cookie is saved on your computer, generally only the website that created the cookie can read it.
  * An Internet Protocol address is a number that automatically identifies the computer or mobile device that you are using to access the Internet. The IP address enables our server to send you the site pages that you want to visit or the data you want to view. The IP address may disclose the server owned by your Internet service provider. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to support our site administration.


How will information be used?
    

Any personal information that you provide is used for the purpose for which you provide it. For example, if you use location services to find a provider near your current location, your location is used only to facilitate that function. We may also gather quantitative user information, such as the number of users and the pages or data accessed, in order to perform administrative, technical, hosting or other functions that help us manage our website and deliver new functionality to you. We do not sell, license, transmit or disclose personal information that you provide to us to third parties except with the following exceptions:

  * Upon your authorization
  * When such disclosure is necessary to allow us and our contractors or agents to carry out treatment, payment or health care operations
  * When required or permitted by law


Third parties
    

We may work with third party service providers who may place third party persistent cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies to collect anonymous information about the use of our websites. They are not permitted to collect any personal information, and this information will be solely used for web usage analysis for a better understanding of how you use our website, and/or to customize our content and advertising.

What if I don’t want information about me to be collected?
    

Providing personal information through this website is an option. Additionally, personally identifiable information will not be collected from you without your knowledge and approval.

If you do not wish to have your activity on our website tracked, [to discontinue first party cookie tracking of your web activity](http://www.112.2o7.net/optout.html?second=1&amp;second_has_cookie=0).

You also have the choice to opt-out of third party cookies, web beacons or similar technologies, if you do not want third party service providers to collect your anonymous information for marketing purposes, [visit the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) website to perform the opt-out](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/).

“Do Not Track” Signals
    

We do not respond to web browser “do not track” signals. As such, your navigation of our site may be tracked as part of the gathering of quantitative user information described above. If you arrive at our website by way of a link from a third party site that does respond to “do not track” requests, the recognition of any “do not track” request you have initiated will end as soon as you reach our site.

Linking to Other Sites
    

From time to time we will provide links to websites not owned or controlled by us. We do this because we think this information might be of interest or use to you. While we do our best to ensure your privacy, we cannot be responsible for the privacy practices of other sites. A link to a third party website does not constitute or imply endorsement by us. Additionally, we cannot guarantee the quality or accuracy of information presented on those websites. We encourage you to review the privacy practices of any website you visit.

Use of email and fax
    

We may provide email and fax links to further facilitate communication for our members and their designees and caregivers. Information collected through email may be shared with our customer service department, employees or third parties that perform services on our behalf. Unless otherwise noted, email through our website is not a completely secure and confidential means of communication. Non-encrypted email may be accessed and viewed by other Internet users without your knowledge and permission while in transit to us. Further, if you request that we email information about you to someone through our digital channels, that email may not be completely secure. Please verify email addresses carefully before submitting such a request.

Health Information Exchanges
    

We may share your information with health information exchanges. Electronic health information exchanges allow health care providers to view and share your health information quickly and easily — for treatment, payment or health care operations.

Health information exchanges can improve the speed, quality, safety and cost of your care. It’s also a great way to help make sure you get the right medication, and you don’t get the same tests more than once if you don’t need to. Doctors, health insurers and others using an exchange like this are required to follow the privacy and security standards set by U. S. and state laws.

**California.** In California, we’re taking part in a health information exchange called Cal INDEX. If you’re a member living in California, you’re automatically enrolled. Only participating doctors who are treating you will have access to your health records. If you or your dependents do not wish to have your health information made available on Cal INDEX, please fill out the online form at [www.calindex.org/opt-out](http://www.calindex.org/opt-out). Or you can call Cal INDEX at 1-888-510-7142.

If you have questions regarding this policy or if you would like to review or change any of your personal information we have on file, please contact Customer Service by dialing the number on the back of your ID card.

This privacy statement is effective January 1, 2014 and was most recently revised January 1, 2015. This privacy statement is subject to change. We encourage you to review it from time to time.
