Whether you are a current customer or just visiting our web site, we are committed to attempting to protect the information you provide, just as we protect it when you provide it to us over the phone, in person or through the mail. 

We value your relationship with us, so we want you to understand our privacy objectives for our web site, and how and why we collect, use and disclose the personal information about you on our web sites.

If you are not yet a customer, but are applying for an insurance product through this web site, any information you supply to us is protected as stated in that HIPAA Notice. This Web Site Privacy Statement supplements that HIPAA Notice by providing you with information concerning BCBS-TX’s practices and procedures relating specifically to information we collect at this web site.
