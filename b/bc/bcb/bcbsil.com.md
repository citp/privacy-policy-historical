•  | Use of E-Mail  
  |  Please use your own best judgment when sending information via the Internet to an e-mail address. E-mail sent via the Internet may pass through private and public networks with varying levels of security. Some networks may have taken steps to secure e-mail transmissions while others have not, thereby compromising the privacy and integrity of an e-mail. An e-mail may be copied, altered or destroyed. 

If you have personal or confidential information to relay to our company, please call the appropriate member service phone number that you will find in our [ Contact Us](https://web.archive.org/member/contacts.htm) section. 

We preserve the content of your e-mail, your e-mail address and our response so that we can efficiently respond to questions you might have. We also do this in an effort to meet legal and regulatory requirements. 

We will respect your request not to be contacted by e-mail.
