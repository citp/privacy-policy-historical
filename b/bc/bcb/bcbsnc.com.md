## How We Handle Your Protected Health Information (PHI)

Federal law requires that we publish a Notice of Privacy Practices describing how we handle our members' PHI collected both online and offline. You may want to read this Notice to learn how we process your protected health information as well as what rights you have concerning such information.

We don't use or disclose any PHI you submit to our website or our tools and services unless it's required or permitted under federal and state laws that apply to us or our website.

If you use products and services that are location-enabled (for example, Google Maps) while accessing our website, tools or services, you may be sending us your location information. This information may reveal your actual location, such as GPS data.

## Security

We've taken steps to protect information collected from our online visitors against unauthorized access and use.

The chat feature and all online forms that include information captured from our users are secured using a Secured Socket Layer (SSL), which encrypts the information as it travels from a desktop to our server.

We're committed to ensuring transaction security and privacy. We obtain certification from industry-recognized security vendors to ensure our systems meet security standards.

As an additional security measure, we use a firewall to prevent unauthorized access to our site. Site personnel monitor activity logs at regular intervals to look for unauthorized intrusions.

For your protection, please don't send e-mail to us that contains your personal health information. We cannot guarantee the security of these emails before they reach us, in contrast to the security precautions in place when you send us personal information through an online form on this website. If you're a member, we suggest you use the Blue Connect Inbox to send secure messages and receive secure messages from us.

In addition, our Enterprise Security program protects our information and the supporting infrastructure against unauthorized use, disclosure, modification, damage and loss. Enterprise Security promotes a culture that understands and respects the value of protecting information while following legal, regulatory and accreditation requirements and standards that govern online security.

Research, planning and implementation of technologies, tools and training programs are used to secure our critical electronic information.

## Protecting Your Information Online

Once someone else has your personal information or PHI, that information is no longer in your control. It can be reused, sold, lost, stolen or misused. Protecting your personal information online is a good and necessary action to take. One of the most obvious reasons would be to prevent identity theft. A good rule of thumb is to always ask yourself this question when it comes to your personal information: Can this information be used to reset the password for my online bank account or some other sensitive online account? If so, then you shouldn't share that kind of information online or anywhere else for that matter.

Here are some simple actions to protect your personal information online:

  * Weigh the benefit against the risk - is what you are getting out of this transaction worth the exposure of your data?
  * Read the fine print - understand what websites plan to do with your data, and decide if this is acceptable to you. Provide only the minimum amount of information necessary.
  * Create an account using a nickname or made-up name, and use an online email account that you don't normally use and don't care if it gets spam.



Use these basic technical controls to prevent yourself from falling victim to a security breach:

  * Use anti-virus software.
  * Make sure all your devices have the latest security updates.
  * Don't use the same password for all your accounts.
  * Use a passphrase to strengthen your passwords.
  * Use a password longer than 10 characters. The longer the password, the better your chances of not getting hacked.
  * Enable encryption on your home router, disable remote access features, use its firewall and change its default name.
  * Be cautious when using free, but not always secure, public Wi-Fi. 
  * Know what devices are connected to your network.
  * Delete any emails that are out of the ordinary.
  * If you receive a phone call from technical support and you didn't ask them to contact you, don't give away any personal information. Typically, you call technical support when you need help, not the other way around.
  * Create backups of your computer.
