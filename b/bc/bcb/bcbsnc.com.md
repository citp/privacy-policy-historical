This notice describes how medical information about you may be used and disclosed and how you can get access to this information. Please review it carefully. The privacy of your medical information is important to us. 

**Our Responsibilities**

Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina is committed to protecting the privacy of the medical information and other personal information we keep regarding our members. We call this information Protected Health Information or "PHI" throughout this notice. We are required by law to maintain the privacy of your Protected Health Information. We are also required to give you this notice about our privacy practices, our legal duties, and your rights concerning your PHI. We must follow the privacy practices that are described in this notice while it is in effect. This notice takes effect on April 14, 2003 and will remain in place until we replace it.

We reserve the right to change this notice and our privacy practices at any time. We also reserve the right to make the changes in our privacy practices and the new notice effective for all PHI that we already have about you as well as for PHI that we may receive in the future. Before we make a material change in our privacy practices, we will update this notice and send the new notice to our health plan subscribers within 60 days of the time we make the change.

**How We Use and Disclose Your Protected Health Information**

We may use and disclose your protected health information as permitted by federal and state privacy laws and regulations. We have described below how we are most likely to use and disclose your protected health information under these laws and regulations. Generally, we will only use and disclose your PHI as authorized by you or as permitted or required by law. If you cease to be a member, we will no longer disclose your PHI, except as permitted or required by law. 

The federal health care privacy regulations known as "HIPAA" generally do not take precedence over state or other applicable privacy laws that provide individuals greater privacy protections. As a result, when a state law requires us to impose stricter standards to protect your health information, we will follow the state law rather than the HIPAA Privacy Regulations. For example, where such laws have been enacted, we will follow more stringent state privacy laws that relate to uses and disclosures of the protected health information concerning HIV or AIDS, mental health, substance abuse/chemical dependency, genetic testing or reproductive rights. 

We may use and disclose your PHI for the following purposes: 

Payment. We may use and disclose your PHI for payment purposes or to otherwise fulfill our responsibilities for coverage and providing benefits as established under your policy. For example, we may use or disclose your PHI to pay claims from your health care providers for their services that are covered under your health plan, determine your eligibility for benefits, coordinate benefits, determine the medical necessity of the treatment that you received or plan to receive, obtain premiums, issue explanations of benefits to the person who subscribes to the health plan in which you participate, and other purposes related to payment. 

Health Care Operations. We may use and disclose your PHI to support our business functions. These functions include, but are not limited to: quality assessment and improvement, reviewing the competence or qualifications of your health care provider and evaluating the performance of your health care provider; conducting training programs, accreditation, certification, licensing or credentialing activities, rating our risk and determining our premiums for your health plan, medical review, legal services and auditing, business management and general administrative activities, including activities relating to privacy, customer service and resolution of grievances, business planning and business development. For example, we may use or disclose your PHI: (i) to inform you about one of our disease management programs; (ii) to respond to a customer service inquiry from you; (iii) in connection with fraud and abuse investigations and compliance programs; or (iv) to survey you concerning how effectively we are providing services. We may also disclose your PHI to the North Carolina Department of Insurance during a review of our health insurance operations. We may also disclose your PHI to non-affiliated third parties where allowed by law and as necessary to help us fulfill our obligations to you. 

Your Authorization. You may give us written authorization to use or disclose your PHI for any purpose. If you give us an authorization, you may revoke it at any time by giving us written notice. Your revocation will not affect any use or disclosures permitted by your authorization while it is in effect. Without your authorization, we may not use or disclose your PHI for any reason except as described in this notice. 

Your Family and Friends. We may disclose PHI to a family member, a friend or other persons whom you indicate are involved in your care or payment for your care. We may use or disclose your name, location and general condition or death to notify or help with notification of a family member, your personal representative, or other persons involved in your care about your situation. If you are incapacitated or in an emergency, we may disclose your PHI to these persons if we determine that the disclosure is in your best interest. If you are present, we will give you the opportunity to object before we disclose your PHI to these persons. 

Your Health Care Provider. We may use and disclose your PHI to assist health care providers in connection with their treatment or payment activities. For example, we may disclose your PHI when needed by a health care professional to render medical treatment to you. 

Underwriting. We may receive your PHI for underwriting, premium rating or other activities relating to the creation, renewal or replacement of a contract of health insurance or health benefits. We will not use or further disclose this PHI for any other purpose, except as required by law, unless the contract of health insurance or health benefits is placed with us. If the contract is placed with us, we will only use or disclose your PHI as described in this notice. 

Business Associates. We may contract with individuals and entities called business associates to perform various functions on our behalf or to provide services to you. To perform these functions or services, business associates may receive, create, maintain, use or disclose your PHI, but only after the business associate has agreed in writing to safeguard your PHI. For example, we may disclose your PHI to a business associate who will administer your health plan's prescription benefits, or perform preenrollment medical screenings. 

Required by Law and Law Enforcement. We may use or disclose your PHI when we are required to do so by state or federal law. We are required to disclose your PHI to the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services when the Secretary is investigating or determining our compliance with federal privacy laws. We may disclose your PHI in connection with legal proceedings such as in response to an order from a court or administrative tribunal, or in response to a subpoena. We may also disclose your PHI for law enforcement purposes.
