      <p><b>Our Responsibilities</b></p>
		  <p>Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina is committed to protecting 
            the privacy of the medical information and other personal information 
            we keep regarding our members. We call this information <span class="blue">Protected 
            Health Information </span>or <span class="blue">"PHI"</span> throughout 
            this notice. We are required by law to maintain the privacy of your 
            Protected Health Information. We are also required to give you this 
            notice about our privacy practices, our legal duties, and your rights 
            concerning your PHI. We must follow the privacy practices that are 
            described in this notice while it is in effect. <span class="blue">This 
            notice takes effect on April 14, 2003</span> and will remain in place 
            until we replace it.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to change this notice and our privacy practices at any time. We also reserve the right to make the changes in our privacy practices and the new notice effective for all PHI that we already have about you as well as for PHI that we may receive in the future.  Before we make a material change in our privacy practices, we will update this notice and send the new notice to our health plan subscribers within 60 days of the time we make the change.</p>

	<p><b>How We Use and Disclose Your Protected Health Information</b></p>	
			
<p>We may use and disclose your protected health information as permitted by federal and state privacy laws and regulations. We have described below how we are most likely to use and disclose your protected health information under these laws and regulations. Generally, we will only use and disclose your PHI as authorized by you or as permitted or required by law. If you cease to be a member, we will no longer disclose your PHI, except as permitted or required by law.

</p><p>The federal health care privacy regulations known as "HIPAA" generally do not take precedence over state or other applicable privacy laws that provide individuals greater privacy protections. As a result, when a state law requires us to impose stricter standards to protect your health information, we will follow the state law rather than the HIPAA Privacy Regulations. For example, where such laws have been enacted, we will follow more stringent state privacy laws that relate to uses and disclosures of the protected health information concerning HIV or AIDS, mental health, substance abuse/chemical dependency, genetic testing or reproductive rights. 
</p><p>We may use and disclose your PHI for the following purposes: 

          </p><ul type="square">
		   <p><span class="blue">Payment.</span> We may use and disclose your PHI 
            for payment purposes or to otherwise fulfill our responsibilities 
            for coverage and providing benefits as established under your policy. 
            For example, we may use or disclose your PHI to pay claims from your 
            health care providers for their services that are covered under your 
            health plan, determine your eligibility for benefits, coordinate benefits, 
            determine the medical necessity of the treatment that you received 
            or plan to receive, obtain premiums, issue explanations of benefits 
            to the person who subscribes to the health plan in which you participate, 
            and other purposes related to payment.
			</p><p></p><p><span class="blue">Health Care Operations.</span> We may use and 
            disclose your PHI to support our business functions. These functions 
            include, but are not limited to: quality assessment and improvement, 
            reviewing the competence or qualifications of your health care provider 
            and evaluating the performance of your health care provider; conducting 
            training programs, accreditation, certification, licensing or credentialing 
            activities, rating our risk and determining our premiums for your 
            health plan, medical review, legal services and auditing, business 
            management and general administrative activities, including activities 
            relating to privacy, customer service and resolution of grievances, 
            business planning and business development. For example, we may use 
            or disclose your PHI: (i) to inform you about one of our disease management 
            programs; (ii) to respond to a customer service inquiry from you; 
            (iii) in connection with fraud and abuse investigations and compliance 
            programs; or (iv) to survey you concerning how effectively we are 
            providing services. We may also disclose your PHI to the North Carolina 
            Department of Insurance during a review of our health insurance operations. 
            We may also disclose your PHI to non-affiliated third parties where 
            allowed by law and as necessary to help us fulfill our obligations 
            to you.
             </p><p><span class="blue">Your Authorization.</span> You may give us written 
            authorization to use or disclose your PHI for any purpose. If you 
            give us an authorization, you may revoke it at any time by giving 
            us written notice. Your revocation will not affect any use or disclosures 
            permitted by your authorization while it is in effect. Without your 
            authorization, we may not use or disclose your PHI for any reason 
            except as described in this notice.
             </p><p><span class="blue">Your Family and Friends.</span> We may disclose 
            PHI to a family member, a friend or other persons whom you indicate 
            are involved in your care or payment for your care. We may use or 
            disclose your name, location and general condition or death to notify 
            or help with notification of a family member, your personal representative, 
            or other persons involved in your care about your situation. If you 
            are incapacitated or in an emergency, we may disclose your PHI to 
            these persons if we determine that the disclosure is in your best 
            interest. If you are present, we will give you the opportunity to 
            object before we disclose your PHI to these persons. 
             </p><p><span class="blue">Your Health Care Provider.</span> We may use and 
            disclose your PHI to assist health care providers in connection with 
            their treatment or payment activities. For example, we may disclose 
            your PHI when needed by a health care professional to render medical 
            treatment to you. 
             </p><p><span class="blue">Underwriting.</span> We may receive your PHI for 
            underwriting, premium rating or other activities relating to the creation, 
            renewal or replacement of a contract of health insurance or health 
            benefits. We will not use or further disclose this PHI for any other 
            purpose, except as required by law, unless the contract of health 
            insurance or health benefits is placed with us. If the contract is 
            placed with us, we will only use or disclose your PHI as described 
            in this notice.
             </p><p><span class="blue">Business Associates.</span> We may contract with 
            individuals and entities called business associates to perform various 
            functions on our behalf or to provide services to you. To perform 
            these functions or services, business associates may receive, create, 
            maintain, use or disclose your PHI, but only after the business associate 
            has agreed in writing to safeguard your PHI. For example, we may disclose 
            your PHI to a business associate who will administer your health plan's 
            prescription benefits, or perform preenrollment medical screenings. 
             </p><p><span class="blue">Required by Law and Law Enforcement.</span>
			We may use or disclose your PHI when we are required to do so by state 
            or federal law. We are required to disclose your PHI to the Secretary 
            of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services when the Secretary 
            is investigating or determining our compliance with federal privacy 
            laws. We may disclose your PHI in connection with legal proceedings 
            such as in response to an order from a court or administrative tribunal, 
            or in response to a subpoena. We may also disclose your PHI for law 
            enforcement purposes.
             </p><p><span class="blue">Abuse or Neglect.</span> We may disclose your 
            PHI to a government authority that is authorized by law to receive 
            reports of abuse, neglect or domestic violence.

            your PHI to comply with workers' compensation laws and other similar 
            laws that provide benefits for work-related injuries or illnesses.
             </p><p><span class="blue">Public Health and Safety, Health Oversight Activities.</span> 
            We may use or disclose your PHI for public health activities for the 
            purpose of preventing or controlling disease, injury or disability. 
            We may also disclose your PHI to a health oversight agency for activities 
            authorized by law such as audits, investigations, inspections, licensure 
            or disciplinary actions.
             </p><p><span class="blue">Research.</span> We may disclose your PHI to researchers 
            when an institutional review board or privacy board has reviewed the 
            research proposal and established protocols to protect the privacy 
            of your PHI. We may also make limited disclosures of your PHI for 
            actuarial studies.
             </p><p><span class="blue">Marketing.</span> We may use your PHI to contact 
            you with information about our health-related products and services, 
            product enhancements or upgrades, or about treatment alternatives 
            that may be of interest to you.
             </p><p><span class="blue">Employers or Organization Sponsoring A Group Health 
            Plan.</span> We may disclose your PHI and the PHI of others enrolled 
            in your group health plan to the employer or other organization that 
            sponsors your group health plan. Please see your group health plan 
            document for a full explanation of the limited uses and disclosures 
            that the plan sponsor may make of your PHI in providing plan administration. 
            We may also disclose summary information about the enrollees in your 
            group health plan to the plan sponsor to use to obtain premium bids 
            for the health insurance coverage offered through your group health 
            plan or to decide whether to modify, amend or terminate your group 
            health plan.
             </p><p><span class="blue">Death and Organ Donation.</span> We may disclose

            about you. Your request must be in writing. You may visit our office

            will contact you to review the fee and obtain your agreement to pay 
            the charges. If you wish to access your PHI, please call the number

        will provide you a written explanation. You have the right to file a statement 
        explaining why you disagree with our decision and setting forth what you 
        believe is the correct, relevant and fair information. We will file the 
        statement with your PHI and we will provide it to anyone who receives 
        any future disclosures of your PHI. If we accept your request to correct, 
        amend or delete your PHI, we will make reasonable efforts to inform others, 
        including people you name, of the amendment and include the changes in 
        any future disclosures of your PHI. If you wish to correct or amend your 
        PHI, please call the telephone number on the back of your identification 
        card and request an amendment of PHI form. 
      </p><p><span class="blue">Right to Request an Accounting of Disclosures.</span> You have a right to receive a list of certain instances in which we 
            or our business associates disclosed your PHI for purposes other than 
            our treatment, payment or health care operations and certain other 
            activities. You are entitled to this accounting of disclosures for 
            the six years prior to the date you make the request, but not for 
            disclosures made before April 14, 2003. We will provide you with the 
            date on which we made a disclosure, the name of the person or entity 
            that received your PHI, a description of the PHI that we disclosed, 
            the reason for the disclosure, and certain other information. If you 
            request this list more than once in a 12-month period, we may charge 
            you a reasonable fee for preparing the list. Your request must be 
            in writing and you may call the number on the back of your identification card and request an accounting of disclosures form. 
			
</p><p><span class="blue">Right to Request Restrictions.</span> You have 
            the right to ask us to place additional restrictions on our use or 
            disclosure of your PHI for our treatment, payment and health care 
            operations. We are not required to agree to these restrictions. In 
            most instances, we will not agree to these restrictions unless you 
            have requested Confidential Communications as described below. 
			
			
          </p><p><span class="blue">Right to Confidential Communications.</span> If 
            you believe that a disclosure of your PHI could endanger you, you 
            may ask us to communicate with you confidentially at a different location. 
            For example, you may ask us to contact you at your work address or 
            other place instead of your home address. You may call the number 
            on the back of your identification card to request a confidential 
            communications form. Once we have received your confidential communications 
            request, we will only communicate with you as directed on the confidential 
            communications form, and we will also terminate any prior authorizations 
            that you have filed with us. 
			
          
        </p><p><span class="blue">Right to File a Privacy Complaint. </span>You may 
          complain to us if you believe that we have violated your privacy rights. 
          You may also file a complaint with us by contacting the Chief Privacy 
          Official, P.O. Box 2291, Durham, NC 27702-2291. You may also file a 
          complaint with the Secretary of the U. S. Department of Health and Human 
          Services in Washington, D.C. We will not take any action against you 
          or in any other way retaliate against you for filing a complaint with 
          the Secretary or with us. 
        </p><p><span class="blue">Right to Obtain a Copy of this Privacy Notice.</span> 
            You have a right to request a copy of this notice at any time by calling 
            the number on the back of your identification card or you may obtain 
            a copy from our Web site. Even if you agreed to receive this notice
