## Update on previously reported security issue

(Dec. 31 2012)

In June of 2012, BCIT reported a security incident that could have potentially resulted in an unauthorized third party accessing personal information of certain students, staff and faculty through a computer server associated with the Student Health Services Medical Clinic at the BCIT Burnaby Campus. To date, and to the best of our knowledge, we have not had any indication that any personal information has been compromised.

To ensure the preservation of privacy standards, BCIT notified and began working with the Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner of BC (OIPC) regarding this matter.

The OIPC recently released a report which confirms the actions taken by BCIT were adequate and fulfilled the obligation to protect personal information under the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act. The following is an excerpt from the summary of the report’s findings and conclusions: 

> _". . .BCIT took quick and appropriate action to contain the breach. It correctly assessed the harms that might take place if this type of information were disclosed, it notified affected individuals quickly and provided them with information required to mitigate the potential threats from this disclosure. BCIT has taken the proper steps to prevent a similar breach from occurring in the future."_
