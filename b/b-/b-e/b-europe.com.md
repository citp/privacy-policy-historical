additional data is requested and/or collected, including your gender, name, email address, password, possible purchase order history and, if applicable, telephone number, address, language, and travel preferences and arrangements. 

Such data are used respectively

Likewise, an email offering assistance will be sent to you if your purchase is interrupted for whatever reason, on the condition that you have sent us your details using the booking tool; 

(ii) to let you enjoy all the benefits of your MyTrain account, including a simplified booking and ordering procedure and access to your purchase order history, to the online after-sales service for active bookings and to your own profile data for the management thereof, as well as for purposes of customized marketing via emails and adaptation of the Website according to your preferences and history order; 

(iii) to deal with your question, request or communication and to answer if applicable; 

(iv) to let you participate in the contest and to inform you about the progress and completion thereof, as well as, following your consent, for purposes of customized marketing via email and the newsletter;

(v) to provide you with the newsletters and customized marketing via emails with your agreement;

(vi) to enable you to take part in satisfaction surveys relating to the products and services offered by SNCB Europe;

(vii) to enable you to enjoy additional services in the Apps, such as directions to the nearest train station, the function of priority direct calling to our services for help with booking your journeys and saving your digital transport tickets in the directories of your smart phone or smart tablet;

and, to these ends, can be transferred to third parties or subcontractors as explained under point 3.4. below. 

In addition, in order to prevent potential fraud when tickets are purchased, SNCB Europe will check the accuracy of all the details you have provided at the time of each transaction. 

3.2. Collection, processing, and uses of personal data at the SNCB Europe Contact Center

When you call the SNCB Europe Contact Center to make a purchase or request after-sales support, your personal data will be requested and/or collected, including your gender, name, e-mail address and, if relevant, the financial details needed for a payment or refund, your telephone number, address, language, and travel preferences and arrangements. 

These data will be used 

(i) to set up a buyer record so that your booking or order can be confirmed, and to provide you with any additional information, supply and track the relevant products and services, guarantee after-sales service and continually improve the service offered to you and adapt this service to your requirements, in particular by offering you personalised services likely to be of interest to you, based on customer profiles created; 

(ii) to complete and amend a buyer record in the event of changes or cancellations to a previously booked journey, so that any after-sales support requested can be provided and any refund paid; 

(iii) to send you newsletters and customised e-marketing, subject to your consent;

(iv) to enable you to take part in satisfaction surveys relating to the products and services offered by SNCB Europe.

For these purposes, they may be passed on to third parties or subcontractors, as explained in 3.4 below.

3.3. Collection, processing, and uses of personal details at SNCB station counters selling international rail tickets and connected products marketed by SNCB Europe

When buying specific products which are in your name and are non-transferable by virtue of their special conditions (such as certain season tickets or unlimited travel passes), requesting after-sales support involving refunds, or picking up rail tickets previously paid for by a third party, your personal data will be requested and/or collected, including, if and as required, name, date of birth, address, language, financial data if required for a refund, and, if necessary, the relevant details from your identity card or passport (see iii below) 

These data will be used 

(i) to create the travel document (pass or season ticket) in your name, in compliance with its special conditions of use; 

(ii) to complete and amend a purchase file in the event of change or cancellation of a journey previously booked, so that the after-sales support requested can be provided and any refund paid, or 

(iii) to hand over international rail tickets and any other products marketed by SNCB Europe which are booked and paid for remotely (by phone, online, or at a travel agency recognised by SNCB Europe), when the person picking up the rail ticket or other product is unable to provide the confidential code given on purchase or the credit card used to pay for the rail ticket or other product, solely for purposes of fraud prevention. 

They may therefore be passed on to third parties or subcontractors, as explained below 

3.4. Transfer to third parties or to subcontractors 

SNCB may also transfer certain personal data to third parties, among other things, for the following purposes: 

  * To the partners of SNCB Europe as indicated in the Website, in brochures or in any other material published by SNCB Europe (for example, hotels, rental car companies, carriers) for the management and performance of the travel contract, the contract of carriage and/or another service or product of SNCB Europe; 
  * To travel agencies recognized by SNCB Europe for the management and performance of the travel contract, the contract of carriage and/or another service or product of SNCB Europe; 
  * To the competent authorities in case of threatening or pending legal proceedings.

SNCB may also transfer personal data to other natural or legal persons acting as subcontractors on behalf of SNCB. In this case, they only have access to the data which are strictly necessary to the fulfilment of their task. 

3.5. International transfer 

By using the Application or disclosing your personal details to SNCB Europe, you expressly acknowledge and agree that, in the framework of the mentioned processing of personal data, data can be transferred to countries outside the European Economic Area, not affording a similar level of protection for personal data.
