Collecting this information helps us design the BTS website to suit your needs. In the event of a known security or virus threat, we may collect information on the web content you view.

**How, and with whom, do we share the information we collect online?**  
We may share contact information you provide to us online with appropriate representatives within the Department of Transportation's [Operating Administrations and related entities ](https://web.archive.org/external_links/government/federal/executive/cabinet/department_of_transportation.html), other federal government agencies, or other designated BTS representatives as needed to facilitate your request or transaction. In a government-wide effort to combat security and virus threats, we may share some information we collect automatically, such as IP address, with other federal government agencies.

Additionally, we may be required by law to share information we collect with authorized law enforcement, homeland security, and national security entities (also see the “What are your rights under the Privacy Act of 1974?” section in this Privacy Policy). 

**Do we give you choices on how we use the information you provide us?**  
Throughout our website, we will let you know whether the information we ask you to provide is voluntary or required. By providing contact information, you are granting us consent to use it for the primary purpose for which you are providing it.  Additionally, we will ask you to grant us consent before using your voluntarily provided information for any secondary purposes, other than those required under the law. 

**How long do we keep your information?**  
If you place an order with our bookstore or register with us, using a business mailing address, we keep your contact information indefinitely and we will keep the information until you send a request to [answers@bts.gov ](mailto:answers@bts.gov)or if we decide we no longer need the information .

If you submit Feedback to us, we will keep your contact information for 30 days after its submission. 

**What are our information practices for children?**  
Our website does not intentionally collect information from children under the age of 13. If in the future we choose to collect personal information from children, we will comply with the [Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) ](https://web.archive.org/cgi-bin/ExitPage/good_bye.cgi?url=http://www.ftc.gov/privacy/privacyinitiatives/childrens.html). 

**Do we use cookies or other tracking devices?**  
A “cookie” is a small text file that is stored on your computer and makes it easy for you to move around a website. 

We use only “session” cookies; this means we store the cookie on your computer only during each visit to our website. After you turn off your computer or stop using the Internet, the cookie is erased and nothing will be remembered the next time you visit our website. 

**How do we secure your information we collect online?**  
We are committed to properly securing the information we collect online. To help us accomplish this, we take the following steps: 

  * We employ internal access controls to ensure that the only people who see your information are those with a need to do so to perform their official duties; 
  * We train relevant personnel on our privacy and security measures so that our personnel know what is required for compliance; 
  * We physically secure the areas where we hold hard copies of the information we collect online; 
  * We regularly back up the information we collect online to insure against loss; 
  * We use technical controls to secure the information we collect online as appropriate, including but not limited to: Secure Socket Layer (SSL), encryption, firewalls, and password protections; 
  * We periodically test our security procedures to ensure personnel and technical compliance; and 
  * We employ external access safeguards to identify and prevent unauthorized attempts of outsiders to hack into, or cause harm to, the information in our systems. 
  * Tampering with BTS' website is against the law. If anyone tries to tamper with it, they may be punished under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act. 



**What are your rights under the Privacy Act of 1974?**  
The Privacy Act of 1974 protects personal information the federal government collects and stores in a “systems of records” (SOR). A SOR is information an agency controls that can be retrieved by name or some other personal identifier. The Privacy Act regulates how the government can disclose, share, provide access to, and maintain the personal information that it collects. Not all information collected online is covered by the Privacy Act. 

The Privacy Act's major provisions require agencies to: 

  * Publish a Privacy Act Notice in the Federal Register explaining the existence, character and uses of a new or revised SOR; 
  * Keep information about you accurate, relevant, timely, and complete to assure fairness in dealing with you; and 
  * Upon request, allow you to access and review your information held in a SOR and request amendment of the information if you disagree with it. 



When BTS collects information from you online that is subject to the Privacy Act (i.e., information to be kept in a SOR), we will provide you, through a link on the web page from which we collect information, access to our [Privacy Act Notices ](https://web.archive.org/cgi-bin/ExitPage/good_bye.cgi?url=http://www.bts.gov/cgi-bin/ExitPage/good_bye.cgi?url=http://cio.ost.dot.gov/DOT/OST/Documents/files/records.html). This Privacy Act Notice will inform you what portion of the information is maintained and retrieved by your name or other personal identifier. 

Each Privacy Act Notice will also notify you of the following: 

  * The authority for and purpose and use of the collection of information subject to the Privacy Act; 
  * Whether providing the information is voluntary or mandatory; and 
  * The effects on you if you do not provide any or all of the requested information. 



Also, DOT has conducted [Privacy Impact Assessments ](https://web.archive.org/cgi-bin/ExitPage/good_bye.cgi?url=http://www.dot.gov/pia.html) on some systems.
