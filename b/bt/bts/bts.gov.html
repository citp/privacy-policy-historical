      <p>We collect no personal information about you when you visit the Bureau 
      of Transportation Statistics (BTS) website unless you choose to provide 
      this information to us. However, BTS collects and stores certain 
      information automatically. </p>
      <p>Here is how BTS handles information about your visit to our 
website.</p>
      <h4>What We Collect and Store Automatically</h4>
	  <p>If you do nothing during 
      your visit but browse through the website, read pages, or download 
      information, BTS will gather and store certain information about your 
      visit automatically. This information does not identify you personally. 
      BTS automatically collects and stores only the following information about 
      your visit: 
	
      </p><ul class="btsfont">
        <li>The Internet domain (for example, "xcompany.com" if you use a 
        private Internet access account, or "yourschool.edu" if you connect from 
        a university's domain) and IP address (an IP address is a number that is 
        automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the 
        Web) from which you access our website; 
        </li><li>The type of browser and operating system used to access our site; 
        </li><li>The date and time you access our site; 
        </li><li>The pages you visit; and 
        </li><li>If you linked to our website from another website, the address of 
        that website. </li>
	  </ul>
	
	  <p></p>
      <p>BTS uses the information we collect to count the number and type of 
      visitors to the different pages on our site and to help us make our site 
      more useful to visitors like you. </p>
      <h4>If You Send Us E-mail</h4>
      <p>You may choose to provide BTS with personal information, as in e-mail 
      with a comment or question. BTS uses the information to improve our 
      service to you or to respond to your request. Sometimes BTS forwards your 
      e-mail to other government employees who may be better able to help you. 
      Except for authorized law enforcement investigations, BTS does not share 
      our e-mail with any other outside organizations. </p>
      <h4>Links to Other Sites</h4>
      <p>The BTS website has many links to our partners, especially other 
      federal agencies. In a few cases BTS links to private organizations. When 
      you link to another site, you are no longer on the BTS website and are 
      subject to the privacy policy of the new 
site.</p></td></tr></tbody></table></p>
