# Privacy Policy

The Ad Age Group, publishers of btobonline.com, has developed this Privacy Policy to advise site users of our possible uses of information collected during an btobonline.com visit.

For each visitor to btobonline.com, our web server automatically attempts to identify the user's domain name, but not the e-mail address. We collect and store the domain name of btobonline.com users in our log files. We also track information, in aggregate, on pages and features that users access or view.

Information collected about users may be used by The Ad Age Group (and our partnering companies) to provide users with the features of the site, for audits, to perform statistical analysis of user behavior in order to measure interest in the various areas of our site (for product development purposes) and to inform advertisers as to how many users have seen or "clicked" their advertising banners. We will disclose site usage information to third parties only in aggregate.

The Ad Age Group will remove any registrant for our btobonline.com email products (and their personal information) from our database pursuant to a request from the registrant, including full name and user name, to [webinfo@btobonline.com](mailto:webinfo@btobonline.com).
