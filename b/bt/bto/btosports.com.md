# Privacy Policy - BTO Sports

Privacy Policy  
  
**Customer Information  
**BTO Sports is firmly committed to protecting your privacy. We do not distribute a customer's information outside the BTO Sports organization. This customer information is solely used to build and maintain a typical business-to-customer data base. Within the checkout process, we use an order form to enable your purchase of products. In connection with your purchase, we ask for contact and shipping information (name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, etc.) and billing information (credit card number, etc.). To insure that you are aware of our current privacy policy, we suggest that you stop back and review this policy from time to time.

**Secure Servers  
**Some customer information is supplied to the company which processes your credit card purchases. All order information you provide to us and all information contained in your "Shopping Account" is transmitted using 128 Bit SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption. SSL is a widely used coding system that lets your browser automatically encrypt or scramble data before you send it to us. Transactions will not be permitted if your browser does not accept SSL encryption. Only authorized personnel from BTO Sports or its partners (Payment processor) can decode this information and such personnel will only do so in accordance with our or their Privacy Policy. In addition, to attempt to deter the theft of credit card numbers and other personal information residing in our system, we and our retail partners have installed secure "firewalls" and/or have implemented other security measures to help protect our systems against "hacker" break-ins. Additionally, all credit card numbers are encrypted in our system until either the customer or BTO Sports requires the information.

**Promotional email  
**If you subscribe to our promotional email, you will occasionally receive special offers from us and email updates from us about important functionality changes. This information is not shared with other companies, but it is transmitted over non-secure web servers. If you would rather not receive future emails from us, unsubscribe by typing in your email address.

**Cookies  
**"Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. We may use cookies in several ways, just as thousands of other sites currently do. Cookie files may be used to better understand how you travel through our website so that we may better tailor your experience. Cookies may be also used to tell us whether you have visited our website previously, and to help us determine whether you came to our website from a particular Internet link or banner advertisement. Cookies can also be used to help you save and retrieve passwords and other information and preferences you use on our website, saving you from having to re-enter this information upon every visit to our website. Cookies cannot and will not be used by us to retrieve any personal information about you from your computer that you have not previously and voluntarily provided to us. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in the future. Please note that most of our features, as well as with other web sites, will not function if you do not accept cookies. For more information on cookies, see Cookies on your computer's help menu. We do not use "cookies" to store any personally identifying information.

**IP Addresses  
**When you connect to our website, we record your IP addresses and information on the type of operating system (i.e.Windows98) and browser software you are using (i.e. AOL, Internet Explorer, Netscape). This helps us to diagnose problems with our servers and for system administration. Your IP address is also used to help gather aggregated demographic information.

**Communication  
**E-mail addresses and other information that you send us from the order forms are not used for marketing purposes and are not made available to anyone outside of BTO Sports. We do NOT make your e-mail addresses or any other information available to any other companies. Your e-mail address will NOT be released to any third party companies.
