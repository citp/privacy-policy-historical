                        <p>When you first log on to use your internet access service from BT you will be shown a screen asking if you want to activate parental controls or not. We keep a record of whether or not you have activated parental controls and will continue to offer them to you each time you log in if you ignore the request. The only data we will capture is whether or not you have activated parental controls and the level of you have activation selected.<br>
                        We give numbers of activations to the Government and keep an aggregated and anonymous report of the sites which are blocked.

                    <h1>Cookies</h1>
                    <p>A cookie is a text file with a small bit of information in it, which a server downloads onto your computer, tablet or smartphone when you visit a website. Then you can be recognised when you come back, or when you visit another site which recognises that cookie.</p>
                    <p>Different types of cookie do different things. Some let you navigate between different pages on a website. Some remember your website preferences. Some give you adverts tailored to your interests. And some measure how many sites or which you visit. Session-based cookies sit on your device while you're on a website then expire once you shut your web browser. Persistent cookies stay on your device for longer, then automatically expire.</p>
                    <p>The law says we have to give you details about the cookies we use and why we use them. We also have to have your consent to use them. So we've developed a system of classifying the different types of cookie we use on bt.com, or that third parties might download to your device via our websites. Our cookie classification system explains how we use the cookies, and also determines how we ask for your consent to use them. We also explain what functionality you lose if you decide you don't want to have them on your device.</p>
                    <p>To keep things simple, we use different icons to represent cookie categories. Each icon links to a more detailed description. We fix the icons to a sliding scale which you can set to choose which cookie types you want to have on your device at any time. The tool bar displaying these icons is at the foot of every page on bt.com.</p>
                    <p>When you first visit bt.com you'll see a notice telling you we use cookies, why we use them, and how you can change which cookies you accept – using the sliding scale toolbar and clicking on the icons. If you enter bt.com having seen this notice, without making changes to our standard cookie settings, we take that to mean you're happy with the settings as they are. If you change the settings using the icons on the sliding scale, that means you consent to use the ones you haven't disabled.</p>
                    <p>Some cookies are 'strictly necessary' for us to give you the online service you've asked for. We don't ask for your permission to use these and all the information collected by those cookies is anonymous and doesn't in any way affect your privacy. We use 'performance' cookies to measure how our websites perform so we can improve our pages and measure how that works for visitors.</p>
                    <p>You can't disable 'strictly necessary' or 'performance' cookies and by using our website and online services, you're automatically agreeing to have those on your device.</p>
                    <p>You can get into the cookie classification system anytime. Just look for the 'cookie preferences' tool bar. To make your choices, slide the bar over the icons and click on an icon for a detailed description of that type of cookie.</p>
                    <p>We also give a list of the individual cookies we use in each category in the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bt.com/static/includes/globalheader/cookies/more-about-cookies.html">'more about cookies'</a> section. That's so if you check your internet settings, you know what these are if you've agreed we can use them. You can always take cookies off your device using your browser settings. But if you do, some things won't work as well – for example, lots of pop up boxes might run the same ads, or you mightn't be able to get to a page you earlier personalised.</p>
                    <p>Your browser options let you choose whether to accept, not to accept or be warned before accepting cookies. (They're in the advanced preferences section.)

                    <h1>Legals</h1>
                    <h3>Credit Checks</h3>
                    <p>When you buy something from us, we might have to do a credit check. That means looking into your records with credit reference agencies (like Experian or Equifax), the Interactive Media in Retail Group (IMRG) security alert, or fraud prevention agencies. When they get a search from us, a 'footprint' goes on your file which other organisations might see.</p>
                    <p>We might keep personal information we find out about you – but we have a strict policy for how we look after it and keep it safe. We also keep the results of the searches we do with credit agencies so we don't have to do another search if you buy something new from us in the future. But we only keep your credit data for a reasonable amount of time.</p>
                    <p>We'll also do checks to confirm your identity when you want a new phone line. That's to help protect you from identity theft and fraud, and to prevent and detect crime or money laundering. And once in a while we might run more checks with CRAs and FPAs to keep your account with us up to date.</p>
                    <p>If you tell us you've got a spouse or financial associate, we'll link your records together – so you must make sure you have their agreement to disclose information about them. CRAs also link your records together and these links will stay on your and their files – unless you or your partner successfully files for a disassociation with the CRAs to sever that link.</p>
                    <p>We send CRAs information on applications, and they hold onto that. We may also give them details of your accounts and bills, including how you manage them. That includes telling them about your account balances, what you pay us and when you miss a payment (going back in the past, too). If you don't pay your bills on time, CRAs will record that. They, or a fraud prevention agency, might tell others doing similar checks – including organisations trying to trace you or recover money you owe them.</p>
                    <p>There are a few different CRAs in the UK, and each one might have different information on you. If you want to find out what information they have on you, they'll charge you a small statutory fee.</p>

                    <h3>Disclosure and sharing data</h3>
                    <p>We may share your personal information with other companies in the BT Group who may use it for the purposes set out in this Privacy Centre.</p>
                    <p>We sometimes use other companies to provide some of our services or to provide services to us. To do that, they may need to process your personal information. When we do, they have to follow our instructions and comply with the Data Protection Act 1998.</p>
                    <p>We might transfer your personal information to places outside the European Economic Area and store it there, where our (or our suppliers') people might process it. If that happens, we require them to apply the same security standards as when we process your information in the UK.</p>
                    <p>Sometimes we ask specialist partners to call you, on our behalf, to offer you things from BT we think you might want. We've listed these partners <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bt.com/partners">here</a>. If someone contacts you who isn't on the list but claims to be acting for us, get in touch straight away on 0800 800 150 so we can check it out.</p>
                    <p>If law enforcement agencies ask us in the proper way, we may give them information about you. We do that so they can prevent and detect crime, and prosecute offenders. We may also provide information to protect national security. In all cases, we do this in accordance with the law.</p>
                    <p>We also provide information when the law says we have to such as in response to a court order or other lawful demand.</p>
                    <h3>Monitoring and Recording communications</h3>
                    <p>We may monitor and record our communications with you, including e-mails and phone conversations. Information which we collect may then be used for training purposes, quality assurance, to record details about the products and services you order from us or ask us about, and in order to meet our legal and regulatory obligations generally.</p>
                    <p>We regularly review our privacy policy. The last update was on 18th September 2013.</p>
                    <h3>Accessing your information</h3>
                    <p>We want to make sure that any data we hold on you is up to date. So if you think your personal information is inaccurate, you can ask us to correct or remove it.</p>
                    <p>Under the Data Protection Act 1998 individuals have the right to know what information we hold on them. If you'd like a copy of some or all of your personal information, write to us at:</p>
