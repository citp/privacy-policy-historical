			<h4>1. GENERAL PRINCIPLES</h4>

We endeavor to comply with laws of other countries but cannot and do not warrant that we do. We do everything we reasonably can to protect your rights of privacy on systems and the Website controlled by us, but we are not liable for any unauthorized or unlawful disclosures of your personal and confidential information made by third parties who are not subject to our control, for example advertisers and websites that have links to our Website. You should take note that the information and privacy practices of our business partners, advertisers, sponsors or other sites to which we provide hyperlinks, may be different from ours.</p>

			<p>We want you to</p>
			  <ul>
			    <li>feel comfortable using our web sites</li>

			<p>(h) Stored Information: Data either created by you or by a third party and which you wish to store on our servers such as image files, documents etc.</p>
			<p>We collect your Personal Information to conduct our business and to enable us to deliver and improve our Services.</p>

			<p>We will only disclose your Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If we want to use it for any other purpose, we will obtain your prior written consent.</p>
			<p>If you decline to submit personal information to us, then we will unfortunately not be in a position to provide the Services to you.</p>
			<p>Any of your information which you provide when you use certain Services and are to an open, public environment or forum including (without limitation) any blog, community or discussion board, is not confidential, does not constitute Personal Information, and is not subject to protection under Privacy Policy.</p>
			<p>Since such public environments are accessible by third parties, it is possible that third parties may collect and collate and use such information for their own purposes. You should accordingly be careful when deciding to share any of your Personal Information in such public environments.</p>
			<p>Information, which is disclosed publicly, is also shared with our affiliates, third party service providers, sponsors of competitions etc. unless expressly stated otherwise.</p>
			<p>We are not liable to you or any third party for any damages that you or any third party may suffer howsoever arising from your disclosure of Personal Information in any public environment. You accordingly disclose information in a public environment at your own risk.</p>

			<h4>2. RIGHT TO COLLECT</h4>
			<p>By accepting the Terms of Service you agree that we may collect and store your Personal Information as long as you use our Services subject to the limitations set out in this Privacy Policy.</p>
			<p>2.1 We collect your Profiling and Account Information for the following reasons:</p>
			<p>(a) We need your identity details, contact details, banking information and account history to manage our relationship with you and provide Services to you. We will only disclose this information as per mutually agreed terms and condition.</p>
			<p>(b) We use certain of your information in an aggregated form to compile statistical and demographical profiles for our business and marketing activities. We may disclose such information about you, provided that the information is in an aggregated form that is not capable of being used or interpreted in such a manner as to identify you.</p>

			<p>2.2 We collect and store your Service Usage and Transactional Information to:</p>
			<p>(a) determine and verify the Service Charges payable by you and to administer our relationship with you.</p>
			<p>(b) comply with any statutory or regulatory requirement.</p>
			<p>(c) compile statistical and demographical profiles about you for our business and marketing activities and to customize our Services to you. While we are entitled to use such information about you for our own internal business purposes without limitation, we will only disclose it in an aggregated form which is not capable of being used or interpreted in such a manner as to identify you; and</p>
			<p>(d) monitor your use of our Services for the purposes of ensuring compliance with our Terms of Service.</p>

			<p>2.3 We collect and store your Correspondence Information and Personal Identifiers to:</p>

			<p>Sometime we use "cookies" so that we can provide you with more customized information when you return to our website. "Cookies" are used to store user preferences and to track user trends, so as to enhance your interactive experience and generally improve our Services to you. You can set your browser to notify you when you are sent a "cookie", giving you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. If you do accept a "cookie", you thereby agree to our use of any Personal Information collected by us using that Cookie.</p>
			<p>You may update your Profiling Information at any time on the website.</p>
			<p>You acknowledge and agree that in the interests of improving personalisation and Service efficiency, we may, under controlled and secure circumstances, share your Personal Information with our affiliates (an entity which is our subsidiary or holding company or a subsidiary of our holding company or an entity which controls, is controlled by or is under common control with us).</p>

			<h4>3. GENERAL EXCEPTIONS</h4>
			<p>If we are required to intercept, disclose, monitor and/or store your Personal Information:</p>
			<p>(a) by law;</p>
			<p>(b) to conduct our business;</p>
			<p>(c) to secure our systems; or</p>
			<p>(d) to enforce our own rights,</p>
			<p>we will do so in the manner as prescribed by law.</p>
			<p>Such interception, disclosure, monitoring and storage may take place without your knowledge. In that case, we will not be liable to you or any third party for any damages howsoever arising from such interception, disclosure, monitoring and storage. In order to ensure that all our Users comply with the Terms of Service, we may monitor your Personal Information to the extent that this may be required to determine compliance and/or to identify instances of non-compliance. To ensure that the security and integrity of our Services are safeguarded, we may monitor your Personal Information. This monitoring may include (without limitation) the filtering of incoming and outgoing electronic data messages to identify, limit and/or prevent the transmission of spam, viruses and/or unlawful, defamatory, obscene or otherwise undesirable material or content. We may under certain circumstances procure an element of the Services from a third party service provider. To the extent that it may be necessary, and solely for the purposes of providing the Service to you, you agree that we may disclose to such third party any of your Personal Information that may be necessary for the procurement of services from the third party.</p>

			<h4>4. CHANGES IN PRIVACY POLICY</h4>
			<p>From time to time we may make changes to our privacy policy If we make changes, we will post them on our site to make users aware of what the changes are so users will always be aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and when we may disclose it. A User is bound by any minor changes to the policy when she or he uses the site after those changes have been posted If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner materially different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify by posting a notice on our Web site for 30 days.</p>
