### Collection and Use of Your Information (including via Cookies)

We use cookies, web beacons and similar technologies (called "Cookies" in this Online Privacy Statement) to track information provided to us by your browser and by our software application when you use the Site. A cookie is a small piece of information that a website stores on the web browser on your device and can later retrieve. "Session" Cookies are temporary and will expire at the end of a browser session; that is, when you leave a website. Session Cookies allow a website to recognize you and carry information as you navigate between pages during a single browser session and allow you to use the website most efficiently. "Persistent” Cookies, in contrast, remain in the Cookie file of your browser even after you leave a website and after the browser is closed. They enable a website to recognize you upon your return, remember your preferences and provide tailored services to you. A cookie will not contain information that will enable us to contact you via telephone, e-mail, or other means.

We, and third party service providers acting on our behalf, use session and persistent Cookies to:
