**Information BNED Collects About You**

       **Information You Provide to Us**

BNED may collect information, including personal information, directly from you when you visit the Sites. For example, we collect information from you when you create a user account; make purchases; subscribe to receive emails or notifications; or otherwise communicate with us through the Sites. “Personal Information” is information that identifies you specifically, and the types of Personal Information we collect may include your name, billing address, zip code, email address, phone number, and payment card number.

       **Information Collected Automatically**

Certain information about you may be collected automatically when you access or use the Sites. This information may include IP address, browser and device type, operating system characteristics, information about your use of the Sites, data regarding your geographic location, and data regarding network-connected hardware (such as unique device identifiers, type, model, version, MAC address, device or session ID, functionality, performance data, and connection type). This information also may include clickstream data, which illustrates the page-by-page path(s) you take as you browse the Sites.

**Cookies and Tracking GIFs.** We may use “cookies” to collect information about you when you visit the Sites. Cookies are small text files placed on visitors’ computers/devices to store information about their activities on the Sites, such as their user preferences. In addition to cookies, tracking GIFs may be set by us or third parties to collect information about your use of the Sites. Tracking GIFs are small image files embedded within the content of the Sites to monitor which parts of the Sites are visited and whether particular content is of interest.

Most web browsers are set to automatically accept cookies, but many provide options to allow you to stop accepting new cookies or to disable existing cookies. Please be aware that if you disable the cookies on your computer you may not be able to use certain features of the Sites, and disabling cookies may invalidate opt outs that rely on cookies to function.

It is possible that third parties may collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites and devices when you use the Sites. Note that your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to websites and online services you visit. Like many websites, the Sites currently are not designed to respond to “Do Not Track” signals from visitors’ browsers. To learn more about “Do Not Track” you may wish to visit [this site](https://allaboutdnt.com/).

**How We May Share Your Information**

Certain of our affiliates (such as parent companies, subsidiaries, or other companies within our corporate family), agents, vendors, consultants, the colleges and universities with which we have management agreements to perform retail services, and other service providers may have access to your Personal Information to carry out work on our behalf or to provide services or information to you. These third-party service providers and agents are prohibited from using your Personal Information for any purpose other than to provide this assistance.

We also may share information about you for the following purposes:

•   **Disclosures as required by law or to prevent harm.** We may disclose IP addresses, mobile device identifiers, or any other information we collect to identify users, in our discretion and without notice to you, for purposes of cooperating with copyright owners, Internet service providers, wireless service providers, or law enforcement agencies.

•   **In the event of corporate sale or merger.** BNED may share information with third parties (such as purchasers, potential purchasers and their advisers) if BNED or a portion of its assets is sold or offered for sale. We reserve the right to transfer any information we obtain about you through the Sites in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets (including in the event of a merger, reorganization, or liquidation).
