**Interacting with social networking sites**

Our Apps may provide you with the ability to enter (directly, or by authorizing us to download the information from a third party such as a social networking site or application) personal information such as contacts or lists of friends. These or related applications may also allow you to provide information directly to social networking sites including information about your purchases, physical location, or comments. 

**Signing up for promotional communications**

If you sign up to receive promotional communications or notifications from us, we may ask you to provide personal information so that we can provide these to you.

  * Wireless networks operated by BNED in retail stores

  * Your college or university
  * Business partners, contractors, and other third parties



For your convenience, we have provided a summary description of each of these circumstances below.

**Web server logs**

When you visit a BNED Website, our web servers may automatically log information that your browser sends us. For example, we may receive and collect: the name of the domain and host from which you access the Internet; the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer you are using; the date and time you access the BNED Website; and the Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to the BNED Website. We may also collect information regarding search queries run on the BNED Website. We use this information to monitor the usage of the BNED Websites and as necessary for our business.

**Cookies**

Like many online retailers, we and/or our third party providers use cookies to recognize you as you use or return to the BNED Websites. This is done so that we can personalize and enhance your browsing and shopping experience. "Cookies" are small files that are placed in your browser to collect information about your activities on a BNED Website. Cookies help us to: (1) speed navigation, keep track of items in your shopping bag and provide you with content that is tailored to you; (2) remember information you gave us so that you do not have to re-enter it; (3) determine the effectiveness of some of our and our third party partners' marketing efforts and communications; and (4) monitor the total number of visitors, pages viewed, and the total number of ads displayed. 

Browsers are typically set to create cookies automatically. You can choose to have your browser notify you when cookies are being written or accessed, or you can disable cookies entirely. If you disable cookies, however, you will not be able to place items in a BNED Website shopping bag, and therefore you will not be able to place an order with us online. Also, by not using cookies, some BNED Website features and services may not function properly.

**Pixel tags or clear GIFs**

We may use sensing technologies that use pixel tags or clear GIFs (which are also called web beacons). These technologies allow us to determine the effectiveness of our e-mail and advertising and marketing efforts. For this purpose, we tie the pixel tags and clear GIFs to personally identifiable information. We may also collect information regarding the links within such marketing materials that you click on and purchase statistics regarding items you buy following receipt of such marketing.

**Third party web analytics services**

We work with third party service providers, including but not limited to IBM Coremetrics and Google Analytics, to help us better understand how you use the BNED Websites. These third party service providers will place cookies in your browser to collect information such as how you were referred to the BNED Website, how you navigate around the BNED Website, what you purchase and what traffic is driven by various marketing methods. This information will help us to better serve you and provide you with more personalized information and product offerings. We do not allow third party service providers to collect your credit card information, e-mail address or password information. These third party service providers may only use your personal information to perform services for us and may not share your personal information with anyone else, or use it for any other purpose, except on an aggregated, non-personally identifiable basis.

To learn more about the privacy practices of Google, you may review its privacy policy located here. To disable the Google Analytics cookie and other third party web analytics service provider cookies, you can choose to have your browser notify you when cookies are being written to your computer or accessed, or you can disable cookies entirely.

**Targeted advertising**

We may partner with third party advertising networks that collect IP addresses, unique device identifiers (UDIDs), browser type, operating system, time zone, country, referring pages, and other information through the use of cookies, web server logs and pixel tags on BNED Websites, Apps, emails and on third party websites and emails. They use this information to provide you with advertisements that are customized to your particular preferences, including for companies that are not affiliated with us. You may see these advertisements on BNED Websites and third party apps and websites, and across different devices you use. We may use this process to help us manage and improve the effectiveness of our marketing efforts. If you would like to learn more about the third party advertisers that may be aware of the fact that you visit BNED Websites or use our Apps, and to understand your opt-out choices, please visit the website of the National Advertising Initiative here. Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads.

Please understand that BNED does not control these third party cookies, and you should check the privacy policies of third party advertising networks to see whether and how it uses cookies.

**Apps you use, including geolocation**

When you use our Apps, we automatically collect information through the App when it is connected to the Internet. For example, we may receive and collect information concerning operating system, settings, usage, search queries, network interaction, the name of the network from which you access the Internet, the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the device you are using, unique device identifiers (UDIDs), downloads, configuration, or service information relating to any malfunction of the App. This may include information regarding your activity on such Apps, such as books or textbooks opened, date and time of use, time elapsed, page turns, bookmarks, annotations, customer reviews, and quiz or test answers.

In addition, to provide location-based services through Apps, BNED may automatically collect real-time geographic location information or other location-based information about you and the mobile device on which the App is installed. This information may be used to provide certain device or application functionality or to offer, provide and improve products and services.

**Wireless networks operated by BNED in retail stores**

When you connect your computer or mobile device to wireless networks operated by BNED at store locations, we may collect information concerning your location, unique device identifiers (UDIDs), date and time of access and information regarding your interaction with the BNED enterprise through BNED Websites or Apps as permitted by this Privacy Policy.

**Social networking sites**

We may provide you the ability to sign into a BNED Website or App using a social networking account such as a Facebook, Twitter or Google account, or use your social networking accounts to share information from BNED Websites or Apps. In these cases, as well as when you use a BNED App on a social networking site or choose to join (or "like") a BNED page on a social networking site, the social networking site may provide us with certain information about you, including but not limited to your contacts and other "likes". Please see the privacy policy for the applicable social networking site to learn more about how these sites share your personal information.
