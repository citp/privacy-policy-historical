Last updated December 26, 2018

Branch Metrics, Inc. ( **"Branch"** , **"us"** or **"we"** ) offers a linking and analytics platform enabling developers of applications (our " **Clients** ")--whether those applications are websites or "apps," and across different types of devices--to improve their end users’ (" **Users** ") cross-application experiences, and to derive additional insights into how their Users download and utilize those applications. Branch recognizes and believes that data privacy is important to all Internet users, and therefore we design and operate our services in a privacy-first manner. 

This Privacy Policy is divided into three parts, and is intended to meet requirements globally, including those in North America, Europe, APAC, and other jurisdictions: 

  * **Collection and Use of Information from Our Services:** This section explains how information is collected about our Clients’ Users, and used, by Branch in connection with the provision of our products and services (the " **Branch Services** " or the " **Services** "). 
  * **Collection and Use of Information from Our Website:** This section explains how information is collected and used by us from our website visitors through our website located at branch.io (the " **Website** "), which includes the dashboard provided to our Clients located at dashboard.branch.io. So, if you are a Client using our Branch dashboard, this section applies to the data we collect from you. 
  * **Policies Applicable to Both Our Services & Our Website:** This section lays out the parts of the Branch Privacy Policy that apply to both the Services and to the Website.



## **Collection and Use of Information from Our Services**

### What Information Does Branch Collect from Our Services?

Top

Below, we explain what information we collect on behalf of our Clients through the Services, and how we use it. We process information in a way that is relevant for the purpose for which it was collected as described below. 

#### The Branch Services: Overview

Branch provides a variety of Services intended to help Clients bridge together the identity of their Users across a wide array of platforms, devices and applications. Branch helps Clients by connecting User interactions across siloed applications (email, SMS, web browsers, social platforms, native applications and others), so that Clients understand the multiple steps that a User took to ultimately complete a transaction with the business. This information is used by the Client to better inform marketing and product decisions as well as to provide improved user experiences by using their knowledge of continuity. 

Branch has no direct relationship with Users. Branch’s Services are provided when Branch Clients install on their platforms “Branch Mechanisms” (including links, pixels, direct platform integrations, etc.) that capture the User action on behalf of the Client. By associating the information collected from these Mechanisms, Branch creates and stores identifiers unique to the Branch platform, and then uses a variety of techniques to connect these User actions and identifiers together. Some of these common connection techniques include a direct pass-through of identifiers from platform to platform, probabilistic matching using real time and historical parameters observed from each interaction, as well as using historical connections aggregated across the Branch platform. In some cases, these connections are made without the use of cookies. These techniques help Clients match Users with devices they use, including matching the same User across multiple devices. 

The key use cases of Branch’s connection service are: 

  * To support Clients in implementing deep linking, which uses Branch’s connection information in real time to improve the User experience. 
    * For example, if a User clicks on a link in an email or ad to a specific page in a Client’s app, Branch helps the User get to that page after they download the app.
  * To report individualized and aggregated analytics metrics about the performance of the Client’s product and marketing initiatives to the Client directly. 
    * For example, Branch can tell a Client how many Users that downloaded an app or that went to a specific page in an app came from clicking on a specific link, and provide corresponding advertising identifiers.
  * To assist the Client by presenting real time, targeted messaging to their Users depending on past behavior observed across the tracked platforms with the purpose of driving more engagement to the Client. 
    * For example, Branch can use Branch Mechanisms to provide a tailored message like a coupon code or special offer in your website to users who have interacted with your app and/or website in the past.



Branch requires that each Client commit to share with Branch only information that it has lawfully obtained (including, where necessary, by obtaining consent from Users, or from their parents for children under 13, or in certain jurisdictions, under 16), and that it has the right to share with Branch, and we strongly discourage Clients from sharing sensitive User information with us, as such information is not necessary for the provision of the Services. 

In the charts below, we summarize the information collected automatically by the Services. 

#### Information Collected By Branch Links and Pixels

Branch collects the following information from web URLs created by the Client and pixels placed on Client websites. Some of this information is considered personal data under applicable law (in other words, information that itself may identify a unique individual or can be linked back to an individual) (“ **Personal Data** ”). 

**Type of Information Collected** | **Purpose**  
---|---  
IP Address | Standard web HTTP request; used for matching  
Cookie | Standard web cookies, used for matching

### How Does Branch Use Information Collected by Our Services?

Top

Data Branch collects through the Services is processed: 

  * to better understand how Users come to download certain apps, what types of apps are popular, or to infer that certain browsers and devices are operated by the same User based upon information collected across multiple non-affiliated apps and websites.
  * to provide, maintain, optimize, research and improve the Branch Services.
  * to fulfill Clients’ and prospective Clients’ requests for the Services including processing data at the Client’s direction and transferring User data to them. Branch does not control how Clients use information Branch shares with Clients and Users should read Clients’ Privacy Policies to understand how they use information they receive from Branch.
  * to analyze and aggregate Client data with data of other Clients for Branch’s own internal business purposes and as permitted by applicable law.
  * to create reports based on aggregated information, which is information that cannot be linked back to any individual person or Client, and share these reports with the public.



### Our Clients’ Use of Information

Top

Our Clients use the information collected via the Services to improve their Users’ app experiences, customize their apps to Users, and to better understand their app marketing programs and how Users discover their apps. For example, a User may want to share information about a hotel that she found in a travel app with a friend. When that User sends her friend a Branch link to that hotel, after clicking the link the friend is brought directly to the content relating to that hotel within the app, rather than landing on the app’s homepage and having to search for the hotel. The travel app would also gain insights and analytics as to how the content is being shared from its app. 

We require that our Clients utilize our Services responsibly and in accordance with our Terms & Conditions. Branch is not responsible for the data practices of any of our Clients through the Services or otherwise. Each Client’s practices are subject to each Client’s individual privacy policy. Users should review the privacy policy of each Client to understand how that Client uses User information collected through the Services. 

Branch recognizes a number of consumer choice mechanisms. 

**Mobile Device Identifier:** To exercise the mobile device privacy settings controls, please visit the privacy settings of your Android or iOS device and select [“opt-out of interest based ads” (Android)](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/6048248?hl=en) or [“limit ad tracking” (Apple iOS)](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202074). Branch will only be able to collect information as permitted by these settings. 

**Branch’s Browser Cookie Opt-out:** Our cookie-based opt-out can be accessed by clicking [here](https://app.link/optout). This will place a Branch opt-out cookie on your browser. Where Branch detects the presence of that opt-out cookie, we will no longer set cookies (beyond the opt-out cookie itself). Due to the nature of the Services, some functionality will be degraded or no longer work as a result. Cookie-based opt-outs must be performed on each device and browser that you wish to have opted-out. For example, if you have opted-out on your computer browser, that opt-out will not be effective on your mobile device. 

**Client App Opt-out Controls:** Branch supports functionality to allow Clients to respect granular controls regarding User data privacy rights. Clients can flag in the Branch SDK that a particular User has requested that their data not be processed by Branch, in which case Branch will no longer process engagement data on behalf of the Client for that User. 

## **Collection and Use of Information from Our Website**

Clients also have the option of adding other team members to their account. This account information enables us to set up an account for Clients, to provide the Services, and to otherwise manage Client accounts. We may also use this information to notify Clients about updates to our Services and provide them with promotional emails. We offer a mechanism to opt-out from promotional emails as described in the “Opt-out from Promotional Emails” section below. 

**Account and Billing Information:** To the extent that we charge a fee for the Services, we may also collect billing and payment information from Clients through our third-party payment processors.

If you choose to connect Branch to such third-party services, we may collect information related to your use of those third-party services, such as authentication tokens that allow us to connect to your third-party service accounts.

We may also collect information about how you are using the Services to interact with those connected third-party services. 

**Communications with Branch:** Some Users may provide Personal Data to Branch by sending us an email or filling out an online form on the Website. We use this information to answer their question(s), and may store that information for our record keeping, marketing, and advertising purposes. 

**Research/Survey Solicitations:** From time to time, we may perform research (online and offline) via surveys. We may engage third-party service providers to conduct such surveys on our behalf. All survey responses are voluntary, and the information collected will be used for research and reporting purposes to help us better serve individuals by learning more about their needs and the quality of the products and services we provide. The survey responses may be utilized to determine the effectiveness of our Website, various types of communications, advertising campaigns and/or promotional activities. 

**Cookies, Pixels and Web Beacons:** We also collect other data via the Website from Website Users, including Website Users employed by or affiliated with Clients, through [cookies and/or web beacons](https://web.archive.org/cookie-declaration/).

If you consent to the use of cookies and web beacons when you visit the Website, we will collect information through those tools.

### Privacy Shield For EU and Swiss Personal Data Transferred into the United States

Branch complies with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland transferred to the United States pursuant to Privacy Shield.  Branch has certified that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to such data. If there is any conflict between the policies in this privacy policy and data subject rights under the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification page, please visit [https://www.privacyshield.gov](https://www.privacyshield.gov/). 

Branch is subject to the investigatory and enforcement authority of the US Federal Trade Commission. 

Pursuant to the Privacy Shield Frameworks we are obliged to inform EU and Swiss individuals whose data is being transferred into the United States that we may be required to release personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities including to meet national security and law enforcement requirements. 

Branch remains liable for the onward transfer of EU and Swiss personal data to agent third parties pursuant to the Privacy Shield unless we can prove we were not a party to the actions giving rise to the damages.

If your Privacy Shield complaint cannot be resolved through the above channels, under certain conditions, you may invoke binding arbitration for some residual claims not resolved by other redress mechanisms.  See Privacy Shield Annex 1 at <https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=ANNEX-I-introduction>. 

### Rights of Access, Rectification, Erasure and Restriction For EU Individuals Pursuant to GDPR

Top

**Services:** Because Branch is a service provider that processes data on behalf of its Clients, any requests relating to European Users’ exercise of their rights of access, rectification, erasure, or restriction under the European General Data Protection Regulation ( **“GDPR”** ) must be provided to Branch by a Client. Clients can notify Branch of these requests [here](https://gdpr.branch.io/hc/en-us/requests/new). 

Moreover, Branch supports functionality to allow Clients to respect granular controls regarding User data privacy rights. Clients can flag in the Branch SDK that a particular User has requested that their data not be processed by Branch, in which case Branch will no longer process engagement data on behalf of the Client for that User. 

**Website:** Website Users who are residents of the European Economic Area may seek confirmation regarding whether Branch is processing Personal Data about you, request access to such data, and ask that we correct, amend, or delete it where it is inaccurate or has been processed in violation of the Privacy Shield Principles. You can submit such requests starting on May 25, 2018 at [ https://gdpr.branch.io/hc/en-us/requests/new](https://gdpr.branch.io/hc/en-us/requests/new), which will be processed in line with applicable law. Although we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your Personal Data, there may be circumstances in which we are unable to provide access, including but not limited to: where the information contains legal privilege, would compromise others’ privacy or other legitimate rights, where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to your privacy in the case in question, or where it is commercially proprietary. To protect your privacy, we will take commercially reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access to or making any changes to your Personal Data. 

European individuals have the right to file a GDPR complaint directly with the appropriate EU Data Authority. For information on who those parties are and how they can be reached please go to <http://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/structure/data-protection-authorities/index_en.htm>.
