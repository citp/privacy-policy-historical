</ul>

<p>For your convenience, we have provided a summary description of each of these circumstances below.</p>

<p><b>Web server logs</b><br>

When you visit a BNED Website, our web servers may automatically log information that your browser sends us. For example, we may receive and collect: the name of the domain and host from which you access the Internet; the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer you are using; the date and time you access the BNED Website; and the Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to the BNED Website. We may also collect information regarding search queries run on the BNED Website. We use this information to monitor the usage of the BNED Websites and as necessary for our business.</p>

<p><b>Cookies</b><br>
<br>
Like many online retailers, we and/or our third party providers use cookies to recognize you as you use or return to the BNED Websites. This is done so that we can personalize and enhance your browsing and shopping experience. "Cookies" are small files that are placed in your browser to collect information about your activities on a BNED Website. Cookies help us to: (1) speed navigation, keep track of items in your shopping bag and provide you with content that is tailored to you; (2) remember information you gave us so that you do not have to re-enter it; (3) determine the effectiveness of some of our and our third party partners' marketing efforts and communications; and (4) monitor the total number of visitors, pages viewed, and the total number of ads displayed. <br>
<br>
Browsers are typically set to create cookies automatically. You can choose to have your browser notify you when cookies are being written or accessed, or you can disable cookies entirely. If you disable cookies, however, you will not be able to place items in a BNED Website shopping bag, and therefore you will not be able to place an order with us online. Also, by not using cookies, some BNED Website features and services may not function properly.</p>

<p><b>Pixel tags or clear GIFs</b><br>
<br>
We may use sensing technologies that use pixel tags or clear GIFs (which are also called web beacons). These technologies allow us to determine the effectiveness of our e-mail and advertising and marketing efforts. For this purpose, we tie the pixel tags and clear GIFs to personally identifiable information. We may also collect information regarding the links within such marketing materials that you click on and purchase statistics regarding items you buy following receipt of such marketing.</p>

<p><b>Third party web analytics services</b><br>
<br>
We work with third party service providers, including but not limited to IBM Coremetrics and Google Analytics, to help us better understand how you use the BNED Websites. These third party service providers will place cookies in your browser to collect information such as how you were referred to the BNED Website, how you navigate around the BNED Website, what you purchase and what traffic is driven by various marketing methods. This information will help us to better serve you and provide you with more personalized information and product offerings. We do not allow third party service providers to collect your credit card information, e-mail address or password information. These third party service providers may only use your personal information to perform services for us and may not share your personal information with anyone else, or use it for any other purpose, except on an aggregated, non-personally identifiable basis.<br>

<p><b>Targeted advertising</b><br>
<br>
We may partner with third party advertising networks that collect IP addresses, unique device identifiers (UDIDs), browser type, operating system, time zone, country, referring pages, and other information through the use of cookies, web server logs and pixel tags on BNED Websites, Apps, emails and on third party websites and emails. They use this information to provide you with advertisements that are customized to your particular preferences, including for companies that are not affiliated with us. You may see these advertisements on BNED Websites and third party apps and websites, and across different devices you use. We may use this process to help us manage and improve the effectiveness of our marketing efforts. If you would like to learn more about the third party advertisers that may be aware of the fact that you visit BNED Websites or use our Apps, and to understand your opt-out choices, please visit the website of the National Advertising Initiative here. Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads.<br>
<br>
Please understand that BNED does not control these third party cookies, and you should check the privacy policies of third party advertising networks to see whether and how it uses cookies.</p>

<p><b>Apps you use, including geolocation</b><br>

When you use our Apps, we automatically collect information through the App when it is connected to the Internet. For example, we may receive and collect information concerning operating system, settings, usage, search queries, network interaction, the name of the network from which you access the Internet, the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the device you are using, unique device identifiers (UDIDs), downloads, configuration, or service information relating to any malfunction of the App. This may include information regarding your activity on such Apps, such as books or textbooks opened, date and time of use, time elapsed, page turns, bookmarks, annotations, customer reviews, and quiz or test answers.<br>
<br>
In addition, to provide location-based services through Apps, BNED may automatically collect real-time geographic location information or other location-based information about you and the mobile device on which the App is installed. This information may be used to provide certain device or application functionality or to offer, provide and improve products and services.<br>

<br>
We may provide you the ability to sign into a BNED Website or App using a social networking account such as a Facebook, Twitter or Google account, or use your social networking accounts to share information from BNED Websites or Apps.

<p><a name="q6"></a><b>6. How do we secure personal information?</b><br>
<br>
We take significant and appropriate security measures, including physical, technological and procedural measures, to help to safeguard your personal information and to prevent unauthorized access and disclosure. In addition, we use industry-standard technology, such as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology in the transmission of certain sensitive personal information, designed to prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your personal information, and, as technology develops, we intend to take additional measures to improve security.<br>
<br>
We want you to feel confident whenever you visit us in our stores, on the BNED Websites, or use BNED Apps. While we are focused on the security of your personal information and follow strict standards, processes and procedures that are designed to protect your personal information, you must remember that the Internet is a global communications vehicle open to threats, viruses and intrusions from others and so we cannot promise, and you should not expect, that we will be able to protect your personal information at all times and in all circumstances.</p>

<br>
If you are a parent or guardian who believes that your Minor under the age of 13 has submitted personal information or other information to us without your consent, please contact <a href="mailto:privacy@bncollege.com">privacy@bncollege.com</a> Once we verify that you are the parent or legal guardian, at your request, we will promptly provide to you information regarding what, if any, personal information we have collected about your child and how it has been used or shared.
