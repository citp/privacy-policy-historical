# Privacy Policy - BzzAgent

Effective: November 15th, 2010

### BzzAgent Privacy Policy

[](https://privacy-policy.truste.com/click-with-confidence/ctv/en/www.bzzagent.com/seal_m "Validate TRUSTe privacy certification")We will closely guard any personally identifiable information you disclose to us during registration or at any other point during your BzzAgent experience. Information will only be shared with a third party if a member requests for that information to be shared, by participating in an offer/program/opt-in/opt-out. A member may request that this information be shared, by opting-in to programs or newsletters that may require information such as, but not be limited to, first name, last name, occupation, e-mail address, mailing address, phone number, selected interests or date of birth. Not all offers/programs/opt-ins/opt-outs specify exactly which pieces of information will be shared. By joining BzzAgent, you are able to opt-in to receive mail from BzzAgent. This Privacy Policy includes and incorporates the BzzAgent Terms and Conditions of Use. 

### Information Collection & Use

When you visit BzzAgent, you provide us with two types of information: personally identifiable information, which you choose to disclose that is collected by us (“PII”), and non personal information, which you either submit as content to the site or which is information collected by us as you interact with our website. We will not sell, share, or rent any information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement without your permission.

BzzAgent, Inc. collects information from our users at several different points on our website as described herein. For instance, when you access the BzzAgent operated website or open one of our HTML emails, we may automatically record certain information from your system by using different types of tracking technology. This “automatically collected” information may include Internet Protocol address (“IP Address”), a unique device or user ID, system type, the content and pages that you access on the BzzAgent site or the dates and times that you visit the site. We also may collect information from third party websites with whom we connect, including Facebook. As an example, if you connect to our site via Facebook, Facebook provides us with certain information from your Facebook account, which may include, without limitation, your Facebook User ID, any Facebook posts, the amount of activity (i.e., comments, likes) that may occur in response to posts, certain demographic information and other information to the extent that you elect to make it publicly available on Facebook. We intend to use such information to allow you to continue to connect to such third party sites while on our site and to display and otherwise disclose to our clients information relating to the volume of activity around a client’s marketing campaign.

BzzAgent may use cookies (as described below) and similar tools to customize the content you receive based on the information you have provided. BzzAgent may share non- personally identifiable information with its clients and business partners, but no such information can be linked directly to you or your account. Furthermore, we may need to disclose PII when required by law such as to comply with a subpoena.

BzzAgent employees and contractors must have a business reason to obtain access to your PII. We may share your PII with those who help us manage or provide our services (for example, order fulfillment, statistical analyses, list analysis, data processing and to comply with unsubscribed lists), or with outside contractors, agents or clients who help us with the administration of such services. These third parties may temporarily store some information on their servers, but they may only use your PII for the specific purpose and no other. We may also provide your PII to a third party in those instances where you have chosen to receive certain information and have been notified that the fulfillment of such a request requires the sharing of your PII.

You and other users may post Submitted Content (as defined in the BzzAgent Terms of Use) on the BzzAgent site or other third party sites and view the Submitted Content of others. You consent to such viewing of such Submitted Content and any subsequent activity resulting therefrom and agree that any Submitted Content posted by you is at your own risk. You should also understand that any information you disclose in your Submitted Content, along with your screen name or ID, or any image or photo, becomes public and may be used by BzzAgent and its clients for online and offline promotional or commercial uses in any and all media. We are not responsible for the PII that you choose to include in such Submitted Content. You understand and acknowledge that, even after removal, copies of Submitted Content may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if other users have copied or stored your Submitted Content. Any improper collection or misuse of information provided on the website is a violation of the BzzAgent Terms of Use and should be reported by e-mail to abuse@bzzagent.com

If you choose to tell someone about our website through tools provided on the site, we will ask you for information needed to send the invitation, such as that person’s email address. We will send the invitee an email or instant message in your name inviting him or her to visit the site, and may send follow-on reminders. BzzAgent stores this information to send invitations and reminders, to register a third party connection if your invitation is accepted, to allow you to see invitations you have sent, and to track the success of our referral program. Your invitee may contact us through the form on our help page to request that we remove this information from our database.

During registration a user is required to give their contact information (such as name, e-mail address, and postal address), additional psychographic information, and information needed for shipping campaign materials. This information is used to notify the user about new campaigns, specific campaign directives and changes in point offerings. Users are also required to provide a valid e-mail address before the account creation process can be completed. In addition, we ask a user to provide legitimate proof of address. Proof and validation of address is required in order to guard BzzAgent, Inc. from fraudulent activities. This information is also used for shipping purposes.
