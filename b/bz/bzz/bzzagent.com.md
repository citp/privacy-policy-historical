#### What information do we collect?

When you register as a member of BzzAgent or interact as part of the BzzAgent community we will receive personal information about you. We will collect information if you [give it to us directly](https://web.archive.org/pg/Privacy-Cookies-Policy#infoWeCollect), for example when you fill in the registration section of the site or answer survey questions. We will also receive information about you if you choose to share it with us via other websites (such when you [connect through Facebook or Twitter](https://web.archive.org/pg/Privacy-Cookies-Policy#fbInfo)) or if you provide it to another company who supplies us with personal information.

#### How do we use your information?

We may use your personal information for reasons such as shipping product samples to you for a campaign, understanding which campaigns might be most relevant to you and evaluating campaigns. You can read more reasons why we collect your personal information within our [Privacy Policy](https://web.archive.org/pg/Privacy-Cookies-Policy). We may share your personal information with other companies that are part of our group of companies so that they can provide you with products and services that are more likely to be suited to you. dunnhumby is part of a larger group of companies so by “group” we mean dunnhumby Limited and its subsidiaries and affiliates. There are also limited circumstances where we might share information outside of our group, such as where we share your contact details with our clients or fulfilment partners so that they can ship items to you directly or for certain campaigns when you have given us your consent to share your information with our clients so that they can provide you with products, services and advertisements that are more likely to be suited to you.

By subscribing to and using our services, you acknowledge and consent that your personal information may be sent to a location which may not afford the same legal protections as the country in which you live. We work to implement measures designed to protect your personal information when we do so.

#### What choices can I make regarding my personal information?

When you sign up to BzzAgent you are able to opt-in to certain communications from us (e.g. emails about campaigns or special offers) and you can change your account preferences at any time if you change your mind.

We may then ask you to opt-in to certain campaigns. If you opt-in to a campaign, we may share the results of your participation in the campaign with our clients. However, in order to protect your privacy, before sharing we aggregate your campaign results with other members so that your "personal information" is not identifiable to our clients. 

For certain campaigns we may ask for your consent to share your “personal information” with the retailer, merchandise manufacturer or other company identified in the campaign.

You can also ask us for a copy of the personal information we hold about you and let us know if you would like us to update your personal information in our records.

You can decide whether you want to receive cookies from us, or if you want to reduce the number of cookies you receive from us but if you disable cookies your user experience of our sites will be limited.
