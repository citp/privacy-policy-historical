Last Updated September 16, 2009

Behr Process Corporation Industries LLC (“Behr Process Corporation”, ”we”, “us”) has created this Privacy Policy for www.Behr.com and other websites operated by Behr Process Corporation that display or link to this Privacy Policy (collectively the “site”) to demonstrate its firm commitment to privacy. This Policy discloses Behr Process Corporation’s information gathering and dissemination practices for the information collected by Behr Process Corporation through this site.

We encourage you to read this Policy before using this site or submitting your personal information to us. Your use of this site signifies that you agree with all terms of this Policy, so please do not use this site or share your personally identifiable information if you disagree with any part of this Policy.

#### How do we Collect and Use Personally Identifiable Information? 

We will collect personally identifiable information about you, such as your name, date of birth, gender, postal address, telephone and mobile numbers, email address and credit card number or other payment number when you voluntarily provide it to us through this site such as when you create an account or profile, order or register a product, order literature, enter contests or incentive programs, sign up for newsletters, participate in a survey, contact customer service, or otherwise interact with this site. You may review and change your information with us at any time by logging into your workbook and clicking on Edit Your Profile.

Your personally identifiable information may be used by us for all legal purposes, which may include, but are not limited to, responding to your requests, processing your transactions, notifying you of new products or product-related news, and for administrative purposes such as conducting incentive programs or tracking which parts of the site are of interest to you.

We use your personally identifiable information to provide the services you request from Behr Process Corporation such as responding to product information requests; registering products; fulfilling orders for parts, products or customer service; initiate refunds; administering contests or incentive programs; and facilitating on-line product visualization applications and preferred products catalogs. We also use personally identifiable information to send you news about our products and promotions, to conduct online surveys, contests or incentive programs via email, telephone or postal mail, and to notify you of special events and advertising that you might be interested in. In addition, we may use the information to improve Behr Process Corporation’s online and other services, such as customer service and product support, to understand consumer preferences in developing product improvements and innovations, and to ensure that our site is of interest to you. We may also use your personally identifiable information for internal business purposes, such as optimizing users' site experiences and analyzing and managing our businesses. If you apply for employment with Behr Process Corporation, we may use the personally identifiable information you supply to process your job application.

This site may offer a feature that allows you to send an electronic postcard or otherwise share a message with a friend. If you choose to do so, we will ask you for the recipient's name and email address, along with the text of any message you choose to include. By using this feature, you warrant that you are entitled to use and provide us with the recipient's name and email address for this purpose.

#### Notice Regarding Use of this Site by Children

This site is not directed to children under the age of 18, and we request that children do not provide personally identifiable information through the site.

#### How we Collect and Use Non-Personal Information

We may also collect other information that is not personally identifiable through this site (“non-personal information”) such as your postal or Zip code, IP address, domain name, URL, browser and operating system and a record of the site pages you visited. This data helps us to understand traffic patterns at this site and may be used to tailor your experience at this site, such as showing you content including special events and advertising that you might be interested in and displaying the content according to your postal code. At times we will use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our web site. We also may track browser types to help us understand our visitors' needs related to our web site design.

Since non-personal information does not identify any particular individual, we may use such information for any purpose. In addition, we reserve the right to share such non-personal information with third parties, for any purpose.

In some instances, we may combine non-personal information with personally identifiable information (such as embedding email addresses in cookies). If we do combine any non-personal information with personally identifiable information, the combined information will be treated by us as personally identifiable information in accordance with this Policy.

#### Cookies and Similar Technologies

This site uses cookies, which are small bits of data that a web server transfers to an individual's computer for certain purposes, such as to report usage and demographic information, which may help us to know more about site users and their interests. Cookies are an industry standard used by most web sites to help facilitate users' ongoing access to and use of a particular web site, for example, by providing information used to deliver content specific to users' interests and for administrative purposes such as security, and which may track personally identifiable information, such as your name, postal address, telephone and mobile numbers and email address. If you want to remove cookies from your computer at any time, you can delete or automatically decline them using your browser. Please refer to your browser instructions or help screen to learn more about these functions. You should note, however, that declining cookies may make it difficult or impossible for you to use portions of the site.

The site may use so-called "pixel tags," "web beacons," "clear GIFs" or similar means (collectively, "Pixel Tags") to compile aggregate statistics about site usage and response rates. Pixel Tags allow us to count users who have visited certain pages of the site and to help determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns. When used in HTML-formatted email messages, Pixel Tags can tell the sender whether and when the email has been opened. We only use the information received from these Pixel Tags in the aggregate for statistical analysis.  

Some uses of Pixel Tags in connection with the site may be under the control of unaffiliated entities that Behr Process Corporation retains to manage certain programs and fulfill specific visitor requests. Behr Process Corporation cannot be responsible for third-party uses of Pixel Tags.

#### How We Share Personally Identifiable Information 

Behr Process Corporation may share personally identifiable information collected with Affiliated Entities or third parties as described below. You should also be aware that this means that personally identifiable information about you may be transferred to or received by Affiliated Entities or third-parties in the USA, or other countries which may be subject to different privacy regulations than those applicable in the country where you reside.

  * **Affiliated Entities.** We may share personally identifiable information with our parent, subsidiaries and affiliates worldwide (collectively, “Affiliated Entities”) to fulfill the purposes described above. You may access a list of certain Affiliated Entities at http://www.masco.com/our_companies/index.html.   


  * **Service Providers.** We may use third-party service providers to help us operate our business and this site or to administer activities on our behalf, such as sending emails, hosting dealer locater sites, providing order fulfillment, conducting advertising or customer service, and administering contests or incentive programs. We may share personally identifiable information with these third parties for those business purposes. For instance, if you request a brochure, we may share personally identifiable information about you with fulfillment and management agencies to complete your request.


  * **Dealers and Retailers.** We may share personally identifiable information with third parties that offer our products for sale. The third-party dealer or retailer may contact you directly by email, phone or postal mail. If you provide any personally identifiable information to such a third party through its web site or otherwise, your transaction will occur with the third party (and not on this site) and the personally identifiable information you provide will be collected by, and controlled by the privacy policy of, that third party. Behr Process Corporation recommends that you review the privacy policy of third parties who may contact you about Behr Process Corporation or Affiliated Entities' products or services.


  * **Other Disclosures.** Personally identifiable information of any individual user also may be shared with other companies outside Behr Process Corporation: (i) as permitted by law; (ii) in the event of a transfer of ownership, assets or a bankruptcy of Behr Process Corporation; (iii) where we determine that disclosure of specific information is necessary to comply with the request of a law enforcement or regulatory agency or other legal process, or (iv) to protect the interests or safety of Behr Process Corporation, the Affiliated Entities, site visitors, customers, business partners, employees or the public; (v) permit us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain (vi) enforce our Terms of Use; and (vii) respond to an emergency.


  * **Co-Branded Pages.** From time to time, we may enter into a special relationship with another company that is not owned by or affiliated with Behr Process Corporation to provide additional features on this site, such as co-branded sites (referred to here as "co-branded pages"). Any information including personally identifiable information that you provide on one of these co-branded pages may be shared with or accessible by these third-party partners. By submitting your information through these co-branded pages, you also consent to our sharing this information with those third-party partners. You should review the privacy policies posted on these co-branded pages to understand how information collected through these pages will be collected and used.


  * **Purchases.** We may use third-party payment services (each, a "Payment Service") to collect payments made through the site. If you wish to make a payment and through the site, you will be directed to a webpage that is hosted by the Payment Service (or the Payment Service's service providers) and not by us (such page, the "Payment Service Page"). Any personally identifiable information that you provide through the Payment Service Page will be collected by Payment Service and not by us, and will be subject to Payment Service's privacy policy, rather than this Policy. Behr Process Corporation has no control over, and shall not be responsible for, Payment Service's use of information collected through the Payment Service Page. PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS POLICY DOES NOT ADDRESS THE COLLECTION AND USE OF INFORMATION THROUGH THE PAYMENT SERVICE PAGE OR THE PRIVACY OR INFORMATION PRACTICES OF PAYMENT SERVICE.”



#### User Generated Content Functions

Certain pages on this site enable users to create their own profile page or submit their own content (for example, message boards, forums, chat functionality and blogs, among other services). Any information you disclose in such a profile page or submission may be publicly available and be read, collected, or otherwise used by anyone who visits the URL of the page on which you have chosen to comment, and you should exercise caution in deciding whether to disclose your personal, financial or other sensitive information there. Behr Process Corporation cannot prevent such publicly-available information from being used by others in a manner that may violate this Policy, the law, or your personal privacy and safety, and is not responsible for the results of any postings.

If you do not wish to receive marketing-related e-mails from us, or if you would prefer that we do not share personally identifiable information about you with third parties for such third parties’ marketing purposes, you may opt-out of receiving such marketing-related e-mails or from such sharing by logging into your workbook and clicking on Edit Your Profile (change your answer to “No” next to the question “May we send you BEHR news and special offers by email?”) or by sending an e-mail through the Contact Us section found on www.behr.com.

This will not opt you out of Behrpro.com or the BehrPro Connect online community. If you have registered on either of these sites, you must log on to them separately and follow the “opt-out” instructions for each of these sites.

We will endeavor to comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable. Please note that if you opt-out as described above, we will not be able to remove personally identifiable information about you from the databases of Affiliated Entities or other third parties with which we have already shared your personally identifiable information as of the date on which we implement your opt-out request. If you wish to cease receiving marketing-related e-mails from such third parties, please contact such third parties directly or utilize any opt-out mechanisms set forth in their respective privacy policies or marketing-related e-mails.

#### Sweepstakes, Contests, Etc. 

We may operate sweepstakes, contests, raffles and similar promotions through the site that may require online registration with us or with third party sponsors of such sweepstakes, contests, raffles, etc. You should carefully review the rules of each sweepstakes, contest, raffle and promotion in which you participate through the site, as they may contain additional important information about Behr Process Corporation’s or a sponsor's use or disclosure of your personally identifiable information. To the extent that the terms and conditions of such rules concerning the treatment of personally identifiable information conflict with this Policy, the terms and conditions of such rules shall control.

#### Links and Third Parties' Privacy Practices 

This site may contain links to other sites which are not operated by Behr Process Corporation.

Behr Process Corporation recommends that you review the privacy policy of third-party web sites arrived at from links on this site.

Behr Process Corporation takes measures to protect personally identifiable information collected through this site against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction. We also seek to require our Affiliated Entities and service providers to exercise reasonable efforts to maintain the confidentiality of any personally identifiable information about you that they receive from Behr Process Corporation. Unfortunately, however, no security system or system of transmitting data over the Internet can be guaranteed to be entirely secure.

For your own privacy protection, we encourage you not to include sensitive personal information in any emails you may send to us.
