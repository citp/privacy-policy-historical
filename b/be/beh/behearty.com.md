Your order with BeHearty.com is secure, which means that your personal information and credit card number are encrypted with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) security. The secured pages will show a secured URL ("https://") and a lock sign on your browser. When you enter your credit card number into the Order Form, it is transmitted across the Internet in an encrypted (scrambled) form, and then decoded when it gets to the server. Additionally, your credit card information is not transmitted via e-mail (which is not encrypted). Should you have any problem with your credit card charge, we will give you our prompt attention and work to resolve the issue. We want our customers and visitors to feel 100% safe and secure private when surfing our web site.
