www.Behindindia.com welcomes
you. We value your privacy,
and want you to know what information
we collect and what we do with
it.
<p>From time to time, we may
make changes to this Policy.
We will endeavor to post the
changes before they become
effective. The effective date
of the most recent version
of the privacy policy will
appear at the top of this
page. This consumer privacy
policy applies to any information
we collect or receive about
you, from any source.</p>
<p>Information Collected by
Behindindia.com</p>
<p>Behindindia.com have several
areas where members can submit
information to us, and we
also have features that automatically
collect information from our
members and other users.</p>
<p>Information Provided to Behindindia.com</p>
<p>Behindindia.com features
certain areas where we ask
you to provide information
to us.</p>
<p>Registration:</p>
<p>You may register with us
to use some of our member
only features on our site.
We may also offer the option
for you to register with us
or sign up for our mailing
list without having to use
any other product or service.
During registration, you provide
your "contact information"
(which identifies you and
how we can contact you, such
as your name and email address)
as well as certain demographic
information (which describes
certain information about
you, such as your country
of residence). You may be
asked to enter an e-mail address
and password. We may also
ask you to provide additional
information about your music
preferences, so that we can
cater to those preferences.</p>
<p>Communications from Us and
Mailing Lists:</p>
<p>In order to keep our members
informed about the operation
of our services, we will send
e-mails and announcements
that are needed for the proper
functioning and administration
of our site and subscription
service. For additional information
about our site, services and
offers, we give our members
the option of joining our
mailing list. We also allow
you to choose whether to receive
mails from partners and sponsors
that we think will be of interest
to you. Each marketing e-mail
from us will come with instructions
on how to unsubscribe from
our mailing list.</p>
<p>Communications with Us:</p>
<p>We have features where you
can submit information to
us (such as when contacting
us with a question or problem
related to the service). We
will retain your emails and
other information you submit
to us for our internal purposes,
and to help us to serve you
better.</p>
<p>Interactive Features:</p>
<p>We also may offer interactive
features, such as message
boards, chat rooms, etc. Note
that all personal information
you send or post via such
features becomes public information,
and we are not responsible
for any information you choose
to make public (including
any online identifier, such
as an email address, instant
messenger name or member name).
We may store such information
in an aggregate form but we
will not file or retain such
information on a personal
basis. We may monitor such
traffic via electronic software
or personnel but only to check
for obscenity, defamation
or other types of abusive
language, which we reserve
the right to remove at any
time.<br>
<br>
Surveys:</p>
<p>We may occasionally ask members
to participate in surveys.
Such surveys will be voluntary.
They are intended to improve
your member experience and
any information you provide
we may associate with your
member name for future use.
Any personal information collected
will be used only by us unless
we specify otherwise, although
we may share aggregate survey
result information with others.<br>
<br>
Automatic Data Collection:
<br>
<br>
Cookies:</p>
<p>We use a software technology
called "cookies"
for several purposes, depending
on the type of cookie employed.
Within Behindindia.com, we
use what are commonly called
"session" cookies,
meaning that they only last
as long as you are online.
We use these cookies to identify
you as a valid subscriber
so that we can deliver music
to you, to ensure that no
one else can sign on simultaneously
with your account from another
computer and to help us personalize
your service experience based
on your registration preferences
(such as genre). We may also
use session cookies to help
us facilitate any promotions
or surveys that we provide.
As part of the sign-in process,
we may also use what are commonly
called "persistent"
cookies which stay with you
after your session is over
and you are offline. We only
use these cookies in connection
with a sign-in feature that
allows you to save your member
name and password so that
the next time you sign in,
these fields will be pre populated
for you. This cookie is only
offered in conjunction with
certain Affiliate Sites that
choose to make it available
and it can only be activated
if you select that option
during your sign-in. If you
select this option you can
always deselect it each time
you sign-in. </p>
<p>Others:</p>
<p>In order to personalize our
service for your enjoyment
and to monitor and improve
the performance of our technology,
we do collect/capture other
data such as a member's searches
(such as their search criteria
and results). For our internal
purposes, we gather information
such as date, time, connection
speed and IP address of all
visitors to our site. We keep
this information simply for
our internal security audit
log, trend analysis, and system
administration. </p>
<p>Third Party Advertising &amp;
Third Party Cookies:</p>
<p>In the course of serving
advertisements to this site,
our third-party advertiser
may place or recognize a unique
"cookie" on your
browser.</p>
<p>With whom we share your information:
</p>
<p>We do not share your personally
identifiable information with
other companies, apart from
those acting as our agents
in providing our service to
you, all of which agree to
use it only for that purpose
and to keep the information
secure and confidential. Also,
entities into which our company
is merged, or to which our
assets, site or operations
have been transferred, will
be able to use your personal
information under the terms
of this privacy policy. We
will also disclose information
we maintain when required
to do so by law, for example,
in response to a court order
or a subpoena or other legal
obligation, in response to
a law enforcement agency's
request, or in special cases
when we have reason to believe
that disclosing this information
is necessary to identify,
contact or bring legal action
against someone who may be
causing injury to or interference
with (either intentionally
or unintentionally) our rights
or property. You should also
be aware that courts of equity,
such as U.S. Bankruptcy Courts,
may have the authority under
certain circumstances to permit
your information to be shared
or transferred to third parties
without your permission. We
may share (provide and receive)
with others certain aggregate
service information, which
is not personally identifiable.
This information may include
usage and demographic data,
but it will not include personal
information (such as your
email address). We may use
aggregate demographic information
about our audience in order
to improve our service, for
marketing purposes and/or
industry reporting purposes.</p>
<p>Links:</p>
<p>We may display links to other
sites within Behindindia.com.
We are not responsible for
those other sites, their privacy
policies or how they treat
information about their members.
We advise you to check their
privacy policies to find out
how they are treating your
personal information.</p>
<p>Downloads:</p>
<p>We do link to other web sites
which might support downloads.
We are not responsible for
the downloadable materials
that are present in these
websites. We are also not
responsible for the legalities
and privacy policy binding
the downloadable materials
of these websites. We are
also not responsible for the
legalities and privacy policy

the websites that our visitors
refer to in our forums and
discussions. Downloads referred

can be videos, images, software,
games and any application
