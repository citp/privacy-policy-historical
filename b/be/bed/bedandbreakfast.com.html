</span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;"><br>
<br>
We use information collected about you only as permitted in this Privacy Policy. This is our privacy policy, but please be aware that should you follow a link to another website, you are no longer covered by this policy. Unless otherwise defined herein, the words and phrases used in this policy have the same meaning as in the Terms and Conditions of Use - available at </span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;">
</span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;"><a href="http://www.bedandbreakfast.com/about/terms.aspx" class="ApplyClass">Terms &amp; Conditions</a>.<br>
<br>
By providing information to us when subscribing, sending inquiries or otherwise using this Site, you expressly agree to this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; This Privacy Policy was last updated on May 11, 2010. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;">
</span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;"><br>
<br>
<strong>Who processes your personal data?</strong></span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;">
</span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;"><br>
Your personal data (also referred to as personal information) - that is, data that identifies you, or from which you are identifiable - will be collected, processed, stored and used by us, and passed to and processed by our subsidiaries and/or affiliated companies and other data processors acting under contract with us. Personal data contributed by or collected from users may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which we or our affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities.&nbsp; By using our Site, you acknowledge and agree that you may be transferring your personal data outside of the country in which you have contributed it, and that you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country. These countries may not have similar data protection laws to those that apply in your country. However, if we transfer your personal data outside of your country in this way, we will take reasonable steps to protect your privacy rights in compliance with applicable data protection law and this Privacy Policy.<br>
<br>
<strong>The information we gather</strong></span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;">
</span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;"><br>
At various times you may contribute your personal data to us. For example, in order to process an inquiry concerning a property, we need to know all or some of the following: your full name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, and, in the case of a member's listing, a method of payment. You may also contribute personal data to us at other times, such as when registering on the Site. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>How we use your personal data</strong></span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;">
</span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;"><br>
Our primary purpose in collecting your personal data is to provide you with the services you requested and those which we believe will optimize your use of our Site.&nbsp; You agree that we may use for personal data for the following purposes:<br>
</span>
<ul>
    <li><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;">for the services or support you request;</span></li>
    <li><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;">to contact you from time to time with critical user or service updates or other information important for our services;</span></li>
    <li><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;">to customize, measure and improve our services, content and advertising;</span></li>
    <li><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;">to promote the services or special offers or promotions related to our Site and services or those of our subsidiaries and/or affiliates; </span></li>
    <li><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;">to compare information for accuracy, and verify it with third parties; </span></li>
    <li><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;">to prevent activity we determine to be potentially illegal; and</span></li>
    <li><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;">for the enforcement of this Privacy Policy and/or our Terms or any other purpose referenced herein or therein. </span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;"><br>
If you are a member, we will also be able to contact you about your account and your use of our services.<br>
<br>
In order for users to benefit from some of our services, we may require personal data.&nbsp; Examples of such services include:</span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;">
</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;"><br>
</span><blockquote><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Newsletters</span>: We and the websites of our affiliates may offer different newsletters from time to time intended to enhance the services we or they offer. Users may cancel their subscription to these newsletters at any time.<br>
</span>
</blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Surveys</span>: Surveys are another method by which we gather information about our users. From time to time, we request users' input in order to evaluate potential features and services. The decision to answer a survey is completely yours. We use information gathered from surveys to improve our services.<br>
</span>
</blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reservations &amp; Bookings</span>:&nbsp; Travelers may reserve and book rooms for a future stay in properties owned by our members.&nbsp; Reservations and bookings will require that you submit your personal information and may also require credit card or other payment information.<br>
</span>
</blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">E-Mailing Innkeepers</span>: Travelers may send e-mails to members via the listings on our Site. If you choose to send an inquiry through these links, your personal information, including your e-mail address and any other information you supply, will be visible to the member in question so that they might reply directly to you. If you call the member, you may be asked to leave a return telephone number. Do not share information in the e-mail or phone call that you are not prepared to allow them to have, including, but not limited to, credit card and bank account information. These inquiries are both sent to the individual member you selected and to our system. The resulting e-mail is available for review only by the member to whom they were initially addressed and to our customer service employees, who may be asked by members for their past e-mail information. While the content of these e-mails is not shared with any other party, we may, from time to time, use third party e-mail servers to send and track receipt of the e-mails, and analyze the pattern of inquiry usage reported by these third party tracking systems.<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reviews</span></span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;">
</span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;">: Travelers may leave reviews about properties of our members they stayed in and members may also respond to reviews.&nbsp; Travelers are urged not to put any personal data or information about themselves in any review and users may not put any personal data or information about anyone else in any review or response to a review.&nbsp; When submitting a review, travelers will be requested to provide a valid email address, information to confirm their stay in the property and other personal data may be requested as well. <br>
</span>
</blockquote><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;"><strong>Caution About Phishing or False E-mails</strong><br>
If you receive an unsolicited e-mail that appears to be from us or one of our members that requests personal information (such as your credit card, login, or password), or that asks you to verify or confirm your account or other personal information by clicking on a link, that e-mail was likely to have been sent by someone trying to unlawfully obtain your information, sometimes referred to as a "phisher" or "spoofer." We do not ask for this type of information in an e-mail. Do not provide the information or click on the link. Note that if you clicked on a link in such an e-mail, this would not compromise your account or information that you provided to the Site.&nbsp; However, the sender of such an email would be able to obtain your information if you provided it to them in the link or by a return e-mail.<br>
<br>

<strong>How Do We Protect Your Personal Information Once We Have It?</strong></span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;">
</span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;"><br>
We take appropriate technical and organizational measures to guard against unauthorized or unlawful processing of your personal data and against accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to, your personal data. While no system is completely secure, we believe the measures implemented by our site reduce the likelihood of security problems to a level appropriate to the type of data involved. We have security measures in place to protect our user database and access to this database is restricted internally. <br>
<br>
However, it remains each user's responsibility:</span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;">
</span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;"><br>

<ul>
    <li><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 13px;">to protect against unauthorized access to your use of the Site; </span></li>

Despite the measures taken by us that the third parties we contract with, third parties may nevertheless unlawfully intercept or access private transmissions or data.
