  E. U. SAFE HARBOR POLICY

Bedbug.com recognizes that privacy is very important to our customers, and we pledge to protect the security and privacy of any personal information that customers provide to us. This includes customer's names, addresses, telephone numbers, email addresses and any information that can be linked to an individual. Not only does Bedbug.com strive to collect, use and disclose personal information in a manner consistent with the laws of the countries in which it does business, but it also has a tradition of upholding the highest ethical standards in its business practices. This Safe Harbor Privacy Policy (the "Policy") sets forth the privacy principles that Bedbug.com follows with respect to transfers of personal information from the European Union (EU) to the United States. 

SAFE HARBOR 

The United States Department of Commerce and the European Commission have agreed on a set of data protection principles and frequently asked questions (the "Safe Harbor Principles") to enable U.S. companies to satisfy the EU law requirement that personal information transferred from the EU to the United States be adequately protected. Consistent with its pledge to protect personal privacy, Bedbug.com adheres to the Safe Harbor Principles. 

SCOPE 

This Safe Harbor Privacy Policy (the "Policy") applies to all personal information received by Bedbug.com in the United States from the EU, in any format including electronic, paper or verbal. 

DEFINITIONS

  The following definitions shall apply throughout this Policy: "Agent" means any third party that uses personal information provided to Bedbug.com to perform tasks on behalf of and under the instructions of Bedbug.com. "Bedbug.com" means Bedbug.com, its successors, subsidiaries, divisions and groups in the United States. "Personal information" means any information or set of information that identifies or could be used by or on behalf of Bedbug.com to identify an individual. Personal information does not include information that is encoded, anonymized, aggregated or publicly available information that has not been combined with non-public personal information. "Sensitive personal information" means personal information that reveals race, ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, or that concerns health or sex life. In addition, Bedbug.com will treat as sensitive personal information any information received from a third party where that third party treats and identifies the information as sensitive. 

PRIVACY PRINCIPLES

  The privacy principles in this Policy are based on the Safe Harbor Principles. 

NOTICE

  When Bedbug.com collects personal information directly from individuals in the EU, it will inform them about the purposes for which it collects and uses their personal information, the types of non-agent third parties, if any, to which Bedbug.com discloses that information, and the choices and means, if any, that Bedbug.com offers individuals for limiting the use and disclosure of their personal information. Notice will be provided in clear and conspicuous language when individuals are first asked to provide personal information to Bedbug.com, or as soon as practicable thereafter, and in any event before Bedbug.com uses the information for a purpose other than that for which it was originally collected. If Bedbug.com receives personal information from its subsidiaries, affiliates or other entities in the EU, it will use such information in accordance with the notices such entities provided and the choices made by the individuals to whom such personal information relates.

  Bedbug.com will offer individuals the opportunity to choose (opt-out) whether their personal information is (a) to be disclosed to a non-agent third party, or (b) to be used for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. For sensitive personal information, Bedbug.com will give individuals the opportunity to affirmatively and explicitly (opt-in) consent to the disclosure of the information to a non-agent third party or the use of the information for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. Bedbug.com will provide individuals with reasonable methods to exercise their choices. 

DATA INTEGRITY

TRANSFERS TO AGENTS
