At Bed Bath & Beyond we are committed to protecting the privacy of our customers, which is why we do not sell, rent, or loan any personal identifiable information regarding our customers to any third party. We hope the policy below will answer all of your questions regarding how we treat information gathered from visitors to bedbathandbeyond.com. Feel free to e-mail us at [customer.service@bedbath.com](mailto:customer.service@bedbath.com) with any questions you might have.   
  
**What Information We Collect** In order to process your order efficiently, we collect the following information: name, billing address, shipping address, e-mail address, phone number, and credit card number ("Personal Information") when you place an order with us. This information is used solely by Bed Bath & Beyond and is stored in a secure environment. Under certain circumstances we do also collect the user's IP address, but only when we suspect that credit card fraud may have occurred. We also periodically conduct surveys of visitors to our Web site. This helps us better understand what our customers would like to see from us. We use this information for internal marketing research purposes. We may contact a visitor who responded to a survey for more information, but only if that visitor has told us that they don't mind being contacted.   
  
**Use of Information that You Provide** At Bed Bath & Beyond we collect Personal Information only for the purposes of fulfilling orders, providing a high level of customer service, gaining knowledge internally regarding what our customers want and mailing circulars and special offers from Bed Bath & Beyond. We do not give or sell Personal Information to any other party, except to those of our employees and agents who we rely on to handle this information on our behalf in accordance with the above purposes. If at any time you do not want to receive offers and/or circulars from us, you can always remove yourself from our mailing list by sending an e-mail to [customer.service@bedbath.com](mailto:customer.service@bedbath.com), indicating "NO SNAIL MAIL" in the subject line along with your name, address and zip code.   
  
**Opt-out E-mail policy** We ask that you tell us when you do not wish to receive periodic e-mails from us. We will only send e-mail for customer service purposes and to those visitors who have indicated that they wish to receive other types of e-mail from us. If at any time you wish to stop receiving e-mail from us at any time, you can always remove your name from our mailing list by sending an e-mail to [customer.service@bedbath.com](mailto:customer.service@bedbath.com) stating that you wish to unsubscribe and indicating in the subject line of the e-mail "NO E-MAIL".   
  
**Security of the Information You Provide** Among our top priorities is keeping your Personal Information secure. We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology, which provides the highest level of security currently available for secure transactions, to encrypt all of your Personal Information before it is transmitted to us. Encrypted information cannot be read or recorded as it travels over the Internet. You can tell you are sending information securely by the unbroken key icon or closed lock icon that should appear at the bottom of your internet browser's window (depending on what browser you use). These icons will appear when you are placing an order on our Web site. In addition, you will see our site address change slightly, from http: to https: indicating a secure server connection is being used. 

Additionally, access to your Personal Information is provided only to our employees and agents who have a need to know such information for the purpose of fulfilling your order and offering our high level of customer service. The computers that store your Personal Information are located in a separate facility which employs the latest in firewall and security technology. 

If you prefer not to disclose your credit card information online, you can always place your order by calling 1-800-GO BEYOND® (1-800-462-3966) or visiting one of our many stores. Click [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20030621174636id_/http://www.bedbathandbeyond.com/store_loc.asp?order_num=-1&) to locate the store nearest you and to receive driving directions. 

  
**Use of Cookies** We use cookies to provide our customers with streamlined ordering and other useful features. Cookies are pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Cookies make Web surfing easier for you by saving your customer identification information while you're at our site. The use of cookies has become an industry standard used by most major Web sites. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent that. Please continue to review our privacy policy from time to time so that you are aware of our current policy with respect to cookies.   
  
**Bridal Registry Information** Please be aware that bridal registry information is treated in a slightly different manner than as outlined above. The main difference between bridal registry users and other users of our Web site is that in the case of bridal registry users, certain information collected is shared with advertisers, but only on an aggregate basis which does not identify any Personal Information which could be linked to you. Additionally, bridal registry users may receive additional e-mail communications from us, such as a registry welcome e-mail, optional bi-weekly and fortnightly e-mails to guests, monthly newsletters to registrants, purchase confirmation e-mail when ordering, and follow-up contact to registrants, 30 days after the wedding. IP addresses (i.e., the Internet number associated with your specific computer) are used to help diagnose problems with our wedding registry computer, to administer our wedding registry portion of our Web site, and to help identify you to your shopping basket. Finally, cookies are used as part of our wedding registry service to save your registry number and password on your computer so that you won't have to enter this information every time you return to your registry.   
  
**Your Acceptance of these Terms** By using our Web site, you agree to accept the Bed Bath & Beyond privacy policy. Make sure you read this policy carefully, because if you do choose to use our Web site, you automatically agree to this policy. If you do not agree to this policy, please do not use our Web site. We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions of this policy at any time. Please check this page periodically for changes. Your continued use of our Web site following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes. © 1999-2003 Bed Bath & Beyond and its subsidiaries. All rights reserved.
