This could include the inability to login to services or programs, such as logging into forums or accounts.

We may also use web beacons on the Site, in our emails and in our advertisements on other websites. Web beacons are tiny graphic images that are used to collect information about your Site visit, such as the pages you view and the features you use, as well as information about whether you open and/or act upon one of our emails or advertisements.

Third-party advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on our site, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP address, your ISP , the browser you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed. This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing Chicago-related ads to someone in Chicago, for example).

We show ads from third-party vendors which may include those listed on the following page [What vendors are certified for third-party ads? (Google)](https://www.google.com/adsense/support/bin/answer.py?answer=94149). You may visit those vendor websites to opt out of cookies (if the vendor offers this capability).

Ads you see on this and other websites may be based in part on your previous actions on visits over time and on various websites. This is known as “interest-based” or “online behavioral” advertising, and you may [visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s website to opt out of interest-based advertising](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/?partnerId=1//#completed "Opt out of interest based advertising").
