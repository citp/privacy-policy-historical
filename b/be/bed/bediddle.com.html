Bediddle does not require you to share information that identifies you personally, such as your name or email address, in order for you to use the Bediddle search. Bediddle assigns an anonymous ID number to your requests and links the following additional data to that number: the date and time you visited Bediddle, your search terms, and the links upon which you choose to click. Like most standard Web site servers, we use log files to collect and store this anonymous user information. We analyze this information to examine trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. Bediddle may present links in a format that enables us to understand whether they have been followed. We use this information to understand and improve the quality of the Bediddle search. </p>
