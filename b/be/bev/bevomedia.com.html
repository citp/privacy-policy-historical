				<h3>INFORMATION COLLECTION PRACTICES</h3>
				
				 <p>
				 
						<b>Traffic Data.  </b>

							Like most website operators, BevoMedia automatically gathers information 
							of the sort that browsers automatically make available, including: (i) 
							IP addresses; (ii) domain servers; (iii) types of computers accessing 
							the Website; and (iv) types of Web browsers accessing the Website (collectively 
							'<b>Traffic Data</b>'). Traffic Data is anonymous information that 
							does not personally identify You.
				 
				 </p>

				 <p>
				 
						<b>Cookies.  </b>
						A '<b>Cookie</b>' is a string of information that a website stores 
						on a user's computer, and that the user's browser provides to the 
						website each time the user submits a query to the website.  The 
						purpose of a Cookie is to identify the user as a unique user of the 
						Website.  BevoMedia uses Cookies to customize Your experience on 
						the Website to Your interests, to ensure that You do not see the same 
						advertisements or informational messages repeatedly, and to store Your 
						password so You do not have to re-enter it each time You visit the Website.  
						For additional information on BevoMedia' uses of Cookies, see the 
						section concerning Information Use and Disclosure Practices/Traffic 
						Data and Information Gathered Using Cookies, below.
				 
				 </p>
				 
				 <p>IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO HAVE COOKIES PLACED ON YOUR COMPUTER, YOU SHOULD SET YOUR BROWSERS TO REFUSE COOKIES BEFORE ACCESSING THE WEBSITE, WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT CERTAIN OF THE SERVICES AND CERTAIN FEATURES OF THE WEBSITE MAY NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY WITHOUT THE AID OF COOKIES.  IF YOU REFUSE COOKIES, YOU ASSUME ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY RESULTING LOSS OF FUNCTIONALITY. </p>
				 
				 <p>
				 
					 <b>Personal 
						Information.  </b>In order for You to use certain of the Services, 
						You may be asked to provide BevoMedia certain information that personally 
						identifies You ('<b>Personal Information</b>'). Personal Information 
						includes, without limitation: (1) '<b>Contact Data</b>' (such as 
						Your name, company name, email address, mailing address, phone number 
						and instant messenger handle); (2) '<b>Login Information</b>' (such 
						as Your user name and password of Your affiliate/marketing accounts 
						that you wish to view using the Website and Services);  and (3) 
						'<b>Demographic Data</b>' (such as Your instant messenger service, 
						primary website, marketing method, zip code and country). In each case, 
						You will be asked to provide Personal Information; the Website will 
						not gather it surreptitiously. BevoMedia may supplement the Personal 
						Information You provide with additional Personal Information gathered 
						from public sources or from third-parties (e.g., consumer reporting 
						agencies) who may lawfully provide such information to BevoMedia.
				 
				 </p>
				 
				 <p>
						You are under no obligation to provide Personal Information, with the caveat that Your refusal to do so may prevent You from using certain of the Services.
