# Privacy Policy | www.beuc.eu

BEUC strongly believes that you have the right to control the use of your personal information and that your privacy must be respected. We strictly limit the processing of your personal information to the specific purposes described in our privacy policy. We have chosen to use the services of only those companies that respect your fundamental rights to privacy and protection of your personal data.

We have developed this privacy policy to explain what information we collect about you when you get in contact with us or use our website.

## Data you provide to us

### Your information

If you want to stay updated about our work or receive our publications by regular mailings we will only ask you to provide us with the information necessary for this purpose: your name and email address. You can choose whether to indicate the organisation you work for. You can choose to receive different categories of BEUC materials, such as press material, position papers, brochures, the Annual Report, factsheets, reports and our Presidency Memorandum.

### Sharing your information

We do not rent or sell your information. Your email address is used to only send you information that you have requested. We will not send you unsolicited email, commercial offers or advertisements. All emails you request will have an option to unsubscribe.

### Updating or removing your information

You may choose to correct, update, or delete the information you have submitted to us by sending an email to [consumers@beuc.eu](mailto:consumers@beuc.eu) or [ [communications@beuc.eu](mailto:communications@beuc.eu)](mailto:communications@beuc.org)

requesting changes to your subscription. You can also get a copy of your data without cost. You can remove your subscription at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link at the bottom of mailings. You can choose to unsubscribe from receiving one or all of our material. We will ensure your information is deleted and no longer used for any purpose.  

### Cookies

BEUC uses cookies on its website [www.beuc.eu](http://www.beuc.eu/). Cookies are text files containing a small amount of data which is sent to your computer when you visit our website. Cookies involve the collection and storage of personal information.

Our intention is to allow only those cookies which are strictly necessary or that improve the functionality of our website.

We also use the services of third parties to analyse the use of our website and to monitor when, where and how people access information so that we can adapt the site to better suit our users' needs. For this service we selected the company PIWIK because it monitors and analyses the traffic we receive on our website in a way which fully respects your privacy. For example, it uses AnonymizeIP, which removes the last octet of the IP addresses, so we will never know your full IP address.

You can find more information on the cookies we use, and how to delete them in this [link] section.

### Updates & contact

#### Changes to our Policy

It might happen that we have to change our Privacy Policy, for instance to comply with new legal requirements. However, if we make any changes to our policy, we will make this information publicly available on our website; the date and nature of the change will also be clearly indicated in our privacy policy.

#### How to contact us

If you have any questions, complaints or queries with regards to how we use your information, we encourage you to contact us and we will do our best to resolve it. You can send your questions, complaints or queries to [communications@beuc.eu](mailto:communications@beuc.eu) or [consumers@beuc.eu](mailto:consumers@beuc.eu). You can also contact the [Belgian Privacy Commission](http://www.privacycommission.be/).
