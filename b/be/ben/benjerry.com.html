		<p>As used in this Privacy Policy, “Personal Information” means personally identifiable information such as your name, street address, telephone number, credit card information, screen name and email address.</p>

		<p>When you provide us with Personal Information, you are authorizing us to use that information in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy, which includes your right to limit our use of your Personal Information (see <a href="#who">Who to Contact</a>).</p>

		<p>We may also collect Personal Information from you about a third party (e.g., our website might allow you to send an electronic “post card” to a friend, in which case we will need that person’s name and e-mail address). Please note that we use such information only for the specified purpose (e.g., to mail the post card) and we will not contact the third party again unless and until the third party contacts us.</p>

		<p>When you supply us with your Personal Information we will use it for the express purpose for which it was collected (e.g., to enter you in a sweepstakes or to send you a sample). It may also be used to contact you regarding other products and services that may be of interest to you (including those we may offer jointly with other companies). At any time, however, you may opt out of such contact. (See <a href="#who">Who to Contact.</a>)</p>

		<p>At times we may retain third parties to analyze data we collect, including Personal Information, solely to help us improve our products and our web site. In addition, if you order a product or service from us, we may provide Personal Information to suppliers and other third parties to enable delivery of such product or service. These third parties, including suppliers, are not authorized by us to use your Personal Information in any other way. Ben &amp; Jerry’s does not sell Personal Information.</p>

		<p>We may supplement the information that you provide to us with other information that we receive from third parties.  We do this for marketing purposes in order to provide the most appropriate products and services to meet your needs.</p>

		<p>Finally, please note that we will release your Personal Information if required to do so by law, or by search warrant, subpoena or court order.</p>
