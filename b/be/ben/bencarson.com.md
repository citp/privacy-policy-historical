# Privacy Policy | Official Ben Carson for President 2016

**Last Revised June 26, 2015**

Welcome to the website of Carson America, Inc. (“Carson America”), official website for the 2016 Presidential Campaign of Dr. Ben Carson. Carson America knows your right to privacy is important, especially online. This Privacy Policy has been created to answer questions you may have regarding Carson America’s data collection and protection policies. This Privacy Policy applies to information we collect when you use our websites, mobile sites, mobile applications and other online services that link to this Privacy Policy.

**What information is being collected at[www.bencarson.com](https://www.bencarson.com/?__hstc=34878590.11cb516680095f40b4a49655a0398d75.1435149860043.1435610059949.1435621070538.12&__hssc=34878590.11.1435621070538&__hsfp=1863559887)?**

The only personal information collected is information you give us. You do not have to provide this information in order to navigate the website. We only ask that provide the information so that we can better communicate with you. In an effort to grow our grassroots community online, Carson America may ask you to submit information.

By law, some information must be collected when you make a contribution. When you make contributions to Carson America that aggregate to more than $200, federal law requires us to use our “best efforts” to collect your name, mailing address, employer, and occupation. Credit card information provided may be stored at the donor’s option. In the event a donor exercises that option, all credit card information will be stored with Carson America’s secure, third-party vendor, certified to PCI Service Provider Level 1, the most stringent level of certification. Any information shared is done at the donor’s own risk.

We ask that anyone under 18 years of age not submit their information. In addition, in accordance with the Federal Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), Carson America does not knowingly collect personal identifiable information from persons 13 years of age or younger.

Our servers also collect certain server log information about your use of the website. This may include the type of browser you use, access times, pages viewed, your IP address, and the page you visited before navigating to our website.
