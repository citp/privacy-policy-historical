**Privacy and Terms of Use Statement**

| 

Thank you for visiting this site and reviewing our privacy and terms of use statement. We are strongly committed to maintaining the privacy of your personal information and the security of our computer systems. With respect to the collection, use and disclosure of personal information, we make every effort to ensure compliance with applicable Federal law, including, but not limited to, the Privacy Act of 1974, the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, and the Freedom of Information Act.

We do not collect or store personal, identifying information about you when you visit our site. The information we receive depends upon what you do when visiting our site.

**If you visit our site to read or download information, we collect and store the following information:**

  * The name of the domain from which you access the Internet (for example, aol.com if you are connecting from a personal computer account).
  * The date and time you access our site.
  * The Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to our site.
  * Commonly researched benefits, keywords searched and questionnaire responses.



The above information is used by software programs on our website to create summary statistics. We can then determine the number of visitors to the different sections of our site. We can also identify what information is of most and least interest, helping us make our site more useful to visitors.

**If you identify yourself by sending an e-mail containing personal information:**

You also may decide to send us personally-identifying information, for example your mailing address, in an electronic mail message requesting that information be mailed to you. Information collected in this manner is used solely for responding to requests for information or records. We may forward your e-mail to other Government employees who are better able to respond to you; however, GovBenefits will not share any of your personal information with any other organization or individual. Should you wish to file a request under FOIA, instructions are provided at: [http://www.dol.gov/dol/foia/main.htm](https://web.archive.org/ExternalLinkPageFlow/ExternalLinkPageFlowController.jpf?url=http://www.dol.gov/dol/foia/main.htm "Link to file a request under the Freedom of Information Act at DOL").

Finally, the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended (5 U.S.C. 552a), requires us to notify you that the Privacy Act protects the information you are providing to us. The Privacy Act also requires we notify you that, in rare instances, we may have to disclose this registration information to the Department of Justice or a court in connection with Federal litigation.

**If you link to other sites:**

Our website has many links to other sites. When you link to any of these sites, you are no longer on our site and are subject to the privacy policy of the new site.

**Cookie Use Notice**

On a limited number of our Web pages, we employ "cookies" to provide better service to our customers. We do not use cookies to collect any personal, identifying information from users or to track user activities beyond our website. We do not maintain copies of cookies on our website after you leave our website.

Cookies are small pieces of temporary data that are exchanged between a website and a user's computer which enable a "session", or "dialog", to be established between the two machines. With the session established, we are able to tailor responses (i.e., identify and provide you with the information you want) and help you traverse our web pages in the most efficient and effective manner possible. The session ends when we do not receive further requests from your computer or you simply exit your browser.

We limit our use of cookies to "session cookies"... types of cookies that are temporarily stored in your computer's memory. Session cookies are normally deleted from your computer when you log off the computer or you exit the browser.

For security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available to all users, our website also employs software programs to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage. Unauthorized attempts to upload information or change information on this service are strictly prohibited and may be punishable under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act of 1996.
