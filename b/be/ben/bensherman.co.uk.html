<ul class="numbered">
<li>

<p>We may collect and process the following data about you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Information that you provide by filling in forms on our site.

<li>If you contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence;</li>
<li>We may also ask you to complete surveys that we use for research purposes, although you do not have to respond to them;</li>
<li>Details of transactions you carry out through our site and of the fulfilment of your orders;</li>
<li>Details of your visits to our site including, but not limited to, traffic data, location data, weblogs and other communication data, whether this is required for our own billing purposes or otherwise and the resources that you access;</li>
<li>Information about your computer, including where available your IP address, operating system and browser type, for system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers.

<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>We may obtain information about your general internet usage by using a cookie file which is stored on your browser or the hard drive of your computer. Cookies contain information that is transferred to your computer's hard drive. They help us to improve our site and to deliver a better and more personalised service. Some of the cookies we use are essential for the site to operate and, in particular, to allow you to shop from our site. Please see our&nbsp;Cookies Policy&nbsp;for further details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Where we store your personal data</h3>
<p>The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff maybe engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.</p>
<p>Our email campaigns are provided through Mailchimp, a service operated by Rocket Science Group LLC based in the United States. Email addresses and other profile information provided by you may be disclosed to Rocket Science Group LLC for the sole purpose of operating email campaigns on our behalf. Rocket Science Group LLC complies with the EU Safe Harbor framework as specified by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union. Details of their registration can be found here:&nbsp;<a href="http://safeharbor.export.gov/companyinfo.aspx?id=10039">http://safeharbor.export.gov/companyinfo.aspx?id=10039</a>.</p>
<p>All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. Any payment transactions will be encrypted using SSL technology. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.</p>
