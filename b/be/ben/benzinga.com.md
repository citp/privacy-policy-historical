We also receive your IP address and the name of your internet service provider (“ISP”) or your mobile carrier.

Depending on your device’s settings, we may also receive location data and other types of information sent from third-party services or GPS-enabled devices. As you use the Site, we may also collect information about such usage and your actions on the Site, such as pages you viewed, access times, and how long you spent on a page.

This information is considered Non-Personal Information, which we can use for any purpose, including, without limitation, to help us improve the Site and to enhance your and other users’ experience.

We may also convert PII into Non-Personal Information by excluding information that is personally identifiable. You acknowledge that Non-Personal Information and PII that is converted into Non-Personal Information belongs to Benzinga and that Benzinga has the right to use such general information as it determines in its sole discretion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we will treat as PII any item that, either alone or together with other information, we could use to identify an individual.

Except as described below in this section and in the “When We May Disclose Your Information” section below, we will not share with third-parties the link between your IP address and your PII without your permission. By providing your PII to us, you explicitly agree to our collection and use of such information as described in this Privacy Policy. By providing PII belonging to another person, you expressly represent and warrant that you have the authority and right to do so, and that you obtained all appropriate and required consents.

We will only use PII for the purpose of fulfilling our duties and providing the Service and for improving services. Benzinga may use PII for the following purposes: To improve customer service: Your information helps us to more effectively respond to your customer service requests and support needs.
