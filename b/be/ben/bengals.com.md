Types of information that may be collected 

The following are the types of information we may collect: 

Information You Provide Us: In the course of using the Web site, we may ask you to provide us with certain information, including contact information, such as your name, mailing address, email address, or phone number, unique identifiers, such as your user ID or user password, demographic information, such as your date of birth, ticket holder status, or game attendance, or similar information. 

Site Usage Information: We may receive and store certain types of internet usage information whenever you visit the Web site, such as click-stream data and your IP address. 

How information may be collected 

We may collect information from you in several different areas on the Web site, including but not limited to those described below: 

Registration: You may be asked to complete a registration form and provide personally identifiable information; you may also be asked to choose a user ID and password in order to take advantage of certain features the Web site may choose to offer, such as newsletters or contests. Participation in registration is voluntary and you will have the opportunity to decide whether or not to disclose information to the Web site. 

Newsletters and Web site Emails: We offer free newsletters to share information with you about the Web site, about us and our affiliates and subsidiaries, or about our marketing partners and advertisers and sponsors. You may receive a newsletter either by registering for a particular newsletter or in conjunction with a special feature or membership for which you have registered on the Web site. Participation is voluntary and you will have the opportunity to decide whether or not to disclose information to the Web site. You may also cancel your free email subscription by following the instructions provided on the Website or in the newsletter or email. In the event that the "unsubscribe" function is inoperable for any reason, you may send an email to [webmaster@bengals.nfl.net](mailto:webmaster@bengals.nfl.net) stating your intentions to unsubscribe from any future correspondence from the Cincinnati Bengals. 

Contests or Sweepstakes: We periodically operate contests and sweepstakes through the Web site that may require registration or the submission of personal information. Participation is voluntary and you will have the opportunity to decide whether or not to disclose information to the Website. Your personally identifiable information may be used to contact you for winner notification, prize delivery confirmation or other related purposes, (see the rules of each contest for details about how your personal information will be used). We may also ask your permission to allow us to publicly post some of your information on the Web site, such as on a winner's page, in the event you win a contest or sweepstakes. Except as required by applicable law, we will not post your information without your permission. All contests are managed internally by the Cincinnati Bengals and none of the data collected is shared with third-party sponsors. 

Cookies: As with many Web sites, our Web site uses a technology called "cookies." A cookie is a unique, random number that is stored in the browser on your computer. The cookie doesn't actually identify you, just the computer that is used to visit the site. Cookies automatically identify your browser to the Web site whenever your computer is used to visit the Web site. Cookies also let us know how many people visit our website and where visitors go on the site. In addition, cookies can let us know non-personally identifiable information, like what web browser is being used to access the Web site. For registered users, cookies can make using the Web site easier for you by saving information such as your passwords or preferences. By tracking how and when you use the Web site, cookies help us determine which areas are popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates to the Web site are based on data obtained from cookies. Accepting cookies allows you, among other things, to personalize your experience on the Web site. Cookies may also allow the Web site to present to you advertising which may be of interest to you. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, your browser should contain an option that allows you to disable or delete cookie data at any time. Some areas of the Website, however, may not provide you with a personalized experience if you have disabled the use of cookies. Cookies are used solely for purposes as outlined above, and are not combined with personally-identifiable information such as your name and email address. 

IP Addresses and Click-Stream Data: We may collect IP addresses and/or click-stream data. An IP address is a number associated with the service through which you access the Internet, like your ISP (Internet service provider), your company, or your university. Standing alone, your IP address is not personally identifiable. Click-stream data is information collected by our computers when you request Web pages from the Website. Click-stream data may include such information as the page served, the time, the source of the request, the type of browser making the request, the preceding page view and other such non-personal information. When analyzed, this data helps us analyze how visitors arrive at the Web site, what type of content is most popular, what type of visitors in the aggregate are interested in particular kinds of content and advertising, and the like. 

Transaction Information: If you conduct a financial transaction with our Website, such as ordering merchandise from our Website, we will ask you to complete an order form that will request certain information from you, including contact information, demographic information and financial information. We will use this information to complete the transaction that you have requested, i.e., to deliver the information, products or other services that you order, and to invoice you. For your protection, such information is collected and stored through encrypted means. 

How we use the information collected 

As applicable, the information you provide to us may be used to:

contact you about the Web site;

contact you relating to your membership status;

confirm or fulfill an order you have made; 

inform you of a prize you have won;

monitor or improve the use of the Web site;

customize the advertising and content you see; 

monitor compliance with our terms and conditions of use of the Web site; and

send you promotional material or special offers on behalf of our marketing partners and/or their respective affiliates and subsidiaries and other third parties via our email newsletter. 

With whom the information may be shared 

At times, we may share your personal information with others for various purposes. The following outlines the ways in which your information may be shared with others and the ways in which you may opt-out of having your information shared: 

Agents: We employ other businesses, certain services and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, sending e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, Website analysis, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. They may have access to personally identifiable information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for their own purposes, like sending you marketing offers about their products. Third-party providers are used to host our email newsletter and Bengals Pro Shop Web site. When signing up for our e-newsletter or ordering merchandise from the Bengals Pro Shop, you are entering personally-identifiable information to a third-party service provider. The Cincinnati Bengals has ownership of the data submitted during e-newsletter registration and this data is not shared with the third-party provider. The fulfillment of all orders at the Bengals Pro Shop is managed in-house and information is not shared with the third-party host of the Bengals Pro Shop Web site. 

Aggregate Information: We may share aggregate information, such as demographics and Web site usage statistics, with advertisers, sponsors or other organizations. When this type of information is shared, the other parties do not have access to your personally identifiable information. 

Other Promotional Offers: We may send offers to you on behalf of our marketing partners. When we do this, we do not give that partner your name and address. If you do not want to receive such offers, you may use the opt out method detailed in the email or change your preferences by logging into your account. 

Business Transfers: In the event that all or substantially all of our assets are sold or transferred to another party, or another transaction occurs in which your personally identifiable information is one of the business assets transferred, all personally identifiable information that has been collected and saved may be one of the business assets we transfer. See "YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THE PRIVACY POLICY AND NOTIFICATION OF CHANGES TO THE POLICY" below. 

Administrative or Legal Process: Your personal information may be transferred to third parties without notice to you in order to comply with applicable law, law enforcement agencies, to protect our rights, or protect the rights of other users of this Web site. 

Chat rooms, forums, and message boards 

The Web site makes message boards available to its users. You are not required to provide any personal information when using these areas but you may choose to do so. If you post personal information online, it will be publicly available and you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties. We cannot ensure the security of any information you choose to make public in a chat room, forum, or message board. Also, we cannot ensure that parties who have access to such publicly available information will respect your privacy. Please exercise caution when deciding to disclose personal information in these areas. Message boards are run in-house by the Bengals and no information is collected by any third party. 

Tell-a-friend

If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. Cincinnati Bengals stores [or does not store] this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email [and tracking the success of our referral program]. 

Your friend may contact us at [webmaster@bengals.nfl.net](mailto:webmaster@bengals.nfl.net) to request that we remove this information from our database. 

Links To Other Web Sites 

You should be aware that when you are on the Web site you could be directed to other Web sites beyond our control. For example, if you "click" on a banner advertisement, the "click" may take you off the Web site onto a different Web site. This includes links from advertisers, sponsors and marketing partners that may use the Web site's logo as part of a co-branding agreement. These other Web sites may send their own cookies to you, independently collect data or solicit personal information and may or may not have their own published privacy policies. If you visit a Web site that is linked to our Web site, you should consult that Web site's privacy policy before providing any personal information. 

SECURITY 

This Web site incorporates reasonable safeguards to protect the security, integrity, completeness, accuracy and privacy of the personal information that we may collect and we have put into place reasonable precautions to protect such information from loss, misuse and alteration. Your personally identifiable information is transferred to our computers utilizing encryption software. Only those employees who need access to your information in order to do their jobs are allowed access. Our security policies are reviewed periodically and revised as required. 

A special note for parents concerning privacy 

The Web site is a general audience Web site. We do not currently collect any personal information from children under the age of thirteen on the Web site. If in the future, we collect personally identifiable information from children, it will do so in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (15 U.S.C. 6501 et seq.) including, without limitation, obtaining necessary parental consent. For more information about the privacy practices for our affiliated children's Web site (<http://www.nflyouthfootball.com/>), please consult the privacy policy at the children's Web site.

As explained in this privacy policy, whenever you agree to let us collect personal information about you, we will always provide you with an option to prevent this information from being shared for non-administrative purposes with third parties.
