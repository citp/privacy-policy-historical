# Privacy Policy - Benjamin Franklin Plumbing MN

<http://www.benjaminfranklinplumbingmn.com/> uses all features of Google Analytics for Display Advertisers. That includes obtaining specific visitor cookie data, such as the source, medium and keyword used to visit our website. Google Analytics does not store any visitor specific data and we will not use visitor specific data in any way related to Google Analytics, Google Adwords, and Remarketing.

<http://www.benjaminfranklinplumbingmn.com/> uses remarketing with Google Adwords and analytics to display content specific advertisements to visitors that have previously visited our site when those visitors go to other websites that have the Google Display Network implemented.

<http://www.benjaminfranklinplumbingmn.com/> and other third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on visitor’s past visits to our website.

We take our users’ privacy very seriously. We feel that certain personal information should always be kept private, so we’ve developed restrictions around the types of ads where we don’t allow remarketing. When creating remarketing lists, we can’t use any sensitive information about users. This includes information such as their financial status, sexual orientation, and other sensitive categories.

As adwords advertisers, we are restricted from and will not perform the following actions:

  1. Running ads that collect Personally Identifiable Information (PII) including, but not limited to, email addresses, telephone numbers, and credit card numbers.
  2. Creating a remarketing list or creating ad text that specifically targets users in ways that are outlined as â€œprohibitedâ€ in the categories below



Visitors can opt out of Google Analytics for Display Advertisers and opt out of customized Google Display Network ads by visiting the [Ads Preferences Manager](https://www.google.com/settings/ads). Visitors can also opt out of a third-party vendor’s use of cookies by visiting the [Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp).
