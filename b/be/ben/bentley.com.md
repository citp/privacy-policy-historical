## Reasons we Share the Information we Collect

We do not sell or otherwise disclose information we collect to others except as described in this Privacy Statement. Bentley may share your information we collect with our controlled subsidiaries and affiliates. 

In some cases Bentley may share information we collect with vendors or agents working on our behalf for any purposes described in in this Privacy Statement. For example, we may share information for purposes of data processing or storage, delivering customer support, processing credit card payments, and sending emails on our behalf. In such cases, these companies will be permitted to obtain only the information they need to deliver the respective services and are not allowed to use your information for any other purpose, except where required by law. Such vendors and agents must abide by our data privacy and security requirements and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information, except where required by law to disclose your information. Bentley may also share information with carefully selected strategic partners who provide services and sponsor events that may be of interest to you. These companies are obligated to protect your information and use it in accordance with their own privacy policies and practices.

Some Bentley webpages allow you to choose to share your information with select Bentley partners so that they can contact you about their products, services, or offers. Other sites do not share your contact information with third parties for marketing purposes, but instead may give you a choice as to whether you wish to receive communications from Bentley on behalf of external business partners about a partner’s particular offering (without transferring your information to the third party).

Some Bentley services may be co-branded and offered in conjunction with another company. If you register for or use such services, both Bentley and the other company may receive information collected in connection with the co-branded services. The other company's use of your information is subject to such other company's own privacy policies and practices, and Bentley is not responsible for the privacy practices of, or use of your information by, such other companies.

We may access and/or disclose information we collect if we believe such action is necessary to: (a) comply with the law or legal process served on Bentley; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Bentley (including the enforcement of our agreements) or third parties; or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of Bentley services or members of the public. If we merge with another company or reorganize some part or all of our business, assets, or stock (including if we file for bankruptcy or similar proceeding), we may share information we collect from and about you in connection with the merger or reorganization. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur and that any acquirer may continue to use information we collect from and about you as set forth in this Privacy Statement.

## Your Choices and Controls

You may have the ability to view or edit information we collect from and about you online. To help prevent this information from being viewed by others, you will be required to sign in with your credentials (e.g. username and password). The appropriate method(s) for accessing your information will depend on which sites or services you have used. Some Bentley webpages or services may collect information that you may be able to access through alternative means of access described by the service. Or you can use our [contact us](https://web.archive.org/en/about-us/contact-us "Contact Us") form and we will contact you within 30 days regarding your request.

You can stop the delivery of future promotional email from Bentley and services by following the specific instructions set forth in such promotional email. You may also have the option of proactively making choices about the communications you receive from Bentley by [contacting us](https://web.archive.org/en/about-us/contact-us "Contact Us"). However, we may send out emails periodically informing you of administrative and technical service issues about the products and services that you are using. These communications are considered essential to the provision of the service you have requested. You will not be able to choose to unsubscribe to these mailings, as they are considered a part of the service you have chosen.

## **EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework (EU RESIDENTS)**

Bentley complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union to the United States. Bentley has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles of _Notice_ , _Choice_ , _Accountability for Onward Transfer_ , _Security_ , _Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation_ , _Access_ , and _Recourse, Enforcement and Liability_ , and the 16 Supplemental Principles (collectively, " **Privacy Shield Principles** "). Such adherence is subject to investigation and enforcement by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. 

Bentley's participation in the Privacy Shield applies to all personal information that is subject to this Privacy Statement and is received by or on behalf of Bentley from the European Union and European Economic Area. Bentley will comply with the Privacy Shield Principles in respect of such personal information. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Statement and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern in respect of such personal information. Bentley’s adherence to the Privacy Shield Principles may be limited to the extent necessary to meet national security, public interest, or law enforcement requirements.

Bentley’s accountability for personal information that it receives under the Privacy Shield framework and subsequently transfers to a third party is described in the Privacy Shield Principles. In particular, Bentley remains responsible and liable under the Privacy Shield Principles if third-party agents that we engage to process personal information on our behalf do so in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles, unless we prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

You have the right to access your personal information maintained by Bentley under the Privacy Shield framework, and to correct, amend or delete such information where it is inaccurate or processed unlawfully, as described in the Privacy Shield Principles. To exercise these rights, please contact us by clicking on this [contact us](https://web.archive.org/en/about-us/contact-us "Contact Us") link.

In addition, Bentley provides individuals with certain choices regarding how we use and disclose personal information we receive under the Privacy Shield framework. First, if Bentley uses your personal information for a materially different purpose than that for which it was originally collected or discloses your personal information to a third party (other than third party providers acting on our behalf), we will first provide you with a clear, conspicuous, and readily available mechanism to opt-out of any such use or disclosure (for example, by sending you an email seeking your consent). Further, all of our email communications include the ability to opt-out from receiving future emails, except those emails that are necessary to provide you with the services you have requested or purchased. If you have any questions about your choices regarding how we use and disclose your personal information, or how to exercise these choices, please contact us via our [contact us](https://web.archive.org/en/about-us/contact-us/contact-us-form) form.

We encourage you to contact us should you have a Privacy Shield-related (or general privacy-related) complaint or inquiry by clicking on this [contact us](https://web.archive.org/en/about-us/contact-us "Contact Us") link. For any complaints that cannot be resolved with Bentley directly, Bentley has chosen to cooperate with the American Arbitration Association, an alternative dispute resolution provider, to resolve such complaints at no charge to you. Please visit <http://info.adr.org/safeharbor> for more information and to file a complaint. As further explained in the Privacy Shield Principles, a binding arbitration option will also be made available to you to address residual complaints not resolved by any other means.

## Other Important Privacy Information

**Security of Your Information**  
Bentley is committed to protecting the security of information we collect from and about you. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect this information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, we store the information you provide on computer systems with limited access, which are located in controlled facilities. When we transmit highly confidential information (such as a credit card number or password) over the Internet, we protect it through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol. If a password is used to help protect your accounts and information, it is your responsibility to keep your password confidential. Do not share this information with anyone. If you are sharing a computer with anyone you should always choose to log out before leaving a site or service to protect access to your information from subsequent users.

**Collection and Use of Children’s Information**  
Bentley webpages and services are intended for general audiences and we do not knowingly collect any personal information from children. When a Bentley webpage does collect age information, and users identify themselves as under 13, the site will either block such users from providing personal information, or will seek to obtain consent from parents for the collection, use, and sharing of their children’s personal information. We will not knowingly ask children under the age of 13 to provide personal information to us. Bentley strongly encourages you to talk with your children about communicating with strangers and disclosing personal information online and about using the Internet safely.

**Use of Cookies**  
We and our approved partners use cookies and similar technologies on our websites, services, applications, tools, and electronic communications (collectively referred to as our “ **sites and services** ”) that automatically receive and track certain data about your device and interaction with our sites and services. You can read more [here](https://web.archive.org/en/cookie-policy "Cookie Statement") about the types of cookies and similar technologies we use, why we use them, and how you can exercise your choices.

**Use of Third-Party Ad Networks**  
The majority of the online banner advertisements you see on Bentley webpages are displayed by Bentley. However, we allow other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to display advertisements on Bentley webpages. Some of these ad networks may place a persistent cookie on your computer to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement. In this way, ad networks may compile information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw their advertisements and determine which ads are clicked. This information allows an ad network to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. Bentley does not have access to nor does it control the cookies that may be placed on your computer by the third-party ad servers or ad networks. You can read more [here](https://web.archive.org/en/cookie-policy "Cookie Statement") about the types of cookies and similar technologies we use, why we use them, and how you can exercise your choices.

Bentley maintains relationships with a number of third-party ad networks currently operating. Those ad networks that use persistent cookies may offer you a way to opt out of ad targeting. You may find more information at the website of either the individual ad network or the [Network Advertising Initiative](http://www.networkadvertising.org/ "Network Advertising Initiativ").

**Links to Other Sites**  
Bentley webpages may contain links to other sites. Bentley is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of other websites. Please refer to the policies of the respective site.

**Enforcement of This Privacy Statement**  
If you have questions regarding this Privacy Statement, you should contact us by clicking on this [contact us](https://web.archive.org/en/about-us/contact-us "Contact Us") link.

**Changes to This Privacy Statement**  
We will update this Privacy Statement when necessary to reflect customer feedback and changes in our services and practices. When we make changes, we will post the " **Last Revised** " date at the top of this Privacy Statement so you know when those changes were made. If there are material changes to this Privacy Statement or in how Bentley will use information we collect from and about you, we will notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes prior to implementing the change or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Statement to be informed of how Bentley is protecting your information.
