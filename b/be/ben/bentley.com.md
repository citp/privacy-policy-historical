## Reasons we Share the Information we Collect

We do not sell or otherwise disclose information we collect to others except as described in this statement. Bentley may share your information we collect with its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates. In some cases Bentley may share information we collect with vendors or agents working on our behalf for any purposes described in in this statement. For example, we may share information for purposes of data processing or storage, delivering customer support, processing credit card payments, and sending emails on our behalf. In such cases, these companies must abide by our data privacy and security requirements and are not allowed to use your information for any other purpose. 

Some Bentley Web pages allow you to choose to share your information with select Bentley partners so that they can contact you about their products, services, or offers. Other sites do not share your contact information with third parties for marketing purposes, but instead may give you a choice as to whether you wish to receive communications from Bentley on behalf of external business partners about a partner’s particular offering (without transferring your information to the third party). 

Some Bentley services may be co-branded and offered in conjunction with another company. If you register for or use such services, both Bentley and the other company may receive information collected in connection with the co-branded services. 

We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, such as handling the processing and delivery of mailings, providing user or customer support, hosting websites, processing transactions, or performing statistical analysis of our services. Those companies will be permitted to obtain only the information they need to deliver the service. They are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose. 

We may access and/or disclose information we collect if we believe such action is necessary to: (a) comply with the law or legal process served on Bentley; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Bentley (including the enforcement of our agreements); or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of Bentley services or members of the public.

If we merge with another company or reorganize some part or all of our business, assets, or stock (including if we file for bankruptcy or similar proceeding), we may share information we collect from and about you in connection with the merger or reorganization. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur and that any acquirer may continue to use information we collect from and about you as set forth in this privacy statement.

## Your Choices and Controls

You may have the ability to view or edit information we collect from and about you online. To help prevent this information from being viewed by others, you will be required to sign in with your credentials (e.g. username and password). The appropriate method(s) for accessing your information will depend on which sites or services you have used. Some Bentley Web pages or services may collect information that you may be able to access through alternative means of access described by the service. Or you can use our [contact us](https://web.archive.org/en/about-us/contact-us "Contact Us") form and we will contact you within 30 days regarding your request. 

You can stop the delivery of future promotional email from Bentley and services by following the specific instructions set forth in such promotional email. You may also have the option of proactively making choices about the communications you receive from Bentley by [contacting us](https://web.archive.org/en/about-us/contact-us "Contact Us"). We may send out email periodically informing you of administrative and technical service issues about the products and services that you are using. These communications are considered essential to the provision of the service you have requested. You will not be able to choose to unsubscribe to these mailings, as they are considered a part of the service you have chosen. You can also click [here](https://web.archive.org/en/cookie-policy "Cookie Statement") about the types of cookies and similar technologies we use, why we use them, and how you can exercise your choices.

## Other Important Privacy Information

**Security of Your Information**  
Bentley is committed to protecting the security of information we collect from and about you. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect this information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, we store the information you provide on computer systems with limited access, which are located in controlled facilities. When we transmit highly confidential information (such as a credit card number or password) over the Internet, we protect it through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.

If a password is used to help protect your accounts and information, it is your responsibility to keep your password confidential. Do not share this information with anyone. If you are sharing a computer with anyone you should always choose to log out before leaving a site or service to protect access to your information from subsequent users. 

**Collection and Use of Children’s Information**  
Bentley Web pages and services are intended for general audiences and do not knowingly collect any personal information from children. When a Bentley Web page does collect age information, and users identify themselves as under 13, the site will either block such users from providing personal information, or will seek to obtain consent from parents for the collection, use, and sharing of their children’s personal information. We will not knowingly ask children under the age of 13 to provide more information than is reasonably necessary to provide our services. Bentley strongly encourages you to talk with your children about communicating with strangers and disclosing personal information online and about using the Internet safely.

**Use of Cookies**  
We and our approved partners use cookies and similar technologies on our websites, services, applications, tools, and electronic communications (collectively referred to as our “ **sites and services** ”) that automatically receive and track certain data about your device and interaction with our sites and services. You can read more [here](https://web.archive.org/en/cookie-policy "Cookie Statement") about the types of cookies and similar technologies we use, why we use them, and how you can exercise your choices.

**Use of Third-Party Ad Networks**  
The majority of the online banner advertisements you see on Bentley Web pages are displayed by Bentley. However, we allow other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to display advertisements on Bentley Web pages. Some of these ad networks may place a persistent cookie on your computer in order to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement. In this way, ad networks may compile information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw their advertisements and determine which ads are clicked. This information allows an ad network to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. Bentley does not have access to nor does it control the cookies that may be placed on your computer by the third-party ad servers or ad networks. You can read more [here](https://web.archive.org/en/cookie-policy "Cookie Statement") about the types of cookies and similar technologies we use, why we use them, and how you can exercise your choices. 

Bentley maintains relationships with a number of the third-party ad networks currently operating. Those ad networks that use persistent cookies may offer you a way to opt out of ad targeting. You may find more information at the website of either the individual ad network or the [Network Advertising Initiative](http://www.networkadvertising.org/ "Network Advertising Initiativ"). 

**Links to Other Sites**  
Bentley Web pages may contain links to other sites. Bentley is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of other websites. Please refer to the policies of the respective site. 

**Links to Bentley Web Pages or Services**  
You are welcome to establish a hypertext link to our sites and services as long as the link does not state or imply Bentley’s sponsorship of your site. However, you may not use any Bentley logo in conjunction with the link without obtaining Bentley’s prior express permission to do so. Bentley reserves the right to revoke this courtesy, at its sole discretion. You may not link to our sites or services through a frame. 

**Controlling Spam or Unsolicited Email**  
Bentley is concerned about controlling unsolicited commercial email, or spam. Bentley will not sell, lease, or rent its email subscriber lists to third parties. While Bentley continues to actively review and implement new technology, such as expanded filtering features, there is no currently available technology that will totally prevent the sending and receiving of unsolicited email. Using various email client tools and being cautious about the sharing of your email address while online will help reduce the amount of unsolicited email you receive. By using or otherwise accessing Bentley Web pages, you agree not to gather any email addresses for spamming purposes. 

**Miscellaneous**  
Bentley Web pages may include inaccuracies or typographical errors. Bentley may make improvements and/or changes in the products, services, programs, and prices described in Bentley Web pages at any time without notice. Pennsylvania law and controlling U.S. federal law will govern any action arising from use of Bentley Web pages. 

**Enforcement of This Privacy Statement**  
If you have questions regarding this statement, you should [contact us](https://web.archive.org/en/about-us/contact-us "Contact Us").

**Changes to This Privacy Statement**  
We will update this privacy statement when necessary to reflect customer feedback and changes in our services and practices. When we make changes, we will post the " **Last Revised** " date at the top of this statement so you know when those changes were made. If there are material changes to this statement or in how Bentley will use information we collect from and about you, we will notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes prior to implementing the change or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to periodically review this statement to be informed of how Bentley is protecting your information.
