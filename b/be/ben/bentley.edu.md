**Our Information Collection Practices:**

  * Personal information about you is not gathered when you visit the Bentley College web site unless you choose to supply information to us. 

  * Bentley makes use of conventional on-line data entry forms to collect personal information from web visitors who choose to identify themselves for purposes of transacting e-commerce or receiving products, services or information.  Department web sites that collect data of any type are required to abide by, and provide a link to, Bentley's information privacy statement.  We request no more information than is required to fulfill the purpose for which the information is being collected.

  * We support Bentley-hosted applications that collect data for e-commerce purposes. We also maintain partnerships with selected vendors to process e-commerce transactions on our behalf.  These e-commerce transactions are secured with SSL and maintain high standards of privacy, to which approved sub-contracting vendors are also held. 

  * Bentley's web site neither targets persons who are less than 13 years of age nor knowingly collects personal information online from them.

 **Important Technical Information:**

Bentley follows industry-standard precautions and procedures in the transmission and storage of electronic data. When you make online payments, Secure Socket Layer (SSL) server software in conjunction with your SSL-enabled-browser software prevents unauthorized access to the information you submit by encrypting it during transmission. While we remain committed to protecting the privacy of our users, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems. We do so by using secure technology, privacy protection controls, and restrictions on employee access.
