Welcome to Benchmark Email, owned and operated by Benchmark Internet Group (herein after referred to as "Benchmark," "company," "us," "we," and/or "our").

This document/page lays out our privacy policy in regards to information that we may collect on our website www.benchmarkemail.com and through the associated Benchmark Email Service. This includes personal information (personal data) of customers, registered users, interested parties and non-registered visitors of the websites of Benchmark. The use of information collected through our Service shall be limited to the purpose of providing the service for which our customers have engaged us. Your data and privacy are of utmost importance to Benchmark, and this privacy policy was created to emphasize that. This policy will explain how we use and protect your personal data and any other information gathered with the service as well as the human resources data of our employees.

#### Benchmark Email as the Contract Data Processor

Benchmark Email offers its business customers a technical solution (so-called software as a service), to allow for email campaigns to be created and sent to customer-specific contacts. The respective customer of Benchmark Email named therein is responsible in terms of content and data protection law for the email campaigns as the provider or the sender of the email campaign. Benchmark Email does not have an influence on this, and insofar as data protection law is concerned, is merely a technical service provider for contract data processing subject to the instructions of its customers. Therefore, any claims in consequence of receipt of an email campaign and its content must always be directed towards the provider apparent therein. This applies in particular for claims under data protection law for information, correction, blocking or deletion. The respective offeror or sender of the email campaign shall independently provide information (e.g. in a separate data privacy statement) about how personal data will be used—also while employing the technical platform of Benchmark Email. 

#### EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield

Benchmark, and its parent company Benchmark Internet Group, participate in and has certified its compliance with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework.  Benchmark is committed to subjecting all personal data received from European Union (EU) member countries and Switzerland, respectively, in reliance on the Privacy Shield Framework, to the Framework’s applicable Principles.  To learn more about the Privacy Shield Framework, visit the [U.S. Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield List](https://www.privacyshield.gov/list).

Benchmark is committed to cooperating with the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) and will comply with the advice given by the authority with regard to human resources data transferred from Switzerland in the context of the employment relationship.

Benchmark is responsible for the processing of personal data it receives, under the Privacy Shield Framework, and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf.  Benchmark complies with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of personal data from the EU and Switzerland, including the onward transfer liability provisions.

With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Framework, Benchmark is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the U.S. Department of Transportation.  In certain situations, Benchmark may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third-party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at <https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request>. Benchmark has further committed to cooperate with EU data protection authorities (DPAs) with regard to unresolved Privacy Shield complaints concerning human resources data transferred from the EU in the context of the employment relationship.

 

Under certain conditions, more fully described on the [Privacy Shield website](https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=How-to-Submit-a-Complaint), you may invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.

1\. Contract must specify and limit the purposes of processing, and act only on instruction of the transferring organization (e.g., the controller).

2\. Take reasonable steps to ensure service providers act only as instructed and put in place appropriate safeguards to protect information.
