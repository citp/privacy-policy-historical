In addition, see important information below regarding our use of Automatically-Collected Information to track your online activity and deliver targeted advertising. Unless prohibited by law, Automatically Collected Information may be combined with Personally Identifiable Information we have collected about you. 

**3\. How We Collect Automatically Collected Information**

      ** _(a) Cookies_**

We use a feature of your internet browser called a “cookie” (a small file automatically placed on your hard drive or operating device, which assigns you a unique, random number that acts as a sort of anonymous ID) to facilitate Website navigation and internet sessions. Standing alone, a cookie does not identify Personally Identifiable Information of a user; rather, it identifies the computer or device that a user uses to access the Website. Unless you choose to identify yourself to us by providing Personally Identifiable Information, you remain anonymous to us when browsing the Website; in other words, the cookie alone will not allow us to identify you personally. 

Regardless of whether you have an account on the Website, when you visit the Website, our servers send a session cookie to your computer or other operating device. And we use these session cookies to collect Automatically Collected Information as you browse and use the Website. Session cookies are removed from your hard drive when you close your browser or otherwise end your session on the Website. 

If you have an account on the Website, each time you log into your account, we use a persistent cookie containing encrypted information to allow us to uniquely identify you and to process your online transactions and requests. Persistent cookies are required to use your account. Persistent cookies remain on your hard drive even after you close your browser or otherwise end your session on the Website so that the information held in the cookie is still available when you return to the Website. 

We further use persistent cookies, even if you don’t have an account on the Website, when you put an item in our shopping cart. We use this persistent cookie to save the data for a designated period of time in case the user’s session expires and the user then returns to complete the purchase within that timeframe. 

We use cookies to collect information about your browser and your computer or device, to later identify your computer or device (by recording your IP address or device ID), to provide Website user authentication and distinguish you from other Website users, to remember your personal settings, to pre-fill forms for you by saving your preferences for future visits, to monitor your use of the Website, to identify the websites you visited prior to and that you visit after visiting our Website, and to compile aggregate data about Website traffic and interactions so we can offer better experiences and tools in the future and to improve our ad targeting. 

Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually disable the acceptance of browser cookies and remove existing browser cookies at any time by changing the preferences in your browser or device. Please refer to your browser or device for information on how to disable and control cookies. If you choose to disable cookies, you will not be able to use some of the Website and/or some features or services will not function as well. For example, you might not be able to order product through our Website, track your order, register for an account, or access your existing account. 

      ** _(b) Web Beacons_**

We use web beacons alone or in conjunction with cookies to compile Automatically-Collected Information about your use of the Website, as well as your interaction with emails from us. Web beacons are clear electronic images imbedded in a web page, website feature, or email, which can recognize certain types of information on your computer or device, such as cookies, when you viewed a particular website tied to the web beacon, and a description of a website tied to the web beacon. For example, we may place web beacons in marketing emails that notify us when you click on a link in the email that directs you to the Website. We use web beacons to operate and improve the Website and email communications and to statistically monitor how many people are using the Website and opening our emails and for what purposes. 

      ** _(c) IP Addresses and Mobile Device IDs_**

When you visit the Website, we collect your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address and/or mobile device ID to track and aggregate Automatically Collected Information. For example, we use IP addresses and mobile device IDs to monitor the regions from which our Website users navigate the Website. We also collect IP addresses and mobile device IDs from users when they log into their accounts on the Website in order to confirm the applicable user’s identity. 

      ** _(d) Third Party Cookies and Website Analytics; Our Targeted Advertising Practices_**

We use third party services to track and analyze your Website activity, as well as to track websites you visited before and websites you visit after using the Website. You will encounter session and persistent cookies and other tracking technologies from these third parties on certain pages of the Website, which we have allowed. The information provided to these third parties does not include Personally Identifiable Information; rather, these third parties only collect Automatically Collected Information, such as pages and products viewed and your IP address or device ID. 

We use the information collected from these service providers to find usability problems to make the Website easier to use, to analyze use patterns, and to improve our products and services. 

**We also use these third-party persistent cookies and other third-party services to serve our online advertisements to you on other websites and/or mobile applications you visit after you’ve visited the Website. This online targeted advertising is based on your online activity. You will see our advertisements across the Internet, which are served to you by these third-party service providers, unless you opt-out of receiving the online targeted advertisements.** We also receive reports from these third parties that include Automatically Collected Information regarding your use of the Website. 

**You can opt-out of receiving online targeted advertisements by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page (<http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/#completed>) or the Digital Advertising Alliance Consumer Choice Page ([http://www.aboutads.info/choices/)](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/) or here: <http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/>. See more information about your options regarding online advertising here: <http://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising/what-are-my-options>. Our online advertisements will also contain an icon or link regarding your advertisement choices, which you can click on to then opt-out of receiving certain ads delivered by that particular ad network. Note that even if you opt-out, you may still see our advertisements, but they will not be delivered based on your online activity. Further, please remember that changing your settings with certain browsers and ad networks will not carry your privacy choices across all browsers and/or other ad networks.**

The online targeted advertisements described in this Section are different from marketing communications you will receive if you are on our promotional mailing list, which is discussed in Section 4(b) below.

 _Our security measures_

: We use commercially reasonable physical, electronic, and managerial security measures to assist in protecting against the loss, misuse, and unauthorized alteration of Personally Identifiable Information that is under our control. When the Website is accessed using Chrome, Internet Explorer version 8.0 or later, Firefox version 2.0 or later, or Safari version 5.0 or later, Secure Socket Layer (“SSL”) technology protects your Personally Identifiable Information using both server authentication and data encryption during transmission. 

_User Responsibility_

: The safety and security of your Personal Information also depends on you. For example, you should not send us sensitive Personally Identifiable Information via email, as this is not secure, and information sent via email is not encrypted. Also, before transmitting sensitive Personally Identifiable Information to us through our Website, look at the bottom status bar of your browser window for an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending on your browser), which will indicate that the SSL is active and the connection is secure. Please notify us if you become aware that your Personally Identifiable Information is lost, stolen, or used without permission. 

_DISCLAIMER_

: Unfortunately, no data storage system, or system of transmitting data over the Internet or wireless network, can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, and no security system can prevent all security breaches. As a result, we do not and cannot guarantee the security of our servers, the means by which Personally Identifiable Information is transmitted between your computer or device and our servers, or any Personally Identifiable Information provided to us or to any third party to or in connection with the Website or otherwise.

Your Automatically-Collected Information may be retained for the purpose of serving targeted online advertising to you until you opt-out of receiving these advertisements, as described in Section 3(d) above.
