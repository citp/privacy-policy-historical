**Introduction**

Bennetts is a trading name of Saga Services Limited, part of Saga Group of Companies. The data controller is Saga Services Limited, registered in England and Wales (registered number 732602) at Enbrook Park, Sandgate, Folkestone, Kent CT20 3SE. In this Privacy & Cookie Policy, "we", "us" and "our" means Saga Services Limited and "you" and "your" means the person who wishes to use the website. 

We are committed to protecting your privacy. We comply with the principles of the General Data Protection Regulation and associated data protection legislation. We aim to maintain best-practice standards in our processing of personal and/or special category personal data (this is also referred to as sensitive personal data).

**How we use your information**

We use the information we receive from you, together with information we have obtained from our dealings with you (including in relation to goods and/or services we provide to you and/or your use of those goods and/or services), to provide goods and/or services that you request, to communicate with you, and to personalise information sent to you. Examples of how we may personalise information include using your information in generating an insurance quote for you. 

We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to others.

We store all the information you provide to us, including information provided via forms you complete on our website, and information which we may collect from your browsing. Our server, in common with nearly all web servers, logs each page that is downloaded from the site. If you contact us electronically we may collect your electronic identifier, e.g. Internet protocol (IP) address or phone number supplied by your service provider. This is to identify the number of visits to our websites, fraudulent behaviour or mystery shoppers using our websites.

Our website may also use SessionCam for analysis. SessionCam is a product that has been developed by SessionCam LTD. SessionCam may record mouse clicks, mouse movements, page scrolling and any text keyed into website forms. The information collected does not include bank details or any sensitive personal data. Data collected by SessionCam from the Bennetts website is for the Saga Group’s internal use only. The information collected is used to improve our website usability and is stored and used for aggregated and statistical reporting.

For further information; please see our ‘Use of Cookies’ section. ****Any new information you provide us may be used to update an existing record we hold for you. If you provide a work email address we will not be responsible for third parties having access to any communications we send.

We ask for your home, mobile phone number, and email address to enable us to contact you in relation to an enquiry you have made, to contact you if there is a problem with your policy , notifying you about important functionality changes to the website,  or there is another genuine reason for doing so.

Sometimes we may need to collect information that the law defines as special category data (also called sensitive personal data). This includes, but is not limited to, information about racial or ethnic origin, sexual orientation, health data, and criminal records. We will not collect or use these types of data without your consent, unless the law allows us to do so. If we do, it will only be when it is necessary as determined by the law and the ICO. 

When you enter a contest or other promotional features, we may ask for your name, address, phone numbers and email address so we can administer the contest and notify winners.

We collect credit or debit card details from you in order to pay for a service or product. We will keep such details secure and ensure that the details are only used further with your consent and/or for the purposes of any appropriate refunds.

In the event of phone calls from you, we also reserve the right to ask security questions (which we in our sole discretion deem appropriate) in order to satisfy ourselves that you are who you say you are.  


Claims & Underwriting Exchange Register

Insurers pass information to the Claims and Underwriting Exchange Register run by Insurance Database Services Limited (IDS Ltd), the Hunter Database, run by MCL Software Ltd and the Motor Insurance Anti Fraud and Theft Register, run by the Association of British Insurers (ABI) to help us check information provided and also to prevent fraudulent claims. When we deal with your request for insurance, we may search these Registers and any other relevant registers. Under the conditions of your policy, you must tell us about any incident (such as an accident or theft) which may give rise to a claim. When you tell us about an incident, we will pass this information to the Registers and to any other relevant registers. You can ask us for more information about this.  


Motor Insurance Database

Information relating to your insurance policy will be added to the Motor Insurance Database ("MID") managed by the Motor Insurers’ Bureau ("MIB").

MID and the data stored on it may be used by certain statutory and/or authorised bodies including the Police, the DVLA, the DVLANI, the Insurance Fraud Bureau and other bodies permitted by law for purposes, not limited to but including: 

i. Electronic Licensing

ii. Continuous Insurance Enforcement

iii. Law enforcement (prevention, detection, apprehension and or prosecution of offenders)

iv. The provision of government services and or other services aimed at reducing the level and incidence of uninsured driving.

If you are involved in a road traffic accident (either in the UK, the EEA or certain other territories), insurers and or the MIB may search the MID to obtain relevant information.

Persons (including his or her appointed representatives) pursuing a claim in respect of a road traffic accident (including citizens of other countries) may also obtain relevant information which is held on the MID.

It is vital that the MID holds your correct registration number. If it is incorrectly shown on the MID you are at risk of having your vehicle seized by the Police.

You can check that the correct registration number is shown on MID at www.askmid.com. You can find out more about this at www.mib/org.uk. You should show this notice to anyone insured to drive the vehicle covered under the policy.  


Insurance Administration, Renewal and Claims Handling

Information you supply may be used for the purpose of insurance administration, renewal and claims handling by the insurer, its agents, re-insurers and your intermediary. In assessing any claims made, insurers may undertake checks against publicly available information such as Electoral Register, County Court Judgments, bankruptcy or repossession information. Information may also be shared with other insurers either directly or via those acting for the insurer such as Loss Adjusters or investigators.

**Fraud Prevention and Credit Checks**

To help us prevent fraud and money laundering, your details may be submitted to fraud prevention agencies and other organisations where your records may be searched. We will also conduct a search with a credit reference bureau to assist us in providing a quote, and to check which payment options we can make available to you. A copy of this search will be left on your credit file but will not affect your credit score. Where we are providing a motor insurance quotation this search will be noted on your credit file and may be reflected in your credit score.

In order to assess financial and insurance risk, we will make full and open checks on the electoral roll registers and public data provided to us by credit reference bureaus and other third parties. This is also to assess your premium at quote and renewal, for credit applications and to assist with identity checks in order to prevent money laundering. 

**Lawful bases for using your information**

Before you provide any data to us we will endeavour to make it clear why we need it. Sometimes we may need special category (sensitive) personal data, for example we may require details of any motoring convictions to ensure the insurance price we provide to you is accurate. When this is required, we will obtain your consent first, unless the information is necessary to provide the insurance product or service requested by you. Without this information, we may not be able to fulfil the product or service you have requested. 

A customer may properly give their partner's consent over the phone or via the website providing the customer confirms they have permission to do so. If the consent is written, the spouse must independently endorse such consent via counter signature.

We use the information you provide to us, either orally or in writing and the information we obtain from you through the use of our website, and as a result of our dealings with you (including any data we obtain from third parties) to provide the service requested by you. It may also be used for market research, offering renewals and statistical purposes. This also includes pricing insurance risk.

We recognise that we have a legitimate interest in processing the personal data we collect about you for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to: marketing purposes, to enables us to enhance, modify, personalise, or otherwise improve our services, identify and prevent fraud, enhance and protect the security of our network and systems, and market research (e.g. determining the effectiveness of campaigns and the products / services we offer). “Legitimate interests” means the interests of our company in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the best service and most secure experience. 

When we use your information for our legitimate interests, we make sure to consider and balance any potential impact on you and your data protection rights. Where applicable, legitimate interest assessments are conducted to ensure that these rights are protected.

**Keeping you informed about our products and services**

**Sharing your information**

As previously mentioned, we do not sell, trade or rent your information, and will never disclose information about you (including information obtained from our dealings with you) to third parties, except:

a) where we have a legal interest in a company; 

b) to fulfil your specific orders for a product or service or information in the event that third parties deliver the relevant product or service or information. In these instances, while the information you provide will be disclosed to them, it will only be used for the administration of the service provided, including (but not limited to), verification of any quote given to you, claims processing, underwriting, pricing purposes as appropriate, testing, and to maintain management information for business analysis. For example, if you take out an insurance policy provided by a third party, they will need your details in order to administer the policy, verify the quote given to you and process any claims. For further details about how your insurer handles your information, please see their Privacy Policy which can be found on their website. See your schedule policy documentation for your insurer contact details;

c) where third parties administer part or all of the product or service; and 

d) for underwriting, pricing, insurance rating analysis and testing purposes, and to maintain management information for business analysis.

We may of course be obliged by law to pass on your information to the police or any other statutory or regulatory authority and in some cases, exemptions may apply under relevant data protection legislation, whereby we can legitimately release personal data e.g. to prevent or detect crime or in connection with legal proceedings.

Subsequent to your purchase of a product or service, we may enter into an arrangement for that service to be provided by a new third party. If this happens, the terms and conditions of your contract with us will provide that you consent to the transfer and processing of personal and/or special category personal data to the new provider, subject to the requirements of the GDPR and associated legislation.

If we provide information to a third party (either a provider of a product or service, or an external data processing agency such as a mailing house) or a company Bennetts has a legal interest in, we will exercise the strictest control over them contractually, requiring it and any of its agents and/or suppliers to:

  * maintain the security and confidentiality of the information and restrict access to those of its own employees
  * use the data for the agreed purpose only and prevent it being used for any other purpose by any other party
  * refrain from communicating with you other than concerning the product in question
  * return the data to us at the conclusion of any contract term, and destroy or delete any copies made of all or any part of the information unless copies are needed to be kept to comply with regulations



In addition, we will restrict the information disclosed to the absolute minimum necessary, for example, to provide the product or service.

Amendment and retention of information

Please advise us in writing as to any changes in your circumstances, or if you feel we hold inaccurate information about you so that we can update our records accordingly. 

We will hold your personal information in accordance with the principles of the GDPR (and associated legislation) and in line with our Data Retention Policy. We are obliged and permitted by law and regulation to retain certain types of data for a minimum period of time. The minimum period of time tends to be for six years but can be longer if the statute or regulation requires.

**Your rights**

Access to your information: You have a statutory right of access to accessible personal and/or sensitive personal data that we hold about you. In order to exercise this right, your application must be in writing, either via letter or email. Please refer to the information you wish to see giving dates if possible. Please note that where relevant we may ask for proof of your identity. 

We will not administer Subject Access Requests by a third party unless accompanied by a written authority of the individual who is the subject of the request.

Rights related to automated decision making including profiling: We use the information we know about you to make decisions which inform our pricing, fraud prevention and the products and services we can offer. Automated decision making enables us to make efficient and fair decisions, providing a better service for our customers. Whilst you have the right to object to us using your information in this way, this could have an impact on the products or services we may be able to offer you. We use automated decision making in the following areas: 

Pricing - the information we know and collect about you is used to inform decisions around what we charge for the products and services that we offer. For example, If you apply for insurance, we will compare what you tell us with other records to work out how likely you are to make a claim. This will help us decide whether to offer you the product and what price to charge you.

Tailoring our marketing communications – as mentioned previously, we use your personal information to make decisions about what products, services and offers we think you may be interested in. This ensures the communications you receive from us are tailored and relevant to your interests. You can opt out of this at any time by contacting the Data Protection Officer. 

The right to erasure: you have the right to request that your personal data is erased and to prevent processing in specific circumstances which are detailed by the ICO. 

The right to data portability: you have the right to obtain and reuse the personal data that you have provided to us for your own purposes which includes transferring it to other services.
