Privacy Policy

## Updated: September 22, 2006

Our Commitment to You

Welcome to Bebo.com, the next generation social networking site where members can stay in touch with their friends, meet new people and hang out. The founders and employees of Bebo take your privacy very seriously. To make it easier for you to read and understand our privacy policy, we did the unconventional thing - we wrote this in plain English and tried to keep it to a reasonably short length.

* Your privacy remains strictly under your control
* You can end your membership at any time
* We will never disclose your personally-identifiable information to any third party for marketing purposes unless you expressly tell us to
* Bebo does not spam

Information Collected by Bebo

When you register to become a member of Bebo.com, you submit information such as your name and email address. As part of your personal profile, you may choose to submit additional information such as age, hobbies, and interests and other content, such as photos.

Use of Information

We will display your personal information on your profile according to the preferences you set in your account. We will use your name so that we can personalize your experience. We will use your email address to contact you from time to time and we will use your email address for security reasons to confirm that you are who you say you are. You can control the types and frequencies of certain emails you receive.

We may use the non-personally identifiable information, like your IP address, to statistically analyze site usage and to customize our site's content, layout and services. The resulting information will allow us to improve our site and better understand and serve our users.

We may also cooperate with law enforcement agencies in any official investigation and we may disclose your personally identifiable information to the relevant agency in doing so.

You Control Who Shares Your Information

Your profile information will only be given to friends you have specifically agreed to share such information with and to other members of groups (such as universities) you choose to belong to. You can limit who can view certain personal information, such as email addresses and phone numbers.

You can choose to make your profile visible to non-members of Bebo by editing your profile and opting in to 'accessible profile.'
