Our Commitment to You

Welcome to Bebo.com, the next generation social networking site where members can stay in touch with their friends, meet new people and hang out. The founders and employees of Bebo take your privacy very seriously. To make it easier for you to read and understand our privacy policy, we did the unconventional thing -- we wrote it in plain English and tried to keep it to a reasonably short length.

The key points of our privacy policy are:

  * Your privacy remains under your control.
  * You can end your membership at any time.
  * We only disclose information from which you may be personally identifiable to selected third parties in accordance with this privacy policy.
  * Bebo does not spam.
  * By participating in the Bebo community, you agree to this privacy policy.

You can control the types and frequencies of certain emails you receive in your email preferences.
  * We may use the information collected automatically, such as your IP address and information stored via cookies, to gather statistics about the number of people who visit Bebo and to customise Bebos content, layout and services.
