_By using our website, you agree, without limitation or qualification, to be bound by these terms of use._

### Liability and Results Disclaimer

The information provided on this website is for informational purposes only and is not intended as a substitute for advice from your physician or other qualified health care professional.

You should not use the information on this website for diagnosis or treatment of any health problem or for the prescription of any medication or other treatment.

You should consult with your chosen health care professional before making changes to your lifestyle, starting any new health care regimen, or if you have, or suspect you might have, a health problem.

Though we always try to provide accurate information, we make no representation and assume no responsibility for the accuracy of information on or available through our website, and this information is subject to change without notice.

We urge you to confirm any information found on or through our website by other means, including consulting with health care providers of your choice.

The products and the claims made about specific products on or through this website have not been evaluated by the United States Food and Drug Administration and are not approved to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent disease.

Further, we make absolutely no guarantee, expressed or implied, that by purchasing any of the products we present on our website, or by taking any of the actions recommended by the vendors of those products, that you will achieve the results you wish.

You acknowledge that you are solely responsible for your actions regarding the use of these products and that we are not responsible in any way for the success or failure of your actions.

### Disclosure Policy Regarding Vendor Sales

BeBrainFit.com provides information that can help you maintain and improve your cognitive and mental health.

In providing this information, we also routinely provide convenient access to products that we think may help you achieve those goals. We do this through links to vendor websites where you can purchase these products.

One of those is the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program (for the US), an affiliate advertising program that allows sites like ours to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to Amazon.com.

BeBrainFit.com is also a participant in the Amazon EU Associates Programme (for the UK), an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by linking to Amazon.co.uk, and in the Amazon Associates Program (for Canada), an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by linking to Amazon.ca and affiliated sites.

If you purchase a product on Amazon.com or another vendor’s website after clicking a link on our website, we will be paid a commission by the vendor for your purchase.

Whenever we do explicitly recommend a product, we give you our honest assessment of it. Our recommendation is based on either our assessment of the vendor and its product or our prior experience with the vendor and similar products made or sold by it.

Note that the cost of any product you buy on a vendor’s website through a link on our website is no higher than if you bypassed our link and bought the product on the vendor’s website directly.

Regardless of any mention or recommendation we make of a product on our website, we urge you to always do your own due diligence so that you make the best decision for you and your circumstances.
