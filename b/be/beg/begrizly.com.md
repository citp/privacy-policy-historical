Your User Contributions are posted on and transmitted to others at your own risk. We cannot control the actions of other users of our Services with whom you may choose to share your User Contributions. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that your User Contributions will not be viewed by unauthorized persons.

**_3.2. Information We Collect Through Automatic or Passive Data Collection Technologies_**  

‌

As you navigate through our Website and interact with our Services, we may use automatic or passive data collection technologies or third-party services (which in turn use certain automatic or passive data collection technologies) to collect certain information about you and other users of our Services, including information about your equipment, browsing actions, and patterns.

The information we collect from you automatically or passively is anonymous or is aggregated with information collected from other users of our Services and cannot be used by us to specifically identify you, except as expressly set forth in this policy. However, we may tie some of this information with personal information about you that we collect from other sources or you provide to us. The aggregated and/or anonymized data we obtain automatically and passively, and have access to consists of:

  *     * Details of users’ visits to our Website and use of our Services, including traffic data, logs, referring website addresses, data/time of visits, page views, domain names, location data, conversion rates, active users, time spent on the Website, and other similar data about how and when you and others access and use our Services.
    * Information about your computer, mobile device, and Internet connection, including your IP address, operating system, device identifiers, browser type, and what Internet Service Provider (ISP) you use.

    * Details about how and what users engage with our quizzes and other features of our Services.
    * Information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or other online services ( _e._ , behavioral or interest-based tracking).



This information helps us to improve our Services and to deliver a better and more enjoyable service, including by enabling us to:

  *     * Estimate our audience size and users’ usage patterns.
    * Store information about your preferences, allowing us to customize our Services according to your individual interests.

To the extent we use Facebook ad services ( _g._ , the Facebook Audience Network), Facebook may use tracking technologies, such as SDKs and pixel tags, to collect or receive information from users of our Services and may use any such information collected to provide us with measurement services or the ability to target advertisements to users within Facebook’s ad network.
