What are Cookies and Other Tracking Utilities?

Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that Belisi transfers to your computer's hard drive through your web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and to provide personalized product recommendations and other personalized features. For this reason, we ties your personally identifiable information to our cookies. While your browser will allow you to disable cookies, we recommend that you leave them turned on so that you can enjoy the best possible experience at Belisi.com. Some of our business partners (ie tracking utility company) use cookies on our site. We have no access to or control over these third party cookies.

Log Files

As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.

We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information. We use a third-party tracking service that uses cookies to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our site in the aggregate to capture usage and volume statistics to enhance our Web site.

Web Beacons

We employ a software technology called Web beacons, that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Web beacons are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, Web beacons are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We use clear gifs in our HTML- based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. For this reason, we tie your email address to the Web beacons. If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see follow the unsubscribe instructions in each email or change your email preferences in My Account.
