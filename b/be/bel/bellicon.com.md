These usage profiles are not aggregated and do not permit to draw any conclusions as regards your personal data.

g) Outbrain

On some of our web pages, we have integrated a so-called widget of Outbrain UK Limited, a company having its registered office in London. The service Outbrain is used for drawing your attention to supplementary contents, which are connected to the topics of the contents already read by you. If you did not declare your opt-out, the selection of the contents displayed in the widget is also made on the basis of those contents, which you currently and in the recent past have viewed on our web pages. For this purpose, Outbrain inter alia uses cookies.

The contents displayed in the widget are controlled and delivered in terms of contents and technology by Outbrain. We do not collect and use personal data in connection with the Outbrain widget. Outbrain provides information on the collection and utilisation of usage and other data in their data privacy policy (<https://www.outbrain.com/legal/privacy>). There, you are also able to object to the use of usage and other data for particular purposes (Opt-out). The recommendations of contents in the widget will afterwards no longer be controlled on the basis of usage data recorded by Outbrain.

h) Hotjar

We employ Hotjar, which essentially is a tracking code-based web analysis tool offered by Hotjar Ltd., (Level 2, St Julians Business Centre, 3, Elia Zammit Street, St Julians STJ 1000, Malta). By means of Hotjar, interactions between randomly selected, individual visitors of our website are recorded in an anonymised form. This creates a log of e.g. mouse movements and clicks, with the aim of finding possibilities for improving our offers. Moreover, information on the operating system, browser, inbound and outbound references (Links), geographic origin, as well as resolution and nature of the device accessing our website are analysed for statistical purposes. Moreover, we offer the possibility of an anonymous user feedback via Hotjar by means of so-called "Feedback Pools". The recorded information is not person-related, is stored by Hotjar Ltd. and is not passed on to other third parties. You may find supplementary information on functions and data usage by means of Hotjar at <https://www.hotjar.com/privacy>. If you do not desire an analysis of your web site by means of Hotjar, you can activate this on all Internet sites that employ Hotjar, by setting a DoNotTrack header in your browser (Hotjar-opt-out).

i) sendgrid

For the dispatch of order confirmation messages, we employ the service provider SendGrid. SendGrid is an offer of SendGrid, Inc., 1401 Walnut, Boulder, CO 80302, USA. Information on the data privacy policy of SendGrid may be found at https://sendgrid.com/privacy.

j) MailChimp

For the dispatch of newsletters, we utilise the services of MailChimp, an offer of Rocket Science Group LLC, 675 Ponce De Leon Ave NE, Suite 5000, Atlanta, GA 30308, USA. MailChimp is a service which inter alia enables the organisation and dispatch of newsletters. When you input data for the purpose of receiving newsletters (e.g. your email address), these are stored on the servers of MailChimp in the USA. MailChimp has received a certification in accordance with the "EU-US Privacy Shield". The "Privacy Shield" is an agreement concluded between the European Union (EU) and the USA that shall guarantee compliance with European data protection and data privacy standards in the USA.

With the help of MailChimp, we are able to analyse our newsletter campaigns. When you open an email that has been sent by MailChimp, a file contained in the email (so-called web-beacon) establishes a connection to the servers of MailChimp in the USA. Thus, it is possible to determine whether a newsletter message was opened and which links, if any, were clicked. Moreover, technical information is recorded (e.g. time of retrieval, IP-address, browser type and operating system). We are not able to attribute this information to the respective recipients of the newsletters. They exclusively serve the purpose of statistical analysis of newsletter campaigns. We can use the results of these analyses to better adapt future newsletters to the interests of the recipients.

If you do not wish any analysis by MailChimp, you need to unsubscribe from the newsletter. For this purpose, we provide a relevant link in each newsletter message.

The data processing is performed on the basis of your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR), which you can revoke at any time. The lawfulness of the data processing procedures that have already taken place remains unaffected by such revocation.

The data stored by you with us for the purpose of receiving newsletters remain stored by us until your deregistration from the newsletter and will be deleted from both our servers and from the servers of MailChimp after you unsubscribe from the newsletter. Data, which have been stored by us for other purposes (e.g. email addresses for the member section), remain unaffected thereby. For more details, you may wish to consult the data privacy provisions of MailChimp at <https://mailchimp.com/legal/terms/>.

We have concluded a so-called "Data Processing Agreement" with MailChimp, in which we obligate MailChimp to protect the data of our customers and not to disclose them to any third parties.
