**Information Collection**

We collect information from web site visitors who must register for certain services on-line, from users who agree to participate in on-line surveys, from users who wish to make certain on-line information requests from us, and from users who wish to participate in on-line contests and promotions sponsored by us.

The type of information so requested or collected by us includes user contact information (like their name, mailing address, telephone/fax number, and e-mail address), third party ship-to information (such as name, mailing address, telephone/fax number, and e-mail address), and user demographic information (like their zip code, country or corporate position).

The visitor's contact information will be used to provide shipment of products ordered online, for verification of credit card validity, and to contact the visitor when the visitor has expressed interest in being contacted (visitors can opt-out of receiving future mailings by complying with the choice/opt-out requirements noted below). While our site processes credit card information, such as card number, expiration date, CVV, CVC, or CID number; this information is immediately and securely transmitted to our credit card processing gateway contractor and we do not record this information within our firm. We do track and record IP addresses that access our site for reporting and profiling purposes only.

We also gather anonymous browsing habits of our visitors to better identify content preferences. User information may be shared with other Bell Electronics affiliates, or its' successors and assignee's.

We also share user information with governmental authorities when legally required to do so, and cooperate with such authorities investigating claims of illegal activity such as (but not limited to) illegal transfer of copyrighted material, or user web site postings or e-mail messages that contain threats of violence. 

Other than these specific exceptions noted,  we do not sell, rent, or provide access to any data collected about or from our users to any third parties.

Your data security is very important to us. By participating in the McAfee SECURE™ Program we have made a commitment to web site intrusion prevention. Further information about this program is available at [ https://www.mcafeesecure.com](https://www.mcafeesecure.com/RatingVerify?ref=www.bellnw.com).

**Security**

This site has taken reasonable security measures to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Please remember that no computer system should be considered safe from intrusion. E-mail may pass through many computer systems, and should not be considered as a secure means of communication unless encrypted. Even then, information is only as secure as the encryption method.

Employees are made aware of security policies and changes via e-mail reminders monthly. Access is limited to a very small number of employees with a defined need and is password protected. In order to provide the best possible security we review our Web security policies every 180 days.
