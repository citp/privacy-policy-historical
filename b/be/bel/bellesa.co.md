Security Precautions
Your Bellesa Profile is password-protected so that only you and authorized Bellesa employees
have access to your account information. In order to maintain this protection, do not give your
password to anyone. Bellesa staff will never proactively reach out to you and ask for any personal
account information, including your password. If you share a computer, you should sign out of
your Bellesa account and close the browser window before someone else logs on. This will help
protect your information entered on public terminals from disclosure to third parties.


Bellesa makes every effort to ensure that your information is secure on its system. Unfortunately,
no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, Bellesa
cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit. Any transmission made to or
through Bellesa is done at your own risks and perils. Bellesa expressly disclaims any liability that
may arise should any other individuals obtain the information you submit to or through the
Bellesa Website.
Bellesa has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the
information under our control. Your information may be transferred to and maintained on
computer networks which may be located outside of the state, province, country or other
governmental jurisdiction in which you reside, and the country or jurisdiction in which these
computer networks are located may not have privacy laws as protective as the laws in your
country or jurisdiction.

the privacy practices of other web sites. We encourage our users to read the privacy statements of
each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This Privacy Policy
