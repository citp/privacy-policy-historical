## Your personal information

**What is “personal” information?**

Personal information can include:

  * Your name, address and phone number(s). 
  * Other information about the Bell product(s) that you subscribe to, such as calling features or Bell TV programming. 
  * Your service usage such as cellular call records, long distance usage or Internet surfing habits. 
  * Account information such as the status of your account or your method of payment. 



**How and why does Bell collect personal information?**

We collect information during the application process, when communicating or transacting business with you, and when providing you with service. Occasionally we collect information about you from third parties, such as credit reporting agencies for credit checks.

We collect information to:

  * Establish and maintain a responsible commercial relationship with you. For example, we may collect information to confirm your identity or to establish credit worthiness. 
  * Understand your needs and preferences to make recommendations for products, services and bundled discounts. 
  * Understand who the people are that use our products and services, how they use them, and how we can improve them. 
  * Manage and develop Bell's business and operations. For example, we monitor usage volumes in order to plan and provision our communications networks. We also track product sales to determine the success of features, promotions and pricing. 
  * Meet legal and regulatory requirements. For example, we may be required to collect information by a court order or to demonstrate compliance with a CRTC requirement. 



Your personal information will not be used for any other purpose without your consent.

**Does Bell store customer information outside of Canada?**

In some cases, personal information collected by the Bell companies may be stored and processed outside of Canada to provide you with service or to support Bell operations.

While the information may be subject to the legal jurisdictions of these countries, the companies that provide us with these services have obligations to protect such information. For example, the information is typically provided only after detailed contracts are set out with the companies that provide us with these services. Moreover, the information may only be used for the purposes of providing the services in question. 

The use of customer information in this way is governed by the Bell Privacy Policy.

## Does Bell share personal client information?

**Does Bell share personal client information with outside organizations?**

We do not provide personal information to any party outside of the Bell companies except in limited circumstances in which it is necessary for us to do so. These third parties may include:

  * An agent acting on behalf of Bell, **** such as a company hired to perform installation work on our behalf. 
  * Another communications service provider, in order to offer efficient and effective communications services (e.g., to provide mobile service while roaming in another company's coverage area) or as required by law. 
  * A collection agency, for the express purpose of the collection of past due bills. 



When we provide personal information to third parties, we give only the information that is required under the specific circumstances. That information is used only for the purpose stated and is subject to strict terms of confidentiality. The employees of the companies that we share this information with must meet and respect our privacy standards.

**Directory listing information**

Please note that, pursuant to federal legislation, publicly available information, including a directory listing of your name, address and telephone number, may be collected, used and disclosed by organizations without your consent.

If you prefer not to have your listing information provided to select organizations, please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/Contact-us).

**Sharing information among the Bell companies**

Occasionally we may share information between the Bell companies to help understand your information, communication and entertainment needs, and to provide you with relevant information to meet those needs.

## Customer information verification

**Why we ask you to confirm personal information when you call Bell**

Bell places great emphasis on the security of your personal information and has safeguards in place to ensure that it is not disclosed to an unauthorized third party which is why, when calling Bell you'll be asked to confirm certain details regarding your account.

This safeguard will help us prevent pre-texting, often referred to as “social engineering”, which refers to the fraudulent and illegal practice of misrepresenting who you are in order to obtain access to someone else' s information. Bell is aware pre-texting, although illegal, has been a practice employed by unauthorized third parties trying to obtain access to customer information.

The kinds of things we might ask you to confirm could include your account number, PIN or password associated with the account, details of your payment habits, service usage or identification that you might have provided when you first requested your service such as a provincial driver's licence number.

We therefore ask for your patience and understanding when you are asked to confirm or provide such information as this process has been established to protect your personal account information.

## Common privacy concerns

**Does Bell monitor client Internet usage?**

Bell does not usually monitor your use of the service or the content of your emails. However, similar to other Internet service providers, Bell reserves the right to do so from time to time.

For example, in the normal course of business, we may need to review certain aspects such as your bandwidth consumption. This is to ensure that our service is functioning properly, but it may also be to ensure your compliance with the provisions of our Acceptable Use Policy, a copy of which can be found at the end of your service agreement.

Some of the things that will trigger monitoring of your use include:

  * Spamming 
  * Harassment of other users 
  * Uploading, downloading or otherwise transmitting materials which are protected by copyrights or other intellectual property rights 
  * Assisting or engaging in the fraudulent use of telecommunications services 



You can [view your Bell Internet Service Agreement online](http://internet.bell.ca/index.cfm?method=content.view&category_id=550&content_id=929).

**What is Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) and what does it have to do with the Internet?**

Deep packet inspection or DPI is a technology used in the industry to examine the types of traffic going across a network, but not the content. During peak periods, Bell uses DPI to identify peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing traffic which is less time sensitive than other real-time sensitive applications, such as Web browsing or video streaming. Because P2P file sharing applications are less time sensitive, they can be slowed when Internet traffic becomes congested during peak periods without interrupting use of the service.

When Bell uses DPI as part of its traffic management measures during peak periods of Internet usage, we do not examine the actual content of traffic and we only collect, for a limited time, your IP address. For example, we do not know the content of your communications nor your search activities. However, for traffic management to work properly, we use DPI technology to assess traffic data along with each IP address to determine what type of traffic it is so that we can treat it accordingly (e.g. if it is P2P file sharing traffic, we may slow it down during times of peak Internet usage to support other activities like Web browsing and video streaming). Once the traffic has been sorted by type for traffic management purposes, it is not retained as part of the usage pattern of any IP address.

**What are cookies and does Bell use them?**

A cookie is a small text file containing a unique number that identifies your browser - but not you - to our computers each time you visit. Cookies tell us which pages of our sites are visited and by how many people. This allows us to make decisions about which information is useful and what areas need improvement.

Unless you specifically identify yourself, we will not know who you are, even though we may assign your computer a cookie. In addition, unless we have your consent, we never combine cookie information with personally identifiable details like your name, telephone number or even your email address.

Most websites use cookies and most browsers will accept them. You can change the options on your browser to tell you when you have received one, or to refuse to accept them altogether.

You don’t need cookies to visit Bell sites. But if you refuse to accept them, some of the site features might not work, for example, the personalization options.

For more information on how to manage your cookies please visit Bell's [Internet Support pages](http://internet.bell.ca/index.cfm?method=content.view&content_id=6857).

**Why does Bell record customer calls?**

Because Bell is committed to continually improving its customer contact experience, some customer calls may be recorded and used for the ongoing training and development of our employees. Consistent with federal privacy legislation, customers are informed by a pre-recorded message that their call may be recorded for quality assurance purposes. After hearing this message, should you decide to continue with the call, your consent to record the call is implied. Otherwise, you may contact a Bell customer service representative through our [contact us](https://web.archive.org/Contact-us) section or by visiting a Bell store in your area.

The Bell companies may also record outbound calls placed to our customers for similar purposes.

## How does Bell respect children’s privacy online?

We will request permission from a parent or legal guardian before collecting, using or disclosing any personally identifiable information about a child (e.g., for participation in contests and promotions) on any of our commercial websites or online services directed to children under 13 years of age.

For more information regarding marketing to children, please visit the [Canadian Marketing Association’s Special Considerations in Marketing to Children guidelines](http://www.the-cma.org/?WCE=C=47|K=225849#11), part of the CMA’s Code of Ethics and Standards of Practice.

## Fraud prevention

Every day, scam artists from around the world are finding new ways, and using the latest technology, to break into office networks or personal computers, or invent new phone or online scams in order to steal information and money from unsuspecting consumers.

Because of the variety and sheer volume of these activities, it is virtually impossible to track every incident or find the source of every fake marketing operation. As a result, more and more consumers and businesses are becoming victims of fraud and losing millions every year.

**Education is your best protection**

We encourage you to find out more about phishing (email fraud), telemarketing scams and other types of activities that can make you vulnerable. Below, are some examples of what you should be looking out for, as well as some tips that will help you stay safe online and offline.

**Telemarketing or prize scams**

Look out for aggressive marketing tactics, pressure to “act now,” instructions to pay administrative fees for the delivery of a prize or product, etc. Aggressive marketing tactics are often used in order to “close the deal”, enabling the scam artist to quickly obtain your money and important information such as your banking information or credit card number.

**Important tip:** Watch out for “suspiciously generous” offers and make sure you are dealing with a legitimate business when you make a purchase over the phone or the Internet. Very short offer-expiry dates are often a sign of a scam. Short expiries reduce the risk of the fraudster being traced by authorities.

Some of our customers have had calls from fraudulent telemarketing “operators” claiming to be from Bell. For example, the operators may try to sell new rate plans (which are phony) or they may tell you that they’re updating your account and want you to “confirm” details. Their goal is to trick you into releasing personal information like credit card numbers or social insurance numbers, which can then be used for further fraud. Another example is the use of a pre-recorded message promising customers travel rewards or a $100 credit on their next bill and directing customers to a fake site that “looks” like a legitimate site or a 1-800 number to try to trick customers into disclosing their personal information.

If you get a suspicious call:

  * Do not give out your personal information. Legitimate companies will never call or email their customers requesting information such as passwords, bank account information or a credit card number, unless they are responding directly to an inquiry you know you have made. 
  * If you suspect that you are speaking with a fraudulent telemarketer, you should end the call and contact the business or organization through its regular channels, for example, **310-BELL (2355)**. 
  * Beware of being directed to websites that “look” like the sites from legitimate organizations – it is always best to access the site of a legitimate organization from its direct homepage, e.g. bell.ca. 



**Email fraud or phishing**

This refers to the use of deceptive emails and fake websites using the brand name of a legitimate business or government agency in order to obtain the personal information of web users for purposes of identity theft and other types of fraud. For more information, go to the [Bell Internet support site. ](http://internet.bell.ca/index.cfm?method=content.view&category_id=575&content_id=6936)

**Identity theft**

Scam artists are now using a wide range of tactics in order to steal your information online and offline. In addition to phishing, your personal information may be pulled from social networking sites, such as Facebook and MySpace, your computer, your mailbox and even your recycling bin.

**Important tips:**

  * Be cautious about posting personal information on public websites, such as social networking sites, as those details can be used by fraudsters to convince you that they represent Bell or other companies. 
  * Keep your passwords, bank account information and social insurance number confidential at all times, and check your bank and credit card statements frequently. 
  * Buy a shredder so you can destroy personal documents that you no longer need. You can be targeted for identity theft by fraud artists who find credit-card bills, etc., in your recycling. 



**Toll fraud**

Scam artists use creative schemes to steal your money by accessing your voice mail system, your calling card information or your Web browser and making sure the additional long distance fees are charged to you. Bell’s Fraud Control Centre continuously monitors its networks and works diligently to protect our customers and our employees.

For more useful tips on how to protect yourself from toll fraud, [visit our phone fraud page](https://web.archive.org/Home_phone/Phone_line/How_to_protect_against_phone_fraud).

Remember, it is your responsibility to remain vigilant and adopt the simple, but important safeguards that can protect you from toll fraud.

**Some important tips:**

The following are some important tips to help protect you from fraudulent activities:

  * Be cautious with the information you provide over the phone and make sure no one is watching when keying in your calling card PIN or any other PIN. 
  * Watch out for free downloads over the Web. Some sites will try to draw you in with free offers and then download programs that may be directing your Web browser to telephone an Internet service provider overseas. You could be charged the additional long distance fees. 
  * Always check your monthly statements carefully and look out for unusual charges. 
  * Beware of suspiciously generous offers or prizes from any company. 
  * Look out for aggressive marketing tactics, pressure to “act now,” instructions to pay administrative fees for the delivery of a prize or product, etc. 
  * Very short offer-expiry dates are often a sign of a scam. Short expiries reduce the risk of the fraudster being traced by authorities. 
  * Buy a shredder so you can destroy personal documents that you no longer need. You can be targeted for identity theft by fraud artists who find credit-card bills, etc., in your recycling. 
  * Be cautious about posting personal information on public websites as those details can be used by fraudsters to convince you that they represent Bell or other companies. 
  * Learn about [“phishing”](http://internet.bell.ca/index.cfm?method=content.view&category_id=572&content_id=6914) and Internet fraud and take steps to protect yourself.

If you think you may have given personal information to a fraud operator posing as a Bell representative, please [call](https://web.archive.org/Contact-us) us immediately. Give us as much information as possible including the exact date and time of the call.

Otherwise, if you suspect you’ve been a target of any type of phone or Internet fraud and would like to report a problem, contact the Canadian Anti-Fraud Call Centre (formerly Phonebusters) at **1 888 495-8501** or go to [www.antifraudcentre.ca](http://www.antifraudcentre.ca/).
