**How does BellSouth combat phishing?**

We do not ask you to disclose sensitive personal information in an email. Before you access your BellSouth account online and are asked to disclose such information to us, you will be asked to enter your login name and password for authentication purposes.

Our normal practice is to send you an email confirming significant changes made to your account online, such as, updates to the email address registered with us, payments on an account, or new services added.

You can protect yourself by regularly logging into your online account to ensure that all transactions are legitimate. Other tips on how you can protect yourself can be found at <http://www.antiphishing.org/consumer_recs.html>.

**What Kinds of Information Does BellSouth Collect and Use?**

The only personally identifiable information we collect about visitors is provided voluntarily. In general, you can visit our Web site without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. However, some portions of our Web site may be accessible only to users who have registered with us (and who may be asked to provide certain information as part of the registration or login process). In addition, our Web servers may use “cookies” (described below) to collect information about visitors such as domain names, but not your e-mail addresses. This information may be aggregated to measure such things as the number of visits, average time spent on the site, number of pages viewed, and methods by which our site was found. BellSouth uses such information to evaluate the use of our site and to continuously improve the content and services being provided.

At times we may ask you for contact information or conduct on-line surveys in order to better understand your needs so that we can provide you with a customized experience. If we wish to use this information other than as set forth in this statement, we will let you know at the time of collection. We will take commercially reasonable steps to safeguard this information from unauthorized access.

When you access your account information, order a service or make a payment on-line, request product or service information, send us e-mail, register to receive news or information alerts, establish a “My Yellow Pages,” submit a click wrap agreement or enter a contest that we are sponsoring, we will ask you to provide individually-identifiable information to us. Except as otherwise provided below under the heading “Who Has Access to This Information?”, when you supply information about yourself for a specific purpose, we use the information for that purpose and to manage the internal operations and security of our Web site consistent with the terms of use and policies established from time to time governing this site. Such purpose may involve the disclosure of such information to unaffiliated companies/vendors where necessary to and for the limited purpose of processing your request, processing a transaction authorized by you or providing you with products or services.

We also want you to be aware that certain information related to telecommunications services provided to you by BellSouth, commonly referred to as “Customer Proprietary Network Information” or “CPNI,” is subject to special Federal laws and regulations, with which we are fully committed to comply, both in the on-line environment and in all other respects.

BellSouth and its affiliated companies use this information to help us deliver the services you have requested, or to design or offer specific products or services that we believe will be useful to you. While we may use this information to contact you or to send materials to you for marketing purposes, we will take commercially reasonable steps to safeguard such information from unauthorized access by any other parties. As we strive to meet the needs or our customers, we may disclose personally identifiable information we collect, as described above, to companies and vendors that perform marketing or other services on our behalf or with whom we have joint marketing agreements so that we may provide a full range of products and services to you. Our policy is to prohibit these companies from otherwise selling or disclosing the personal information we provide.
