        <p><b>How does BellSouth combat phishing?</b></p>

        <p>We do not ask you to disclose sensitive personal information in an 
          email. Before you access your BellSouth account online and are asked 
          to disclose such information to us, you will be asked to enter your 
          login name and password for authentication purposes.</p>
        <p>Our normal practice is to send you an email confirming significant 
          changes made to your account online, such as, updates to the email address 
          registered with us, payments on an account, or new services added.</p>
        <p>You can protect yourself by regularly logging into your online account 
          to ensure that all transactions are legitimate. Other tips on how you 
          can protect yourself can be found at <a href="http://www.antiphishing.org/consumer_recs.html">http://www.antiphishing.org/consumer_recs.html</a>.</p>

        <a name="COLLECT_USE"></a>
        <p><b>What Kinds of Information Does BellSouth Collect and Use?</b></p>

        <p>The only personally identifiable information we collect about visitors 
          is provided voluntarily. In general, you can visit our Web site without 
          telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. 
          However, some portions of our Web site may be accessible only to users 
          who have registered with us (and who may be asked to provide certain 
          information as part of the registration or login process). In addition, 
          our Web servers may use “cookies” (described below) to collect 
          information about visitors such as domain names, but not your e-mail 
          addresses. This information may be aggregated to measure such things 
          as the number of visits, average time spent on the site, number of pages 
          viewed, and methods by which our site was found. BellSouth uses such 
          information to evaluate the use of our site and to continuously improve 
          the content and services being provided.</p>
        <p>At times we may ask you for contact information or conduct on-line 
          surveys in order to better understand your needs so that we can provide 
          you with a customized experience. If we wish to use this information 
          other than as set forth in this statement, we will let you know at the 
          time of collection. We will take commercially reasonable steps to safeguard 
          this information from unauthorized access.</p>
        <p>When you access your account information, order a service or make a 
          payment on-line, request product or service information, send us e-mail, 
          register to receive news or information alerts, establish a “My 
          Yellow Pages,” submit a click wrap agreement or enter a contest 
          that we are sponsoring, we will ask you to provide individually-identifiable 
          information to us. Except as otherwise provided below under the heading 
          “Who Has Access to This Information?”, when you supply information 
          about yourself for a specific purpose, we use the information for that 
          purpose and to manage the internal operations and security of our Web 
          site consistent with the terms of use and policies established from 
          time to time governing this site. Such purpose may involve the disclosure 
          of such information to unaffiliated companies/vendors where necessary 
          to and for the limited purpose of processing your request, processing 
          a transaction authorized by you or providing you with products or services.</p>
        <p>We also want you to be aware that certain information related to telecommunications 
          services provided to you by BellSouth, commonly referred to as “Customer 
          Proprietary Network Information” or “CPNI,” is subject 
          to special Federal laws and regulations, with which we are fully committed 
          to comply, both in the on-line environment and in all other respects. 
          For more information about these special rules and our related policies 
          regarding the use of CPNI, please visit – BellSouth’s Public

        <a name="ACCESS_INFORMATION"></a>
        <p><b>Who Has Access to This Information?</b></p>

        <p>Unless we specifically disclose it to you at the time of collection 
          or subsequently obtain your approval, we will not make visitor or customer-specific 
          information that is gathered on our site available to unaffiliated organizations 
          for commercial purposes unrelated to the business of BellSouth. BellSouth 
          and its affiliated companies use this information to help us deliver 
          the services you have requested, or to design or offer specific products 
          or services that we believe will be useful to you. While we may use 
          this information to contact you or to send materials to you for marketing 
          purposes, we will take commercially reasonable steps to safeguard such 
          information from unauthorized access by any other parties. As we strive 
          to meet the needs or our customers, we may disclose personally identifiable 
          information we collect, as described above, to companies and vendors 
          that perform marketing or other services on our behalf or with whom 
          we have joint marketing agreements so that we may provide a full range 
          of products and services to you. Our policy is to prohibit these companies 
          from otherwise selling or disclosing the personal information we provide.</p>
        <p>We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, 
          prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, 
          situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any 
          person, violations of BellSouth’s Terms of Use, or as otherwise 
          required by law.</p>
        <p>Certain federal, state and local laws or government regulations may 
          require us to disclose non-public personal information about you. In 
          these circumstances, we will use reasonable efforts to disclose only 
          the information required by law, subpoena or court order to be disclosed.

        <p>BellSouth recognizes the importance of children’s safety and 
          privacy on the Internet. For this reason and to comply with certain

          targeted to children under 13.Children should always ask their parents 
          or guardians for permission before disclosing any information online.

          including some that may have reduced prices or other special offers 
          for certain BellSouth customers. </p>

          policies of those other sites.</p>
