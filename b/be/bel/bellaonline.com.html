			<p class="articletext">This statement discloses the privacy practices for BellaOnline.com ("Website").
			Because this Website wants to demonstrate its commitment to respecting your privacy and to build
			users' trust and confidence in the Internet, it has agreed to disclose its information practices.
			You can expect to be notified of: </p>

			<ol>
			<li><span class="articletext">What personally identifiable information is collected</span></li>
			<li><span class="articletext">How the information is used</span></li>
			<li><span class="articletext">With whom the information will be shared</span></li>
			<li><span class="articletext">This Website's opt-out policy</span></li>
			<li><span class="articletext">This Website's policy on correcting and updating personally identifiable information</span></li>
			<li><span class="articletext">This Website's policy on deleting or deactivating your name from our database</span></li>
			</ol>

			<p class="articletext">Questions regarding this statement should be directed to
			BellaOnline.com by sending an email to <a href="mailto:info@bellaonline.com">info@bellaonline.com</a>
			and writing "Privacy Policy" in the subject line.</p>

			<p class="articletext">BellaOnline is currently seeking review and certification of its
			Privacy Policy by an independent privacy organization. The terms of this Privacy Policy
			are subject to revision in order to obtain certification.</p>

			<p class="articletext">This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to the terms of
			our <a href="terms.asp">Terms of Use Agreement</a>. Pursuant to the Terms of Use,
			this Privacy Policy is subject to
			modification at any time. You are responsible to review the Privacy Policy before using the
			site or providing any information.</p>

			<p class="subchannel">How We Collect Information

			</p><p class="category">This Website collects information that falls into one of two categories --
			personally identifiable information and aggregated information.  Personally identifiable
			information is information that can be used to identify you.  Aggregated information is
			information that is not associated with a specific user, such as the number of people who
			visit the Website from various states.</p>

			<p class="category">We collect personally identifiable information whenever you voluntarily
			submit it to the Website.  Examples of this type information include when you answer our
			polls, enter sweepstakes or contests, fill out the registration page, send us feedback or
			post in our chat rooms or message boards.  You always have the option of choosing not to
			reveal this personally identifiable information to us, although certain services may be
			unavailable if you do not.  In the event of a complaint, we may also receive and collect
			personally identifiable information about you from other parties in our Website or from
			other users or third parties who may communicate information to us about you in relation
			to that complaint.</p>

			<p class="category">In addition, we collect and store statistics and other information about
			the online activities of our visitors on an aggregated (collective) basis.  For example,
			we track the number of people who view each page, the order in which pages are viewed,
			and other information to learn which features are the most popular and to refine our
			design and marketing efforts.</p>

			<p class="subchannel">Information We Gather or Track </p>

			<p class="category">Information on general usage and any optional personal details you
			provide to us will be used to provide you with enhanced features such as customized
			content, access to our Chat Rooms and message boards, and the ability to participate
			in any of our BellaOnline communities. The following are details of the information
			we collect: </p>


			<ul>
				<li class="category">BellaOnline collects data so that we may display personalized content to our
				visitors. Additionally, usage information may be analyzed so that we can judge our system's
				performance or execute your customized features. </li>
				<li class="category">Your computer reaches us via a particular IP, (<b>I</b>nternet <b>P</b>rotocol),
				address. This can tell us things like what part of the world you're connecting from. Or
				what service provider you are using. </li>
				<li class="category">Your browser offers so-called "cookies" which -- if you allow their
				use -- store small amounts of data on your computer about your visit to any of our sites.
				Cookies assist us in tracking which of our features you like best. And when you re-visit our
				site, cookies can enable us to customize our content according to your preferences. However,
				cookies tell us nothing about you personally unless you specifically give us additional
				information. </li>
				<li class="category">Our registration form asks for contact and demographic information used to
				send news about our products or promotional material from our partners. You will be able to
				opt-out of receiving any mailings. Demographic information may be used to customize the display
				of our site to you by showing content that we think might be of interest or related to your past
				visits.</li>
				<li class="category">Surveys may ask for contact information or unique identifying information
				to increase the value of the results. Contests may require contact information or other
				demographic/personal information in order to determine your eligibility.</li>
				<li class="category">Some of the banner ads displayed in our site are provided by outside companies.
				These ads may contain cookies. While we use cookies in other parts of our Web site, cookies
				received with banner ads are collected by our advertisers and we do not have access to this
				information. Cookies in and of themselves do not contain any personally identifiable information
				about you.</li>
			</ul>


			<p class="subchannel">How We Use and Disclose Your Information</p>

			<p class="category">Both aggregated and personally identifiable information is used to operate and
			enhance our site and enhance your on-site experience by displaying content and marketing messages
			that we believe will be of interest to you.</p>

			<p class="category">Except as described below or otherwise indicated, we do not sell your personally
			identifiable information to third parties.  On some pages where we ask for your personally identifiable
			information, we may tell you that the data we are collecting on that page will be shared with third
			parties.  Information gathered from such pages may be shared with or sold to third-parties.</p>

			<p class="category">We produce aggregate reports for advertisers. For example, we tell
			advertisers how many people saw or clicked on an ad and additionally, how many people
			saw or clicked on ads in different portions of our service. Where available, we may
			offer additional information about viewer characteristics. <em>However this does <b>not</b> include
			personally identifiable information about you or your online usage patterns.</em> Our
			advertisers allow us to provide our service to you. In return, they need to know
			how to effectively place their ads to potential customers. </p>

			<p class="category">We'll use your email contact information to provide you with newsletters to
			which you subscribe, or for similar information we think you may find of interest. However,
			you can choose to opt out of these mailings. By providing your contact information you will
			be eligible to acquire user IDs and passwords that will allow you to participate in our
			community features, including chat and bulletin boards. </p>

			<p class="category">We also share or sell your personally identifiable information with
			third parties who provide services to our Website or are affiliated with our Website in
			order to enhance the functionality available to you as part of the Website, and to provide
			you with new products and services such as email and Member services. </p>

			<p class="category">Some online activities necessarily lead to disclosure of your personally
			identifiable information to third parties, such as when you include your name and email
			address in a postcard or when you order merchandise in the Store.  For such activities,
			a separate warning may not be provided.  Your choice to disclose personally identifiable
			information in these cases is voluntary.</p>

			<p class="category">In addition, you agree that BellaOnline.com may assign, sell, license, or
			otherwise transfer to a third party, your name, address, e-mail address, member name and any
			other personal information in connection with an assignment, sale, joint venture, or other
			transfer or disposition of a portion or all of the assets or stock of BellaOnline.com or its
			affiliated entities.</p>

			<p class="subchannel">Who Can Use Collected Information and How</p>

			<ul>
				<li class="category">As mentioned above, we provide our advertisers with aggregate reports on
				advertising activity. </li>
				<li class="category">Feedback is used both by BellaOnline staff as well as the individual
				Hosts for each of the BellaOnline Hosted sites. Hosts not only link to content from their sites
				and provide their own original content, but would have available to them any information that
				you send them directly. Hosts use of this information is bound by the principles and practices
				expressed here.</li>
				<li class="category">Please be aware that if you voluntarily disclose information online,
				personal or otherwise, that information can be collected and used by others. For example,
				using chat, bulletin boards, or your e-mail, if you post personal information online you
				may receive unsolicited messages from others. BellaOnline will have no means to
				control this. </li>
			</ul>

			<p class="subchannel">Controlling or Changing Your Information</p>

			<p class="category">You can access and update your personal information, including changing your
			subscriptions to our email newsletters, by going to the
			<a href="http://members.bellaonline.com">members.bellaonline.com</a> and following
			the instructions on that page.  There you can review, modify, or delete the personally identifiable
			information we maintain about you.  You can also opt in or out of receiving commercial communications
			from us or having your information shared with or sold to third parties.  While you can modify or
			delete the information that we maintain, we cannot modify or delete the information that has already
			been provided to a third party.  In addition, some personally identifiable information is required
			by the Terms of Use to maintain your Membership on BellaOnline.com.  If you delete that information,
			you may lose access to the Website.</p>

			<p class="subchannel">Cookies and Other Tracking Methods</p>

			<p class="category">We use cookies (see <a href="http://www.cookiecentral.com" target="_blank">cookiecentral.com</a>
			for complete information) or
			IP addresses for a number of uses, including allowing you to store your password without having
			to constantly re-enter it, helping us to tailor a Web site or a marketing message to better
			match your needs and interests, and allowing us to better understand how users use our site.
			You are always free to instruct your web browser to decline our cookies if it has the capability
			to do so, but some parts of our site may not work properly if you do.</p>

			<p class="subchannel">Other Sites</p>

			<p class="category">If you provide any information on your own or directly to parties who provide
			service to the Website (such as WhoWhere?), any merchants in our Store or any other sites you
			encounter on the Internet (even if these sites are branded with our branding), BellaOnline
			Website privacy policies to not apply to the use or disclosure of the personal information
			you disclose to them.</p>

			<p class="subchannel">Limits on Our Abilities</p>

			<p class="category">We cannot fully ensure that your private communications and other personally
			identifiable information will not be disclosed to third parties.  We may be forced to disclose
			information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, or third parties
			may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. If we need to
			investigate or resolve possible problems or inquiries, we can (and you authorize us to do so)
			disclose any information about you to private entities, law enforcement or other government
			officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate. </p>

			<p class="subchannel">Security</p>

			<p class="category">We use industry-standard efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of
			 your personal identifiable information, such as firewalls and Secure Socket Layers where
			 appropriate. However, "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet.</p>

			<p class="articletext">We hope this policy clarifies our procedures regarding your personal
			information. We at BellaOnline encourage you to learn as much as you can about your
			privacy on the Internet. To learn more, visit TRUSTe at: <a href="http://www.truste.org/" target="_blank">http://www.truste.org/</a>
