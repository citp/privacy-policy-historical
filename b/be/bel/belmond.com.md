 **3\. Use of personal data**

As a provider of luxury hospitality experiences worldwide, Belmond has a legitimate business interest in operating and improving its business and the services it offers. Belmond therefore uses and processes your personal data to:

  * help us create content that is relevant to our visitors;
  * make improvements to our websites and social media pages and ensure that content on these is presented in the most effective manner for you;
  * provide you with information, products or services that you request from us or which we feel may interest you;
  * facilitate bookings, payment and other administrative processes related to your stay or travel;
  * assess and help us understand general trends and patterns relating to our business;
  * provide for the safety and security of our guests and visitors;
  * manage general record keeping;
  * enable us to compile anonymous, aggregated statistics that allow us to understand how users use our websites and to help us improve the structure of our websites;
  * enable you to make reservations, buy Belmond gift cards and payments;
  * meet any legal and/or regulatory requirements;
  * provide the products or services you request from us including providing personalised services; and
  * improve our products and services and to ensure our products and services are of interest to you. 



Even where Belmond has a legitimate interest in processing your personal data, it will not do so to the extent that processing would override your interests, rights and freedoms to protect your personal data.

We may also use your personal data to protect against and prevent fraud, claims, and other liabilities and to comply with or enforce applicable legal requirements, industry standards, and our policies and terms. We use personal data for these purposes when it is necessary to protect, exercise or defend our legal rights, or when we are required to do so by applicable law.

In the situations set out below, we will only process your personal data when you have given us your specific consent and you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time (see Your rights below): 

  * marketing and profiling purposes which are managed solely by Belmond Management Limited as data controller for the Belmond Group. Your decision to provide your data for such purposes is optional and will have no consequence on your ability to stay with us or benefit from the requested services;
  * all purposes concerning your booking, your stay and to provide you with the services you have requested, which are managed by Belmond Management Limited and the Belmond property(ies) you visit as joint controllers. Your decision to provide personal data (including special category/sensitive personal data) to us is voluntary, however, if you do not provide such personal data you may no longer be able to benefit from our services. 



We may process your personal data by both automated and manual means. We may use your personal data in other ways for which we provide specific notice at the time of collection.

We may transfer to, and store the data we collect about you in, countries other than the country in which the data was originally collected, including the United States, Canada or other destinations outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”).

If you are located in the EEA, we will only transfer your personal data if:

  * the country to which the personal data will be transferred has been granted a European Commission adequacy decision;
  * the recipient of the personal data is located in the US and has certified to the US-EU Privacy Shield Framework; or
  * we have put in place appropriate safeguards in respect of the transfer, for example we have entered into EU standard contractual clauses with the recipient, or the recipient is a party to binding corporate rules.
