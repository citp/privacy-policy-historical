    <p>Each agency, in accordance with published rules, shall make available  for public inspection and copying all public records, unless the record falls  within the specific exemptions of the Public Records Act or other statute which  exempts or prohibits disclosure of specific information or records. To the  extent required to prevent an  unreasonable invasion of personal privacy interests protected by <a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=42.56.210">RCW 42.56.210</a> and <a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=42.56.320">42.56.320</a>, an agency shall  delete identifying details in a manner consistent with RCW 42.56.210 and RCW  42.56.320 when it makes available or publishes any public record; however, in  each case, the justification for the deletion shall be explained fully in  writing.</p>
