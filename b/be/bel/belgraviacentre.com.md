If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information).

Similarly, if we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.

**Who does Belgravia share my personal information with?**

We may disclose your personal information to the following categories of recipients:

• to our **group companies, third party services providers and partners** who provide data processing services to us (for example, to support the delivery of, provide functionality on, or help to enhance the security of our Website), or who otherwise process personal information for purposes that are described in this Privacy Policy or notified to you when we collect your personal information;  
• to **your healthcare providers** , for example if you ask us share information with your GP or surgeon;  
• to any **competent law enforcement body, regulatory, government agency, court or other third party** where we believe disclosure is necessary (i) as a matter of applicable law or regulation, (ii) to exercise, establish or defend our legal rights, or (iii) to protect your vital interests or those of any other person;  
• to an **actual or potential buyer** (and its agents and advisers) in connection with any actual or proposed purchase, merger or acquisition of any part of our business, provided that we inform the buyer it must use your personal information only for the purposes disclosed in this Privacy Policy; and  
• to any **other person with your consent** to the disclosure.

**Cookies and similar tracking technology**

We use cookies and similar tracking technology (collectively, “ **Cookies** ”) to collect and use personal information about you when you visit our Website. For further information about the types of Cookies we use, why, and how you can control Cookies, please see our Cookie Policy, available at https://www.belgraviacentre.com/cookie-policy/.

**How do we keep your personal information secure?**

We use appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect the personal information that we collect and process about you. The measures we use are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal data.

**Where do we store your personal information?**

The Belgravia Centre stores data on its own secure internal servers. We also use services hosted by third parties for the purpose of backup. These backup servers are currently located within the UK and the third parties have no access to your data other for backup and retrieval purposes.

Your personal information may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you are resident. These countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country (and, in some cases, may not be as protective).

When you pay via our portal, your transactions will be completed by one of our partners, such as Stripe or WorldPay. The Belgravia Centre will limit the use of your Personal Data by our partners, vendors and suppliers according to this Privacy Policy, contractual restrictions, and applicable law. When using a payment method through the third-party mechanism offered via the portal, the information you choose to share with that third-party will be treated in accordance to that third-party’s privacy policy.

However, we will endeavour to take appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Notice.

**How long do we keep your personal information?**

We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements).

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

**Your Rights**

We respect your right to control your data. If you wish to exercise any of your data protection rights, you can do so at any time by contacting us using the contact details provided under the “Contact” heading below. Your data protection rights include:

• If you wish to **access, correct, update or request deletion** of your personal information, you can do so at any time.  
• In addition, you can **object to processing o** f your personal information, ask us to **restrict processing** of your personal information or request **portability** of your personal information.  
• You have the right to **opt-out of marketing communications** we send you at any time. You can exercise this right by clicking on the “unsubscribe” or “opt-out” link in the marketing e-mails we send you. To opt-out of other forms of marketing (such as postal marketing or telemarketing), then please contact us.  
• Similarly, if we have collected and process your personal information with your consent, then you can **withdraw your consent** at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.  
• You have the **right to complain to a data protection authority** about our collection and use of your personal information. For more information, please contact the Information Commissioner’s Office.

We respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws. For more information on your individual rights, please see the website of the Information Commissioner’s Office (https://ico.org.uk/).

**Making a complaint**

We pride ourselves on customer service and want to exceed your expectations in everything we do. However, we know that there may be times when we do not meet our own high standards. When this happens, we want to hear about it, in order to deal with the situation as quickly as possible and put measures in place to stop it happening again.

We take complaints very seriously and we treat them as an opportunity to develop our approach. This is why we are always very grateful to hear from people who are willing to take the time to help us improve.

Our policy is:

• To provide a fair complaints procedure that is clear and easy to use for anyone wishing to make a complaint.  
• To publicise the existence of our complaints procedure so that people know how to contact us to make a complaint.  
• To make sure everyone in our organisation knows what to do if a complaint is received.  
• To make sure all complaints are investigated fairly and in a timely way.  
• To make sure that complaints are, wherever possible, resolved and that relationships are repaired.  
• To learn from complaints and feedback to help us to improve what we do.  
All complaint information will be handled sensitively, in line with relevant data protection requirements.
