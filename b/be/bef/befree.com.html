<p><b>STATEMENT OF RESPONSIBLE ONLINE MARKETING</b></p>
<p>Be Free's information usage practices are based on two beliefs: first, that protecting user privacy is essential to the growth and prosperity of the Internet; second, that a personalized web experience can provide significant benefits to Internet end users if done properly.  In accordance with these beliefs, Be Free has created partner marketing programs that bring businesses (Be Free's "<b>Customers</b>") and <b>Partners</b> (people or entities that promote goods and services for our Customers) together in revolutionary ways without compromising individual privacy.  We believe that our method of anonymous online profiling is the right way to provide a personalized web experience, and we have put in place a number of strict policies to ensure that user privacy is protected. This statement describes those policies.</p> 
<p><b>Be Free Is a Licensee of TRUSTe</b></p>
<p>This confirms that Be Free is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build users' trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. Because this web site wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe. By displaying the TRUSTe Trustmark, this web site has agreed to notify you of: </p>
<blockquote><p>What personally identifiable information of yours or third party personally identification is collected from you through the web site <br><br>
The organization collecting the information <br><br>
How the information is used <br><br>
With whom the information may be shared <br><br>
What choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution of the information <br><br>
The kind of security procedures that are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under Be Free's control <br><br>
How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information</p> </blockquote>
<p>If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact <a href="mailto:privacy@befree.com">privacy@befree.com</a>.  If your inquiry is not satisfactorily resolved, you should then contact TRUSTe at <a href="http://www.truste.org/users/users_watchdog_intro.html" target="_blank">http://www.truste.org/users/users_watchdog_intro.html</a>.  TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with Be Free to resolve your concerns.  TRUSTe can only cover the activities on <a href="/">www.befree.com</a>, and is not able to cover activities outside of this Be Free web site. </p> 
<p><b>Collection of Data About Internet End-Users</b></p>
<p>Be Free does not track the identity or contact information of end users.  Be Free's partner marketing and site marketing technologies collect and analyze anonymous Internet browsing and online purchase data to predict which promotions may be most interesting to Internet end users. When an Internet end user visits a web site employing Be Free's technology, Be Free sends a cookie to assign an anonymous, unique identifier to the end user's Internet browser.  Cookies are small data files commonly used on the Internet to help identify repeat visitors to web sites.  Only Be Free has access to the anonymous identifier assigned to an end users browser. Be Free then uses Internet browsing and online purchase data associated with the anonymous identifier to develop a predictive statistical user profile of the end user's needs and interests.  Be Free does not collect end users' names, physical addresses, e-mail addresses, phone numbers, credit card numbers, social security numbers, or any other information which can be used to identify a specific person, nor does it match such information with the anonymous profiles.  Be Free's technology records IP addresses, but does not associate any IP address with an organization name. </p>
<p>For improved audience targeting, Be Free's web site marketing technology allows Customers to add non-personally-identifying demographic information, such as age, gender, area code, or ZIP code, to the non-identifiable profile data.  Thus, there is no direct connection between an end user's online choices and his or her personal identity. </p>  
<p><b>Uses and Disclosures of Data</b></p>
<p>Be Free does not sell or rent individually-identifiable end user or Partner data, and discloses such information only as provided in this policy.  Be Free uses end user profile data to present targeted offers or content to visitors of Customer sites that use the Be Free site marketing technology.  Be Free provides this information only in the form of specific recommendations based on aggregate profile data.  At no point in this process does Be Free give profile data to the Customer, nor does it provide the recommendation to the Customer in any form , which could be combined with existing personal information that the Customer possesses.  Be Free may also use anonymous end user data to create and disclose aggregate reports which reflect the collective browsing and purchasing activities of groups of anonymous end users, and if applicable to detect suspect activity.</p>
<p>Customers may receive reports showing the aggregate number of times a particular promotion is displayed on end users' browsers and the volume of purchases resulting from such promotions, or the browsing activity of certain demographic segments selected by a particular Customer. </p>
<p>At present, all information processing occurs in the United States.</p>
<p><b>Access and Opt Out</b></p>
<p>Be Free empowers end users to access and modify their anonymous profile data through a Profile Control Panel.</p>  
<p>This control panel can be found at <a href="http://www.yourcontrolpanel.com/mypage/pcp.html" target="_blank">http://www.yourcontrolpanel.com/mypage/pcp.html</a>.  The panel displays the web site and web page information incorporated into an end user's targeted recommendations.  The Profile Control Panel allows users to remove individual records that they do not wish to have associated with their profile, remove all of the records in the profile, or opt out of personalization entirely.  Be Free provides access to this panel on its own web site, and requires that its site marketing Customers also provide clear access to the Profile Control Panel.</p>
<p><b>Partner Privacy</b></p>
<p>Because Be Free serves as the data interchange between Partners and Customers, it necessarily has access to a great deal of information about Partners, including contact information and the performance data for their marketing and promotional programs.  To ensure the privacy of Partners, Be Free maintains the following policies: </p>
<p>Be Free shares neither personally identifiable information about a Partner nor information about a Partner's performance with any parties except to the Partner to whom the information pertains, to the Customer with whom that Partner is affiliated, or to others as directed by the Partner or the Customer with whom the Partner is affiliated. While Be Free does record such information in the application process and retains it in order to serve its Customers through processes such as reporting and payments to Partners, Customers' use of Partner data is governed by the Customers' affiliation agreements with their Partners.  For some Customers, Be Free works with third party service providers to analyze Partner information on the Customer's behalf and for the Customer's use and benefit.  Such service providers may have access to certain Partner information maintained by Be Free in the course of providing its services.   The use of this data is governed by the affiliation agreement between the Customer and the Partner.   Partners are always free to verify, alter, or delete the information recorded about them by updating their profiles through reporting.net, Be Free's Partner interface, or by contacting the administrators of the Customers' marketing programs.  Partners are encouraged to review all terms of the affiliation agreement before initiating the relationship.</p>
<p>In instances in which an individual has become affiliated with a Be Free Customer and has also visited sites employing the Be Free site marketing service, Be Free may possess personal information about an individual for whom it also has an anonymous user profile.  Be Free stores these data sets separately, and at no point will Be Free incorporate personal information about a Partner into a user profile without the explicit consent of the Partner.</p> 
<p><b>Security Measures</b></p>
<p>Be Free employs industry standard security measures to ensure the security of all data.  Be Free data processing occurs in facilities that employ multiple safeguards to protect system data.  All Customer and Partner data is protected through case-sensitive, alphanumeric passwords. These passwords are stored on an encrypted database.  Access to these passwords is limited to the Customers and Partners that created the accounts, and to designated Be Free employees who require system level access in order to perform their jobs. Access to anonymous user profile data is limited to designated Be Free employees who require such access in order to perform their jobs.  Be Free routinely evaluates its data security practices to identify security threats or opportunities for improvement.</p>

<p><b>Customer and Partner Web Sites</b></p>
<p>While Be Free encourages Customers and Partners to adopt responsible approaches to online marketing, Be Free is not responsible for the information practices of Customers or their Partners or for the manner in which they use Be Free's services.  Customers and Partners may collect information from or about Internet users, including personal information.  The collection, use, and disclosure of information by Customers and Partners are subject to their respective privacy policies.  Customers' and  Partners' privacy policies may differ from Be Free's policy. Customers employing Be Free's site marketing services are required to provide access on their site to the Be Free hosted Profile Control Panel.</p>
<p><b>Be Free's Web Site</b></p>
<p>Personal information gathered through Be Free's web site www.befree.com is used only for the purposes stated on the web site and is not normally shared with third parties.  All personally identifying information gathered through the Be Free web site is provided entirely on a voluntary basis, and resulting communications continue only so long as the outside party so desires.  The "Customers" contact information form and the "Stay in Touch" form allow interested parties to request more information about Be Free, and we use the contact information from those forms to reach these interested parties.  The site provides a number of e-mail addresses on the and on the "Products and Services" page and the "Contact Us" page (Sales, Careers, etc.).  These e-mail addresses are provided so that visitors can send their inquiries directly to the people at Be Free best equipped to handle their questions. Be Free endeavors to respond to such inquiries as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Be Free employs cookies to observe the online behavior of anonymous visitors to <a href="/">http://www.befree.com</a>.  Cookies are small data files that are stored on the browser of a web site visitor.  Be Free uses these observations to help optimize and personalize the Internet end user experience and help Customers manage and measure their promotions.  Information derived from these cookies is not tied to personal information submitted on the site, nor is it shared with any third parties. You may access the information tied to your cookie at <a href="http://www.yourcontrolpanel.com" target="_blank">www.yourcontrolpanel.com</a>.  At this site you may also alter the information in your anonymous profile or opt out of personalization altogether, which will prevent Be Free from maintaining a profile for you.</p>  
<p>We also employ a software technology called Clear GIFs (or "web beacons" or "web bugs") that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective.  Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web visitors.  Clear GIFs are invisible on the page and are much smaller, about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.  The Clear GIFs used by Be Free are not  tied to any personally identifiable information about web site visitors. </p>
<p><b>E-mail</b></p>
<p>Be Free will never intentionally send unsolicited e-mail messages often referred to as "spam".  Be Free educates and encourages its Customers to uphold the same standards.  Be Free believes that successful online marketing is created by understanding buyers and their interests, not by using mass e-mail programs that bother large numbers of uninterested parties.  Consequently, Be Free has developed the following policies against the practice of spam:</p>
<blockquote><p>All e-mail sent by Be Free on behalf of our Customers must have an enclosed opt-out. <br><br>
Partner and Customer recruiting activities using e-mail messaging rely upon opt-in methods. <br><br>
Be Free advises its Customers that spam is both inappropriate and ineffective. <br><br>
Be Free recommends to all of its Customers that Partners found to be sending spam be removed immediately from their marketing programs. <br><br>
Recipients of any Be Free newsletter may opt-out of that newsletter at any time by responding to the mailing.</p></blockquote> 
<p>Questions or concerns regarding Be Free's policies on spam and e-mail should be sent to <a href="mailto:Abuse@befree.com">Abuse@befree.com</a>.</p>
<p><b>Third Party Disclosures</b></p>
<p>Be Free relies on various third parties in the operation of its business.  Accordingly, Be Free shares information with its contractors and service providers (such as providers of technical services, attorneys, and auditors) as needed for them to provide services to Be Free.  Information may be transferred as part of a corporate transaction (such as a merger, acquisition, or insolvency proceeding) involving Be Free's assets or businesses.  Information may also be disclosed as Be Free determines it to be necessary to comply with any applicable law, regulation, or court order, as required in connection with a third party dispute resolution proceeding, to protect the legal rights of Be Free or others, or to prevent injury or harm to persons or property.  </p>
<p><b>Changes to this Statement</b></p>
<p>Changing business needs, technologies, and governmental requirements may make it necessary for Be Free to update this Privacy Policy from time to time.  Any material changes will be posted prominently on this site.  Except as otherwise required by law, modifications to this Privacy Policy will not affect the privacy of data collected by Be Free prior to the effective date of the policy change. </p>
