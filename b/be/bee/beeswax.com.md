# Beeswax Privacy Policy

Updated: May 1, 2016

##### What is Beeswax

Beeswax is an advertising technology platform headquartered in New York City. We are providing this privacy policy to inform you about how our technology platform processes information on behalf of online advertisers, website owners, data providers and other businesses that use our technology and services.

If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please feel free to contact us at [privacy@beeswax.com](mailto:privacy@beeswax.com). 

Beeswax runs a technology buying platform for digital media. The Beeswax technology allows our customers to buy ad space on websites, mobile apps, video players, and other devices and allows for the use of proprietary and third party data in the purchase of that ad space. When ad space is bought or sold our technology fulfills the transaction by delivering the ad to Internet users who visit that site, apps, or device. Generally, an Internet user's computer or mobile device comes into contact with Beeswax technology when a user views an ad delivered by our technology or clicks or taps on the ad to visit the advertiser's website or app.

##### Privacy practices for our technology

Advertising supports free content and digital user experiences that we all love. Our goal is to make advertising more effective by helping to display ads that may be of interest to you. We believe that relevant ads are more valuable to users than less relevant ads. More relevancy also helps the services that depend on advertising because advertisers pay more for effective ads which in turn leads to higher quality and richer consumer experiences.

##### What information we collect

The Beeswax technology collects Non-Personally Identifiable Information ("Non-PII") to help target online advertising to you based on your interests. This includes, but is not limited to, your IP host address, your browser type (e.g. Chrome or Firefox), the date and time of the ad request, pages viewed, your operating system (e.g. Macintosh, Windows, Android, OSX), the URL or App you are using, and your Internet Service Provider (e.g. Verizon or Comcast). Please note that in some jurisdictions IP Address may be considered PII. We take steps to obscure the information collected from those jurisdictions so that it is no longer personally identifiable. We may also collect Non-PII from clients or other third parties.

To provide relevant ads to users on mobile devices we may also collect the following mobile specific information: device type, make and model, operating system, mobile advertising identifiers, operating system device identifier (For example, IDFA for iOS and Android ID for Android) and information about the apps you use. We may also use the GPS location of your device if you have opted-in to provide it to one of Beeswax's publisher partners as described below under "Location Tracking".

##### The technology we use

We use the standard "cookies" feature of major browser applications. Cookies are text files that are stored on your computer and we use them to determine how often you've visited a website or seen an ad by assigning an anonymous identifier to your browser. We do not use cookies to access any other data on your computer.

We also use pixel tags, which are small, invisible 1x1 images on a web page. Pixel tags allow the web page or a third party who serves the pixel tag to set, read and modify cookies. Our pixel tag allows Beeswax cookies to be set, read, and modified when you visit the websites or apps of our partners.

##### Opting out of cookies

Please click [here](http://optout.prod.bidr.io/optout) if you'd like to opt-out from having Beeswax collect your Non-PII in connection with our technology.

When you opt out, we will place an opt-out cookie on your computer. This cookie tells us not to collect your Non-PII to tailor our online advertising campaigns. Please note that if you block, delete or restrict cookies in any way, or if you use a different computer or Internet browser, you may need to renew your opt-out choice.

Beeswax adheres to the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising and the Application of Self-Regulatory Principles to the Mobile Environment published by the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA). We honor the DAA’s opt-out mechanism for data collection and use in connection with mobile applications. To learn more about the DAA and your choices, please visit [www.aboutads.info/choices](http://www.aboutads.info/choices).

##### Mobile Tracking

Your iOS mobile device may provide a “Limit Ad Tracking” setting. On Android devices, your settings may allow you to “Opt out of Interest-Based Ads.” When you have opted out using this setting on a device and that information is passed to Beeswax, Beeswax will not use Non-PII data to target ads to you or place you in segments for future marketing.

##### Location Tracking

Beeswax may receive precise location data (e.g. latitude and longitude) from publishers or exchanges for use in determining which ads to display. We use such data for targeting ads and evaluating their success, and may share it with other parties for similar uses. This precise location data is maintained in our logs in accordance with our data retention policy (below).

##### Information Sharing

Beeswax may share individual-level Non-PII information with customers in connection with the offering of our Services. For example, a Beeswax customer may receive a log of all ads they served through our platform, including anonymous cookie IDs, IP Addresses, and other Non-PII data in non-aggregated form.

##### Data Retention

Aggregated data, such as the results of campaigns or the amount spent on different inventory sources, may be retained indefinitely. Non-aggregated data, such as logs of auctions or bids, which may contain Non-PII data, is never retained for more than 13 months.

##### Changes To Our Policy

We may revise this policy at any time. Any changes and/or updates to the policy will be updated directly on this page. We encourage you to visit this page periodically to review our privacy policy so that you will always know what information we gather and how we may use that information.
