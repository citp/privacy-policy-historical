# Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy was last updated on October 26th, 2018. If you want an easier to digest format, read our [Data Promise](https://web.archive.org/data-promise "Data Promise") instead.

This website (the “Site”) is operated by Beeketing, Inc. (“Beeketing”, “we”, “us” and/or “our”) and has been created to provide our Site visitors (“you”, “your”) with information about our company and our e-mail collection tools. This Privacy Policy (this “Policy”) sets forth Beeketing’s policy with respect to information, including personally identifiable data (such personally identifiable data “Personal Information”), that is collected from you through the Site or through our other service offerings (collectively, including the Site, the “Services”). Certain Services may be made available to you on websites owned by our end customers (each, an “End Customers”), and the information collected via these embedded widgets (“Tools”) is directed to Beeketing and governed by this Policy.

The Services and our business may change from time to time. As a result, at times it may be necessary for Beeketing to make changes to this Policy. Beeketing reserves the right to update this Policy at any time and from time to time without prior notice. Please review this Policy periodically, and especially before you provide any Personal Information. This Policy was last updated on the date indicated above. Your continued use of the Services after any changes or revisions to this Policy shall indicate your agreement with the terms of such revised Policy.

1\. Information Collected

When you interact with us through the Site or other Services, we may collect Personal Information and other information from you, as further described below:

Personal Information That You Provide

We collect Personal Information from you when you voluntarily provide such information, such as when you contact us with inquiries, subscribe to our or a Beeketing End Customer’s e-mail newsletter, register for access to the Services or use certain Services. For instance, Beeketing may collect the following information about you: name, address, zip code, telephone number and e-mail address. The information collected may vary. For example, our End Customers may customize the data that is requested via the Tools and may collect other information, such as your favorite color or birthdate. Wherever Beeketing collects Personal Information we make an effort to provide a link to this Policy.

By voluntarily providing us with Personal Information, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this Policy. If you provide Personal Information to the Site or through the other Services, you acknowledge, agree, and expressly consent that such Personal Information may be transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of Beeketing and the authorized third parties referred to herein located in the United States.

Other Information

Non-Identifiable Data: When you interact with Beeketing through the Services, we receive and store certain personally non-identifiable information. Such information, which is collected passively using various technologies, cannot presently be used to specifically identify you, unless it is combined with Personal Information. Beeketing may store such information itself or such information may be included in databases owned and maintained by Beeketing affiliates, agents or service providers. We may use such information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, and the domain names of our visitors' Internet service providers. It is important to note that Beeketing uses no Personal Information in this process.

Cookies: In providing the Services, we may use a technology called “cookies.” A cookie is a piece of information that the computer that hosts our Site gives to your browser when you access the Site or the Tools. Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the Services and help us analyze the Services usage more accurately. Certain information collected through the use of cookies may be used to serve you more relevant online advertisements by us or third parties. We may, or a third party may, place and recognize a unique cookie on your browser specifically to identify you for the purposes of providing you with customized ads or content across channels. The cookies may be linked to data you voluntarily submit to us, e.g., your email address, which we may share with a third party. If we share such Personal Information it will be in hashed, non-human readable form for security purposes only. If you'd like to opt-out of such collection and use of data, please go to the Digital Advertising Alliance’s consumer opt-out page here: www.aboutads.info/choices or the Network Advertising Initiative’s opt-out mechanism here: http://networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp. For the avoidance of doubt, except with respect to EU Data, we may share with third parties data collected from your use of websites of End Customers with third parties and such third parties might use that data, together with data collected by such third parties from other sources to cause advertisements to be targeted to you. Such data typically includes the URL you are on. As used herein, “EU Data” means data of data subjects located in the European Economic Area (including the United Kingdom as of the Effective Date of this Privacy Policy).

In addition, you can generally inform the web services with which our Services integrate (such as social buttons, widgets, and other embedded features or content) that you do not want certain information about your webpage visits to be collected. Enabling “Do Not Track” in your web browser settings is an easy way to accomplish this. The “Do Not Track” browser setting is supported by recent versions of major browsers, including Firefox 5+, Internet Explorer 9+, Safari 5.1+, and Google Chrome. Please consult http://donottrack.us on how to enable this privacy setting on your browser. You can also change the way your browser handles cookies. Already existing cookies can be deleted. Please consult www.allaboutcookies.org on how to manage or delete cookies in your browser. This Policy covers the use of cookies and similar files by Beeketing only and does not cover the use of cookies, flash cookies, and similar files by any third-party advertisers or websites linked to the Site. We also may use Google Analytics and other similar services. Google Analytics uses cookies to help analyze how users use the Site. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the Site (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google, Inc. (“Google”). Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the Site, compiling reports on website activity for website operators and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google’s behalf. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google.

Aggregated Personal Information: In an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of the Services, Beeketing often conducts research on its customer demographics, interests and behavior based on the Personal Information and other information provided to us. This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis, and Beeketing may share this aggregate data with its affiliates, agents and business partners. This aggregate information does not identify you personally. Beeketing may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.

2\. Use of Information

Beeketing uses the Personal Information you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Policy. If you provide Personal Information for a certain reason, we may use the Personal Information in connection with the reason for which it was provided.

In addition to the foregoing purposes, we and our affiliates may use your information to: (a) improve the content and functionality of the Services; (b) better understand our users; (c) improve our marketing and promotional efforts and customize the Services content, layout, and Services to better suit your needs; and (c) resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our Service Terms (as defined below).

If we do so, each communication we send you will contain instructions permitting you to “opt-out” of receiving future communications. In addition, if at any time you wish not to receive any future communications or you wish to have your name deleted from our mailing lists, please contact us as indicated.
