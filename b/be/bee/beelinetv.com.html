<h2>BROWSING</h2>
<p>
When you browse the Beeline Software Express websites, you are able to
do so anonymously. Generally, no personal information is collected
when you browse. However your browser
does automatically give us information about your system, such as the
preferred browser language, the type of computer- and operating system
you are using and your IP number. An IP number is similar to a
telephone number or street address; it is identifiable information
that is automatically captured by computers when communication links
are made over the Internet.
</p>
<p>
Like many other websites, the Beeline Software Express websites use the
so called “cookie” technology. A cookie is a temporary and unique
identifier that a web server places on your computer: a small data-file
that can be used to retrieve records from our
databases, show webpages using personal preferences and help us to 
study traffic patterns on our sites.
The cookies we use do not store any private information about you.
</p>
<p>
The Beeline Software Express websites contain links to other websites.
Beeline Software Express does not share any information about you with
those websites and is not responsible for their privacy practices.
</p>
<h2>ADVERTISEMENTS</h2>

<p>
Most ads appearing on the Beeline Software Express websites are
delivered to you by third-party advertisers. These advertisers also
automatically collect browser information. In the course of serving
advertisements to the Beeline Software Express websites, third-party
advertisers may place or recognise their own unique cookie. Beeline
Software Express does not share any information about you with these
third-party advertisers.
</p>

<h2>PURCHASES</h2>

<p>To make purchases on the Beeline Software Express websites, you must
use an SSL-enabled browser such as Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari,
Chrome or Opera. This protects the confidentiality of your
personal information while it is transmitted over the
Internet.</p>

<h2>PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>

<p>Personal information collected from customers or from subscribers
to free services on the Beeline Software Express websites will always
remain confidential. Beeline Software Express will not sell, lease, or
trade this information with any other party. Beeline Software Express
safeguards the security of your personal information with physical,
electronic, and managerial procedures. However, at times we may be
required by law or legal process to disclose collected information.
</p>
<p>
Beeline Software Express works with other companies to provide
products and services to you, and thus may provide some personal
information to these companies. For example, a shipping company may
receive your address information so that they can deliver the ordered
products. Beeline Software Express requires that these companies
safeguard your personal information in accordance with Beeline
Software Express's own privacy policies.
