Its purpose is to protect the "rights and freedoms" of individuals and to ensure that personal data are not processed without their knowledge and, where possible, processed with their consent.

 **Scope**

Material scope (GDPR Article 2) - this Regulation applies to the processing of personal data wholly or in part by automatic means and to the processing of personal data (for example, manually and on paper) by other means, which are part of a personal data record or which are intended to form part of a personal data record.

Territorial scope (GDPR Article 3) - The rules of the GDPR will apply to all data controllers established in the EU who process personal data of individuals in the context of their activities. It will also apply to non-EU administrators who process personal data in order to offer goods and services or observe the behavior of data subjects who are resident in the EU.

 _Personal data be processed lawfully, in good faith and transparently_

Lawfulness - Identify a legal basis before it can process personal data. They are often referred to as "grounds for processing", such as "consent".

Fairness - in order for the processing to be in good faith, the data controller must provide certain information to the data subjects as far as is practicable. This applies irrespective of whether personal data is obtained directly from data subjects or from other sources.

Regulation (EU) 2016/679 increases the requirements for what information should be available to data subjects that are covered by the "transparency" requirement.

Transparency - The GDPR includes rules on the provision of confidential information to data subjects in Articles 12, 13 and 14 of the GDPR. They are detailed and specific, emphasizing that privacy notices are understandable and accessible. Information must be communicated to the data subject in comprehensible form using clear and comprehensible language.

 _Personal data may only be collected for specific, explicit and legitimate purposes_

Data obtained for specific purposes should not be used for a purpose that differs from those officially announced to the supervisory body as part of the BeeCanvas Data Processing (Article 30 GDPR).

 _Personal data must be adequate, relevant, limited to what is necessary for their processing for the purpose. (principle of minimum necessary)_

  * Data Protection Officer (DPO) is responsible for ensuring that BeeCanvas does not collect information that is not strictly necessary for the purpose for which it was received. 


  * The Data Protection Officer (DPO) will ensure that on an annual basis all data collection methods are reviewed by (internal audit / external experts) to ensure that the collected data continues to be adequate , relevant, are not excessive.

  * Employees / employees (clients / others) should be required to notify BeeCanvas of any change in circumstances in order to update the records of personal data. Instructions and rules for updating the records are contained (here). The responsibility of BeeCanvas is to ensure that any change of circumstances notification is recorded and action is taken. 


  * The Data Protection Officer is responsible for ensuring that appropriate procedures and policies are in place to maintain the accuracy and timeliness of personal data, taking into account the volume of data collected, the speed at which it can change, other relevant factors . 


  * At least annually, the Data Protection Officer will review the storage times of all personal data handled by BeeCanvas, referring to the inventory of the data and will identify all data that are no longer required in the context of the registered objective. These data will be reliably destroyed in accordance with the administrator's procedures and rules. 


  * The Data Protection Officer (DPO) is responsible for complying with data r requests within one month, which can be extended by a further two months If the BeeCanvas decides not to comply with the request, the Data Protection Officer must respond to the data subject in order to explain his / her reasons and to inform him / her of the right to complain and the supervisory authority and to seek redress. 


  * The Data Protection Officer is responsible for taking appropriate measures in cases where third party organizations have inaccurate or outdated personal data to inform them that the information is inaccurate or obsolete and is not used to make decisions about individuals to inform the parties concerned; and to forward any correction of personal data to third countries where necessary.

  * When personal data is retained after the processing date, it will be stored appropriately (minimized, encrypted, aliased) to protect the identity of the data subject in case of data breaches. 



_Personal data are processed in a way that ensures appropriate security (Article 24, Article 32 of the GDPR)_

The Data Protection Officer will carry out an impact assessment (risk assessment) taking into account all circumstances related to data management or processing operations by BeeCanvas.

In determining the suitability of the processing, the Data Protection Officer should also examine the extent of any damage or loss that may be caused to individuals (eg staff or customers) if a security breach occurs, as is the case and any likely damage to the reputation of the controller, including a possible loss of customer confidence.

Regulation (EU) 2016/679 includes provisions that promote accountability and manageability and complement transparency requirements. The principle of accountability in Art. 5, par. 2 requires the controller to prove that he adheres to the other principles in the GDPR and explicitly states that this is his responsibility.

 **Rights of data subjects**

Data subjects have the following rights in respect of the processing of data and the data recorded for them:

4\. Paper-based records should not be left where they can be accessed by unauthorized persons and cannot be removed from the designated office premises without explicit permission.
