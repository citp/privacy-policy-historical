The Site is a web-based property of BeenVerified, Inc. ("BeenVerified," "we," “our,” or "us") that enables end-user visitors to the Site (“Visitors”) to conduct searches of our databases of publicly available sources of information about individuals. This Privacy Policy describes the ways in which BeenVerified collects, uses, and discloses information about you when you access the Site. By accessing, viewing, downloading, or otherwise using the Site, you consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy, now and as amended or modified by us.

###  Information Collected by BeenVerified 

BeenVerified is a database of publicly available sources of information aggregated for your convenience. Through BeenVerified, Visitors can access certain materials posted to or made available through the Site as compiled, distributed, and displayed by BeenVerified and other third-party content providers (“Third-Party Providers”) including, but not limited to, third-party websites or services that provide information about individuals (each, a “Search Subject”) that can be searched for and accessed through the Site (“BeenVerified Checks”).

As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data. We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you. We do this [to improve services we offer you, to improve marketing, analytics, or site functionality.

Cookies enhance your experience at the Site, and are in many instances necessary for the provision of Member Services. For example, we use Cookies to store your password so you don’t have to enter it more than once, and to recognize you if you return to the Site using the same web browser.
