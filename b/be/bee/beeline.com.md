This policy expresses Beeline's commitment to maintain the privacy of personal information that is shared with us, outlines what types of personally identifiable information Beeline receives, and summarizes what we do with this personal information.

**Sources of Personal Information**

Beeline is a provider of workforce optimization solutions, which include the processing of recruitment, human resources, contingent worker and contractor information for customers and their suppliers of recruiting, staffing and consulting services. Beeline has our own dedicated staff of employees and maintains personal information on our internal candidates, employees and contractors as well. 

**Customer Information:** Beeline receives personal information of the current and former candidates, employees, contractors and contingent workers of or on behalf of our customers for processing on behalf of each such customer.

**Supplier Information:** Beeline receives personal information of the current and former candidates, employees, contractors and contingent workers of or on behalf of suppliers of recruiting, staffing and consulting services who contract with us for processing such information on behalf of each such supplier and its customers.

**Internal Information:** Beeline receives personal information of its own internal current and former candidates, employees, contractors and contingent workers. Beeline also collects personal information voluntarily shared by persons through email correspondence or responses to inquiries on our website.

**Uses of Personal Information**

Beeline uses personal information supplied to us solely for legitimate business purposes and to perform information processing services for which we have been contracted by our customers and their suppliers of recruiting, staffing and consulting services. Beeline uses personal information for such purposes as collecting and sorting resumes for position fulfillment, scheduling of interviews, payroll and benefits processing, evaluation and assessment, recordkeeping, invoicing and payment for our customers, their suppliers of recruiting, staffing and consulting services, and for ourselves.

Beeline shares personal information supplied by our customers and suppliers of recruiting, staffing and consulting services, only for the purpose of the information processing services for which we were contracted.

Alternatively, Beeline may share payroll information as applicable to the customer using staffing services and to the supplier of such services for billing and payroll purposes. Beeline will otherwise maintain as confidential and not use or share personal information of individuals submitted by customers and suppliers of recruiting, staffing and consulting services, with which we contract. Beeline retains personal information of individuals submitted by customers and suppliers of recruiting, staffing and consulting services with which we contract, so long as such controlling party directs.

Beeline shares personal information received on our internal candidates, employees, contractors and contingent workers, or from responses to inquiries on our website relating to Beeline's internal business, only with our affiliated companies for legitimate business purposes, and we retain such personal information only for so long as necessary by law or for our legitimate business purpose.

Beeline will share personal information as required by law or regulation, or in cooperation with law enforcement investigations, civil or criminal subpoenas, or when required by court orders.

Beeline will not sell personal information to mailing lists or share personal information to those who would use it for marketing purposes.

**Security of Personal Information**

Beeline employs physical, technical and operational security measures to protect against the loss, misuse, disclosure or alteration of personal information submitted to us. We are committed to keeping your personal information private and will continue to take steps to back up this commitment.
