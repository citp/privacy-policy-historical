**1\. Information We Collect**

We do not collect or store any of your instant message ("IM") account information, such as your user name and password, messages, or contact lists, except that we temporarily store your instant messages solely in order to complete the instant message communication (for example, in response to a dropped call); however after the communication is complete the instant message is deleted from the BeeJive system. We also collect the following information: 

a. User Provided Information.

Any graphics, text, files, or any other content submitted, transmitted, or uploaded, via Internet or mobile communications, to the public areas of the Website by Users ("User Submissions"), or such material that You make accessible to others directly, becomes published and are not considered Personally Identifiable Information. Be aware that if your User Submissions includes personal information, such as your name, email address, etc., other Users will have access to it and it will not be protected Personally Identifiable Information.
