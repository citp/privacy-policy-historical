We won’t be able to control a user’s privacy on another site. We cannot also be held liable/accountable for any loss/damage occurring as a result of activity on another website.

**Affiliates**

Beebom uses Amazon associates program for promoting products from Amazon through affiliate links. Whenever a user buys a product from those links, we earn commission. However, we only recommend relevant products that have high ratings and positive reviews.

Starting September 2015, Beebom has started using VigLink’s affiliate program which converts external links to affiliate links. Whenever a user makes purchase using such link, we earn a small compensation. However, very much like the case of Amazon associates, we only recommend relevant and useful products for readers.
