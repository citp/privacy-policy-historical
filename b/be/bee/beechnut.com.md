**Customer Information**  
  |    
We may require you to supply us with personal information during a registration process online prior to using certain features of our site (for example, prior to entering an online sweepstakes or receiving e-mail communications). If you choose to withhold personal data requested by us, it may not be possible for you to gain access to certain parts of the site or for us to respond to your query. We may also use the information provided in statistical form to understand our site’s demographics, such as percentage of male and female users, geographic location, age ranges, or a combination of these or other demographics. As detailed below, we will not share specific information about you to advertisers or third parties without your consent.

We may perform statistical analyses of aggregate (group) user behavior. This allows us to measure relative consumer interest in the various areas of our web site for product development purposes. Any information we collect is used for our own internal purposes to improve the content of the web site to enhance users’ experiences when visiting our site, to customize the content and/or layout of our pages, and to provide the services required by an individual user. We do not use personally identifiable information for any reason that is not disclosed either in this Policy or at the time the information is requested. Beech Nut processes personal data for specific and limited purposes, which we inform you about when we ask you for information. For example, we may collect and use personal data to provide you with products or services, to market products and services which we think may be of interest to you, or to communicate with you for other purposes. Beech Nut keeps your data only for as long as is reasonably needed for such purposes and in accordance with any applicable legal or ethical reporting or documentation retention requirements. Aside from an automatic reply to an e-mail received by us, it is our intent not to e-mail to you unless you request a particular service, or consent to being contacted by e-mail. There may be instances where you will have the opportunity to subscribe to an e-mail list that will send information about the site or our advertisers to your e-mail address, but after an initial mailing gauging your interest this will be continued only with your permission and consent.

We will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to 1) confirm to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process serviced on Beech Nut or the site, 2) protect and defend the rights or property of Beech Nut or its web site, and 3) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of Beech Nut’s web site or the public.

We will provide the parent with (a) notice of the specific types of personal data being collected from the minor, and (b) the opportunity to object to any further collection, use, or storage of such information, Beech Nut abides by laws designed to protect children.
