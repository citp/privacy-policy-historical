We provide you with this Privacy Policy because we want you to know how we may collect, use, share and keep information about you, and the choices that are available to you.

 **When Does this Privacy Policy Apply?**

This Privacy Policy applies whenever we collect personal information from or about you when you access or use any of our websites, applications, content, streaming services, products, goods, equipment, services, promotions, software, technology and any other materials (collectively, “ **Beachbody Services** ”), or when you contact us in any manner.

 **What Information Is Collected From You Through Beachbody Services?**

The information we receive from you helps us personalize and continually improve our business. Here are the general types of personal information (and sensitive personal information) we (and certain third parties) may gather:

If you sign up as a Team Beachbody Coach, we may also collect your social security/social insurance or other similar identification number and bank account information in order to remit any commission payments you may have earned. If you apply to join our Affiliate Program, we may also collect information about your business, such as your (or your organization's) name, e-mail address, street address, telephone number, tax identification number, and information about your website (e.g., the URL, the number of unique users and page views, the demographics of your user base, etc.). To help track your workout activity, Beachbody may send and receive data to and from Apple’s Healthkit Application if you enabled this feature.



We may also collect other types of information that you provide to us to help you achieve your health and wellness goals, such as your:

  * _general feedback_ (e.g., content you post on our message boards, or information you submit about our products, goods or services). 



**_Information We Automatically Receive_** : We automatically receive and store certain technical information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many other websites, we use “cookies” to enhance your experience on our websites as described below, which allows us to obtain certain information when your web browser accesses any of our websites. 

**_Examples of Information We Automatically Receive_** : This includes without limitation your Internet protocol (IP) address (the number used to identify your computer or modem to the Internet, which can potentially identify your location and Internet Service Provider), browser or device type, version and time zone setting, operating system and platform; information about your activities on our websites, including the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) from which you came to our websites and the URLs that you visited on our websites; cookie identifier; products you viewed or searched for; the phone number you used to call us; pixel tag data as described below; and purchase history. During some visits to our websites, we may use software tools such as JavaScript to measure and collect session information, including page response times, download errors, length of visits to certain pages, page interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs), and methods used to browse away from the page. We may also collect technical information to help us identify your device for fraud prevention and diagnostic purposes.

  *  ** _Mobile and Connected Device Information_** : When you download, install or use our applications through mobile or connected devices, we may receive information about your device and may access your camera, microphone, or other device services or hardware. Some devices may allow you to opt-out of this collection or access, and in those cases, you may be able to subsequently stop the collection or access. Please review your device settings for more information. 
  * **_Examples of Mobile Information_** : This includes without limitation unique identifiers for your device, device and usage information, precise geolocation information (if you enabled this feature), carrier provider, and the types of mobile devices and operating systems accessing the application.
  *  ** _Information We Obtain From Other Sources_** : We may receive information about you from other sources, including from third party vendors, services and commercially available sources (such as data aggregators and public databases). We may also collect information that you publicly post on our social media pages, such as our Facebook®, Instagram®, and Twitter® pages. In addition, we may combine information you give us with other information from Beachbody sources, communications and transactions. Where permitted by law, we combine this information received from other sources, including from social media websites, with information you give us and information that we collect automatically about you.
  *  ** _Examples of Information We Obtain From Other Sources:_** This includes without limitation, information that you provide to our vendors; updated credit card number and expiration dates from your bank or credit card company which we use to keep our records current and service you better; updated delivery and address information from our carriers or other third parties which we use to keep our records current, process orders, deliver your next purchase, and service you better; account information which we use to validate access to your accounts with us; transactional data from third party purchases; demographic and profile data; social media posts, such as your likes, interests, feedback, preferences, pictures, comments, suggestions, opinions, and complaints; information we may receive from your Team Beachbody Coach (if applicable); information that you provide through our e-mail and text message campaigns; information about products or services purchased from other companies. 



**How Does Beachbody Use the Information It Collects?**

 ** _Apple HealthKit Data_** : Beachbody will not use or share health data collected through Apple HealthKit for marketing purposes.

 **What About Cookies, Pixel Tags and Third Party Tracking Tools?**

  *  ** _Cookies_** **:** Like almost every company, Beachbody and others use a technology commonly known as a "cookie", which is a small data file our server places on your computer or mobile device to recognize your device and provide personalized features and advertisements. Cookies are widely used by website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information. Through cookies, we are able to collect information that we use to improve our websites and mobile applications, improve your overall experience on them, and personalize your experiences and advertisements. For example, through cookies, we can keep count of return visits to our website or our advertisers' or partners' websites, collect and report on aggregate statistical information, authenticate your login credentials, and manage multiple instances of our websites in a single browser. We may also collect other data through cookies, such as the page or website that referred you to us, the date and time you visited us, and your current IP address. The cookies we place on your hard drive are known as "first-party cookies" and any cookies placed by third parties are called “third party cookies.” Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g., advertising, interactive content and analytics). The parties that set these third party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other websites. 
  * **_Disabling Cookies:_ **Most major web browsers provide users with the option to accept or reject cookies. Opting out of the use of cookies to deliver targeted advertising relies on information in the unique cookies placed on your web browser by our partners, so if you delete cookies, use a different device, or change web browsers, you may need to opt out again. Please note that if you use your browser settings to block all cookies you may not be able to access parts of our or others' websites. The “Help” feature on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the website of its manufacturer. Since cookies allow you to take advantage of some of our essential features, we recommend that you leave them turned on. For instance, if you block or otherwise reject our cookies, you may not be able to utilize certain features on our websites, such as adding items to your shopping cart, proceeding to checkout, or using services that require you to sign in.
  *  ** _Pixel Tags_** : We also collect information through the use of "pixel tags" on our websites and in e-mail messages we may send to you that may be placed by us or third parties with whom we partner. “Pixels,” also known as "Web beacons," are tiny graphic files or code snippets, not visible to the human eye, that can be included in HTML-encoded e-mail messages and web pages. When such a message is opened in an HTML-capable e-mail program, the recipient's computer or device will communicate with our server to retrieve the pixel tag file, allowing us to record and store, along with the recipient's e-mail address, the date and time the recipient viewed the e-mail message, the fact that the recipient's e-mail client is capable of receiving HTML-encoded e-mail, and other standard logging information. The pixel tag may also see or read cookies. Beachbody may use pixel tags in order to measure and understand traffic better, improve site performance, track visitor behavior to improve user experience, and for tracking promotional and marketing campaign response, among others. You can disable the pixel tag feature by changing the settings on your e-mail client to prevent the automatic downloading of images, changing your browser settings to omit images, disabling Javascript, or there are commercial software packages available that can omit pixel tags and most advertisements.
  *  ** _Behavioral Advertising on Third Party Websites_** : We also work with third parties that use tracking technologies on our websites and on other websites in order to provide and track tailored advertisements on our behalf and on behalf of other advertisers across the Internet. These third party partners may place or recognize a unique cookie on your hard drive. They may help Beachbody place first party cookies from our servers, or third party cookies from their own or other third party servers. Beachbody and our advertisers and third party advertising partners may use cookies in order to collect information about you, which may include how many times you have seen an ad or whether you have interacted with an ad. We and our partners may also use cookies to provide you with interest-based or behavioral advertising. The use of third-party cookies is not covered by this Privacy Policy as these third parties are subject to their own privacy policies. For more information about this practice and to understand your options for many of our advertising partners, please visit _[http://www.youradchoices.com](http://www.youradchoices.com/)_ (U.S.), _[http://www.youradchoices.ca](http://www.youradchoices.ca/)_ (Canada) or the Network Advertising Initiative at _[www.networkadvertising.org](http://www.networkadvertising.org/)_. If you choose to opt-out of behavioral advertising using these cookies, you will still be served with advertisements on the Internet, but it may not be tailored to your interests. Most major web browsers provide users with the option to accept or reject third party cookies. Opting out relies on information in the unique cookies placed on your web browser by our partners, so if you delete cookies, use a different device, or change web browsers, you may need to opt out again. 
  * **_Do Not Track Signals_** : Some web browsers offer a “Do Not Track” signal that is a HTTP header field indicating your preference regarding tracking or cross-site user tracking. Like many other websites and online services, we do not currently alter our practices when we receive Do Not Track signals or other mechanisms that provide consumers the ability to exercise choice regarding the collection of personally identifiable information about an individual consumer’s online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services, as there is no consensus among industry participants as to what "Do Not Track" means in this context. To find out more about "Do Not Track," you may wish to visit _<http://www.allaboutdnt.com/>__._



 **Does Beachbody Share the Information and Data it Receives?**

We value the trust our customers place in us to safeguard their personal information. We share personal information we collect with your consent and as described below: 

  * **_Third-Party Service Providers_** : We utilize third party companies and individuals to perform business functions on our behalf to better serve you. For example, we use third parties to help us make our products and services available to you, fulfill orders you may have placed, process credit card payments, provide customer service, ship postal mail, deliver your packages, conduct market research or information analysis, manage promotions, and contact you in connection with various Beachbody Services. In these instances, we may need to provide your information to these third parties for such purposes. 
  * **_Assignment to a Team Beachbody Coach and/or Master Trainer_** : To maximize the benefits of our products and services, we assign an independent Team Beachbody Coach (a “ **Coach** ”) to all customers who agree to a Team Beachbody Club membership or who consent to be contacted by a Coach. Your assigned Coach is available to assist you in understanding and using the products you ordered, and help give you the motivation you need to help you achieve your fitness goals. To help you both get in contact, your assigned Coach will receive access to certain information you provided during your purchase process, such as your name, address, phone number, e-mail address and the names of the products you purchased. Your Coach may contact you to offer support, and provide general information and marketing materials. Please note that Beachbody will never provide your assigned Coach your credit or debit card information or, if you provided it, your Social Security number/Social Insurance number. If you joined Beachbody LIVE!, we may provide certain basic information to the Master Trainer assigned to train you during your training, such as your name, e-mail address and phone number. 
  * **_Related Companies; Third Party Offers_** : Beachbody occasionally partners with third parties to learn more about our customers so we can service you better or offer products or services that we feel may be useful to you (" **Related Company** "). In such case, we may disclose to a Related Company certain information, such as your name, e-mail, billing or shipping address, products purchased and price. If you request information from a Related Company, we may disclose additional information such as your e-mail address, phone number and other contact information, so the Related Company can provide you with the information you requested. If you purchased a product or service from a Related Company, we will also disclose your credit card information so they can complete your purchase. We may disclose aggregated, de-identified information to Related Companies: (i) so the Related Companies can provide you with advertisements tailored to your interests; (ii) for statistical analysis, research, and demographic profiling purposes; and (iii) to support our business and improve our mission to help our customers achieve their health and wellness goals.
  *  ** _Protection of Beachbody and Others_** : We may share your information, including personally identifiable information, in order to: (i) protect or defend the legal rights or property of Beachbody, or the legal rights of our customers, Coaches, business partners, employees, agents, and contractors; (ii) protect the safety and security of our customers, Coaches or members of the public, including acting in urgent circumstances; (iii) detect and protect against fraud and identity theft or to conduct risk management; (iv) comply with laws, legal process, or legal requests from any governmental or regulatory body; or (v) to enforce or apply our website Terms and Conditions and/or other agreements.
  *  ** _De-identified Data Disclosures_** : We may also disclose non-identifying transaction information to third parties for the purpose of accounting and record keeping. We may also disclose aggregated, de-identified user data or non-personal information with business partners, advertisers, and others.



 **What About Third-Party and Advertisers’ Services?**

At various points and pages on our websites or mobile applications, you may be able to access or utilize services offered by or in conjunction with third parties. This includes services in connection with third-party "social media" and other sites that would allow personal information to be transferred to such third parties (for example, Facebook Connect), Coaches, and others. 

These third parties have separate data collection and privacy practices independent from ours, so please review their privacy policies to understand your rights. For this reason, Beachbody cannot be responsible for their policies or activities. Please contact those third parties directly if you have questions about their privacy practices. 

**How Secure is Information About Me?**

Beachbody has implemented and uses reasonable security measures designed to help prevent the loss and unauthorized access of your information. Despite these efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against interception or to be absolutely secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or our online services. If you suspect a website or mobile application is pretending to be that of Beachbody’s (also known as “spoofing”), do not enter any personal information, but please let us know by e-mailing _[CyberSecurity@Beachbody.com](mailto:CyberSecurity@beachbody.com)_. Personal information may be accessed by persons within our organization, or our third party service providers, who require such access to carry out the purposes indicated above, or such other purposes as may be permitted or required by the applicable law. Personal Information we collect is maintained in the United States. 

**What Happens to My Information if Beachbody is Sold to or Merges With Another Company?**

As we continue to develop and grow our business or in the unlikely event of a bankruptcy, we might sell one or more of our assets, subsidiaries or business units. In such transactions, customer information is typically one of the transferred business assets. 

**Users Based Outside of the USA; Transfer of Personal Information**

Like most websites and businesses, Beachbody’s websites may be accessed by an international audience. By visiting our websites, using our applications, and/or providing us with any data, you agree we may collect, process, use, and store your personal information as discussed herein, outside your resident jurisdiction (such as the U.S. or Canada). Our Related Companies and third party service providers may also be located outside of your jurisdiction. As a result, this information may be subject to access requests from governments, courts, or law enforcement in those jurisdictions according to laws in those jurisdictions. Please note that U.S. law and those of other countries where your information may be stored and processed may offer different levels of protection for your information than your home country. We will take all reasonable steps to ensure that such personal information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

 **How Can I Access or Update My Information?**

We want to be sure your personal information is kept accurate and complete, and for this reason we ask that you inform us in the event of any changes to your information. If you provided your information _directly to Beachbody_ , you may access or update certain personal information by calling our Customer Service at (800) 470-7870 or logging into your Team Beachbody account if you created one. When calling Customer Service, please have your e-mail address and order information available. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to respond to your request to access or update your information. Please note that certain access may be subject to a fee. 

**Your Privacy Choices: Opt-Out**

  *  ** _Marketing_** : We offer you various ways to opt-out of receiving certain communications from us. If you would like to opt-out of receiving e-mail marketing communications from us, you may click the “Unsubscribe” link found at the bottom of Beachbody marketing e-mails that we send and follow the easy instructions to opt-out, or you may click the “Preferences” links to update your e-mail settings. If you would like to opt-out of receiving marketing phone calls, you can inform the agent with whom you speak that you would like to be placed on Beachbody’s “Do Not Call” list. If you would like to opt-out of any Beachbody text message campaign, please follow the instructions provided when you opt-in to the campaign; typically, responding “STOP” to your specific short code will opt you out of the campaign for which you signed up.
  *  ** _Online Advertising_** : To learn some of the ways that you can opt-out of targeted online advertising, see the section above titled “What About Cookies, Pixel Tags and Third Party Tracking Tools?" for more information. 



**Changes to This Privacy Policy**

Beachbody may modify this Privacy Policy at any time effective upon its posting on our websites. Your continued business relationship with us, or use of any of our Beachbody Services after the changes are posted constitutes your acceptance of any changes, both with regard to information we have previously collected from you and information we may collect from you in the future. 

**Notice to California Residents - Your California Privacy Rights (As Provided by California Civil Code section 1798.83).**

A California resident who has provided Personal Data, as defined under California Civil Code section 1798.83, to a business with whom he/she has established a business relationship for personal, family, or household purposes (a “ **California Customer** ”) may request information about whether the business has disclosed personal information to any third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes.

**_Renseignements que nous recevons automatiquement  :_** Nous recevons et sauvegardons certains renseignements techniques chaque fois que vous interagissez avec nous. Par exemple, comme beaucoup d'autres sites Web, nous utilisons des « témoins » pour améliorer votre expérience sur nos sites Web tel que décrit ci-dessous, ce qui nous permet d'obtenir certains renseignements lorsque votre navigateur Web accède à l'un de nos sites. 

**_Exemples de renseignements que nous recevons automatiquement  :_** Ceci inclut, sans s'y limiter, votre adresse de protocole Internet (IP) (le numéro utilisé pour identifier votre ordinateur ou un modem à Internet), ce qui peut potentiellement identifier votre emplacement et fournisseur de services Internet, le navigateur et le type d'appareil, la version et les paramètres de fuseau horaire et le système ainsi que la plate-forme d'exploitation ; des renseignements sur vos activités sur nos sites Web, y compris les adresses de localisateur de ressources uniforme (URL) à partir desquelles vous avez accédé à nos sites Web et les adresses URL que vous avez visitées sur nos sites Web ; l'identificateur de témoin ; les produits que vous avez consultés ou cherchés ; le numéro de téléphone que vous avez utilisé pour nous appeler ; données de pixels invisibles tel que décrit ci-dessous et l'historique d'achat. Au cours des visites sur nos sites Web, nous pouvons utiliser des outils logiciels tels que JavaScript afin de mesurer et recueillir des renseignements de session, y compris les temps de réponse des pages, les erreurs de téléchargement, la durée des visites à certaines pages, les renseignements d'interaction sur des pages (tels que le défilement, les clics et les pointages de souris) ainsi que les méthodes utilisées pour naviguer à l'extérieur de la page. Nous pouvons également recueillir des renseignements techniques pour nous aider à identifier votre appareil pour la prévention de la fraude et à des fins de diagnostic.

  *  ** _Renseignements sur les appareils mobiles ou raccordés physiquement_** _  :_ Lorsque vous téléchargez, installez ou utilisez nos applications sur des appareils mobiles ou raccordés physiquement, nous pouvons recevoir des renseignements sur votre appareil et accéder à la caméra, au microphone ou autres services ou matériel de votre appareil. Certains appareils peuvent vous permettre de refuser cette collecte de renseignements ou accès, et dans ces cas, vous pourriez être en mesure d'arrêter subséquemment la collecte de renseignements ou l'accès. Veuillez vérifier les paramètres de votre appareil pour plus d'informations. 
  * **_Exemples de renseignements pour l'utilisation mobile  :_** Ceci inclut, sans s'y limiter, des identificateurs uniques pour l'appareil, les renseignements de l'appareil et d'utilisation, des renseignements de géolocalisation précise (si vous avez activé cette fonctionnalité), des fournisseurs de services ainsi que les types d'appareils mobiles et de systèmes d'exploitation accédant à l'application.
  *  ** _Renseignements obtenus d'autres sources_** _:_ Nous pourrions recevoir des renseignements sur vous à partir d'autres sources, par exemple, par l'entremise de fournisseurs tiers, de sources de services et commerciales (tels que les agrégateurs de données et les bases de données publiques).

 _Données HealthKit de Apple :_ Beachbody n'utilisera ni ne partagera de données reliées à la santé recueillies par le biais de HealthKit de Apple à des fins de marketing.

 **À propos des témoins, des pixels invisibles et des outils de suivi de tiers**

  *  ** _Témoins_** _:_ Comme presque toutes les entreprises, Beachbody et autres utilisent une technologie communément appelée un « témoin ». Il s'agit d'un fichier de données de petite taille que notre serveur place sur votre ordinateur ou appareil mobile pour reconnaître votre appareil et fournir des fonctionnalités et des publicités personnalisées. Les témoins sont largement utilisés par les propriétaires de sites Web afin de faire fonctionner leur sites Web ou de les faire fonctionner plus efficacement, ainsi que de fournir des rapports d'information. Grâce à des témoins, nous sommes en mesure de recueillir des renseignements que nous utilisons pour améliorer nos sites Web et des applications mobiles, améliorer votre expérience et personnaliser vos expériences et des publicités. Par exemple, par le biais des témoins, nous pouvons tenir le compte des visites de retour à notre site Web ou aux sites Web de nos annonceurs ou partenaires, recueillir et communiquer des renseignements statistiques globales, authentifier vos renseignements de connexion et gérer plusieurs instances de nos sites en un seul navigateur. Nous pouvons également recueillir d'autres données par le biais de témoins, tels que la page ou le site Web qui vous a référé à nous, la date et l'heure de votre visite et votre adresse IP actuelle. Les témoins que nous plaçons sur votre disque dur sont connus comme des « témoins de première partie » et tous les témoins placés par des tiers sont appelés des « témoins tiers ». Les témoins tiers permettent des éléments ou des fonctionnalités de tiers à exécuter sur ou via le site Web (par exemple, la publicité, le contenu interactif et des analyses). Les parties qui définissent ces témoins tiers peuvent reconnaître votre ordinateur lorsqu'il visite le site Web en question et aussi lorsqu'il visite certains autres sites. 


  * **_Désactivation des témoins  :_** ****La plupart des principaux navigateurs Web fournissent aux utilisateurs la possibilité d'accepter ou de refuser les témoins. Refuser l'utilisation des témoins pour fournir de la publicité ciblée repose sur l'information contenue dans les témoins uniques placés sur votre navigateur par nos partenaires ; donc si vous supprimez les témoins, utilisez un autre appareil ou changer de navigateur, vous devrez peut-être refuser l'activation de témoins de nouveau. Veuillez prendre note que si vous utilisez des paramètres de votre navigateur pour bloquer tous les témoins, vous pouvez ne pas être en mesure d'accéder à certaines parties de nos sites ou d'autres sites. L'option «  Aide » sur la plupart des navigateurs vous indique comment empêcher votre navigateur d'accepter de nouveaux témoins, comment le navigateur vous avertit lorsque vous recevez un nouveau témoin ou comment désactiver les témoins. De plus, vous pouvez désactiver ou supprimer des données similaires utilisées par des modules complémentaires de navigateur tels que les témoins instantanés en changeant les paramètres du module complémentaire ou en visitant le site de son fabricant. Puisque les témoins vous permettent de profiter de certains de nos fonctionnalités essentielles, nous vous recommandons de les laisser activés. Par exemple, si vous bloquez ou rejeter autrement nos témoins, vous pouvez ne pas être en mesure d'utiliser certaines fonctionnalités sur nos sites Web, tels que l'ajout d'articles à votre panier, passer à la caisse ou utiliser les services qui vous obligent à vous connecter.


  *  ** _Pixels invisibles :_**   Nous recueillons également des renseignements par l'entremise de « pixels invisibles » sur notre site Web et dans les courriels que nous vous envoyons. Ces pixels peuvent être placés par nous ou par l'un de nos partenaires tiers. Les « pixels invisibles », aussi connus sous le nom de « balises Web » sont de tout petits fichiers graphiques ou extraits de code, invisibles à l'œil nu, contenus dans des courriels et des pages Web HTML. Lorsqu'un tel message est consulté sur un serveur de messagerie prenant en charge le langage HTML, l'ordinateur ou l'appareil du destinataire communique avec notre serveur pour récupérer le fichier de pixel invisible, nous permettant ainsi d'enregistrer et de stocker, en plus de l'adresse de courriel du destinataire, la date et l'heure où le courriel a été lu, si le client de messagerie du destinataire peut recevoir (ou non) des courriels en HTML, ainsi que d'autres renseignements standard de connexion. Le pixel invisible peut aussi voir et lire les témoins. Beachbody pourrait se servir des pixels invisibles afin de mesurer et de mieux comprendre l'achalandage, d'améliorer la performance du site, d'analyser les habitudes des visiteurs pour rehausser l'expérience utilisateur et de faire le suivi des réponses aux campagnes promotionnelles et de marketing, entre autres. Vous pouvez désactiver la fonction des pixels invisibles en modifiant les options de votre client de messagerie de sorte à empêcher le téléchargement automatique d'images, en modifiant les paramètres de votre navigateur pour qu'il ignore les images et désactive Java script. Il existe aussi des logiciels commerciaux qui ignorent les pixels invisibles et la plupart des publicités.
  *  ** _Publicité comportementale sur les sites Web de tiers :_** Nous travaillons également avec des tiers qui utilisent des technologies de suivi sur nos sites Web et d'autres sites Web afin de publier et de faire le suivi des publicités personnalisées en notre nom et au nom des autres annonceurs sur Internet. Ces partenaires tiers peuvent placer ou reconnaître un témoin unique sur votre disque dur. Ils peuvent aider Beachbody à placer des témoins de première partie en provenance de nos serveurs ou les témoins tiers à partir de leurs propres serveurs ou d'autres serveurs tiers. Beachbody ainsi que nos annonceurs et partenaires tiers de publicité peuvent utiliser des témoins afin de collecter des renseignements sur vous, ce qui peut comprendre le nombre de fois que vous avez vu une annonce ou si vous avez interagi avec une annonce. Nous et nos partenaires pouvons également utiliser des témoins pour vous fournir de la publicité basée sur les intérêts ou les comportements. L'utilisation de témoins tiers n'est pas couverte par cette politique de confidentialité puisque ces tiers sont soumis à leurs propres politiques de confidentialité. Pour plus de renseignements au sujet de cette pratique et pour comprendre vos options pour plusieurs de nos partenaires de publicité, veuillez visiter _[http://www.youradchoices.com](http://www.youradchoices.com/)_ (É.-U.), _[http://www.youradchoices.ca](http://www.youradchoices.ca/)_ (Canada) ou Network Advertising Initiative à _[www.networkadvertising.org](http://www.networkadvertising.org/)_. Si vous choisissez de refuser de la publicité comportementale utilisant ces témoins, vous aurez toujours des publicités sur Internet, mais elles ne seront peut-être pas adaptées à vos intérêts. La plupart des principaux navigateurs Web fournissent aux utilisateurs la possibilité d'accepter ou de refuser les témoins tiers. Le refuser repose sur l'information dans les témoins uniques placés sur votre navigateur par nos partenaires, donc si vous supprimez les témoins, utilisez un autre appareil ou changez de navigateur, vous devrez peut-être refuser l'activation de témoins de nouveau. 
  * **_Signaux Pas de suivi  :_** Certains navigateurs Web offrent un signal « Pas de suivi » qui est un champ d'en-tête HTTP indiquant vos préférences concernant le suivi ou le suivi à travers sites de différents sites consultés par l'utilisateur. Comme beaucoup d'autres sites et services en ligne, nous ne modifions actuellement pas nos pratiques lorsque nous recevons des signaux Pas de suivi ou d'autres mécanismes qui offrent aux consommateurs la possibilité d'exercer un choix en ce qui concerne la collecte de renseignements personnels sur les activités en ligne d'un consommateur individuel au fil du temps et à travers des sites tiers ou services en ligne car il n'y a pas de consensus parmi les participants de l'industrie quant à ce que « Pas de suivi » signifie dans ce contexte. Pour en savoir plus sur « Pas de suivi », vous pouvez visiter _<http://www.allaboutdnt.com/>__._



 **Est-ce que Beachbody partage les renseignements et les données qu'elle reçoit ?**

Le Coach qu'on vous aura attitré est là pour vous aider à comprendre et à utiliser les produits que vous commandez et pour vous donner la motivation dont vous avez besoin pour atteindre vos objectifs de mise en forme. Pour faciliter le contact mutuel, votre Coach attitré aura accès à certains renseignements que vous nous aurez fournis lors de votre achat, par exemple vos nom, adresse, numéro de téléphone, adresse de courriel et les noms des produits que vous avez achetés. Votre Coach peut vous contacter pour offrir un soutien et fournir des documents d'information générales et de marketing.

Si vous avez acheté un produit ou un service à partir d'une entreprise associée, nous divulguerons également vos renseignements de carte de crédit afin de pouvoir traiter votre achat. Nous pouvons divulguer des renseignements agrégés, anonymisés à des entreprises associées : (i) de sorte que les entreprises associées puissent vous offrir des publicités adaptées à vos intérêts ; (ii) pour l'analyse statistique, de la recherche et à des fins de profilage démographiques ; et (iii) pour soutenir notre entreprise et améliorer notre mission d'aider nos clients à atteindre leurs objectifs de santé et de bien-être.
  *  ** _Protection des Beachbody et autres  :_** Nous pouvons partager vos renseignements, y compris des renseignements personnels identifiables, afin de: (i) protéger ou défendre les droits ou la propriété de Beachbody, ou les droits de nos clients, nos Coachs, partenaires d'affaires, employés, agents et sous-traitants ; (ii) protéger la sécurité de nos clients, des Coachs ou des membres du public, y compris agir en cas d'urgence ; (iii) détecter et protéger contre la fraude et l'usurpation d'identité ou de procéder à la gestion des risques ; (iv) se conformer aux lois, procédures judiciaires ou des demandes légales d'un organisme gouvernemental ou réglementaire ; ou (v) faire respecter ou appliquer les modalités ou autres accords de notre site.

 **À propos des services de tiers et d'annonceurs**

À divers moments et pages sur nos sites Web ou applications mobiles, vous pourriez être en mesure d'accéder ou d'utiliser les services offerts par ou en conjonction avec des tiers. Cela comprend les services en relation avec des « médias sociaux » de tiers et d'autres sites qui permettrait le transfert de renseignements personnels à ces tiers (par exemple, Facebook Connect), Coachs et autres.

 **Who Does Beachbody Share your Information with?**

We value the trust our customers place in us to safeguard their personal information. We share personal information we collect as described below: 

  * **_Third-Party Service Providers_** : We utilize third party companies and individuals to perform business functions on our behalf to better serve you. For example, we use third parties to help us make our products and services available to you, fulfill orders you may have placed, process credit card payments, provide customer service, payment optimization, seek collections on past due amounts, ship postal mail, deliver your packages, conduct market research or information analysis, manage promotions, and contact you in connection with various Beachbody Services. In these instances, we may need to provide your information to these third parties for such purposes. The categories of such third parties include: order and fulfillment providers; customer service and telesales providers; technology providers; banking, finance and payment processing providers; government agencies or regulators; event management providers (if you signed up for a Beachbody event or similar activity); and marketing providers.
  *  ** _Assignment to a Team Beachbody Coach and/or Master Trainer_** : If the Team Beachbody Coaching opportunity is available in your jurisdiction, we will assign an independent Team Beachbody Coach (a “ **Coach** ”) to all customers who purchase a product from us or who consent to being contacted by a Coach. Your assigned Coach is available to assist you in understanding and using the products you ordered, and give you the motivation you need to help you achieve your fitness goals. To help you both get in contact, your assigned Coach will receive access to certain information you provided during your purchase process, such as your name, address, phone number, e-mail address and the names of the products you purchased. Your Coach may contact you to offer support, and provide general information and marketing materials. Please note that Beachbody will never provide your assigned Coach your credit or debit card information or, if you provided it, your Social Security number/Social Insurance number. If you joined Beachbody LIVE!, we may provide certain basic information to the Master Trainer assigned to train you during your training, such as your name, e-mail address and phone number. 
  * **_Related Companies; Third Party Offers_** : Beachbody occasionally partners with third parties to learn more about our customers so we can service you better or offer products or services that we feel may be useful to you (" **Related Company** "). In such case, we may disclose to a Related Company certain information, such as your name, e-mail, billing or shipping address, products purchased and price. If you request information from a Related Company, we may disclose additional information such as your e-mail address, phone number and other contact information, so the Related Company can provide you with the information you requested. If you purchased a product or service from a Related Company, we will also disclose your credit card information so they can complete your purchase. In other cases, we may disclose aggregated, de-identified information (which _does not_ identify you) to Related Companies: (i) so the Related Companies can provide you with advertisements tailored to your interests; (ii) for statistical analysis, research, and demographic profiling purposes; and (iii) to support our business and improve our mission to help our customers achieve their health and wellness goals.
  *  ** _Protection of Beachbody and Others_** : We may share your information, including personal information, in order to: (i) protect or defend the legal rights or property of Beachbody, or the legal rights of our customers, Coaches, business partners, employees, agents, and contractors; (ii) protect the safety and security of our customers, Coaches or members of the public, including acting in urgent circumstances; (iii) detect and protect against fraud, and identity theft or to conduct risk management; (iv) comply with laws, legal process, or legal requests from any governmental or regulatory body; or (v) to enforce or apply our website Terms and Conditions and/or other agreements. 
  * **_To a buyer or potential buyer of all or part of Beachbody:_** As we continue to develop and grow our business, we might sell one or more of our assets, subsidiaries or business units, or buy a subsidiary or business unit from a third party. In such transactions, customer information is typically one of the transferred business assets, but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless the customer consents otherwise). If this should happen, we will provide you with notice of any such transfer by posting to our website or other form of communication. 
  * **_De-identified Data Disclosures_** : We may also disclose non-identifying transaction information (which _does not_ identify you) to third parties for the purpose of accounting and record keeping. We may also disclose aggregated, de-identified information or non-personal information (which _does not_ identify you) with business partners, advertisers, and others.
  *  ** _Other Disclosures_** : Occasionally, we may disclose personal information in other circumstances, but we will only do this if we have explained at the time we collect the information the purpose for which it will be disclosed.

  


 **What About Cookies, Pixel Tags and Third Party Tracking Tools?**

Like almost every company, Beachbody uses cookies and similar technologies. Please see our Cookie Notice by clicking _here_. 

  


**What About Third-Party Resellers’ and Advertisers’ Services?**

At various places and pages on our websites or mobile applications, you may be able to access or utilize services offered by or in conjunction with third parties. This includes services in connection with third-party "social media" and other sites that would allow personal information to be transferred to such third parties (for example, Facebook Connect). In addition, certain purchases that you make on our websites or applications may be completed by or through our authorized reseller (“ **Reseller** ”). You will be required to provide your personal information to the Reseller who will charge your payment card or other payment method for any Beachbody products or services you wish to purchase. When this happens, we will notify you of the name of the Reseller and present or direct you to their terms and conditions and privacy notice for your review. 

These third parties (including Resellers, Coaches and others to whom you provide your personal information) have separate data collection and privacy practices independent from ours, so please review their privacy policies to understand your rights. For this reason, Beachbody cannot be responsible for their policies or activities. Please contact those third parties directly if you have questions about their privacy practices. 

  


**How Secure is the Information Beachbody Has About Me?**

Beachbody has implemented and uses reasonable security measures designed to prevent the loss and unauthorized access of your information. Despite these efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against interception or to be absolutely secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or our online services. 

If you suspect an e-mail, website or mobile application is pretending to be that of Beachbody’s (also known as “spoofing”), do not enter any personal information, but please let us know by e-mailing _[CyberSecurity@Beachbody.com](mailto:CyberSecurity@Beachbody.com)_.

  


 **What About Information Pertaining to Children?**

We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 16. If we learn that we have inadvertently obtained personal information on a child under the age of 16, that information will be deleted from our systems. Beachbody encourages parents to go online with their children to help keep them safe. 

  


**Transfers of Personal Information**

Like most websites and businesses, Beachbody’s websites may be accessed by an international audience. By using any Beachbody Services and/or providing us with any data, you acknowledge we may collect, process, use, and store your personal information as discussed herein, including outside your resident jurisdiction (such as the U.S. and Canada). Our related companies and third party service providers may also be located outside of your jurisdiction. Please note that U.S. law and those of other countries where your information may be stored and processed may offer different levels of protection for your information than your home country. We will take all reasonable steps to ensure that such personal information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Notice.

Where applicable, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Notice. These include implementing the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of personal information between our affiliate and subsidiary companies, which require all such companies to protect personal information they process from the European Economic Area in accordance with European Union data protection law. 

Our Standard Contractual Clauses can be provided by making a request at _[Privacy@Beachbody.com](mailto:Privacy@Beachbody.com)_. We have implemented similar appropriate safeguards with certain third party service providers and partners. Further details can be provided upon request.

  


 **How Can I Update My Information?**

If you would like to opt-out of any Beachbody text message campaign, please follow the instructions provided when you opt-in to the campaign; typically, responding “STOP” to your specific short code will opt you out of the campaign for which you signed up. For help or information regarding your Beachbody On Demand membership, please visit the “My Account” section within your Beachbody On Demand account.

 ** _Online Advertising_** : To learn some of the ways that you can opt-out of targeted online advertising, see the section titled “ _How Can I Control Cookies_?" in the Cookie Notice below for more information. 

  


**How Can you Exercise your Other Privacy Rights?**

Depending on where you reside, you may have the following privacy rights:

  * If you wish to **access, correct, update or request deletion** of your personal information, you can make such a request at any time by visiting _<https://faq.beachbody.com/app/gdpr_form>_. 


  * In addition, if you are a resident of the European Union, you can **object to the processing** of your personal information, ask us to **restrict processing** of your personal information or **request portability** of your personal information. Again, you can make such a request at any time by visiting _<https://faq.beachbody.com/app/gdpr_form>_. 


  * Similarly, if we have collected and process your personal information with your consent, then you can **withdraw your consent** at any time by visiting our Preference Center which you can access through links at the bottom of e-mails you receive from us or by visiting the My Account tab when you are logged into _[www.TeamBeachbody.com](https://www.teambeachbody.com/)_. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.


  * You have the **right to complain to a data protection authority** about our collection and use of your personal information. For more information, please contact your local data protection authority. 

  


We respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws.

 **How Long do we Retain your Information?**

We retain personal information we collect from you for as long as we: (i) have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so in connection with the purposes set out at “ _How Does Beachbody Use the Information It Collects?_ ” above (for example to process your information whilst you are a customer and afterwards in order to deal with complaints and queries); or (ii) where required by law (for example we are required to keep financial records for a certain period under VAT and accounting rules). 

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

  


 **Legal Basis for Processing Personal Information**

Our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it. However, we will normally collect personal information from you: (i) where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you for the Beachbody Services; (ii) where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your rights; (iii) where we have your consent to do so; or (iv) as required by law. In some cases, we may have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you or may otherwise need the personal information to protect your vital interests or those of another person (for example, if you were to get injured in connection with one of our Beachbody Services).

If we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), this interest will normally be to operate our platform and communicating with you as necessary to provide our services to you and for our legitimate commercial interest, for instance, when responding to your queries, improving our platform, undertaking marketing, or for the purposes of detecting or preventing illegal activities. We may have other legitimate interests and if appropriate it will be clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.

If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information, please contact us using the contact details provided under the “ _Contacting Beachbody_” heading below.

  


 **Changes to This Privacy Notice**

We may update this Privacy Notice from time to time in response to changing legal, technical or business developments.

 _Effective Date_ : May 24, 2018

This Cookie Notice explains how Beachbody UK Ltd. (“ **Beachbody** ”, “ **us** ”, “ **we** ” or “ **our** ”) uses cookies and similar technologies to recognise you when you visit our websites or applications on mobile or connected devices. It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.

  


 **What Are Cookies?**

Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by many companies and website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information. 

Cookies set by Beachbody are called "first party cookies". Cookies set by parties other than Beachbody are called "third party cookies". Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g., advertising, interactive content and analytics). The parties that set these third party cookies can recognise your computer both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other websites. 

**Why Do We Use Cookies?**

We use first party and third party cookies. Cookies help us manage and report on your interaction with our websites or mobile applications. Through cookies, we are able to collect information that we use to improve our websites and mobile applications, and improve your overall experience on them. For example, through cookies, we can keep count of return visits to our website or our advertisers' or partners' websites, collect and report on aggregate statistical information, authenticate your login credentials, and manage multiple instances of our websites in a single browser. We may also collect other data through cookies, such as the page or website that referred you to us, the date and time you visited us, and your current IP address.

We use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You may be able to remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your browser's "help" section.

Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our websites to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our websites. Third parties serve cookies through our websites for advertising, analytics and other purposes. This is described in more detail below.

Some of the first and third party cookies we commonly serve through our websites and the purposes they perform are described in the table below. Please note this list is not intended to be exhaustive, but is intended to illustrate primary reasons for certain types of cookies set by Beachbody and third parties on our websites and applications. Also, the specific cookies served may vary depending on the specific website you visit. Since we are always making improvements to our websites and applications to better serve you, the list of companies named in the table below may change from time to time. We will take commercially reasonable efforts to update this Cookie Notice as frequently as possible to reflect the most accurate information.

 **What About Other Tracking Technologies, Like Web Beacons?**

Cookies are not the only way to recognise or track visitors to a website. We also collect information through the use of other, similar technologies, such as "pixel tags" on our websites and in e-mail messages we may send to you which may be placed by us or a third party with whom we partner. “Pixels”, also known as "Web beacons," are tiny graphic files or code snippets, not visible to the human eye, that can be included in HTML-encoded e-mail messages and web pages. When such a message is opened in an HTML-capable e-mail program, the recipient's computer or device will communicate with our server to retrieve the pixel tag file, allowing us to record and store, along with the recipient's e-mail address, the date and time the recipient viewed the e-mail message, the fact that the recipient's e-mail client is capable of receiving HTML-encoded e-mail, and other standard logging information. The pixel tag may also see or read cookies. Beachbody may use pixel tags in order to measure and understand traffic better, improve site performance, track visitor behavior to improve user experience, and for tracking promotional and marketing campaign response, among others. You can disable the pixel tag feature by changing the settings on your e-mail client to prevent the automatic downloading of images, changing your browser settings to omit images, disabling Javascript, or there are commercial software packages available that can omit pixel tags and most advertisements.

 **Do You Use Flash cookies or Local Shared Objects?**

Our websites may also use so-called "Flash Cookies" (also known as Local Shared Objects or "LSOs") to, among other things, collect and store information about your use of our services, fraud prevention and for other site operations. 

If you do not want Flash Cookies stored on your computer, you can adjust the settings of your Flash player to block Flash Cookies storage using the tools contained in the website Storage Settings Panel. You can also control Flash Cookies by going to the Global Storage Settings Panel and following the instructions (which may include instructions that explain, for example, how to delete existing Flash Cookies (referred to "information" on the Macromedia site), how to prevent Flash LSOs from being placed on your computer without your being asked, and (for Flash Player 8 and later) how to block Flash Cookies that are not being delivered by the operator of the page you are on at the time). 

Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash Cookies may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash applications, including, potentially, Flash applications used in connection with our services or online content.

  


 **Do You Serve Targeted Advertising?**

We also work with third parties that use tracking technologies on our websites in order to provide tailored advertisements on our behalf and on behalf of other advertisers across the Internet. These third party partners may place or recognize a unique cookie on your hard drive. Advertisers and third party advertising partners may use third party cookies in order to collect information about you, which may include how many times you have seen their ads or whether you have interacted with an ad. They may also use third party cookies to provide you with interest-based or behavioral advertising. The information collected through this process does not enable us or them to identify your name, contact details or other personally identifying details unless you choose to provide this information. 

**How Can I Control Cookies?**

You can set or amend your web browser controls to accept or reject cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our websites, however your access to some functionality and areas of our website may be severely restricted. 

  * **_Browser Controls_** : Most major web browsers provide users with the option to accept or reject cookies. Opting out relies on information in the unique cookies placed on your web browser by our partners, so if you delete cookies, use a different device, or change web browsers, you may need to opt out again. Please note that if you use your browser settings to block all cookies you may not be able to access parts of our or others' websites. The “Help” feature on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the website of its developer.

  * **_Targeted Advertising; Do Not Track Signals_** : We may customize content and advertisements for our products and services on our websites or mobile applications in order to make the content and advertising as informative and useful to you as possible. We do this by using information that you provide to us or we obtain through tracking technologies. To prevent this, some web browsers offer a “Do Not Track” signal that is a HTTP header field indicating your preference regarding tracking or cross-site user tracking. Like many other websites and online services, we do not currently alter our practices when we receive Do Not Track signals as there is no consensus among industry participants as to what "Do Not Track" means in this context. To find out more about "Do Not Track," you may wish to visit _<http://www.allaboutdnt.com/>_.
