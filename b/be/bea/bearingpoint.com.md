In such case, we assume that you have an unrestricted permission of such person to provide her personal data to BearingPoint. BearingPoint may use suppliers to collect, process, store, use, analyze and/or transfer the data on its behalf. In such case, it is BearingPoint practice to require that these suppliers handle the personal data they process or transfer in a manner consistent with BearingPoint’s policies.
