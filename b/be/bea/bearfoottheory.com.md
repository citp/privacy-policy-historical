# Privacy Policy / Disclosures - Bearfoot Theory

## Advertising Policy

Occasionally I partner with brands, companies, and tourism boards to share with you the latest gear or to highlight cool adventures and destinations that I think you will be interested in. And at times, I receive compensation to write about these things. This compensation can come in the form of money, free gear, tours, etc, and it helps me continue to create interesting and valuable content on this site.

But first things first. Nothing comes before YOU. My readers mean everything, and no amount of money is worth losing your trust.

When I review a product, whether I am paid or not, I provide you with my upfront and honest opinions. And that’s it. No BS, no fluff.

Also, in my blog posts, you will often find affiliate links to products on Amazon, REI and other retailers. If you purchase something using one of my links, I receive a tiny bit of compensation. This doesn’t affect the price you pay, and the modest earnings I make from affiliate links help me keep this blog running.

In 2009, the Federal Trade Commission passed new regulations that require bloggers to disclose whenever a blog post contains affiliate links or compensation was received. So please assume that any link to Amazon or another retailer on my site is an affiliate link.

If you have any questions about this policy, please feel free to [get in touch](https://bearfoottheory.com/contact/ "Contact"). I always appreciate hearing from my readers.

### Thank you for supporting me and my site!
