We take your right to privacy and to protect the information you give us very seriously. While the basic rule at Beanstalk Internet Marketing is essentially, if it’s about a client – it stays at work, we feel it’s necessary to outline clearly what this means for you.

## Privacy For Our SEO Clients

There is no more serious offence that can be made by a search engine optimization firm that to share the information given to them by a client with those outside the company. We realize that the information that we receive as SEO’s can be extremely confidential and often includes credit card information, FTP information and more. This information will be kept in the hands of [Mary Davies, of Beanstalk Internet Marketing](https://beanstalkim.com/bsi/) and will be given to staff solely on a need-to-know basis (for example, the SEO working on your site will need FTP access to your server).
