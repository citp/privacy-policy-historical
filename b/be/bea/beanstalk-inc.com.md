# Beanstalk's Privacy Policy

We take your right to privacy and to protect the information you give us very seriously. While the basic rule at Beanstalk Internet Marketing is essentially, if it’s about a client – it stays at work, we feel it’s necessary to outline clearly what this means for you.

## Privacy For Our Newsletter Subscribers

We receive email addresses from people wishing to subscribe to “Climbing The Beanstalk”, our bi-weekly newsletter of search engine news and optimization strategies. These emails are kept confidential and are used for no other purpose than to send our newsletter to our subscribers.

## Privacy For Those Requesting Reviews

SEO reviews give us an opportunity to demonstrate to our visitors how search engine optimization works, how it can help their website, and to give them an idea of how we work and what sorts of things we are looking at. In requesting a review we require some personal and site information such as contact information, website address, targeted keyword phrases, etc. This information is used for no other purpose than to provide those requesting one with a custom SEO review.

None of this information leaves Beanstalk Internet Marketing with the sole exception of the review that we send to the email address given to us.

## Privacy For Our SEO Clients

There is no more serious offence that can be made by a search engine optimization firm that to share the information given to them by a client with those outside the company. We realize that the information that we receive as SEO’s can be extremely confidential and often includes credit card information, FTP information and more. This information will be kept in the hands of [Mary Davies, of Beanstalk Internet Marketing](https://www.beanstalkim.com/bsi/) and will be given to staff solely on a need-to-know basis (for example, the SEO working on your site will need FTP access to your server).
