Terms of Use, Privacy and Security Policies 

Privacy & Security Policy

Your privacy is important to us. We use the information you provide about yourself only to complete your order. We do not share this information with outside parties that aren't necessary to complete your order. We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. These addresses are never shared with outside parties! All information gathered while shopping at BeautyCareChoices.com is held in the strictest confidence.

Security - Our Safety Guarantee

We guarantee that every transaction you make on BeautyCareChoices.com will be safe. Your personal billing details are strictly confidential and will under no circumstances be shared with a third policy. All credit card transactions are processed using industry-standard SSL encryption through VeriSign for the utmost security. VeriSign is recognized as the industry leader in delivering the highest levels of trust and security so our customers can be certain that the information they send via web browser stays private and confidential. Your personal details are safely encrypted and completely unattainable to a third party. For added security, we have also implemented AVS (Address Verification System). This is a verification system that compares the billing address information provided by the customer online with the billing address on file at the customer's credit card issuing bank. We have found this to be an excellent and effective method for preventing credit card fraud. To prevent unauthorized access and ensure the correct use of information, we use a secure server which safeguards the information we collect online. All transactions on our web site are protected by this secure server software. Your name, address and credit card number cannot be read by anyone else. The safety and security of your order and personal information are very important to us.
