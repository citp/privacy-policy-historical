If we elect to update or revise this policy, we will post the date on which that revision takes effect at the end of this policy. Please be aware that you have no obligation to provide any personal information requested by us. However, if you choose to withhold your personal information, we may not be able to provide you with the services or products that depend on the collection and use of that information.

  1. OUR PRIVACY COMMITMENT  
We recognise the importance of, and are committed to, managing any personal information that we collect in compliance with the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth), which includes the Australian Privacy Principles, and other Australian privacy laws (together, “Privacy Laws”). As a member of the Australian Press Council (“APC”), we also ensure any personal information we collect in the course of our journalistic activities is managed in accordance with the APC Statement of Privacy Principles.
  2. HOW DO WE COLLECT PERSONAL INFORMATION?  
Where possible, we collect your personal information directly from you. This collection includes through your:  
· registration when you purchase a product, magazine or digital subscription;  
· entry into promotions or competitions;  
· answers to surveys;  
· signing up to newsletters and other notifications from our magazines and other brands;  
· signing up to join our online communities;  
· registration to attend events;

In some circumstances, however, we may also collect your personal information from third parties or public agencies where it is unreasonable or impracticable for us to collect the personal information directly from you. For example, if you subscribe to one of our magazines through a third party that is authorised to take subscriptions for us, we will collect your personal information from that third party. If we have difficulty in delivering a magazine to you, we may make enquiries in an effort to locate your address or correct any error in our recorded address details for you.  
In some circumstances, we may provide you access to our online communities through the option of a third party platform sign on (including but not limited to, social sign ons). In this instance we will be accessing and collecting the personal information which you have authorised the third party platform to pass on to us. Where we collect personal information from third parties, we will ensure that the collection is conducted in a fair and lawful manner and the information is reasonably necessary for our functions or activities.
  3. WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?

· transaction details, if you make a purchase with us or choose to store details in your online profile;  
· bank account/credit card numbers and associated details as reasonably required in relation to processing payments at your request; and  
· any other personal information which may be required in order to facilitate and where possible improve your dealings with us.However, for certain purposes, such as where you apply for employment with us, we will collect additional personal information such as your employment history, educational history and employment references.We generally do not collect sensitive information that is associated with an identifiable individual.  
We may from time to time collect information that would be sensitive personal information about you with your consent where the collection is related to provision of a service or other benefit to you.

We may collect information from you about particular health concerns, gender orientation or other sensitive information with your consent, in order to provide you with offers or promotions related to your concerns or status.  
In the event that we are required to collect sensitive personal information, we will notify you of this at the point of collection and obtain your consent to collect and hold this sensitive personal information.  
If you provide us with sensitive information on an unsolicited basis, we assess whether such information is reasonably necessary for one or more of our functions or activities. The unsolicited sensitive information you disclose to us may be used and disclosed for the purpose for which you provided such information or, where you would reasonably expect us to, we may use the information for a directly related secondary purpose. We may also disclose or use the information for other purposes with your consent or if required to by law.
