			<h3>Information about the Site</h3>
			<p>Your privacy is important to us, and our policy is simple: we will collect no personally identifiable information about you when you visit the Site unless you choose to provide that information (as explained further below). This Privacy Policy does not describe information collection practices on other sites, including those linked to or from the Site.</p> 
			
			<p>BEACON may amend this Privacy Policy at any time by posting a revised Privacy Policy on the Site, and/or sending information regarding the amendment to the email address you provide to BEACON.

			<p>When you use the Site, we may send one or more cookies (a small data file) to your computer or other device that uniquely identifies your browser.

We share personal information for these purposes only with third parties whose privacy policies are consistent with ours or who agree to abide by our policies with respect to personal information, however, we are not liable to you for any disclosure of your information made by such third parties.</p> 
			
			<p>Depending on the types of payment processing you choose with us, you may be required to or choose to have accounts directly with one or more of these third party providers, such as PayPal. Such third party providers’ privacy policies apply for information provided to them.</p>
			
			<p>In the event of a sale, merger, liquidation, dissolution or transfer of part of the business, trade or assets of BEACON and/or any of its individual affiliates, personal information collected about you may be sold, assigned, or transferred to the party acquiring all or substantially all of the equity or assets or business of BEACON and/or its affiliates.

			<p><strong>Consent:</strong></p> 
			
			<p>If you do not consent to the collection, use or disclosure of your personal information as outlined in this policy, please do not open an Account or provide any personal information to us.

			<p><strong>Security:</strong></p> 
			
			<p>BEACON uses industry-standard data collection and encryption methodologies to ensure the secure collection and transmission of your personal information.
