<dd><em>This policy was last updated on June 30, 2015</em></dd>

<dt><strong>Introduction</strong></dt>
<dd>
IBT Media Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively, "Company," "us" or "we") respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it through our compliance with this policy.
</dd>

<dd>This Privacy Policy describes how we may collect and use your personally identifiable information ("PII") (e.g., your full name, email address, mailing address, telephone number, or credit card number), as well as data that can, under certain circumstances, indirectly lead to PII ("Related Data") on our Web sites and other applications. Our Websites include but are not limited to, IBTimes.com, Newsweek.com, MedicalDaily.com, iDigitalTimes.com, LatinTimes.com, FashionTimes.com, Fashionnstyle.com, BeautyWorldnews.com, Designntrend.com and DesignTimes.com.</dd>

<dd>This Policy applies to PII and Related Data (collectively, your "information") received by us from consumers when you visit, register or subscribe to this Website and related services or sites that link to this Privacy Policy. It also applies to information we collect:</dd>

<dd>
• In e-mail, text and other electronic messages between you and this Website.<br>
• Through mobile and desktop applications you download from this Website, which provide dedicated non-browser-based interaction between you and this Website.<br>
• When you interact with our advertising and applications on third-party websites and services, if those applications or advertising include links to this policy.<br>
</dd>

<dd>From time to time Company may revise this Privacy Policy. If we make revisions that change the way we collect or use your PII or Related Data, those changes will be posted in this Privacy Policy and the effective date will be noted at the beginning of the Policy. Therefore, you should review it periodically so that you are up to date on our most current policies and practices. If we make material changes to our practices regarding use of your PII or Related Data, your PII and Related Data will continue to be governed by the Privacy Policy under which it was subject prior to those changes, unless you have been provided notice of, and have not objected to, the changes. </dd>

<dd>Please read this policy carefully to understand our policies and practices regarding your information and how we will treat it. If you do not agree with our policies and practices, your choice is not to use our Website. By accessing or using this Website, you agree to this privacy policy. This policy may change from time to time. Your continued use of this Website after we make changes is deemed to be acceptance of those changes, so please check the policy periodically for updates.</dd>

<dd><strong>Information That We Collect</strong><br>
<strong>Generally:</strong> When you subscribe to our products or services, we collect PII and Related Information from you. We also may collect PII and Related Information from you when you contact us or participate in activities like: our resume database; job searches; forums; message boards; chats; submitting a letter to the editor; forwarding an article to a friend; filling out forms; completing transactions through our Website; queries on the Website, creating a community profile; rating, tagging and commenting on articles; or surveys, sweepstakes, contests, or games. When you post on public areas of the Website, your content is transmitted to others at your own risk as we cannot guarantee that it will not be viewed by unauthorized persons. Additionally, when you visit our web sites, we automatically collect non PII such as IP addresses and web site usage information from you. </dd>

<dd>Sometimes we collect personally identifiable information from consumers in manual format or off-line, for example via a post card or subscription form. Providing detailed notice in those situations often proves impractical, so consumers will instead be provided with a short notice that describes how to obtain the full text of this Policy and other relevant information from us.</dd>

<dd>When you provide PII to us, we will make sure you are informed about the types of uses we will make of the information to the extent it is being used in a manner that differs from what is allowed pursuant to this Privacy Policy. We'll collect only as much personal information as we need for specific, identified purposes, and we won't use it for other purposes without obtaining your consent.</dd>

<dd><strong>Children under the Age of 13: </strong> In compliance with COPPA, we do not, however, knowingly collect or store PII from children under the age of thirteen. No one under age 13 may provide any personal information to or on the Website. If you are under 13, do not use or provide any information on this Website or on or through any of its features/register on the Website, make any purchases through the Website, use any of the interactive or public comment features of this Website or provide any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address or any screen name or user name you may use. If we learn we have collected or received personal information from a child under 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information. If you believe we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at info[at]ibtimes.com.
