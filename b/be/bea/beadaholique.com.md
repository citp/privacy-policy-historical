What information is collected? How do we use the information we collect? When you order, we need to know your name, e-mail address, mailing address, phone number, credit card number, and expiration date. This allows us to process and fulfill your order and to contact you of your order status—for example through a confirmation notice. We also collect e-mail addresses at various locations within the site, including when you order from the site so that we can send you any necessary e-mail messages related to your order, such as shipping notifications. We monitor customer traffic patterns and site usage to help us develop the design and layout of our online store and the products and services we offer. We do not share credit card information with third parties except for the purpose of processing payments for products you've ordered and as required by law.

How do we keep your customer information safe? When you place orders or access your account information, we use a secure server. The secure server software (SSL) encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. If at any time you would like us to delete any of your personal information on file, just e-mail: [service@beadaholique.com](mailto:service@beadaholique.com) , our customer service.
