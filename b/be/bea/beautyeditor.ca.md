BEAUTYEDITOR.ca (“BEAUTYEDITOR.ca”) is committed to respecting the privacy concerns of its visitors. BEAUTYEDITOR.ca has created this privacy policy (the “Policy”) to establish guidelines that will govern the collection, use, protection and disclosure of the personal and non-personal information of its visitors.

BEAUTYEDITOR.ca collects three kinds of information from the Website: (1) your voluntarily provided personal information; (2) anonymous non-personal information; and (3) “cookie” based information.

(1) Personal Information  
BEAUTYEDITOR.ca does not automatically collect personal information, such as name, address, phone number, email address and other personally identifiable information, from its visitors (“Personal Information”). From time to time, BEAUTYEDITOR.ca will collect Personal Information that is voluntarily provided by its visitors in filling out contest entry forms and subscribing to newsletters and other activities carried out on BEAUTYEDITOR.ca. BEAUTYEDITOR.ca will only collect and use such Personal Information solely for the purpose(s) disclosed by BEAUTYEDITOR.ca at the time of collection and only after the visitor has voluntarily agreed to such collection and use, by clicking “I agree” on the online form or in writing if entering via faxed or mailed form. BEAUTYEDITOR.ca also sometimes use email addresses that have been voluntarily provided by its visitors to respond to visitors who communicate with us, to inform winners of contests or to subscribe to newsletters. All emails from BEAUTYEDITOR.ca to its visitors include instructions on how to discontinue receipt of emails, newsletters and other communication from BEAUTYEDITOR.ca and visitors can discontinue such communication at any time. Email addresses from visitors who wish to discontinue receipt of BEAUTYEDITOR.ca’s emails will be removed from BEAUTYEDITOR.ca’s distribution list and databases. All Personal Information that may identify a visitor and has been collected with the visitor’s consent by BEAUTYEDITOR.ca is not disclosed in any identifiable form to any other party outside the company except for the fulfillment of the specific purpose identified to the visitor at the time of collection. However, BEAUTYEDITOR.ca may disclose such information in anonymous, aggregated and non-personally identifiable form to other parties for marketing, advertising or other purposes and to better understand visitors’ use of the Website.

Visitors should exercise caution when they disclosed personally identifiable information on comment forms, bulletin boards or chat rooms on BEAUTYEDITOR.ca or any other website. Such areas are accessible by anyone and may result in the visitor receiving unsolicited messages from other people and/or companies. Although BEAUTYEDITOR.ca is committed to protecting the Personal Information provided to it by its visitors in compliance with this Privacy Policy, it cannot guarantee the security of information, whether personal or otherwise, that visitors disclose online to publicly accessible bulletin boards or chat rooms.

(2) Anonymous Non-Personal Information  
When visitors visit BEAUTYEDITOR.ca, anonymous, non-personal information about their visit is automatically collected. Such information may include the length and date of the visit, how the visitor navigated the Website, what pages the visitor viewed, the type of browser being used by the visitor, the type of operating system used by the visitor and the domain name of the visitor’s Internet service provider. BEAUTYEDITOR.ca uses this Anonymous Non-Personal Information to track the success of BEAUTYEDITOR.ca with its visitors and to better tailor BEAUTYEDITOR.ca to visitors’ needs and interests. This Anonymous Non-Personal Information may be shared with other parties, such as broadcasters, advertisers, sponsors and partners.

(3) Cookie-based Information  
BEAUTYEDITOR.ca may use cookies. “Cookies” are pieces of information that a website transfers to a visitor’s hard drive for record keeping and identification purposes. Cookies are used to make the visitor’s use of a website easier by saving visitor preferences and passwords and to identify which areas of the website are popular and which areas need improvement and how to target certain advertising to its visitors.
