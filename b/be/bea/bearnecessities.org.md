Additionally, we may take personally identifiable information and de-identify it and share it in a de-
identified or aggregated form with third parties, advertisers and/or business partners in order to analyze
Site usage, demographics, or interests, improve our products or services, improve our user experience, or
for similar purposes. We will not re-identify such data and we will ask our contracting parties to agree to
keep the data in its de-identified form.
7.         Children
Bear Necessities does not knowingly collect personal information from children under age 13. If you are
under age 13, you are not permitted to use the Site or to submit any personal information to the Bear
Necessities offline or on the Site. If you are between 13 and 17 years of age, you may visit the Site, but
you may not submit any personal information. If we become aware that a Site user is under age 18 and

files. If you are a parent or guardian and believe Bear Necessities may have inadvertently collected
personal information from your child, please notify Bear Necessities immediately by sending an email to

8.        Protection of Personal Information
Bear Necessities uses reasonable administrative, physical and electronic security measures to protect
against the loss, misuse and alteration of personal information. No transmission of data over the internet is
guaranteed to be completely secure. It may be possible for third parties not under the control of Bear

protect personal information, neither Bear Necessities nor our service providers can ensure or warrant the
security of any information you transmit to us over the internet. Any such transmission is at your own risk.

You are responsible for keeping your information current. You may update your information by contacting
us at office@bearnecessities.org. We will use reasonable efforts to process any change you make;

processing and retention policies and all applicable legal obligations.
10.       Links
You may have the opportunity to follow links on the Site to other sites that may be of interest to you. Bear
Necessities endeavors to only link to reputable organizations. Because other sites may not be hosted or

provided thereon. Therefore, the privacy policies with respect to other sites may differ from those
applicable to the Site. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of each other site. This Privacy
Policy only applies to information collected and maintained by Bear Necessities.
