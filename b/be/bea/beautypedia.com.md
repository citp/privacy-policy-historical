# Privacy & Security: Paula's Choice Skincare & Cosmetics

We respect your privacy and the information you provide will NOT be sold, shared, or disseminated in any way.

Paula's Choice has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information-gathering and dissemination practices for this web site: www.paulaschoice.com. This also applies to www.cosmeticscop.com and www.beautypedia.com. 

We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our web site. We do not sell or trade lists with anyone.

Our site uses cookies to keep track of your shopping cart and your account settings. Cookies are also used to track your Site usage so we can enhance your shopping experience by showing you appropriate product recommendations and promotions.

We partner with a third party ad network to display advertising on our website, as well as advertising on other sites. Our ad network partner uses cookies to collect non-personally identifiable information about your web activity to provide you targeted advertising based on your interests. (To Opt-Out of Behavioral targeting, please visit the choice/opt-out section below).

Our site's registration form requires users to give us contact information (like their name and email address). The customer's contact information is used to contact the visitor when necessary. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings at any time; see the choice/opt-out section below.

Our site uses an order form for customers to request information and purchase products. We collect visitor's contact information (like their email address) and financial information (like their account or credit card numbers). Contact information from the order form is used to send orders to our customers. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the Choice/Opt-Out section below. Financial information that is collected is used to bill the user for products and services.

Our online surveys ask visitors for contact information (like their email address) and demographic information (like their ZIP code, age, or income level). We use contact data from our surveys to send the user information about our company. The customer's contact information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the Choice/Opt-Out section below. Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. We use this data to tailor our visitor's experience at our site, showing them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences.

We run contests on our site in which we ask visitors for contact information (like their email address) and demographic information (like their ZIP code, age, or income level). We use contact data from our contests to send users information about our company. 

## Security

This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. In addition to using a secure server system that encrypts your order information, orders with payment information are not transmitted to us. Instead, a designated individual in the company accesses the orders using a password-protected back office system. Orders are retrieved once via this system and then deleted from the secure server. Each order is then processed manually using the same process we use for fax and telephone orders. At no time is your payment information or any personal data transmitted to a third party for verification or processing. Once the order is retrieved, all portions of the order fulfillment process are handled internally.
