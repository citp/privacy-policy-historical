# Beats by Dr. Dre - Privacy Policy

Your privacy is important to Beats Electronics, LLC. This Privacy Policy is provided to inform you of our policies and practices regarding how we collect, use, disclose, transfer and store information about you.

* ## OUR PRIVACY COMMITMENT

Beats Electronics, LLC and each of its affiliated companies (“ **Beats** ,” “ **we** ,” “ **us** ” or “ **our** ”) is committed to respecting the privacy rights of all users of the Beats website where this Privacy Policy is posted (each, a “ **Site** ”) and persons who may contact Beats at our stores and call centers, and through our contests, sweepstakes, and online surveys or use of applications and/or software we may make available from time to time (we refer to the Site, the services made available through the Site, and other services and applications made available by Beats collectively, as the “ **Beats Features** ”). As such, we have established and implemented this Privacy Policy to inform visitors to the Site and users of the Beats Features how we use and protect the information we collect through the Site and the Beats Features. By visiting the Site or using any of the Beats Features, you consent to Beats' collection, use, disclosure, transfer and storage of information relating to you as set forth in this Privacy Policy.

This policy answers the following questions:

  * What information do we collect about you and how do we use it?
  * How do we share your personal information with third parties?
  * How can you access your personal information?
  * What choices do you have about the collection and use of your personal information?
  * That security measures do we take to safeguard your personal information?


* ## WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU AND HOW DO WE USE IT?

**Types of Information We Collect**

Personal information means information that can be used to identify or contact a single person. You may need to submit personal information to access certain aspects of the Site and to access or use certain of the Beats Features.

We collect personal information when you subscribe to the Beats Army (i.e., sign up to receive marketing communications); create a Beats account; participate in feedback forms, product reviews, questionnaires, surveys, contests or sweepstakes; purchase a product through the Beats Features; register a product; request product availability updates; download a software update or application; or receive customer or technical support.

We may collect information from you such as your name, address, zip code, email address, telephone number, language, gender, location information, and date of birth when utilizing the Site and Beats Features. When registering products through the Site we also collect information about your products and where you purchased your products. When you are purchasing products through the Beats Features, you will also be required to provide a billing address and credit card or other payment information. Your credit card and other payment information will not be collected unless you have decided to purchase one of Beats' products.

When you share information and Site links, send or share Beats promotions and marketing materials, or send products to family and friends and others, Beats may collect the information you provide about those people such as name, address, email address and phone number. 

We may also collect information when you register for a Beats account by logging into an account that you already have with certain third-party social networking sites (“SNS”) (including, but not limited to, Facebook and Google+) via our Beats Features. For example, the Beats Features allow you to create an account and login using your Facebook account credentials through Facebook Connect. If you are not currently registered as an account holder on the Site and you click on “Sign in Using Facebook,” you will first be asked to enter your Facebook credentials and then be given the option to register and create a Beats account. We may gather information regarding your SNS profile and other SNS information.

We may combine information you give us with other information from Beats sources, transactions and communications. This may include, but is not limited to, information from Beats retail stores, direct mail, catalogs, events, products and applications or other Beats interactions. We may combine that information with data that is publicly available and data from third parties to personalize your experience and provide communication, content and features matching your profile and interests.

**How We Use Your Personal Information**

The personal information you provide to us will allow us to fulfill your product or service order; alert you of new products or services, features, or enhancements; handle your customer service questions or issues; administer promotions, contests and sweepstakes; register your products; display relevant marketing to you; provide you software and application updates and upgrades; and notify you of promotions, updates, or special offers that we think may interest you. If you have agreed to receive marketing, we also use your email address and phone number as part of the Beats Features in sending you messages about the Beats Features and other general announcements.

We keep track of your interactions with us, including but not limited to your activity within the Beats Features. We may use personal information that you provide to us to send messages to you in response to your request to perform an activity in connection with your use of any of the Beats Features. From time to time, we may use your personal information to send important notices, such as communications about purchases and changes to our terms, conditions, and policies. Because this information is important to your interaction with Beats, you may not opt out of receiving these communications.

If you decide to create your account by logging into a SNS via the Beats Features, you are using the personal information you have already provided to the SNS (such as your “real” name, email address and other information you make publicly available via the SNS) to create your account on our Site; the information we collect may depend on the privacy settings you have with the SNS, so please consult the SNS’s privacy and data practices. For example, by using Facebook Connect, you are allowing Beats to access personal information in your Facebook account pursuant to the Facebook Terms of Use regarding your use of the Beats Features via Facebook.

We may use your personal information that we collect through the Beats Features for analytical and statistical purposes (the “ **Analytical Data** ”). We may use parts of Analytical Data that do not personally identify you for any commercial purpose, including sharing with service providers. We will not sell or trade any part of the Analytical Data that personally identifies any Beats Features users. 

**Cookies and Other Technologies**

Our Site and certain of the Beats Features may use “cookies” and other technologies such as pixel tags and web beacons. These technologies help us better understand user behavior, tell us which parts of our website people have visited, and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches. We treat information collected by cookies and other technologies as non-personal information so long as the information cannot be used to identify you. However, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal information by local law, we treat these identifiers as personal information.

“Cookies" are small bits of electronic information that a website sends to a visitor's browser and are stored on the visitor's hard drive. Like many websites, we employ cookies and other technologies in certain areas of the Site to allow us to provide information to make your online experience more convenient. For example, when you return to the Site after logging in, cookies provide information to the Site so that the Site will remember who you are on subsequent visits, speeding up or enhancing your experience of the Beats Features by, for instance, tailoring content to you. Cookies also prevent items placed in a shopping basket from disappearing by the time you checkout. Beats and our partners also use cookies and other technologies to remember personal information when you use our Beats Features.

If you want to disable cookies on your web browser through your browser settings, please consult your browser’s help menu for assistance. Please note that certain Beats Features will not be available once cookies are disabled.

In some of our email messages, we use a “click-through URL” linked to content on the Site. When customers click one of these URLs, they pass through a separate web server before arriving at the destination page on our website. We track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications. If you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you should not click text or graphic links in the email messages.

A pixel tag or web beacon is an often-transparent graphic image, usually no larger than 1 pixel by 1 pixel, that is placed on a website or in an email that is used to monitor the behavior of the user visiting the website or sending the email. We may use web beacons and/or pixel tags for many purposes, including site usage analytics, advertising, auditing and reporting, and content and advertising personalization. 

**Targeted Advertising**

Beats and our partners use cookies and other technologies to remember personal information about your visits to our Site and other websites to control the number of times you see a given ad, deliver ads that relate to your interests, and measure the effectiveness of ad campaigns. If you do not want to receive ads with this level of relevance, you can opt out by clicking [here](http://preferences.truste.com/). If you opt out, you will continue to receive the same number of ads, but they may be less relevant because they will not be based on your interests. You may still see ads related to the content on a web page or based on other non-personal information. 

**Information Collected Automatically**

Our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit the Site. This information includes your Internet Protocol address, your browser type and version, the search engine you used to find the Beats Features, if any, referring and exit pages, date/time stamp and clickstream data, which Beats Features you use and when and how long you use them. We use this information to monitor and analyze how users use the Beats Features, to provide customer service, to maintain and improve the Beats Features, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may use this information in our marketing and advertising services.

We use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”) to collect certain information relating to your use of the Site. Google uses cookies to collect and process data about your use of the Site. For more information regarding how Google uses data when you use our Site, please visit www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/.

**Children's Privacy**

We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we learn that we have collected the personal information of a child under the age of 13, we will delete the information as soon as possible. We take children's privacy seriously, and encourage parents to play an active role in their children's online experience at all times. 

* ## HOW DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES?
