# B*tween Productions Privacy Policy - Beacon Street Girls

B*tween Productions, Inc.™ is committed to protecting your online privacy and the safety of all of our website users. Our website, located at www.beaconstreetgirls.com, is the place in cyberspace where fans of the Beacon Street Girls can come to find out more about their favorite Beacon Street Girls™, play games and have their opinions published. 

**B*tween Productions, Inc. Online Privacy Policy**   
At beaconstreetgirls.com, we believe in the power of children and we urge both children and their parents to use and enjoy our website. While we encourage the interactive nature of online media, we hope to educate children and parents on safeguarding your privacy when using the Internet. As such, we want you to check with your parents before entering information on this or any other website. Our information collection practices are described below. 

**What Information Is Collected?**   
It's our policy to create website content that requires minimum collection of information from our visitors. Generally, we limit our collection of information from children to what is known as non-personally identifiable information (e.g. screen name, birthdate, and email address). This information is collected so children can participate in activities (e.g. post messages, play online games) without giving unnecessary personal information. From time to time, however, we may request limited personally identifiable information (e.g. child's email address and/or email address of parent or third party), as explained below, in order to conduct online contests or sweepstakes or offer other online activities (e.g. electronic postcards, videos, e-newsletters). We do not condition a child's participation in any of our online activities on the disclosure of more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity. 

**Use of Information**   
At beaconstreetgirls.com we use or may use personally identifiable information that children provide for such purposes as sending requested electronic postcards, email messages and videos on their behalf, and conducting contests or sweepstakes, and responding to their questions regarding our products and services. Other than as described below under "Parental Access and Certain Disclosures", we currently do not disclose to third parties personally identifiable information that children provide, except from time to time, we may transfer, disclose or share such information with third parties who may be engaged by us specifically to handle and deliver certain online activities (e.g. conducting contests and sweepstakes). Such third parties have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. Additionally, in the event that all or substantially all of our assets are acquired by another entity, personally identifiable information submitted to us may be transferred to the acquiring entity. Finally, we may also disclose personally identifiable information to third parties in order to comply with the law or requests by law enforcement agencies, to enforce our Web Site Terms and Conditions and protect the rights, property or safety of our website, users of our website and others. 

**Electronic Newsletter Subscription**   
We offer children the opportunity to sign up to receive the Beacon Street Girls newsletter by email, (e.g. joining "Club BSG".) When a child asks to receive our email newsletter, the child is asked to provide his or her email address, and the email address of his or her parent (if he or she is under the age of 13.) We send the child's parent a notification email informing the parent of the child's request to receive by email the Beacon Street Girls newsletter on an ongoing basis and give the parent the option to have his or her child's information removed from our Beacon Street Girls newsletter database. At any time after receiving this notification email, the child's parent has the opportunity to exercise the option to request that we stop sending the child the Beacon Street Girls newsletter and have the child's information removed from our Beacon Street Girls newsletter by following the "unsubscribe" instructions found in either their initial notification email or at the end of any of the Beacon Street Girls newsletter emails. In addition, parents may at any time review any identifiable information collected about their child (see Parental Access and Certain Disclosures below). 

Information collected for the Beacon Street Girls newsletters is used to send the child the electronic newsletter, provide lost passwords and user names, and may be transferred, disclosed, or shared with third parties who may be engaged by us specifically to handle the preparation and delivery of the electronic newsletter and perform other related technical and processing functions. These third parties may not use it for other purposes and have agreed to maintain the confidentiality of such information. In addition, joining Club BSG allows the child to post comments, questions, book and film reviews, as well as enter some of our contests.  All comments are reviewed before they are published to the site and no personal information is allowed.

**Contests and Sweepstakes**

Occasionally we may offer contests and sweepstakes which may be entered online. Most of our contests are open to Club BSG members (who have provided us with their email addresses (and, if under 14, the email address of a parent.)  To participate in a one-time contest or sweepstakes, a child is asked to provide his or her email address. When we conduct contests or sweepstakes that may involve more than a one-time contact, we ask additionally for the email address of his or her parent. In such types of contests or sweepstakes, we give the parent the option to have the child's entry deleted. All the information we collect is securely maintained and used only for the purpose of conducting the contest or sweepstakes. Once the one-time contest or sweepstakes is finished, we then delete any personal information collected. Information collected in a contest or sweepstakes may be passed to a fulfillment house which may use the information to help run the contest or sweepstakes and may not use it for other purposes and has agreed to maintain the confidentiality of such information. 

**Electronic Postcards, Videos and Email Messages**   
We provide children the opportunity to send electronic postcards, online games or videos featuring Beacon Street Girls characters or original artwork and videos to family or friends. We may also feature information about products that children are interested in and from time to time may send, on behalf of children who request it, email messages to family and/or friends to let family and/or friends share their interest. We may ask for a first name, but we do not require children to submit personally identifiable information about themselves in order to send an electronic postcard or for beaconstreetgirls.com to send email messages to family or friends. We do, however, ask children to submit the email address of the recipient of such electronic postcards or email messages. We may also provide the opportunity to send e-mail or post comments to the Beacon Street Girls through our website. We may ask for first names, but we request no personally identifiable information except an e-mail address, which we use for the purpose of responding to messages and/or requests. 

All information collected for electronic postcards, video and email messages is used only to send the requested electronic postcard, video or email message and to respond to email questions and/or requests and is deleted from our system once the electronic postcard, video, email message or email response is sent. 

**Information Received from the Beacon Street Girls Shop**   
The website for the Beacon Street Girls Shop, (the "Shop") which is hosted and operated by a third party, and is independent and separate from beaconstreetgirls.com, collects personal information about its users and shares and transfers such information with us. We use the personal information we receive internally within B*tween Productions, Inc. but we do not sell, transfer or share the information with third parties except from time to time, we may transfer, disclose or share such information with third parties who may be engaged by us specifically to handle and manage certain functions (e.g. fulfilling contests and sweepstakes conducted on the Shop to which we are sponsors). Such third parties have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes and have agreed to maintain the confidentiality of any information they receive from us. Additionally, in the event that all or substantially all of the assets relating to beaconstreetgirls.com are transferred or sold to another entity, personal information we received from the Shop may be transferred to the acquiring entity. Finally, we may also disclose personal information about Shop users to third parties in order to comply with law or requests by law enforcement agencies, to enforce the Shop's Terms and Conditions or to protect the rights, property or safety of the Shop's users and others. 

**Cookies and Log Data**   
A "cookie" is a small information file that your web browser places on the hard drive of your computer when you visit a website. Cookies cannot damage user files, nor can they read information from a user's hard drive. Cookies allow websites to "remember" users activities on a website as well as users visits to a site. At beaconstreetgirls.com, cookies are used to determine the number of unique visitors to our website over a given period and to remember user screen names so that the need for multiple log-ins is eliminated. We do not store any personal information into cookies nor do we link or combine information collected through cookies to any personal information that children submit online when participating in our activities. You or your parents can disable cookies on your computer by indicating this in the preferences or options menus in your browser. 

Log data collected on web servers within beaconstreetgirls.com's control supplies us with aggregate information about the number of visits to different pages on our site. We use such aggregate information to improve access to our content based on our visitors' browsers and operating system types to make our content available to as many children as possible. We do not link the log data collected to the personal information that children submit online when participating in our activities. 

**Parental Access and Certain Disclosures**   
While we make every effort to make your child's visit to beaconstreetgirls.com safe and enjoyable, we encourage you to monitor your child's online use and to help us protect children's privacy by instructing them never to provide personal information on this or any other website without parental permission. We never require a child to disclose more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in a contest, game or other activity and we never ask for last names or home addresses. 

We might collect an e-mail address from your child under 13 without your consent, but only if a child under 13 sends a specific request to us. We keep their e-mail address long enough to respond to them and delete this information from our system after we answer their question. If a child under 13 signs up for the Beacon Street Girls' Club BSG, or other activity which requires multiple online contact with the child, we ask the child for a parent's e-mail address so we can notify the parent and provide an opportunity to opt out. 

We may have special site activities or promotions like contests or sweepstakes which are open to children even if they are under 13. In these activities, we are not allowed to ask for more information from your child than what is necessary for your child to participate in the activity. We require your child to give us your e-mail address, too, so that we can tell you that they have registered in a promotion or for a service. If we need more than an e-mail address to enter your child in the promotion or offer the service, we will notify you, explain what information we need and why, and generally ask that you (not your child) provide it. For instance, we might ask you for your mailing address so that we can send to you, for your child, any prizes your child wins, or for your telephone number so that we can tell you when your child has won. Any information you or your child give us in the above special circumstances will be deleted from our database once the promotion, program or activity is concluded, and after any legally required period for keeping such information is complete. 

Please note that due to the nature of the relationship between our fictional characters and children, children occasionally tell us things that they wouldn't tell other adults. In certain circumstances, if we deem it appropriate, we may send a special email to the address provided by a child suggesting that the child contact a children's help line or similar agency. If the circumstances appear to us to be dangerous, extreme or unlawful, we may contact appropriate law enforcement or other authorities and provide as much information as possible to aid such authorities - including personally identifiable information. 

We do not require a child to disclose more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in a contest, sweepstake, game or other activity as a condition of participation. Upon proper identification, parents may review the personal information we have collected about their child, request deletion, or refuse to allow further collection or use by sending us a written request to our contact address listed at the end of this policy. Please understand, if you ask us to delete your child's information, we may have to ask your child not to participate in our activities. Also, for the reasons outlined above, we reserve the right to not delete information at a parent's request and to not release information to a parent if, in either case, we believe that doing so may endanger the child or would be inappropriate given the involvement of any law enforcement or other authorities. 

**Security**

We have taken steps to ensure that personally identifiable information collected is secure, including limiting the number of people who have physical access to our database servers as well as electronic security systems and password protections which guard against unauthorized access. 

We may provide links to other websites that may have their own information collection practices.  These other websites are governed by their own privacy policies or information collection practices, which may be substantially different from ours. We encourage visitors to other websites to review the privacy policies and information collection practices of those websites.
