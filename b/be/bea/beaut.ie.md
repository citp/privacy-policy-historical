Beaut.ie uses some third party software and systems to carry out tasks related to the operation of the website – for example Google.

We never share first party / personally identifiable information from Beaut.ie website or associated apps with any third parties without your explicit consent.

Facebook both acts as a data controller and a data processor for Beaut.ie. We use Facebook [Custom Audiences](https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/customaudience) to group users of Beaut.ie into interest audiences if they are logged into Facebook and engage either with any of  Beaut.ie’s Facebook posts, or engage with content on the Beaut.ie website, by use of a tracking pixel. We do this to better present audiences with more relevant content, be it editorial or advertising content. Any information collected is either of a non personal nature, or if personalised then the information is anonymised by Facebook, as per their [terms of use](https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/customaudience). You can opt in or out of such functionality when registering an account with Facebook or opt in to any such services Facebook offers. Furthermore, you can view and manage any websites that have access to your information by using the “[Off Facebook Activity](https://www.facebook.com/off-facebook-activity)” tool.
