# Privacy and Security | Beauty Brands

**beautybrands.com** values its customers and respects their privacy. Customer information is collected in an effort to improve your online experience and to communicate with you about our products, services, contests and promotions. **beautybrands.com** only communicates with you in regard to an order placed, or if you register to be notified of special deals or enter a contest or promotion on our website. We do not share, trade or sell your information to anyone outside of **beautybrands.com** without your prior consent.

This Privacy Policy covers any personal information that **beautybrands.com** obtains from you when you use our website. We invite you to check back periodically to see if we have made any changes. If we make any material changes, we will post a notice on our homepage. By using our site, you agree to the terms of our policy.

#### What information does **beautybrands.com** protect?

We need to know your name, email address, mailing address, and credit card or debit card number and expiration date. This allows us to process and fulfill your order and to notify you of your order status.

When you enter a contest or other promotional feature, we may ask for your name, address and email address so we can administer the contest and notify winners. We may also use the information we collect to occasionally notify you about important functionality changes to our website, new **beauty brands** locations, services and special offers we think you might find valuable.

#### How **beautybrands.com** protects your information?

**beautybrands.com** realizes that our customers trust us to protect their personal information. We take that responsibility seriously. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your personal information. For example, we use industry-standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) authentication to protect the confidentiality of online transactions made on our site. SSL authentication and encryption of the information that you send to us over the internet help protect your online transaction information from third-party interception.

We never display your full credit card number once it has been entered. We will only reveal the last four digits of your credit card for verification purposes. We urge you to protect your own privacy. We recommend that you do not share your password with anyone or share your log-in information or password in an unsolicited phone call or email. Unfortunately, despite all of our efforts, there is always a risk that third parties may unlawfully intercept transmissions. This reality is true of all internet use. As a result, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit, and you transmit all information at your own risk.
