Privacy Policy

  


**beauty brands** Privacy Policy for all publications, conferences and properties 

**beauty brands** recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of information provided by visitors to our website. We have created the following guidelines to demonstrate our commitment to the issue of privacy. 

Our web server automatically recognizes and collects the domain name and IP address of visitors to our websites. In addition, we collect aggregate information on what web pages visitors access or visit, and information volunteered by the visitor, such as survey information and/or site registrations. We collect email addresses of visitors who post messages to our bulletin boards, make postings to our website, and/or voluntarily subscribe to our email newsletters. The information we collect is used to improve the content of our web pages, customize the content and/or layout for each individual visitor, and for us to contact visitors about our products and services as explained below. 

We occasionally set cookies for sites that require registration, but these cookies are not used to store information other than user name and password. Cookies may also be used to help deliver advertisements and/or unique content to users. 

We allow registered users of our products and services to "opt out" of receiving email from **beauty brands** and outside companies at the time of registration. When a user has given permission, email addresses may be used for promotional purposes for relevant reputable offers. If you do not want to receive these emails, please send your email address to the email address listed below.

Postal addresses and telephone numbers collected on-line may be used for periodic mailings and/or phone calls from us with information on new products and services or upcoming events, and from other reputable companies. If you do not wish to be contacted by third-party companies by mail or phone, provide your name, address and telephone number to privacy@beautybrands.com, and we will be sure your name is removed from the list we share with other organizations. When contacting us, please include the titles of publications to which you subscribe. 

From time to time, we may use customer information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our privacy policy. If our information practices change at some time in the future, we will post the policy changes to our web site. You will always have the ability to opt out of these new uses. If you are concerned about how your information is used, bookmark this page and check back periodically. 

**beauty brands** takes every precaution to protect users' information from unauthorized use. When users submit sensitive information via our web site, the information is protected both online and offline. When our registration/subscription form asks for credit card number, or other sensitive information, that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. If you feel this site is not following this privacy policy, or if you have any further questions, please contact us at:
