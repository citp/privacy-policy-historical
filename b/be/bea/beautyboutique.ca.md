## 2\. What Type of Personal Information Do We Collect and How?

We limit the collection of personal information to what is reasonably required to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected. We collect personal information, as defined below, in a variety of ways, including: directly from you, from third parties, through in-store technologies, and when you are interacting with us online or through our mobile applications. 

### A. How We Define Personal Information

**“Personal information”** is any information that identifies you or could be reasonably associated with you. The personal information we collect may include contact information such as your name, email address, home address, and phone numbers, as well as information about the specific products and services that you purchase in our retail stores or from us online, information provided to us in connection with our programs, products and/or services and/or information collected automatically when you interact with us online or visit our retail stores.

Personal information that we collect may include:

  * **Personal transactional information,** when you make purchases using a _PC Financial_ payment product such as account transactions and the merchants (name, type and location) that you made purchases from. This type of information is also generated by the use of your loyalty and e-commerce accounts and may include information about your purchases
  * **Personal financial information,** through the use of your _PC Financial_ payment product accounts, such as information about your account balances, account numbers, payment history, credit limits and credit scores
  * **Personal health information,** through the use of any of our healthcare services provided by pharmacists, dietitians, opticians, nurses, nurse practitioners, respiratory therapists and other healthcare providers which includes any information that identifies or can identify you and relates to the state of your health or the treatment you are receiving. More specifically, personal health information means both diagnostic, treatment and care information, and/or registration information with our healthcare services.



### B. How We Collect Personal Information

We collect personal information in the following ways:

**Directly From You**

You may provide personal information to us in our stores, by mail, by email, over the telephone, through our websites or mobile applications or in any other direct manner.

_For example:_

_When you voluntarily share information about yourself with us, we will collect that information in order to provide you with our programs, products or services, respond to your inquiry, or for any other purpose disclosed to you at that time._

**From Other Sources**

Occasionally, we may receive personal information from other sources. In these cases, we receive your personal information from these other sources with your consent or if the law requires or permits us to do so (e.g., to meet our anti-money laundering compliance obligations).

_For example:_

_If you apply for a PC Financial payment product, upon obtaining your consent, we may collect information from credit bureaus in order to process your application and determine whether you qualify for a specific product._

**From Used Technologies at Our Locations**

We may collect personal information through various types of technologies used in our stores (e.g., grocery, pharmacy). These can include our point-of-sale systems, video surveillance or other similar types of technologies (including, for example, anonymous video analytics which allows us to track the number of individuals in our stores and consider certain demographic information about our customer base on an anonymous basis) which we may use from time to time.

_For example:_

  * _We use video surveillance in areas surrounding our stores, pharmacies, kiosks, pavilions, bank machines, parking lots and other locations: for security purposes, to protect against theft, to prevent damage to our properties, and to prevent fraud._
  * _We may also use anonymous video analytics to help manage our stores, understand our customer base and improve customer experience._



**Through Our Websites and Mobile Applications**

We may collect certain types of information electronically when you interact with our websites, email, mobile applications, social media accounts, online advertising, or through the use of our or a third party’s technologies, which include cookies, web beacons, single pixel gifs and other technologies such as Data Management Platforms (DMPs). This information helps us understand what actions you take on our websites and mobile applications and allows our websites and mobile applications to work correctly.

We may combine this information with other information collected in-store or online such as your online and in-store transaction history. We do this to support our customer understanding using website and mobile analytics and to provide you with more tailored advertising and marketing campaigns. This includes serving interest-based advertising to you, subject to your right to withdraw consent, as detailed in our [Interest-Based Advertising and Media Notice](https://web.archive.org/content/dam/lclcorp/pdfs/Privacy/Interest-Based-Advertising-and-Media-Notice_Final_Feb5-2019-EN.pdf).

_For example:_

  * _We use your location or language preference to auto-select features when you visit our websites and mobile applications._
  * _We use your online and/or in-store purchase history to provide you with interest-based advertisements on products that you purchase frequently._
  * _We collect, combine and categorize your personal information on an aggregated basis to identify online and offline purchasing patterns to help us analyze our businesses to better serve customers._



The technologies we use include:

  * **Cookies,** which are small text files that are saved on your computer when you visit a website so that information can be saved between visits, such as your login credentials or language preferences. For example, cookies allow you to log in quickly when you visit our sites.
  * **Web beacons,** and **single pixel gifs,** which are small image files that have information about you, such as your IP address, that can be downloaded when you visit a website or open an email. This allows us to understand your online behaviour, monitor our email delivery, and provide you with interest-based advertising. These tools also allow our third-party tracking tools to gather information, such as your IP address, and provide this back to us in an anonymized, aggregate form (i.e. in a manner that prevents us from identifying you personally). Aggregate information refers to personal information compiled and expressed in a summary form where no personal identifiers are included.
  * **Other technologies,** such as DMP services and analytics engines, which pull usage data from multiple sources and help manage and collect this data to use for personalization, interest-based advertising, customizing content and other methods to gain insights into our customers’ needs and preferences.



We may use Google Analytics, a web analysis service of Google Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics uses cookies to analyze your use of our websites, to create reports about visitor activities for us and to provide further services associated with the use of the websites and the Internet. Although this information is collected through your Google ad settings, it is not provided to us in a personally-identifiable format.

You may delete or disable certain of these technologies at any time via your browser. However, if you do so, you may not be able to use some of the features on our websites or mobile applications.

## 4\. How Do We Share Personal Information?

We may share your personal information within our group of companies or with our service providers (companies operating on our behalf) and other third parties (companies with which we provide programs, products or services) for the purposes described in this policy and in accordance with applicable law. We do not sell your personal information to any organization or person; the only exception to this would be if we sell or transfer any part of our business.

Additionally, if you use a program, product or service that involves another person (e.g. a bank account that is jointly owned, or where you have a guarantor for a loan or if you add household members to your loyalty or financial account), we may share your personal information with that person as necessary and in connection with that program, product or service. The information shared with or available to these other persons will be identified at the time of application or registration for that program, product or service. 

We will not share your personal information outside of our group of companies, except as indicated below.

### A. Service Providers

In the course of providing our programs, products, services, promotions, contests and events we may share personal information with our service providers. These service providers help us operate our business, technology systems and applications, internal procedures, infrastructure and advertising and marketing. They provide services to us such as data hosting, contest administration, email deployment, call centre, marketing, sales and processing or analysis of personal information. We require these service providers to limit their access to and/or use of personal information to what is required to provide their services and to comply with our privacy requirements.

_For example:_

_Personal information collected from contest participants may be shared with our contest administrator to contact selected participants._

### B. Third Parties

In the course of providing certain of our programs, products and services, we may do so through arrangements with third parties. As a result, your personal information may be collected, used and shared by us and the applicable third party. These third parties may have their own privacy policies and terms and conditions, which will govern their use of your personal information. You will be informed upon signing up for the relevant program, product or service of the third party arrangement so that you can review the relevant privacy policies that apply.

_For example:_

  * _The PC mobile pre-paid service, which is offered through Loblaws Inc., is provided by a carrier that is identified in connection with that service._
  * _The PC insurance service, which is offered through PC Financial Insurance Broker Inc., is provided by a select number of insurance companies that are identified in connection with that service._
  * _The PC Express home delivery service, which is offered through Loblaws Inc., is provided by a third party delivery company that is identified in connection with that service._



### C. Sale or Transfer of Business or Other Transaction

We may decide to sell or transfer all or part of our business to a related company or to a third party, to merge with another entity, to insure or securitize our assets, or to engage in another form of corporate or financing transaction (including the proceedings of insolvency or bankruptcy), corporate reorganization, share sale, or other change in corporate control. If your personal information is required in connection with any such transactions, we will comply with the legal requirements for the disclosure of personal information.

### D. Other Permitted Reasons

Canadian law permits or requires the use, sharing, or disclosure of personal information without consent in specific circumstances (e.g., when investigating and preventing suspected or actual illegal activities, including fraud, or to assist government and law enforcement agencies). These circumstances include situations when permitted or required by law or when necessary to protect our group of companies, our employees, our customers, or others. If this happens, we will not share more personal information than is reasonably required to fulfill that particular purpose.

### E. With Your Consent

Other than the purposes listed above, we may, with your implied or express consent, share or disclose your personal information outside of our group of companies, in accordance with applicable law.

## 5\. How Do We Manage Consent?

By subscribing to our programs, products and services and/or submitting information to us in connection with using our programs, products and services, you are providing your consent to the collection, use and disclosure of personal information as set out in this policy. In some cases, your consent may be “implied” i.e. your permission is assumed based on your action or inaction at the point of collection, use or sharing of your personal information. 

We will obtain consent when we want to use personal information for a new purpose or for a purpose other than those stated at the time of collection in this policy or in the terms and conditions of a specific program, product, service, contest, promotion or event you signed up for, participated in or purchased.

Your consent can be withdrawn at any time, except in limited circumstances, including legal or regulatory requirements or as a result of your contractual obligations with us. For information on how to manage your privacy preferences, please see How Do I Change My Privacy Choices?

_For example:_

_To obtain credit products, you are required to provide consent on your application to the ongoing collection, use and sharing of your personal information to allow us to obtain and to update credit reports and other credit history information about you from time to time with credit bureau agencies and other entities that support the credit reporting system. Your consent for these purposes cannot be withdrawn during the time you have credit with us and for a reasonable period afterwards._

If you choose not to provide us with certain personal information or if you withdraw your consent, where such withdrawal is available, we may not be able to offer you the programs, products, services, contests, promotions, events or information that you requested or that could be offered to you.

## 6\. How Do I Change My Privacy Choices?

We want you to clearly understand your choices and make informed decisions about your privacy options. There are several options available for you to manage your privacy preferences, including, for example: managing your preferences within your account(s), contacting us directly, changing your browser settings on your device, and/or, where available, using third party unsubscribe functionality. 

### A. Within Your Account(s)

If you have an account with us (e.g., _PC Optimum_ account), you can update your preferences where customer preference options are available through the relevant program, product or service.

### B. When You Register Or By Contacting Us Directly

  * Receiving email or SMS marketing communications at the time that you register for our programs, products or services, enter our contests or promotions or any time thereafter through your online account(s)

Please note the following regarding withdrawal of consent or changes in your privacy preferences:

  * Even if you have opted out of receiving marketing communications from us, we may still contact you for transactional purposes, in compliance with applicable laws (e.g., for customer service, product information, service or reminder notices, or recalls). We may also need to contact you with questions or information regarding your order, such as order status, shipment, or refunds; and
  * It may take some time for all of our records to reflect changes in your preferences (e.g., if you request that you not receive personalized marketing communications from Loblaw, your preference may not be captured for a promotion already in progress).



### C. Changing Your Browser Settings on Your Device

We use technologies to enhance your customer experience and present offers to you, including interest-based advertisements (see our [Interest-Based Advertising and Media Notice](https://web.archive.org/content/dam/lclcorp/pdfs/Privacy/Interest-Based-Advertising-and-Media-Notice_Final_Feb5-2019-EN.pdf)). For example, technologies such as cookies allow us to recognize when you use or return to our websites, providing you with a more seamless experience.

## 7\. How Do We Protect and Store Personal Information?

We take the security of your personal information very seriously and are committed to protecting your privacy by using a combination of administrative, physical, and technical safeguards. These measures include multi-factor authentication, masking, encryption, logging and monitoring, described below. We store your personal information for as long as it is necessary to provide you with our programs, products, and services and for a reasonable time thereafter, or as permitted or required by law. 

### A. How We Protect Personal Information

To protect your personal information, we maintain administrative, technical, and physical safeguards in our stores, pavilions, kiosks, offices, digital properties, and information storage facilities. By having these safeguards, we aim to avoid the loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, or modification of your personal information that we hold. These safeguards also apply when we dispose of or destroy your personal information.

For example, where appropriate, we use the following safeguards:

  * **Multi-Factor Authentication,** which is a method of confirming your identity by using more than one way to authenticate you, such as asking for your password and a code that is sent to your email address or phone number;
  * **Masking,** which is the process of obscuring your information so that the structure remains the same but the content is no longer identifiable;
  * **Anonymization,** which is the process of altering your data so that it can no longer be used to identify you personally;
  * **Encryption,** which is the process of obscuring your information in order to make it unreadable without the use of a code or a key; and
  * **Logging and monitoring,** which is the process of tracking, recording and monitoring activity related to the access and/or use of your accounts or personal information.



### B. Where We Keep Personal Information

We use all reasonable safeguards, including contractual requirements with our service providers, to protect your personal information wherever it is used or stored. In general, we store, access and use personal information in Canada. Some of our service providers may access, process or store your personal information outside of your province, territory or Canada in the course of providing their services to us. When we engage a service provider that operates outside of Canada, personal information may be stored, processed, accessed or used in another country. In that case, the personal information is subject to the law of the jurisdiction in which it is used or stored, including any law permitting or requiring disclosure of the information to the government, government agencies, courts and law enforcement in that jurisdiction. The countries where our service providers are currently located include the United States, the Netherlands, India, El Salvador and the Philippines.

### C. How Long We Keep Personal Information

We will store your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, except where otherwise required or permitted by law (e.g., healthcare providers must retain patient records in accordance with their statutory retention obligations). Once no longer required, your personal information will be securely destroyed or anonymized (so the information no longer identifies you).

Please note that if your personal information is collected by a third party, it will be retained in accordance with the privacy policies and records retention requirements of that third party.

## 8\. How Do I Request Access to My Personal Information?

Under Canadian privacy law, you have the right to access the personal information we hold about you, subject to any legal restrictions. Upon request, we will provide you with access to your personal information within a reasonable timeframe, in compliance with applicable laws.

It is your responsibility to provide accurate, correct and complete information. If you notice any errors in your personal information or need to update it, please let us know through the steps outlined below. 

Some of the personal information we hold about you is accessible to you through your online account(s). You can access and update or correct your personal information by logging into your account(s) and making updates to your profile information and your preferences.

For personal information that is not available through your online account(s), you can request access by contacting the applicable Privacy Office, through email or postal address (for contact information, see Who Do I Contact with Privacy Questions?).

To access your personal health information, please contact your healthcare provider directly. Similarly, to access your personal information collected by a third party, please contact that third party directly.

If you are unsatisfied with our response to your access and/or correction request, or how we handle your personal information, please contact the appropriate Privacy Office.
