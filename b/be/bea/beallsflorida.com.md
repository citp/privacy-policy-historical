### Cookies

A cookie is a small text file sent by a website that is stored on your hard drive by your computer's browser. This Site uses two kinds of cookies: session cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies exist only for as long as your browser remains open. We use session cookies, for example, to add items to your shopping bag. Persistent cookies last from visit to visit and do not go away when you exit your browser. We use persistent cookies to give you a more personalized shopping experience and to streamline your website navigation. For example, we use persistent cookies to show you items you have previously browsed on the Site.

Managing cookies varies from browser to browser, so please refer to your browser for further information. If you prefer, you usually can set your browser to remove or reject cookies. Please be aware that if you block cookies you may not be able to make purchases or use other interactive features on the Site.

We may receive information about you from other sources and combine that information with information we collect about you through the Site. For instance, we obtain information from companies to enhance our existing customer information, such as improving the accuracy of the information we have about our customers.
