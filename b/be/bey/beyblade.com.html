<h2>
    BEYBLADE PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
<p>
    At Beyblade.com (the "Site") we at Nelvana Limted., ("Nelvana"), the operators of
    the Site, understand and appreciate the concerns that parents and families may have
    with regard to information gathered about Site users surfing our website, or on
    any other website. The Nelvana website gathers different kinds of information from
    its visitors.
</p>
<h2>
    Online Polls and Surveys</h2>
<p>
    Occasionally visitors are invited to voluntarily answer polls or survey questions
    that may be used in conjunction with sponsors/business partners. Be assured that
    in these poll and survey situations, only general (not personal) information such
    as gender, age and postal code is collected. The information collected ensures that
    visitors remain anonymous.
</p>
<h2>
    General website Traffic</h2>
<p>
    Nelvana tracks the number of visits to our Site. For example, we count how many
    times people access the Beyblade News page on the Site. All information gathered
    in this way is generic, and we do not track any individual users from this, but
    only calculate how many visits have taken place.
</p>
<h2>
    Cookie Technology</h2>
<p>
    Cookie technology is used on our Site to maximize the Site experience. For example,
    we use cookies to keep track of a user's time zone information which allows us to
    customize our schedule and give accurate show times. We also use cookies to keep
    track of a user's progress through a game we may have on our Site. No personal information
    is gathered from these cookies.
</p>
<h2>
    Email Identification</h2>
<p>
    When a user sends an email message to Nelvana through the website, two pieces of
    information are automatically stamped on the message. These are the time that the
    message was sent, and the IP address it was sent from. This is a precautionary measure
    against any potentially threatening messages being sent to Nelvana, its staff, or
    the public. This information is only used in those extreme cases where we feel someone's
    safety may be at risk.
</p>
<h2>
    Online Safety Notes for Kids</h2>
<p>
    The web is a great place to hang out, to find out stuff, and to share comments and
    ideas with people who are into the same kind of stuff you are. But the net isn't
    always a safe place - so we've put together some tips for you to read that will
    help you handle situations if they come up. First thing is don't give out personal
    information without asking your parents. Personal information includes:
</p>
<ul class="legal">
    <li>Your name</li>
    <li>Your address</li>
    <li>Your phone number </li>
    <li>Your mom or dad's name</li>
    <li>The name of your school</li>
    <li>Your teacher or your friend's names</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Secondly, if you run into something on the internet that makes you uncomfortable
    - whether it's on the web or it's sent to you - tell your mom or dad, or an adult
    you can talk to, and get them to deal with it. Never agree to meet anyone you have
    "met" online.
</p>
<p>
    Never send your picture over the internet without checking with your parents or
    another adult. Don't answer mean messages, or rude ones, or messages asking for
    personal information. If you do get a message like that - tell your parents right
    away, so they can help you deal with it. Make sure you obey the rules that your
    parents have set out for you. Make up a cool nickname for when you join a chat or
    a game online. Never tell anyone your real name or your password. Get your parents
    to read the safety for parent's tips.
</p>
<h2>
    Online Safety Notes for Parents</h2>
<p>
    The web is a great place for kids to hang out and learn about topics that are of
    interest to them. However, there are areas on the internet that are not appropriate
    for children. The guidelines we have drawn up are a starting point for parents of
    children who surf. The most important thing is to be aware of what your children
    are doing online. This may mean surfing with your children, or talking to them about
    the Sites that they like or that they have recently discovered on the web. Make
    surfing a family activity, particularly with young children.
</p>
<p>
    Set ground rules, so each person knows what is expected of them. For example, you
    could go through the safety tips together so everyone understands the "what's" and
    the "whys".
</p>
<h2>
    Software solutions:
</h2>
<p>
    There are software programs that allow parents to block certain websites from their
    kids. Some programs are more flexible than others, so you may want to shop around
    to find one that you're comfortable with. Any questions, comments or requests concerning
    the Nelvana Privacy Policy can be directed to M. Ulster, Privacy Officer at webmaster@nelvana.com.
