By visiting, accessing, using, downloading or creating an account with the Service, you agree to be bound by our [Mobile Application and Website User Agreement](https://beyondthewhiteboard.com/terms). We will not use or share your Collected Information (as defined below) with anyone except as described in this Policy. 

###  The Purpose of the Policy 

We take your privacy seriously. We provide this Policy so that you understand how we treat the information that you provide us as you use the Service (" **Collected Information** "). 

This Policy applies only to information collected via the Service. It may not apply to information that we may collect offline (for example, via phone calls). We reserve the right to change this Policy at any time. Any material changes, modifications, additions or deletions will be effective immediately as soon as we give you notice of them, which we may do by means including but not limited to issuing an email to the email address listed by registered users and/or posting the revised Policy on this page. It is your responsibility to review this Policy periodically and to be aware of any modifications. Your continued use of the Service after any modification means that you acknowledge the change and consent to the practices that we disclose in the Policy. 

###  How We Collect Information 

We collect information in these ways:

  * **_User-Provided Information._** We ask users to manually provide us with their name, email address and other contact information, social media links, free-form information about themselves, birthdate and gender information, and credit-card payment information when they create an account. They also have the option to upload a photo of themselves to appear in the Service. At other times during your use of the Service, we may also give you the opportunity to provide us with other information. 
  * **_Automatically Collected Information._** When you use the Service, we may automatically collect or generate information including but not limited to the Internet Protocol ("IP") address of your computer; web pages that you access within the Service; geographic information; a unique user ID; the type of browser, device or operating system you use; the version of our software that you are using; referring services or websites; search information; and usage and browsing information. 



We refer to all of the information described in this section as " **Collected Information**." 

###  How We Use Collected Information 

We use Collected Information to deliver services to you, and for communicating with you about the Service. We will never use your personally identifiable information for our own purposes, except as expressly described in this Policy or in our [Mobile Application and Website User Agreement](https://beyondthewhiteboard.com/terms).

We will not sell, rent, license or disclose Collected Information to anyone, except:

CrossFit may (by itself or together with us) publish reports about the behavior of our users based on the information that we may share with CrossFit.
