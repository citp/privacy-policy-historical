This privacy policy describes how Beyond the Rack (“BTR”) collects and uses the personal information you provide on our Website: [www.beyondtherack.com](http://www.beyondtherack.com/) (“the Website”) for your use of the services or when you purchase products from BTR, features and content offered by Beyond the Rack (collectively referred to as the “BTR Services”). It also describes the choices available to you regarding the use of your personal information and how you can access and update your personal information. For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, unless otherwise noted, all references to "Beyond the Rack" include beyondtherack.com and BTR. 

Beyond the Rack is committed to protecting all the information you share with us. We follow stringent procedures to help protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of data stored on BTR systems. 

Only those employees who need access to your information in order to perform their duties are allowed such access. Any employee who violates our privacy and/or security policies is subject to disciplinary action, including possible termination and civil and/or criminal prosecution. 

We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy. We do not sell your personal information to third parties.

The information Beyond the Rack gathers falls into two categories: 

  1. Personally identifiable information, which includes personal information you supply when you register, order, complete a survey, enter a contest, provide your email address or provide your friends’ emails addresses and
  2. Non-personally identifiable information collected through technology, which includes tracking information collected as you navigate the Website.



**__Personally Identifiable Information That You Provide Us__**

Registration for the BTR Services requires that you supply certain personally identifiable information, including, in most cases, your first name, your last name, a unique email address and a password to register. This allows BTR to provide you access to your account every time you visit the Website. Beyond the Rack keeps track of your information to offer you the best possible shopping experience. 

To enable the purchase of products, we also collect and store billing and credit/Visa Debit card information as well as your address, telephone number or any other information required to process your order. 

This information may be disclosed to specific members of our staff and to select third parties (such as our credit/Visa Debit card processor and shipping provider) involved in the completion of your transaction and delivery of your order. Examples of this include fulfilling orders and processing credit or Visa Debit card payments service providers. 

We will also use your email address and/or telephone number to notify you about new services, special promotional programs, promotional offers or any information related to BTR Services. 

At any time, you can notify us that you wish to stop receiving these emails or telephone calls by either: 

  * Making the appropriate selections in your account management center, or
  * Following the "unsubscribe" instructions located near the bottom of each email, or
  * Contacting us at [unsubscribe@beyondtherack.com](mailto:unsubscribe@beyondtherack.com) requesting that we remove your email and/or telephone number from our database. To do so please include your email and/or telephone number in the body of your email, and put "Unsubscribe" in the subject line, or
  * Calling our toll-free number at **1-844-400-4287** Monday - Friday from 9AM - 5PM ET.



In addition, we keep a record of your past purchases, returns, and credits. We may also ask you for information regarding your personal preferences and demographics to better meet your needs. 

The Website is targeted for use by a general audience; BTR does not market to or create special areas for use by children. Accordingly, BTR does not collect age identifying information nor does BTR knowingly collect any personal information, even in aggregate, from children under the age of 13 years. However, we hereby advise all visitors to the Website under the age of 13 not to disclose or provide any personally identifiable information on the Website. In the event that we discover that a child under the age of 13 has provided personally identifiable information to BTR, in accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protect Act ([see the Federal Trade Commission's website](http://www.ftc.gov/privacy/privacyinitiatives/childrens.html)), we will delete the child's personally identifiable information from our files and databases to the extent technologically possible. 

You may choose to log-on, create an account or enhance your profile at beyondtherack.com with the Facebook Connect feature on the Website. By doing this, you are asking Facebook to send us registration information from your Facebook profile. We treat that information as we do any other information you give to us when you log on, register or create a profile. After you have connected, Facebook also sends us additional information from your profile that allows us to display a Facebook module on the pages you view. We do not store this additional information. 

Our Web site includes Social Media Features, such as the Facebook Like button and Widgets, the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site. These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it. 

Beyond the Rack collects personal information such as your first name, your last name, a unique email address and a password from readers in connection with optional sweepstakes, contests or special offers. If this information is to be shared with a third party other than Beyond the Rack, we will notify you at the time of collection. If you do not want any personal information shared, you may always decline to participate in the sweepstakes, contest or special offer. 

Beyond the Rack may collect personal information such as your first name, your last name, a unique email address and a password as well as your opinion on specific BTR services from members in connection with voluntary surveys. Data may be collected on the Website, on the phone or through the mail. The information you provide by answering optional survey questions may be shared, but only in the aggregate, with advertisers and partners unless we notify you otherwise at the time of collection. 

If your personal identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our services, you may correct, update, delete/deactivate it by either: 

  * Making the necessary changes in your member information page, or
  * Emailing our Customer Service team at [privacy@beyondtherack.com](mailto:privacy@beyondtherack.com), or

BTR uses SociableLabs to operate our referral program. Notwithstanding anything in this Privacy Policy to the contrary, Personal Information may be securely transferred to SociableLabs or other third parties in the context of the referral program, but only to the extent needed for the referral program to operate properly. This transfer of Personal Information is described in the next paragraph of this section. By using the referral program, you consent to our use of your Personal Information in this manner. If you do not consent to the use of your Personal Information in this manner, please do not use the referral program. 

The referral program will access your web-based email service (currently limited to Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo or AOL). If you are not otherwise logged-in to the email service, it may ask you for your password in order to log in. Your password is not stored by either us or SociableLabs, and is only transferred securely to your email provider in order to log in for the referral program to function. The referral program will access your contacts from your email program, and may ask for your authorization to do so. No emails are sent to your contacts without your consent, as you must confirm to which email addresses you send a referral. Use of your email service is also governed by your email provider’s Terms of Use and / or Privacy Policy. 

When you share a link through the referral program via Facebook or Twitter, if you are not otherwise logged in, you may be asked for your login information, and your login information is transferred securely to those services. Your use of these services is covered by their respective Terms of Use and / or Privacy Policies. 

BTR and SociableLabs are in full compliance with both the U.S. CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 (15 U.S.C. Ch. 103) and the Canadian law Informally known as Canada’s Anti-Spam Law (“CASL”, S.C. 2010, c. 23) within the referral program. BTR As part of our referral program, emails are sent which are subject to anti-spam laws, including the U.S. CAN-SPAM Act and Canada’s Anti-Spam Law. As these laws have different requirements based on the email recipient’s home country, it is important to distinguish your recipients. By using the referral program, you acknowledge that if you are using the American version of the website and referral program, you are sending to American recipients. If you are using the Canadian version of the website and referral program, you are sending to Canadian recipients. 

If you believe you have been sent an email in error or in violation of these laws OR your friend may contact us to request that we remove this information from our database by either:

Your recipient may contact us to request that we remove their information in our database through the same contact information mentioned above. 

We may disclose personal information if we are required to do so by law or we in good faith believe that such action is necessary to (1) comply with the law or with legal process; (2) protect and defend our rights and property; (3) protect against misuse or unauthorized use of the BTR Services; or (4) protect the personal safety or property of our users or the public (among other things, this means that if you provide false information or attempt to pose as someone else, information about you may be disclosed as part of any investigation into your actions).
