									<strong>Use of Cookies and Web Beacons</strong>

									<p>We may use cookies to help you personalize your online experience. Cookies are identifiers that are transferred to your computer´s hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize the sites pages, or register with any of our site´s services, a cookie enables <strong>beststream.tv</strong> to recall your specific information on subsequent visits.</p>


									<p>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies by modifying your Web browser; however, if you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the site.</p>


									<p>A web beacon is a transparent image file used to monitor your journey around a single website or collection of sites. They are also referred to as web bugs and are commonly used by sites that hire third-party services to monitor traffic. They may be used in association with cookies to understand how visitors interact with the pages and content on the pages of a web site.</p>


									<p>We may serve third-party advertisements that use cookies and web beacons in the course of ads being served on our web site to ascertain how many times you´ve seen an advertisement. No personally identifiable information you give us is provided to them for cookie or web beacon use, so they cannot personally identify you with that information on our web site.</p>


									<p>Some third-party advertisements may be provided by Google, which uses cookies to serve ads on this site. Google uses the DART cookie, which enables it to serve ads to our users based on their visits to this site and other sites on the Web. You may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google ad and content network privacy policy.</p>


									<p>Browsers can be set to accept or reject cookies or notify you when a cookie is being sent. Privacy software can be used to override web beacons. Taking either of these actions shouldn´t cause a problem with our site, should you so choose.</p>
									<strong>Children´s Online Privacy Protection Act</strong>

									<p>This website is directed to adults; it is not directed to children under the age of 13. We operate our site in compliance with the Children´s Online Privacy Protection Act, and will not knowingly collect or use personal information from anyone under 13 years of age.</p>

The information collected is used solely for internal review and not shared with other organizations for commercial purposes.</p>
									<strong>Release of Information</strong>

									<p>If <strong>beststream.tv</strong> is sold, the information we have obtained from you through your voluntary participation in our site may transfer to the new owner as a part of the sale in order that the service being provided to you may continue.
