# BestAds.com - Privacy Statement

[ ](http://bestads.com/)

**Privacy Statement**

At BestAds.com, we value your privacy and follow strict guidelines with regards to your personal information.  This statement disclosed the privacy practices of the BestAds.com Web site.  Please read this Privacy Statement to understand how your personally identifiable information will be handled as you use BestAds.com.  If you have any questions regarding this privacy policy, please contact us by email at [privacy@bestads.com](mailto:privacy@bestads.com).

Your privacy is important to us.  At no time has BestAds.com ever sold, traded, or otherwise disseminated our users personally identifiable information.  We have made a commitment to be a trustworthy classified service and will hold your private information in the strictest confidence.

**Who we are.**

BestAds.com is a worldwide classified marketplace which has been bringing together buyers and sellers since 1996.  A division of American Internet Classifieds, BestAds.com is dedicated to providing the best classified advertising service on the internet.

**What information of yours is collected.**

As with most websites, BestAds collects personal information from people who visit our website. This information may include a user's name, email address, phone numbers, credit card information and information about how the user accesses and uses the BestAds website. NO IDENTIFYING INFORMATION IS COLLECTED WITHOUT A USER'S KNOWLEDGE AND CONSENT. ****

Some of our services will require users to enter personal and contact information. The information we gather will not be used by the public, other members of BestAds, or anyone not employed by BestAds or the financial institutions we use to process payments to identify a specific individual. 

During the account registration process, users are asked for specific information such as, but not limited to city, state, country, zip code, area code, phone number (not required) and additional information (not required).  This information is published in the users classified advertisement(s) in order for BestAds to list classifieds by geographic location and also for contact purposes.  In addition, the ad submission form requires users to submit a Ad Headline, Summary, and a Detailed Description as well as other information.  All information provided on the ad submission form is included in the classified ad.

_**NOTE:**_   Your email address is collected during the Account Registration process so that other site visitors may contact you.  It is important to note, however, that your email address is not published online.  Rather users send an online contact form to you using our “anonymous email” function.  In other words, site visitors can contact you via email without ever seeing your email address.  The only way a site visitor can see your email address is if you type it in the ad submission form (in either the Ad Headline, Summary, or Detailed Description spaces).

**What we do with your information.**

BestAds will not sell, rent, share, trade, or otherwise give away any Personally Identifiable Information without a user’s permission, unless required by law or to protect members of BestAds.

**What are Personally Identifiable Information and Aggregate Information?**

Personally Identifiable Information is any information that allows others to contact a user directly or allows the collection of information about a user other than what is displayed on the site.  For example, Personally Identifiable Information includes, but is not limited to, an e-mail address, IP address, first name, last name, credit card number, and a mailing or billing address. If a user voluntarily shares all or part of their Personally Identifiable Information with others, BestAds  is no longer responsible for its confidentiality and/or use. 

For example, when you purchase a commercial advertisement on BestAds, you have to use a credit card. To obtain authorization for the charge, you will need to provide your billing information. BestAds will be using secure servers to forward your purchase and credit card information to your credit card company.  The credit card information is not stored in any way on BestAds servers. However, this information may reside on the credit card companies' servers, and then, their security and privacy policies are effective and BestAds cannot and does not assume any liability. If you do not want your Personally Identifiable information transferred, you must simply choose to not use the service.

Aggregate Information is personal information that cannot be linked to the user individually.   Aggregate Information includes, but is not limited to, gender, age, ethnic background, and appearance, and is information that you volunteer. This information may be used for demographic purposes about visitors to the site, but cannot be used to identify a specific user by name, address, etc.

For example, when a user placing an ad registers at BestAds, the registration form will request, among other things, city, state and zip code information.  When the ad is placed, the geographic information will be shown.  Site visitors will have access to that information but will not be able to directly identify or contact the advertiser strictly on that information.   

For example, if a user registers at BestAds and provides city and state information, an employer would have access to that information, but would still not be able to identify or contact the user directly.

All Personally Identifiable information submitted by the user is confidential and will not be disclosed except as required by law or to protect members of BestAds. 

BestAds now provides “anonymous email.”  In other words, when users submit a classified ad, their published ad will provide a contact form which visitors can fill out and send online to the advertiser.  The contact form is sent to the email address which is provided by the advertiser during the account registration process.  The advertiser’s email address is not displayed online, except when the advertiser also submits the email address in either the Ad Headline, Summary, or Detailed Description portion of the advertisement.

If a user voluntarily shares all or part of their Personally Identifiable Information with others, BestAds is no longer responsible for its confidentiality and/or use.  Users should know that any information submitted during the account registration process, except email address, is published online when the user submits a classified ad. 

Registered users can access their personal information, except credit card information, at any time by using a user ID and password.  Registered users can update or change their information at anytime by logging in at [http://BestAds.com/AccountEdit.cfm](http://bestads.com/AccountEdit.cfm) . 

If a user voluntarily shares all or part of their Personally Identifiable Information with others, BestAds is no longer responsible for its confidentiality and/or use. 

**Cookies**

If a user chooses to accept a cookie from BestAds, we will be able to "remember" the user as he/she browses our site.   This prevents the user from having to log-in each time the user selects different functions on the site.  For your security purposes, however, the cookies expire after 15 minutes during a visit to our site.  Cookies, by themselves, cannot be used to identify a user.  Once a cookie is accepted, BestAds can streamline the login process to the site and provide the user with relevant updates for information they have selected.
