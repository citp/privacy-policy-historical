            Stylesheets and Preprocessors
            ==============================

            You can always bring in CSS files manually with `<link>` tags, or asynchronously
            using a solution like AMD (RequireJS).  Or, if you like, you can take advantage
            of Sails' conventional asset pipeline (boilerplate Gruntfile).

            By default, stylesheets from your `assets/styles` folder are included
            here automatically (between STYLES and STYLES END). Both CSS (.css) and SASS (.scss)
            are supported. In production, your styles will be minified and concatenated into
            a single file.

            To customize any part of the built-in behavior, just edit `tasks/pipeline.js`.
            For example, here are a few things you could do:

                + Change the order of your CSS files
                + Import stylesheets from other directories
                + Use a different or additional preprocessor, like SASS, SCSS or Stylus

            Client-side Templates
            ========================

            HTML templates are important prerequisites of modern, rich client applications.
            To work their magic, frameworks like Backbone, Angular, Ember, and Knockout require
            that you load these templates client-side.

            By default, your Gruntfile is configured to automatically load and precompile
            client-side JST templates in your `assets/templates` folder, then
            include them here automatically (between TEMPLATES and TEMPLATES END).

            To customize this behavior to fit your needs, just edit `tasks/pipeline.js`.
            For example, here are a few things you could do:

                + Import templates from other directories
                + Use a different template engine (handlebars, jade, dust, etc.)
                + Internationalize your client-side templates using a server-side
                  stringfile before they're served.

          Client-side Javascript
          ========================

          You can always bring in JS files manually with `script` tags, or asynchronously
          on the client using a solution like AMD (RequireJS).  Or, if you like, you can
          take advantage of Sails' conventional asset pipeline (boilerplate Gruntfile).

          By default, files in your `assets/js` folder are included here
          automatically (between SCRIPTS and SCRIPTS END).  Both JavaScript (.js) and
          CoffeeScript (.coffee) are supported. In production, your scripts will be minified
          and concatenated into a single file.

          To customize any part of the built-in behavior, just edit `tasks/pipeline.js`.
          For example, here are a few things you could do:

              + Change the order of your scripts
              + Import scripts from other directories
              + Use a different preprocessor, like TypeScript
