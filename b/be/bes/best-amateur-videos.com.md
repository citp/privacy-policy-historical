# CCBill Consumer Privacy Policy

## Instructions

CCBill, LLC ("CCBill") needs to gather and use certain information about individuals. This information can include customers, suppliers, business contacts, employees and other people the organization has a relationship with or may need to contact. This policy describes how this personal data must be collected, handled and stored to meet the company’s data protection standards – and to comply with the law.

## Why this Policy Exists

This data protection policy ensures CCBill:

  * Complies with data protection law and follows good practice
  * Protects the rights of staff, customers and partners
  * Is transparent about how it stores and processes individuals personal data
  * Protects itself from the risk of a data breach



## The General Data Protection Regulation

The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) replaces the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC and was designed to harmonize data privacy laws across Europe, to protect EU citizens’ data privacy and to reshape the way organizations across the world approach data privacy. The GDPR aims primarily to give control back to citizens and residents over their personal data and to simplify the regulatory environment for international business by unifying the regulation within the EU.

## What is "Personal Data"?

"Personal data" is defined in both the Directive and the GDPR as any information relating to a person who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that person. So in many cases online identifiers including IP address, cookies and so forth will now be regarded as personal data if they can be (or are capable of being) without undue effort linked back to the data subject.
