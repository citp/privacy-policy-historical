    </font><p><font size="2"><font face="Arial">During the process of delivering an ad to you, Best Animations does
    not collect any personally identifiable information about you such as name, address, phone
    number, or e-mail address. However, </font></font><font face="Arial" size="2">Best
    Animations does obtain some types of non-personally identifiable information such as the
    Internet Service Provider you use to connect to the Internet, your browser type, or the
    type of computer operating system you use (Macintosh or Windows, for example). The
    information collected by Best Animations </font><font size="2"><font face="Arial">is used

    </font><p><font size="2"><font face="Arial">In some cases, you may voluntarily provide personal information in
    response to a specific ad (this ad may ask you to fill out a survey or provide your zip
    code). If this does occur, </font></font><font face="Arial" size="2">Best Animations may
    collect this information on behalf of an advertiser. This information is used by an
    advertiser to respond to your request. In addition, Best Animations </font><font size="2"><font face="Arial">may combine this information with other users' information and review it in
    an aggregate form to understand the type of individuals who view a specific type of ad or

    Animations serves you an ad. This unique number, which is stored in a cookie file on your

    ensure that we don't serve you the same ad multiple times, and help our advertisers
    understand what you like and don't like about their offerings so that they can cater
    better to your needs the next time you are interested in their products or services. While
    we believe that cookies enhance your Internet experience by limiting the number of times
    you see the same ad and delivering more relevant content to you, they are not required for
