  * In the event, we sell, buy or re-organise any business or assets, or if our assets are acquired by a third party, including prospective sellers or buyers.



## International Transfers

  * International Transfers means that personal data is transferred to a country outside the European Union.
  * As set out above, we may allow access to your data to third parties who may be located outside the European Union.
  * We may also disclose your data if we receive a legal or regulatory request from a foreign law enforcement body outside the European Union.
  * We will always take steps to ensure that any international transfer of information is managed to protect your rights and interests. Any requests for information that we receive from law enforcement or regulators will be carefully checked before personal data is disclosed.



## Direct Marketing

  * We will use your data to send you direct marketing communications regarding products and services that we offer and our partners offer regarding for example online casino, sports betting and financial services. This may be in the form of email or targeted online advertisements.
  * In some cases, our processing of your personal data for marketing purposes will be based on our legitimate interests (see above). When required by law it will be based on your consent.
  * You always have a right to say no to further direct marketing, at any time. You can use the opt-out link that you find in all direct marketing communications, or by contacting us.
  * We take steps to limit direct marketing to a reasonable and proportionate level and to send you communications that we believe may be of interest or relevance to you, based on the information we have about you.



## How long do we keep your personal data?

  * We will retain your data for as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes listed of this Policy.
  * In some circumstances, we keep your personal data during a certain period to meet for example legal, tax or accounting requirements.
  * We maintain a data retention policy for personal data in our care. Where your personal data is no longer required we will ensure it is either securely deleted or made anonymous.

### Please note the following if you wish to exercise your rights

You can ask us to:- confirm whether we are processing your data;

  * Give you a copy of that data;
  * Provide you with other information about your data, for example, what data we have, what we use it for, who we disclose it to, whether we transfer it outside the EU and how we protect it. How long we keep it for, what rights you have, how you can make a complaint, where we got your data from and whether we have carried out any Automated Decision Making or Profiling, to the extent that information has not already been provided to you in this Policy.
  * Rectification You can ask us to rectify inaccurate personal data. We may seek to verify the accuracy of the data before rectifying it.



### Erasure You can ask us to erase your data, but only where

  * it is no longer needed for the purposes for which it was collected; or
  * you have withdrawn your consent (where processing was based on consent); or
  * following a successful right to object (see ‘Objection’ below); or
  * it has been processed unlawfully; or
  * to comply with a legal obligation.



### We are not required to comply with your request to erase your personal data if the processing of your data is necessary

  * for compliance with a legal obligation; or
  * for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims;
  * There are certain other circumstances in which we are not required to comply with your erasure request, although these two are the most likely circumstances in which we would deny that request.
  * Restriction You can ask us to restrict (i.e. keep but not use) your data, but only where:- its accuracy is contested (see Rectification), to allow us to verify its accuracy; or
  * the processing is unlawful, but you do not want it erased; or
  * it is no longer needed for the purposes for which it was collected, but we still need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or
  * You have exercised the right to object, and verification of overriding grounds is pending. We can continue to use your data following a request for a restriction, where:- we have your consent; or
  * to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or
  * to protect the rights of another natural or legal person.
  * Portability You can ask us to provide your data to you in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format, or you can ask to have it ‘ported’ directly to another Data Controller, but in each case only where:
  * the processing is based on your consent or the performance of a contract with you; and
  * the processing is carried out by automated means.  
Objection You can object to any processing of your data which has our ‘legitimate interests’ as its legal basis if you believe your fundamental rights and freedoms outweigh our legitimate interests.
  * We have an opportunity to demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate interests which override your rights and freedoms.  
International Transfers You can ask to obtain a copy of, or reference to, the safeguards under which your data is transferred outside of the European Economic Area.
