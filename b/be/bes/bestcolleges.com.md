By using our website, you are agreeing to this Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.

BestColleges.com collects two kinds of information: _submitted information_ and _automatic information_.

_Automatic information_ includes certain types of anonymous information whenever you interact with BestColleges.com. This data aids in creating improvements in our user experience, such as providing more relevant and tailored content. For example, we use “cookies” to collect anonymous data for analytics, site optimization and for tailored advertising and marketing. This data includes (but is not limited to) your browser version, operating system version, and your IP address.

By utilizing our website, you acknowledge and agree that automatic information collected on BestColleges.com may be shared with schools, affiliated companies, and third parties for the purpose of providing information about degrees, programs and other education-related products and services.

_Submitted information_ is data that is voluntarily inputted and submitted by users through our web forms, which may include personal contact information, such as name, telephone number, mailing address, and email address, as well any other information that may be required to match users to an education product or service. Submitted information is collected, stored and shared with schools and other third parties as necessary to provide users with information about education-related services, in addition to schools and programs.

By submitting this information, you authorize BestColleges.com (as well as our affiliated schools and partners) to contact you in accordance with all applicable laws by phone, through text messages, or by email or mail regarding education options or related topics. You also acknowledge and agree that we retain the right to release any collected information, including personally identifiable information, as needed, to businesses providing our company with administration services (such as an email delivery service). In addition, through this action, you grant us, our affiliates, and our partners and vendors the right to contact you for a period of time, and relinquish any rights granted to you by the Do Not Call list or other applicable law. Your submission serves as an omission to Do Not Call requirements established by state and federal governments and may exempt us from other applicable laws.

If you receive any email communications from us, a school, or third party, you will be afforded the ability to unsubscribe through a link in the email, at which point you will be removed from further mailings from that sender.

We also retain the right to release your personal information in circumstances required by law, such as to abide by a subpoena or other legal procedure. This will be when, in good faith, we believe it is necessary to preserve our rights, ensure the safety of you or others, explore alleged fraud, to reply to a government or legal request, and/or in the instance that BestColleges.com is merging, acquisitioning, or selling some or all of its assets to a third party.

In addition, it is possible that we will revise our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy in the future if we change our practices. We recommend that you revisit this document periodically to stay up-to-date with our practices concerning your privacy and other important information.
