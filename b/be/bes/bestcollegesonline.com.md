We generally collect two types of information: submitted and automatic.

**Submitted information** encompasses all information — name, telephone number, email and mailing addresses — voluntarily given to us through web forms. When you request further information about a school or program, and fill in one of these forms, that information is saved and shared with the relevant schools and entities. This allows them and us to contact you regarding the information you requested. 

In accordance with all applicable laws, the submission of a web form authorizes BestCollegesOnline.com and our affiliated schools and partners to contact you using the information you provided. You reserve the right to opt out of any email correspondences and will be provided with an unsubscribe link in the email you receive from us, a school, or a third party. If you choose to unsubscribe, you will be removed from mailing lists for that sender.

**Automatic information** is anonymous information — browser version, operating system version, IP address — collected through the use of “cookies”. This information is gathered any time you interact with BestCollegesOnline.com and is used for site optimization and analytics. Cookies are also used to create advertisements based on the information you interacted with most while on our site.

You also grant us and our affiliates permission to contact you for a period of time. Your submission waives any rights granted to you by the Do Not Call list and may exempt us from other applicable laws.

Through use of our site, you acknowledge and agree that we retain the right to share your personal information when required by law in order to protect our rights and ensure your safety and the safety of others. We may also release your information in reply to a legal or governmental request, subpoena, and/or in the case that BestCollegesOnline.com merges with, is acquired by, or sells some or all of it’s assets to a third party.

Read Google’s [privacy policy](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245) for more information on how Google Analytics uses and protects your automatic information.

Cookies used to create advertisements do not contain identifiable information; users remain anonymous, but advertisers are able to make ads based on the user’s interests. This type of advertising cookie is sometimes called a third-party cookie because they work on behalf of a third party entity.
