Information Sharing

BestReviews takes the privacy of our visitors very seriously. BestReviews does not share the information it collects, whether general or personal, in any specific way with third parties without visitor consent or as otherwise required by law. 

BestReviews may collect (1) personal or (2) general visitor-related information:

(1) Personal Information Including Email Addresses

BestReviews will never sell, lease or share personal information, including names and email addresses, with any third party.

Visitors will not be required to provide personal information for ordinary use of the site. Visitors may have the opportunity to provide BestReviews with their personal information in response to specific services or tasks (e.g., signing up for BestReviews's newsletter). In order to receive additional services, visitors may be required to provide personal information such as names and email addresses.

(2) General Information
