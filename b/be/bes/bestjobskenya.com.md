# Privacy policy :: Best Jobs Kenya

**PRIVACY POLICY**  
---  
  
  * **Overview**

**Best Jobs Kenya** is committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected. We are committed to upholding the eight data protection principles of good information handling practice.

  *  **General privacy statement**

We may only use your email address or personal details to contact you from time to time about matters directly related to our website, such as sending you a password reminder, or changes in our website that may affect you. Your email address or any other part of your personal information will never be used for marketing purposes or be disclosed to third parties. You will be able to remove any of your personal information stored in our systems at any time, by using the on-line forms in our website.

We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our web site, and to keep a record of pages accessed by our visitiors. Your IP address is used to gather broad demographic information. Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. This information could be shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis only.

This site contains links to other sites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such web sites.

  *  **The privacy of your resume**

We consider your resume as a personal document and we wish you to have full control over it, and whether or not you wish to have your contact details (name, address, telephone number) visible to employers.

We give you the option of putting your resume in our searchable database and we don't oblige you to give any personal details, except your email address. We provide you with the choice of which personal details you wish to give and which you do not. It's entirely up to you to decide what personal information you want to be included.

When registering your resume, we will ask you to give us your email address. This email address will be disclosed to potential employers and recruiters looking for employees in our online database, and apart from that, we will only use it to send you resume update reminders and to contact you about matters directly related to this website.

Making your resume searchable considerably increases your exposure to potential employers. To prevent your resume from being searched and viewed by our clients you can choose to remove it from our database at any time, by using our on-line form. After removing your resume from our database, no copy of your details will be kept in any of our systems, and you can be sure they have been completely deleted and no further access will be possible from anyone, including us.

We make an effort to limit access to our resume services only to employers or recruiters wishing to find employees. If any business is found to be using our resume services for something different to this, then we will immediately terminate their use of our services.

Although you may remove your resume from our searchable database at any time, companies who have had access to the database may have retained a copy of your resume in their own files or databases. We are not responsible for the retention, use, or privacy of your resume by companies in these instances.

  *  **Jobs by email service**

If you subscribe to the _Jobs by email_ service, you will receive once or twice a week, a free email message including those jobs that have been published in the locations and categories specified by you when you subscribed. You can change your search criteria at any time or unsubscribe at any time by using our on-line forms. Your email address will never be disclosed to any third party, and will only be used by us to send you job updates, or to contact you about matters directly related to our website.

  *  **Use of cookies**

We use _"cookies"_ to "remember" log-in details of users who enter the employers area. A _"cookie"_ is a text file that is placed on your hard drive by a web page server. Each time the browser requests a page from the server, this text is sent back. _"Cookies"_ are not used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. _"Cookies"_ are uniquely assigned to your computer, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. If you are using a shared computer and have entered the employers area, please ensure that you log out or close down the browser before leaving the computer for the next user.

  *  **Security**

We have implemented reasonable technical and organisational measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorised access, use, alteration or disclosure. However, we cannot guarantee that unauthorised third parties will never be able to defeat those measures or use your personal information for improper purposes.

When you make payment on-line on this site, your credit card information is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer ("SSL") protocol. SSL makes it extremely difficult for your credit card information to be intercepted or stolen while being transmitted. We use a service company to process our credit card transactions.

This site is not intended for children under 16 years of age. We do not knowingly collect any information from children under 16.

  *  **Changes to this privacy policy**

If we ever change this privacy policy, we will post the changes on this page and inform by email all our users so that anyone may be aware of them and they will be given a chance to ask us not to use their information for the changed purposes.
