<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">At BestAds.com, we value your privacy 
and follow strict guidelines with regards to your personal information.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This statement disclosed the privacy 
practices of the BestAds.com Web site.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</span>Please read this Privacy Statement to understand how your personally 
identifiable information will be handled as you use BestAds.com.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If you have any questions regarding this 
privacy policy, please contact us by email at </font><a href="mailto:privacy@bestads.com"><font face="Arial" size="2">privacy@bestads.com</font></a><font face="Arial" size="2">.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">Your privacy is important to us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At no time has BestAds.com ever sold, 
traded, or otherwise disseminated our users personally identifiable 
information.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We have made a 
commitment to be a trustworthy classified service and will hold your private 
information in the strictest confidence.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font face="Arial">Who we are.<o:p></o:p></font></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">BestAds.com is a worldwide classified 
marketplace which has been bringing together buyers and sellers since 1996.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A division of American Internet 
Classifieds, BestAds.com is dedicated to providing the best classified 
advertising service on the internet.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font face="Arial"><font>What information of yours is 
collected.<o:p></o:p></font></font></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">As with most websites, BestAds 
collects personal information from people who visit our website. This 
information may include a user's name, email address, phone numbers, credit card 
information and information about how the user accesses and uses the BestAds 
website. NO IDENTIFYING INFORMATION IS C</font><font face="Arial"><font size="2">OLLECTED WITHOUT A USER'S KNOWLEDGE AND 
CONSENT.<b><o:p></o:p></b></font></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">Some of our services will require 
users to enter personal and contact<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>information. The information we gather will not be used by the public, 
other members of BestAds, or anyone not employed by BestAds or the financial 
institutions we use to process payments to identify a specific individual. 
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">During the account registration 
process, users are asked for specific information such as, but not limited to 
city, state, country, zip code, area code, phone number (not required) and 
additional information (not required).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</span>This information is published in the users classified advertisement(s) in 
order for BestAds to list classifieds by geographic location and also for 
contact purposes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In addition, the 
ad submission form requires users to submit a Ad Headline, Summary, and a 
Detailed Description as well as other information.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All information provided on the ad 
submission form is included in the classified ad.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><em><strong>NOTE:</strong></em><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Your email address is collected during 
the Account Registration process so that other site visitors may contact 
you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is important to note, 
however, that your email address is not published online.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Rather users send an online contact form 
to you using our “anonymous email” function.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In other words, site visitors can 
contact you via email without ever seeing your email address.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The only way a site visitor can see your 
email address is if you type it in the ad submission form (in either the Ad 
Headline, Summary, or Detailed Description spaces).</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font face="Arial"><font>What we do with your 
information.<o:p></o:p></font></font></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">BestAds will not sell, rent, share, 
trade, or otherwise give away any Personally Identifiable Information without a 
user’s permission, unless required by law or to protect members of 
BestAds.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font face="Arial"><font>What are Personally Identifiable 
Information and Aggregate Information?<o:p></o:p></font></font></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><font size="2">Personally Identifiable 
Information is any information that allows others to contact a user directly or 
allows the collection of information about a user other than what is displayed 
on the site.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For example, 
Personally Identifiable Information includes, but is not limited to, an e-mail 
address, IP address, first name, last name, credit card number, and a mailing or 
billing address. If a user voluntarily shares all or part of their Personally 
Identifiable Information with others, BestAds<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>is no longer responsible for its 
confidentiality and/or use.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</span></font></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">For example, when you purchase a 
commercial advertisement on BestAds, you have to use a credit card. To obtain 
authorization for the charge, you will need to provide your billing information. 
BestAds will be using secure servers to forward your purchase and credit card 
information to your credit card company.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</span>The credit card information is not stored in any way on BestAds servers. 
However, this information may reside on the credit card companies' servers, and 
then, their security and privacy policies are effective and BestAds cannot and 
does not assume any liability. If you do not want your Personally Identifiable 
information transferred, you must simply choose to not use the 
service.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">Aggregate Information is personal 
information that cannot be linked to the user individually.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Aggregate Information includes, 
but is not limited to, gender, age, ethnic background, and appearance, and is 
information that you volunteer. This information may be used for demographic 
purposes about visitors to the site, but cannot be used to identify a specific 
user by name, address, etc.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><font size="2">For example, when a user 
placing an ad registers at BestAds, the registration form will request, among 
other things, city, state and zip code information.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When the ad is placed, the geographic 
information will be shown.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Site 
visitors will have access to that information but will not be able to directly 
identify or contact the advertiser strictly on that information.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">For example, if a user registers at 
BestAds and provides city and state information, an employer would have access 
to that information, but would still not be able to identify or contact the user 
directly.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">All Personally Identifiable 
information submitted by the user is confidential and will not be disclosed 
except as required by law or to protect members of BestAds. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">BestAds now provides “anonymous 
email.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In other words, when users 
submit a classified ad, their published ad will provide a contact form which 
visitors can fill out and send online to the advertiser.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The contact form is sent to the email 
address which is provided by the advertiser during the account registration 
process.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The advertiser’s email 
address is not displayed online, except when the advertiser also submits the 
email address in either the Ad Headline, Summary, or Detailed Description 
portion of the advertisement.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><font size="2">If a user voluntarily shares 
all or part of their Personally Identifiable Information with others, BestAds is 
no longer responsible for its confidentiality and/or use.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Users should know that any information 
submitted during the account registration process, except email address, is 
published online when the user submits a classified ad.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></font></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">Registered users can access their 
personal information, except credit card information, at any time by using a 
user ID and password.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Registered 
users can update or change their information at anytime by logging in at 
</font><a href="http://bestads.com/AccountEdit.cfm"><font face="Arial" size="2">http://BestAds.com/AccountEdit.cfm</font></a><font face="Arial" size="2"> .

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><font size="2">If a user voluntarily shares 
all or part of their Personally Identifiable Information with others, BestAds is 
no longer responsible for its confidentiality and/or use.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></font></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><strong>Cookies</strong></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">A "cookie" is a small data file that 
is stored on a computer and is intended to<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>enhance a user's visit and its gathered 
for all visitors to the site. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">If a user chooses to accept a cookie 
from BestAds, we will be able to "remember" the user as he/she browses our 
site.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This prevents the user 
from having to log-in each time the user selects different functions on the 
site.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For your security purposes, 
however, the cookies expire after 15 minutes during a visit to our site.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Cookies, by themselves, cannot be used 
to identify a user.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Once a cookie 
is accepted, BestAds can streamline the login process to the site and provide 
the user with relevant updates for information they have selected. Session 
information is only gathered while a user is browsing www.bestads.com. Cookies 
can be turned off through security options on a web browser. However, certain 
BestAds features will not function without their use.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><strong>Hyperlinks</strong></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">BestAds contains links to other 
websites as well as to other pages within the BestAds site. Please be aware that 
once a user clicks on a non-BestAds link, they are moving to another website, 
and our privacy policy no longer applies and the privacy policy from those other 
websites is the one defining the collection and usage of information.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><strong>Email 
correspondence</strong></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">E-mail addresses will only be used in 
private correspondence with the user for customer service issues unless further 
permission is granted. BestAds is an "opt-in" service, which means that a user 
may elect to receive communications, including correspondence updates and promotions. Otherwise, we will not 
contact our users. Should a user receive unwanted communications, they 
may</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">remove their address from our contact 
list by sending an email to<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">

message.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial"><strong>Third Party Ad
