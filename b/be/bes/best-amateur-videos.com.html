        <h1>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) – Compliant Data Protection Policy</h1>
      <div class="divider"></div>
      <h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>CCBill, LLC ("CCBill") needs to gather and use certain information about individuals. This information can include customers, suppliers, business contacts, employees and other people the organization has a relationship with or may need to contact. This policy describes how this personal data must be collected, handled and stored to meet the company’s data protection standards – and to comply with the law.</p>
<h2>Why this Policy Exists</h2>
<p>This data protection policy ensures CCBill:</p>
<ul><li>Complies with data protection law and follows good practice</li>
<li>Protects the rights of staff, customers and partners</li>
<li>Is transparent about how it stores and processes individuals personal data</li>
<li>Protects itself from the risk of a data breach</li>
</ul>
<h2>The General Data Protection Regulation</h2>
<p>The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) replaces the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC and was designed to harmonize data privacy laws across Europe, to protect EU citizens’ data privacy and to reshape the way organizations across the world approach data privacy. The GDPR aims primarily to give control back to citizens and residents over their personal data and to simplify the regulatory environment for international business by unifying the regulation within the EU.</p>
<h2>What is "Personal Data"?</h2>
<p>"Personal data" is defined in both the Directive and the GDPR as any information relating to a person who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that person. So in many cases online identifiers including IP address, cookies and so forth will now be regarded as personal data if they can be (or are capable of being) without undue effort linked back to the data subject.</p>
<p>1. Information collection and tracking</p>
<p>1.1. When you visit our website.</p>
<p>You can visit our website (www.ccbill.com) without giving  away your personal information. CCBill uses Google Analytics and Cookies in  order to improve our service, user experience and analyze how our website is  used. Aside from the approximate location (IP address), the information  collected by Google Analytics is mostly anonymous traffic data including  browser information, device information, language. We do not collect additional  information, such as your age, gender, interests, bank details or clickstream.</p>
<p>The collected information is used to provide an overview of  how people are accessing and using the CCBill website. It is not used for any  additional purpose, such as to profile those who access our website.</p>
<p>2. When you contact us</p>
<p>While you can use our website without giving out your  personal information, once you contact us via the CCBill website, CCBill  collects information about you.</p>
