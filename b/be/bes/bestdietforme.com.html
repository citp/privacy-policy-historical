<p align="left"><b><font face="Arial" color="#3A6EA5" size="4">Privacy Policy</font></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Your privacy is very 
important to Marketdata Enterprises, Inc. the owner and operator of 
BestDietForMe.com (collectively, “us”, “we” and “our”). We want you to be 
comfortable visiting our Website and using our service. Our priority is 
providing our services to you in a manner that safeguards your privacy. We are a 
company This Privacy Policy governs our privacy practices in the United States 
and Canada and explains what information we collect from you, how we collect 
such information, what we do with such information, what methods we use to 
protect your information, and the choices you have concerning our use of your 
information. We ask that you take a moment and read this Privacy Policy 
carefully. From time to time, we may amend this Privacy Policy and the changes 
we make will be posted on this web page so that you will always know what 
information we gather and how we may use that information. Please refer back to 
this Privacy Policy on a regular basis. By using our Website and the services we 
provide you agree to be bound to the terms of this Privacy Policy. <br>
<br>
Please remember that this Privacy Policy applies only to information collected 
on our Website. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of any third 
parties from whom you request information through our Website. To safeguard your 
privacy, you should read the privacy policy of each and every website you visit 
whether as a result of using our Website or otherwise.<br>
<br>
<b>WHO DO I CONTACT IF I HAVE ANY PRIVACY QUESTIONS? </b><br>
If you have questions regarding this Privacy Policy, you should contact us at
<a href="mailto:privacy@BestDietForMe.com">privacy@BestDietForMe.com</a>. Or you 
may contact us at the address below. <br>
<br>
<b>WHAT INFORMATION ABOUT YOU IS COLLECTED ON OUR WEBSITE? </b><br>
We collect two types of information: personally identifiable information and 
non-personally identifiable information. <br>
<br>
<i>Personally Identifiable Information</i><br>
Personally identifiable information is information that identifies you or can be 
used to identify or contact you ("Personally Identifiable Information"). Such 
Personally Identifiable Information may include your name, address, email 
address and date of birth. We request Personally Identifiable Information from 
you when you use our service. We will collect Personally Identifiable 
Information from you only if you voluntarily submit such information to us. To 
benefit from our service, we require you to ‘Opt-In’ to the receipt of 
information from third-party sellers. To provide you with the services we 
render, we will sell, license, trade or rent your Personally Identifiable 
Information to third party sellers (as defined below) who will contact you to 
provide you with services you request through our Website. By way of example, if 
you choose to receive further information regarding a weight-loss or nutrition 
service as a result of your responses to our survey, then we will share your 
Personally Identifiable Information with such third party sellers so that they 
may contact you directly. Other than as specified in this Privacy Policy, your 
Personally Identifiable Information will not be disclosed. <br>
<br>
You do not have to provide us with any Personally Identifiable Information to 
visit our Website. However, if you choose to withhold requested information, you 
will not be able to receive valuable diet and nutrition information from third 
party sellers that is dependent upon the collection of such information. <br>
<br>
<i>Non-Personally Identifiable Information </i><br>
When you use our Website or in connection with the services we may make 
available on our Website from time to time, we may also collect information that 
by itself cannot be used to identify or contact you, such as demographic 
information (like age or gender) and health information (like weight and body 
mass index (“BMI”)) ("Non-Personally Identifiable Information"). Non-Personally 
Identifiable Information may also include user IP addresses, browser type, 
domain names, and other anonymous statistical data involving the use of our 
Website. Non-Personally Identifiable Information is used to help us understand 
who uses our Website, how our Website is used, and to improve and market our 
Website in general and our service in particular. <br>
<br>
<i>Information from Other Sources</i><br>
We may also supplement the information we collect from you with information from 
other sources to assist us in evaluating and improving our Website and service, 
to determine your preferences so that we can tailor our service to your needs, 
and/or to study nutritional, weight loss, behavioral and fitness questions in 
general. <br>
<br>
<b>WHERE AND WHEN IS INFORMATION COLLECTED ON OUR WEBSITE (INCLUDING THROUGH THE 
USE OF COOKIES AND ACTION TAGS)? </b><br>
We will collect information (including Personally Identifiable Information) from 
you in different manners and at different places and times on our Website. By 
way of example, when you complete our survey and request information from third 
party sellers. <br>
<br>
<i>Using our Website</i><br>
In order to use our Website and to receive the results of your responses to our 
survey and information from third party sellers we will ask you for information 
(including Personally Identifiable Information). You will be required to provide 
us with information (including Personally Identifiable Information) such as 
name, address, city, state, zip code and email address. This information is used 
by third party sellers to contact you about their nutrition and diet programs 
and services. <br>
<br>
<i>Cookies and Action Tags</i><br>
We also collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information passively using 
"cookies" and/or "action tags." <br>
<br>
"Cookies" are small text files that are placed on your computer in order to 
identify (i) your Web browser (ii) the activities of your computer on our 
Website and (iii) your activity in connection with our advertisements and other 
marketing and promotional efforts. Cookies may be used to: <br>
<br>
• assist you in using our Website (e.g., to save you time by not having to 
reenter your name upon each visit to our Website), and <br>
• allow us to statistically monitor how you are using our Website for purposes 
of improving our online offerings. <br>
<br>
In the future, as our Website is developed further, we will use cookies and/or 
action tags to conduct marketing and promotional efforts, tailor certain 
advertisements to your browser that we think may be of interest to you, or to 
determine the popularity of certain content. <br>
<br>
In addition to the cookies we place on your computer, in the future, cookies may 
also be placed on your computer by third parties that we use to display or serve 
advertisements or to collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information in order to 
provide advertising-related services. We have not designated a third party 
advertising server company at this time. When we do so we will notify you of our 
choice to serve our advertisements and the technology they will employ. You do 
not have to accept cookies to use our Website. However, you may not be able to 
use certain features or resources of our Website if you do not accept cookies. 
Although most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, you may reset your 
browser to notify you when you receive a cookie or to reject cookies generally. 
Most browsers offer instructions on how to do so in the "Help" section of the 
toolbar. <br>
<br>
"Action tags," also known as web beacons or .GIF tags, are a web technology used 
to help track anonymous website usage information, such as how many times a 
specific page has been viewed. Action tags are invisible to you, and any portion 
of our Website, including advertisements, or e-mail sent on our behalf, may 
contain cookies that are associated with action tags that are located on our 
Website. Unlike cookies, action tags are not placed on your computer. At this 
time, we do not use Action tags. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy 
over time for updates to this section. When we do designate a third party 
advertising service company we will amend this Privacy Policy and notify you of 
who we designate, the technology they will employ and give you the information 
you will need to “opt-out” from their technology. <br>
<br>
Finally, please note that advertisers and other third parties may also use their 
own cookies or action tags when you click on their advertisement or link to 
their website from our Website. This Privacy Policy does not govern your use of 
such third party websites or the privacy practices of third party advertising 
providers. <br>
<br>
<i>Log Files</i><br>
We also collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information through our Internet log 
files, which record data such as user IP addresses, browser types, domain names, 
and other anonymous statistical data involving the use of our Website. This 
information may be used to analyze trends, to administer the Website, to monitor 
our Website's use, and to gather general demographic information. We may link 
this information to Personally Identifiable Information for these and other 
purposes such as personalizing your experience on our Website and evaluating our 
service in general. <br>
<br>
<b>DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM CHILDREN UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE? </b><br>
No. We are committed to protecting the privacy of children. Our Website and 
service are not designed for or directed to children under the age of 13. We do 
not collect Personally Identifiable Information from any person we actually know 
is under the age of 13. We urge all parents and/or guardians to participate in 
their children's exploration of the Internet, and to teach their children about 
protecting their personal information while online. <br>
<br>
<b>WHAT DO WE DO WITH THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT? </b><br>
In general, we use the information collected on our Website to help us 
understand who uses our Website and how they are using it, to assist you in 
using our Website, and to improve our Website and service. As a user of our 
Website and after you "‘Opt-In’" to future communications from third party 
sellers you will be contacted by such third parties regarding their product and 
service offerings that may be of interest to you. If you no longer desire for us 
to share your information with such third parties email us at
<a href="mailto:unsubscribe@BestDietForMe.com">unsubscribe@BestDietForMe.com</a>. 
After you receive information from third party sellers and if you no longer wish 
to receive such information please contact each third party seller directly to 
unsubscribe from their communications. <br>
<br>
We may also use the information gathered on our Website to perform statistical 
analysis of user behavior, to analyze and evaluate issues relating to nutrition, 
weight loss, behavior and fitness, or to evaluate and improve our service and to 
assist those third party sellers in doing same. <br>
<br>
<b>WHEN DO WE DISCLOSE INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES? </b><br>
Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy or as specifically agreed to by you, 
we will not disclose any information we gather from you on our Website. <br>
<br>
<i>Laws and Legal Rights</i><br>
We may also disclose your information (including Personally Identifiable 
Information) if we believe in good faith that we are required to do so in order 
to comply with an applicable statute, regulation, rule or law, a subpoena, a 
search warrant, a court or regulatory order, or other valid legal process. We 
may disclose Personally Identifiable Information in special circumstances when 
we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to 
identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our 
Terms &amp; Conditions, or to protect the safety and/or security of our users, our 
Website or the general public. <br>
<br>
<i>Third Parties Generally</i><br>
We may provide to third parties information about you that does not allow you to 
be identified or contacted, including where such information is combined with 
similar information of other users of our Website. For example, we might inform 
third parties regarding the number of unique users who visit our Website, the 
demographic breakdown of the users of our Website, or the activities that 
visitors to our Website engage in while on our Website. The third parties to 
which we may provide this information may include potential or actual 
advertisers, providers of advertising services (including website tracking 
services), commercial partners, sponsors, licensees, researchers and other 
similar parties. We will provide third parties with your Personally Identifiable 
Information only when you ‘Opt-In’ to receive information from these third party 
sellers.<br>
<br>
<i>Outside Contractors</i><br>
We may employ independent contractors, vendors and suppliers (collectively, 
"Outside Contractors") to provide specific services and products related to our 
Website, such as web hosting and developing applications for our Website and 
e-mail services. These Outside Contractors may sometimes have limited access to 
information collected on our Website, including your Personally Identifiable 
Information, in the course of providing products or services to us. Access to 
your Personally Identifiable Information by these contractors is limited to the 
information reasonably necessary in order for the Outside Contractors to perform 
their limited function for us. We also require that these contractors (i) 
protect the privacy of your Personally Identifiable Information consistent with 
this Privacy Policy, and (ii) not use or disclose your Personally Identifiable 
Information for any purpose other than providing us with products or services 
for which we contracted. <br>
<br>
<i>Third Party Sellers</i><br>
Through our Website, you have the opportunity to obtain more information 
regarding certain content, products or services sold through a person or company 
other than us ("Third Party Sellers"). Third Party Sellers may request that you 
submit certain information to them in order to purchase their products or 
services or to obtain additional information from them. You do not need to 
submit this information or purchase any products or services from Third Party 
Sellers to access our Website. By choosing to ‘Opt-In’ to receipt of Third Party 
Sellers information, you affirmatively consent to have your Personally 
Identifiable Information shared with the Third Party Seller. How such Third 
Party Seller uses your Personally Identifiable Information will be subject to 
such Third Party Sellers privacy practices.<br>
<br>
<i>Sale of Business</i><br>
We reserve the right to transfer information to a third party in the event of a 
sale, merger or other transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of 
Marketdata Enterprises, Inc. We will notify users of any such transfer through 
notice on our site and through email. <br>
<br>
<b>DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY APPLY WHEN I LINK TO OTHER WEBSITES? </b><br>
No. Our Website contains links to other websites not owned or operated by us 
(for example, if you "click" on a banner advertisement, you will likely be taken 
off our Website to another website). Please be aware that we are not responsible 
for the privacy practices of such websites. We encourage you to be aware when 
our Website links to other websites and to read the privacy policies or 
statements of each and every website. This Privacy Policy applies solely to 
information collected by our Website. <br>
<br>
<b>IS THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT SECURE? </b><br>
We want your information (including Personally Identifiable Information) to 
remain as secure as possible. We strive to provide secure transmission of your 
information from your computer to our servers through industry-standard 
techniques. We use Secured Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology in 
transmitting such Personally Identifiable Information over the Internet to our 
servers. We secure the Personally Identifiable Information you provide on 
servers located in controlled, secure environments, protected from unauthorized 
access, use, or alteration. Only employees who need access to your information 
to perform a specific task or function are granted access to such information. 
In addition, our employees must abide by this Privacy Policy and are kept 
up-to-date on security practices. Any employee who violates this Privacy Policy 
is subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination. <br>
<br>
Notwithstanding the above commitments to protect your information (including 
Personally Identifiable Information) from loss, misuse or alteration by third 
parties, you should be aware that there is always some risk involved in 
transmitting information over the Internet. There is also some risk that others 
could find a way to thwart our security systems. As a result, while we strive to 
protect your information, we cannot insure or warrant the security and privacy 
of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. <br>
<br>
<b>WHAT CHOICES DO I HAVE REGARDING THE COLLECTION, DISCLOSURE AND DISTRIBUTION 
OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION?</b> <br>
Except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, we will only use 
Personally Identifiable Information for the purposes described above or as 
otherwise disclosed at the time we request such information from you. You must 
‘Opt-In’ and give us permission to use your Personally Identifiable Information. 
If you no longer wish to receive communications from us via postal mail, you may 
notify us by calling us at 813-907-9090 or by contacting us at the address set 
out below. <br>
<br>
<b>CAN I UPDATE OR CORRECT MY PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION? </b><br>
You can always contact us in order to (1) update or correct your Personally 
Identifiable Information, (2) change your preferences with respect to 
communications and other information you receive from us, or (3) delete the 
Personally Identifiable Information maintained about you on our systems, by 
contacting us at <a href="mailto:info@BestDietForMe.com">info@BestDietForMe.com</a> 
or at the address set out below. Such updates, corrections, changes and 
deletions will not have an effect on other information that we maintain, or 
information that we have provided to third -parties in accordance with this 
Privacy Policy prior to such update, correction, change or deletion. <br>
<br>
You should be aware that it is not technologically possible to remove each and 
every record of the information you have provided to us from our systems. The 
need to back-up our systems to protect information from inadvertent loss means 
that a copy of your Personally Identifiable Information may exist in a 
non-erasable form that will be difficult or impossible for us to locate. We 
promise that promptly after receiving your request, all Personally Identifiable 
Information stored in databases we actively use and other readily searchable 
media will be updated, corrected, changed or deleted, as appropriate, as soon as 
reasonably practicable. <br>
<br>
<b>HOW WILL I KNOW IF THERE ARE ANY CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY? </b><br>
If we decide to change this Privacy Policy, we will post those changes on this 
web page so you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, 
and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to 
use Personally Identifiable Information in a manner significantly different from 
that stated in this Privacy Policy, or otherwise disclosed to you, at the time 
it was collected, we will notify you by email or otherwise, and you will have a 
choice as to whether or not we use your Personally Identifiable Information in 
the new manner. We may also make non-significant changes to our Privacy Policy 
that generally will not affect our use of your Personally Identifiable 
Information. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, you should 
not use our Website. <br>
