## 1\. Collection of Information.

### 1.1 Survey Information.

Best Food Secrets collects information from individuals by various methods, including, but not limited to, when an individual voluntarily completes a Best Food Secrets survey, order form, or a registration pages either online or offline, or by means of online or offline surveys, order forms, or registration pages operated by third parties (collectively, a "Survey"). (As used herein, "online" means using the Internet, including the Websites, and related technologies, and "offline" means by methods other than online, including in person, in the postal mail, using telephones and cell phones, and other similar means.) In the Surveys, Best Food Secrets or a third party (a "Third Party") may ask an individual to provide various information to Best Food Secrets , which may include his or her name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, social security number, employment information, personal and online interests, and such other information as may be requested from time to time (together, "Survey Information"). Best Food Secrets may also collect information concerning an individual from another source and uses that information in combination with information provided from this web site. Completing the Surveys is completely voluntary, and individuals are under no obligation to provide Survey Information to Best Food Secrets or Third Party, but an individual may receive incentives from Best Food Secrets or a Third Party in exchange for providing Survey Information to Best Food Secrets.

### 1.2 Third Party List Information.

Best Food Secrets collects information from individuals when an individual provides information to a third party and Best Food Secrets subsequently purchases, licenses, or otherwise acquires the information from the third party (the "Seller"). Such purchased information may include, but is not limited to, an individual's name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), birth date, gender, salary range, credit card information, education and marital status, occupation, industry of employment, personal and online interests, and such other information as the individual may have provided to the Seller (together, "Third Party List Information"). When acquiring Third Party List Information, Best Food Secrets seeks assurances from the Seller that the Seller has a right to transfer the Third Party List Information to Best Food Secrets and that the Seller has a right to provide offers from advertisers to the individuals whose personal information is included on the Seller's list.

### 1.3 Other Information.

Other occasions when Best Food Secrets obtains information from individuals include (1) when an individual is making a claim for a prize or seeking to redeem an incentive offered by Best Food Secrets or by a third party, (2) when an individual requests assistance through Best Food Secrets's customer service department, and (3) when an individual voluntarily subscribes to a Best Food Secrets service or newsletter (together, "Other Information").

### 1.4 Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Info Collected Using Technology.

Best Food Secrets currently uses cookie and web beacon technology to associate certain Internet-related information about an individual with information about the individual in our database. Additionally, Best Food Secrets may use other new and evolving sources of information in the future (together, "Technology Information").

### (a) Cookies.

A cookie is a small amount of data stored on the hard drive of the individual's computer that allows Best Food Secrets to identify the individual with his or her corresponding data that resides in Best Food Secrets's database. You may read more about cookies at http://cookiecentral.com. Individuals who use the Websites need to accept cookies in order to use all of the features and functionality of the Websites.

### (b) Web Beacons.

A web beacon is programming code that can be used to display an image on a web page (by using an programming function -- see http://truste.org for more information), but can also be used to transfer an individual's unique user identification (often in the form of a cookie) to a database and associate the individual with previously acquired information about an individual in a database. This allows Best Food Secrets to track certain web sites an individual visits online. Web beacons are used to determine products or services an individual may be interested in, and to track online behavioral habits for marketing purposes. For example, Best Food Secrets might place, with the consent of a third party website, a web beacon on the third party's website where fishing products are sold. When Bill, an individual listed in Best Food Secrets's database, visits the fishing website, Best Food Secrets receives notice by means of the web beacon that Bill visited the fishing site, and Best Food Secrets would then update Bill's profile with the information that Bill is interested in fishing. Best Food Secrets may thereafter present offers of fishing related products and services to Bill. In addition to using web beacons on web pages, Best Food Secrets also uses web beacons in email messages sent to individuals listed in Best Food Secrets's database.

### (c) New Technology.

The use of technology on the Internet, including cookies and web beacons, is rapidly evolving, as is Best Food Secrets's use of new and evolving technology. As a result, Best Food Secrets strongly encourages individuals to revisit this policy for any updates regarding its use of technology.

Because it does not collect such information, Best Food Secrets has no such information to use or to disclose to third parties. Best Food Secrets has designed this policy in order to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA").
