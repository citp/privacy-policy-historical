## Changes to the Policy

Best Friends may change this Privacy Policy at any time. If and when a change occurs, notice will be prominently posted on the Digital Properties covered by the Privacy Policy. However, please refer back to the Privacy Policy regularly because your use of the Websites, Social Media Sites, Applications and/or other communication channels signifies that you agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy.

## What information does Best Friends collect?

In several areas of our Digital Properties, Best Friends collects user-submitted personally identifiable information, such as your name, home address, email address, and telephone number.

Best Friends also collects anonymous demographic information, which cannot identify you personally, such as ZIP code, gender, or interests. We may append to the data you provide additional data from publicly available sources in an effort to enhance your relationship with Best Friends.

We may collect information about your interaction with our Digital Properties. For example, we may use website analytic tools on the Websites to retrieve information such as the site you came from or the keywords you used to find the Websites. We will also use technologies, such as cookies and pixel-based tracking, to collect information about the pages you view, the links you click on and other actions you take on the Websites. We use the aggregated information to provide a more useful and engaging experience to Website visitors. This information will sometimes be used to display content to you on our Websites, Applications or Social Media Sites.

In order to access certain areas on our Digital Properties, you may need to first complete certain steps to become either a registered user or a subscriber. During these steps, you may be required to provide us with personally identifiable information such as your name, ZIP code and email address. This information is used to help us understand who uses our Digital Properties, to operate and improve our Digital Properties, and to deliver the services or carry out the transactions you have requested.

## How Does Best Friends Secure My Information?

Best Friends provides visitors to our Digital Properties with a secure experience when making a donation or purchasing merchandise through them. We work with Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) compliant vendors.  When personal information is transmitted, it is protected through the use of industry-standard security technology, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.

Even with these measures in place, users should use special caution when using publicly accessible computer terminals or transmitting personal information over unsecured wireless networks.

In addition, on certain Website pages like blogs and news stories, we offer visitors the opportunity to provide comments or other user-generated content. You may also be able to comment on Social Media Sites or while using our Applications. Any information that you disclose when posting a message to these areas, along with the screen name or ID used, becomes public. We are not responsible for any personally identifiable information that you choose to disclose in the public areas of our Websites, Applications or Social Media Sites.
