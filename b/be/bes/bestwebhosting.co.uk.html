<p>Although this privacy notice sets out most of your rights under the new laws, we may not yet be able
to respond to some of your requests (for example, a request for the transfer of your personal data)
until May 2018 as we are still working towards getting our systems ready for some of these
changes.</p>
<p>It is important that the personal data we hold about you is accurate and current.</p>
<p>Please keep us informed if your personal data changes during your relationship with us.</p>

<h5>Third-party links</h5>

<h4>2. The data we collect about you</h4>

and you fail to provide that data when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we
have or are trying to enter into with you (for example, to provide you with goods or services).</p>
<p>In this case, we may have to cancel a product or service you have with us but we will notify you if
this is the case at the time.</p>

  <li>Where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Generally we do not rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your personal data other than to
respond to an enquiry you make to us via our website where by making the enquiry you consent to
us using any personal data provided for the purposes of dealing with and responding to that

<h5>Marketing</h5>
<p>We strive to provide you with choices regarding certain personal data uses, particularly around
marketing and advertising:</p>
<h5>Promotional offers from us</h5>
<p>We may use your Identity, Contact, Technical, Usage and Profile Data to form a view on what we
think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you. This is how we decide which
products, services and offers may be relevant for you (we call this marketing).</p>
<p>You will receive marketing communications from us if you have requested information from us or
purchased goods or services from us or if you provided us with your details when you entered a
competition or registered for a promotion and, in each case, you have not opted out of receiving that
marketing.</p>
<h5>Third-party marketing</h5>
<p>We will get your express opt-in consent before we share your personal data with any company
outside of Smart Hosting for marketing purposes.
</p>
<h5>Opting out</h5>
<p>You can ask us or third parties to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by contacting
us at any time.
</p>
<p>Where you opt out of receiving these marketing messages, this will not apply to personal data
provided to us as a result of a product/service purchase, warranty registration, product/service
experience or other transactions.</p>
<h5>Cookies</h5>
<p>You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when websites set
or access cookies. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of this website may
become inaccessible or not function properly.
</p>
<p>For more information about the cookies we use, please see our cookie policy.</p>
<h5>Change of purpose</h5>
<p>We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably
consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original
purpose.
</p>
<p>If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with
the original purpose, please contact us.
</p>
<p>If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain
the legal basis which allows us to do so.
</p>
<p>Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in
compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.
</p>

<p>We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes
and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with
our instructions.</p>

<h4>6. International transfers</h4>
<p>We share your personal data within the Smart Hosting Group and on occasion along with 3rd party
suppliers where required and listed specifically within our Glossary.</p>
<p>This might involve transferring your data outside the European Economic Area (EEA).</p>
<p>We ensure your personal data is protected by requiring all our 3rd parties to follow the same rules
when processing your personal data.</p>
<p>These rules are called "binding corporate rules". For further details, see European Commission:
Binding corporate rules.</p>
<p>Many of our external third parties are based outside the European Economic Area (EEA) so their
processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.</p>
<p>Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection
is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:</p>
<ul>
  <li>We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an
adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission. For further details,
see European Commission: Adequacy of the protection of personal data in non-EU countries.</li>
  <li>Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the
European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe. For
further details, see European Commission: Model contracts for the transfer of personal data to
third countries.</li>
  <li>Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the
Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared
between the Europe and the US. For further details, see European Commission: EU-US Privacy
Shield.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when
transferring your personal data out of the EEA.</p>

<h4>7. Data security</h4>

<p>We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being
accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we
limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties
who have a business need to know.
</p><p>They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of
confidentiality.</p>
<p>We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify
you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.</p>
<h4>8. Data retention</h4>
<h5>How long will you use my personal data for?</h5>
<p>We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it
for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.
</p><p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature,
and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of
your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can
achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p>
<p>By law we have to keep basic information about our customers (including Contact, Identity,
Financial and Transaction Data) for [six] years after they cease being customers for tax purposes.
</p><p>In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see [Request erasure] below for further
information.</p>
<p>In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be
associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information
indefinitely without further notice to you.
</p>

<h4>9. Your legal rights</h4>
<p>Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal
data.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>[Request access to your personal data].</li>
  <li>[Request correction of your personal data].</li>
  <li>[Request erasure of your personal data].</li>
  <li>[Object to processing of your personal data].</li>
  <li>[Request restriction of processing your personal data].</li>
  <li>[Request transfer of your personal data].</li>
  <li>[Right to withdraw consent].</li>
</ul>

<p>If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us.</p>
<h5>No fee usually required</h5>
<p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights).
However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or
excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
</p>
<h5>What we may need from you</h5>
<p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure
your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights).
This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no
right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your
request to speed up our response.
</p>

<h5>Time limit to respond</h5>
<p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer
than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this
case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
</p>

<h5>YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS</h5>
<p>You have the right to:</p>
<p><strong>Request access</strong> to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This
enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are
lawfully processing it.</p>
<p><strong>Request correction</strong> of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any
incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the
accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
</p>
<p><strong>Request erasure</strong> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal
data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us
to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object
to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we
are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not
always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be
notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
</p>
<p><strong>Object to processing</strong> of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those
of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to
object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms.
You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing
purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to
process your information which override your rights and freedoms.
</p>
<p><strong>Request restriction of processing</strong> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend
the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the
data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c)
where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish,
exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to
verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
</p>
<p><strong>Request the transfer</strong> of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a
third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable
format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided
consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
</p>
<p><strong>Withdraw consent at any time</strong> where we are relying on consent to process your personal data.
However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your
consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to
you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
</p>

<p>2.              <strong>Personal data types and processing purposes</strong></p>
 
<p>2.1           The Data Controller retains control of the Personal Data and remains responsible for its compliance obligations under the applicable Data Protection Legislation, including providing any required notices and obtaining any required consents, and for the processing instructions it gives to the Data Processor.</p>
 
<p>2.2           ANNEX A describes the subject matter, duration, nature and purpose of processing and the Personal Data categories and Data Subject types in respect of which the Data Processor may process to provide services to the Data Controller under the terms of the Services Agreement or otherwise.</p>
 
<p><strong>3. Data Processor's obligations</strong></p>
 
<p>3.1           The Data Controller acknowledges that for the purposes of fulfilling its obligations under the Agreement the Data Processor may have access to and may be required to process Personal Data (as defined in the Data Protection Legislation) on behalf of the Data Controller and in accepting the Agreement the Data Controller authorises the Data Processor to process its Personal Data in accordance with the terms of this Clause 3.</p>

<p>3.2           Both parties will comply with all applicable requirements of the Data Protection Legislation. This clause 3 is in addition to, and does not relieve, remove or replace, a party's obligations under the Data Protection Legislation.</p>

<p>3.3           The parties acknowledge that for the purposes of the Data Protection Legislation, the Data Controller is the data controller and the Data Processor is the data processor (where Data Controller and Data Processor have the meanings as defined in the Data Protection Legislation).</p>

<p>3.4           Without prejudice to the generality of clause 3.2, the Data Controller will ensure that it has all necessary appropriate consents and notices in place to enable lawful transfer of the Personal Data to the Data Processor for the duration and purposes of this agreement.</p>

<p>3.5           Without prejudice to the generality of clause 3.2, the Data Processor shall, in relation to any Personal Data processed in connection with the performance by the Data Processor of its obligations under this agreement:</p>
<p>(a)         process that Personal Data only on the written instructions of the Data Controller unless the Data Processor is required by the laws of any member of the European Union or by the laws of the European Union applicable to the Data Processor to process Personal Data (Applicable Laws). Where the Data Processor is relying on laws of a member of the European Union or European Union law as the basis for processing Personal Data, the Data Processor shall promptly notify the Data Controller of this before performing the processing required by the Applicable Laws unless those Applicable Laws prohibit the Data Processor from so notifying the Data Controller;</p>
<p>(b)        ensure that it has in place appropriate technical and organisational measures, to protect against unauthorised or unlawful processing of Personal Data and against accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to, Personal Data, appropriate to the harm that might result from the unauthorised or unlawful processing or accidental loss, destruction or damage and the nature of the data to be protected, having regard to the state of technological development and the cost of implementing any measures (those measures may include, where appropriate, pseudonymising and encrypting Personal Data, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of its systems and services, ensuring that availability of and access to Personal Data can be restored in a timely manner after an incident, and regularly assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of the technical and organisational measures adopted by it);</p>
<p>(c)         ensure that all personnel who have access to and/or process Personal Data are obliged to keep the Personal Data confidential; and</p>
<p>(d)        subject to clause [3.10] to not transfer any Personal Data outside of the European Economic Area (“EEA”) unless the prior written consent of the Data Controller has been obtained and the following conditions are fulfilled:</p>
<p>(i)         the Data Controller or the Data Processor has provided appropriate safeguards in relation to the transfer;</p>
<p>(ii)        the data subject has enforceable rights and effective legal remedies;</p>
<p>(iii)   	the Data Processor complies with its obligations under the Data Protection Legislation by providing an adequate level of protection to any Personal Data that is transferred; and</p>
<p>(iv)   	the Data Processor complies with reasonable instructions notified to it in advance by the Data Controller with respect to the processing of the Personal Data;</p>
<p>(e)         if so reasonably required, assist the Data Controller, at the Data Controller's cost, in responding to any request from a Data Subject and in ensuring compliance with its obligations under the Data Protection Legislation with respect to security, breach notifications, impact assessments and consultations with supervisory authorities or regulators;</p>
<p>(f)         notify the Data Controller without undue delay on becoming aware of a Personal Data breach;</p>
<p>(g)        if so reasonably required, at the written direction of the Data Controller, delete or return Personal Data and copies thereof to the Data Controller on termination of the agreement unless required by Applicable Law to store the Personal Data; and</p>
<p>(h)        if so reasonably required, maintain complete and accurate records and information to demonstrate its compliance with this clause 3.</p>
<p>3.6           In accepting these Terms and Conditions the Data Controller consents to the Data Processor appointing third-party processors of Personal Data (“the Sub Processors”) under this agreement.</p>

<p>3.7           The Data Processor shall enter with the Sub Processors into a written agreement incorporating terms which are substantially similar to those set out in this clause 3 prior to any Sub Processor being appointed.</p>

<p>3.8           The Data Controller accepts that for the purposes of this Agreement part or all of its Personal Data may need to be processed outside of the EEA and the Data Controller further consents to the Data Processor processing its Personal Data in appointing these third party processors listed at Annex A who are located outside of the EEA.</p>

<p>3.9           The Data Controller shall have the ability to withdraw its consent to the Data Processor’s use of Sub Processor for the purposes of fulfilling this Agreement by notifying the Data Processor in writing at its registered office.  However the Data Controller acknowledges that the Data Processor may not be able to perform the Services or any part of the Services unless it is able to appoint an alternative Sub Processor and where an alternative Sub Processor cannot be appointed, the Data Processor shall not be obliged to provide any part of the Services which are so affected.</p>

<p>3.10        The Data Processor may, at any time on not less than 30 days’ notice, revise this clause 3 by replacing it with any applicable controller to processor standard clauses or similar terms forming party of an applicable certification scheme (which shall apply when replaced by attachment to this agreement).</p>

<p><strong>4.              Term and termination</strong></p>
 
<p>4.1           This Agreement will remain in full force and effect so long as:</p>
 
<p>(a)        the Services Agreement remains in effect or the Data Processor provides the relevant services to the Data Controller, or</p>

<p>(b)       the Data Processor retains any Personal Data related to the Services Agreement and/or the services in its possession or control.</p>
 
<p>4.2           Any provision of this Agreement that expressly or by implication should come into or continue in force on or after termination of the Services Agreement or the provision of services by the Data Processor to the Data Controller (as may be applicable) in order to protect Personal Data will remain in full force and effect.</p>
 
<p>4.3           If a change in any Data Protection Legislation prevents either party from fulfilling all or part of its obligations to the other party, the parties will suspend the processing of Personal Data until that processing complies with the new requirements. If the parties are unable to bring the Personal Data processing into compliance with the Data Protection Legislation within 28 days, they may terminate the Services Agreement and/or the provision of services on written notice to the other party without prejudice to any right or remedy the parties may have under the Services Agreement or otherwise</p>

<p><strong>Waiver.</strong> A waiver of any right under this Agreement or law is only effective if it is in writing and shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any subsequent breach or default. No failure or delay by a party in exercising any right or remedy provided under this Agreement or by law shall constitute a waiver of that or any other right or remedy, nor shall it prevent or restrict its further exercise of that or any other right or remedy. No single or partial exercise of such right or remedy shall prevent or restrict the further exercise of that or any other right or remedy.</p>
<p><strong>No partnership or agency.</strong> Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, or shall be deemed to, establish any partnership or joint venture between the parties, nor constitute either party the agent of the other for any purpose. Neither party shall have authority to act as agent for, or to bind, the other party in any way.</p>
<p><strong>Third parties.</strong> A person who is not a party to this Agreement shall not have any rights to enforce its terms.</p>
