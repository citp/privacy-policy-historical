### 2\. Information Collected

Information you provide directly to us. You may provide different types of information to us when you access various content or features, post reviews or ratings, directly contact us, or otherwise interact with our websites, mobile sites or mobile applications, including:

  * Contact information such as name, email address, mailing address, phone number, and mobile number;
  * User name and password; and
  * When you post a review or make a comment, information you provide such as your user name, email address, geographic location, and the content of your review or comment.



Information we collect automatically. We may collect certain information automatically, including through the use of cookies (see below), web beacons, and other technologies. This information may include the following:

  * Your browser and mobile device type, operating system and name of your Internet service provider;
  * Web pages you visit;
  * Geo-location information;
  * Information about your interactions with email messages, such as whether the messages were opened and the links clicked in those emails; and

Like most standard website servers, we also use log files. Log files track anonymous user information including, but not limited to internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks. This information is tracked in order to analyze trends, administer our websites, track users’ movements in the aggregate and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. The information tracked via log files is not linked to personally identifiable information except for IP addresses and source URL.

Cookies. Our websites use a “cookie” to assign a unique identifier to your computer. The cookies we use are persistent files that your web browser places on your computer’s hard drive. Cookies may be used to help save information on past activities and other preferences, so that you are not required to reenter information each time that you visit our websites, and to deliver content specific to your interests.

Information we obtain from other sources. We may collect information about you from other sources, including when you use social media integrated with our products and services (for example, on our pages on Facebook) and when you were to purchase products and services from third party services. Examples of the type of information we may receive from other sources are user name and password and payment card information and demographic and lifestyle information.

Combining Information. Please note that the information we collect about you may be combined or supplemented with information from other sources, such as information to validate or update your address, payment card or demographic information.

However, by submitting your information to our websites, you grant BestCompany.com and any third-party affiliates or subsidiaries of BestCompany.com the right to use that information for marketing purposes, and agree to receive email marketing from our website. We may maintain separate email lists for different purposes. We may share, license or sell your information to third parties for various marketing purposes, including but not limited to e-mail marketing, telemarketing, text messaging, and direct mail.

### 4\. Disclosure of Information

User Reviews. If you submit reviews, we may share your submissions with other websites or provide links to your submissions from other websites and we may share your information with third parties. By submitting your email address to our websites you agree to receive email marketing from BestCompanies.com and our affiliated websites. We are able to offer third party services to you, in part, based on your willingness to be reached by our third-party advertisers.

Authorized Third-Party Service Providers.

We provide these companies only with the information they need to perform their services.

Business Transfers. We may share your information in connection with a substantial corporate transaction, such as the sale of one or more of our businesses, a merger, the creation of a separate business to provide certain of our products and services, the sale or pledge of our assets, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy, insolvency or receivership. Information about our customers, donors, and other users of our websites and other products and services may also be shared in connection with a transaction in which BestCompany.com or one of our affiliates, is seeking financing, investment, support, or funding.

If we engage in any of these types of transactions, your information will be subject to our privacy policy in effect at the time of the transfer of that information.

Legal Requirements. We may disclose your information if required by law, such as to comply with a court order or subpoena.

Protect our Websites and Users. We may also disclose your information to investigate, prevent or take action regarding suspected illegal activities or any violation of the User Agreement or to protect and defend the legal rights and safety of our websites and our employees, agents and contractors (including to enforce our agreements) or in connection with any safety or security concerns. Moreover, you hereby consent to the disclosure of any record or communication to any third party when BestCompany.com, in its sole discretion, determines the disclosure to be appropriate including, without limitation, sharing your email address with other third parties for suppression purposes in compliance with the provisions of the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, as amended from time-to-time.
