            whenever you visit our site. The information saved is used for the functionality of the site, for example,

            including newsletters and alerts. Your information may also be used to contact you when necessary (such as
            to assist you in your use of the website). You may always choose not to provide us with this information.
            However, this may limit our ability to provide you with a specific service. You may opt-out of receiving
