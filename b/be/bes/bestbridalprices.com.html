<font size="14" color="#000099"><b><u> Privacy Policy </u></b></font>
<br><br><br><table><tbody><tr><td width="450">
<font color="#000099"><b>Do you sell or trade customer names and addresses?</b></font><br>
We never sell, rent, or trade names, addresses,  e-mail addresses, or any other customer information. Period.<br><br><br>
<font color="#000099"><b> What kind of information will I be asked for?</b></font><br>
We will ask you to provide information when you place an order. That information includes the following: your name, address, phone number, e-mail address and credit card information. We also maintain a record of your purchases. If you ship your order to an address different from your billing address, we will ask you to enter the "ship to" name and address.<br><br><br>
<font color="#000099"><b>  How will Best Bridal Prices use the information I provide?</b></font><br>
Your information is used to process and deliver your order to the address you request. Your payment information allows us to bill your credit card company. If we have any questions regarding your order, we will contact you by phone or e-mail. <br><br>
We often use testimonials from our customers in printed material or on our Web site, but only when we have your express permission to do so. Testimonials come from customer comments posted or e-mailed directly. Additional uses of customer information do not in any way identify individuals. Instead they describe our customers as groups; for example, everyone who orders petite sizes or those who order only at certain times of the year. From time to time we provide statistical information about our consumers, sales, traffic patterns on our Web site and site shopping information. These statistics are used in communications such as our annual report and do not identify individuals.<br><br><br>
<font color="#000099"><b>   How do I know Best Bridal Prices.com is a secure site?</b></font><br>
We use state-of-the-art technology to encrypt your financial information before it is sent. The ordering area of our site is protected this way and is referred to as "secure." Secure transmission is not necessary for our product pictures or general site information and is not used there. This keeps our site faster and your shopping experience more enjoyable. And you never have to worry about sending us your credit card information.<br><br><br>
<font color="#000099"><b>    Does BestBridalPrices.com use SSL technology?</b></font><br>
Yes, we do. Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology is the gold standard in Internet encryption. This highly sophisticated system scrambles your financial data as it travels from your computer to our Web site.<br><br><br>
<font color="#000099"><b>Our Commitment To Data Security </b></font><br>
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. 
<br><br><br>
<font color="#000099"><b>How You Can Access Or Correct Your Information </b></font><br>
You can access all your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain by contacting us at sales@bestbridalprices.com.   We use this procedure to better safeguard your information. 
<br><br>
You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable information by sending us a request that credibly shows error to sales@bestbridalprices.com 
<br><br>
To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections. 
<br><br><br>
