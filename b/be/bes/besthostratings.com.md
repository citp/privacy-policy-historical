# Privacy Policy - Web Hosting Reviews

We respect and are committed to protecting your privacy. That is why we have adopted this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy lets you know how your personal information is processed and used. We promise that we will take steps to use your personal information only in ways that are compatible with this Privacy Policy. The following discloses our Privacy Policy.   
**  
What information are you collecting and how are you collecting it?**   
Every computer connected to the Internet is given a domain name and a set of numbers, that serve as that computer's "Internet Protocol" IP address. When a visitor requests a page from our site our Web servers automatically recognize that visitor's domain name and IP address. The domain name and IP address reveal nothing personal about you other than the IP address from which you have accessed our site. We store IP addresses and referrer URL to help detect problems with our server, detect manipulation of ratings, and to analyze trends and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. 

**What are cookies?**  
A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent to your Internet browser from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. A cookie can't read data off of your computer hard disk or read cookie files created by other Web sites. Cookies do not damage your system. We use cookies to detect manipulation of webhost ratings and multiple reviews submissions. Our advertisers may also use cookies to ascertain how many times you've seen an advertisement. You can choose whether to accept cookies by changing the settings of your Internet browser. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies, or allow your browser to show you when a cookie is being sent. If you choose not to accept these cookies, your experience at our Site and other Web sites may be diminished and some features may not work as intended.
