# Privacy policy - Best Western

**Last Updated:** August 2015

Interchange and Consort Hotels t/a Best Western Hotels Great Britain (referred to herein as " **BWGB** ," " **we** ," and " **us** ") is committed to protecting your privacy and wants you to be familiar with how we collect, use, and disclose Personal Data (as defined below). This Privacy Policy (this " **Policy** ") describes our practices in connection with information that we collect through our websites and mobile applications (collectively, the " **Site** ") and by other means as described in this Policy. This Policy also applies to the collection, use, and disclosure of such information by our group (collectively known as " **BW Group Companies** "). References to " **BWGB** ," " **we** " and " **us** " throughout this Policy, depending upon the context, collectively refer to BWGB and BW Group Companies. 

By using this Site or by providing Personal Data (as defined below) to BWGB, you consent to all actions taken by us with respect to your Personal Data as set forth in this Policy. If you do not agree to the terms and conditions of this Policy, please do not use the Site or provide any Personal Data to BWGB through our Site or otherwise.

This Policy does not address the collection, use, or disclosure of information by third parties, including entities authorized by BWGB or by an authorized licensee of BWGB to operate Best Western® branded hotels and properties (" **Licensed Hotels** "), and third-party affiliated organizations permitted to sublicense Licensed Hotels outside the United Kingdom in various countries and territories throughout the world (" **Affiliates** "). Please be aware that Licensed Hotels and Affiliates are independent entities neither owned nor controlled by BWGB or BW Group Companies. Licensed Hotels and Affiliates might have their own privacy policies, which might be different from this Policy. To learn about the privacy practices of any of the Licensed Hotels or Affiliates, please review their respective privacy policies, not this Policy.

While this Policy is intended to describe the broadest range of our information processing activities globally, those activities may be more limited in some jurisdictions based on the restrictions of their laws.

## PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT

BWGB may collect " **Personal Data** " from you, meaning information that identifies you as an individual or from which you may be identified. For example, we may collect:

  * contact information, such as your name, mailing address, e-mail address, and telephone number;
  * credit card number or other payment account number, billing address, and other payment and billing information (" **Payment Information** ");
  * Best Western Rewards® (" **BWR®** ") loyalty program member information, online user account details, profile or password details and any frequent flyer or travel partner program affiliation;
  * records and copies of your correspondence if you contact us;
  * information necessary to fulfill special requests (e.g., health conditions that require specific accommodation);
  * guest stay information, including the hotels where you have stayed, date of arrival and departure, and goods and services purchased;
  * information collected through the use of closed circuit television systems, card key and other security systems; and
  * in limited cases, information relating to the credit of customers.



We may collect Personal Information:

  * through the Site;
  * through reservation and call centers;
  * through social media and brand channels (e.g. Facebook, Twitter);
  * from Licensed Hotels, Affiliates, or other third parties; or
  * when you otherwise voluntarily provide it to us, including in connection with our loyalty program (i.e. BWR).



We may also combine Personal Data we collect with publicly available Personal Data and Personal Data we receive from others or cross-reference with others. The collection and use of Personal Data, whether separately or combined, is done in accordance with and for the purposes described in this Policy.

If you voluntarily share "Sensitive Personal Data" (e.g., Personal Data related to your health, racial or ethnic origins, political opinions, religious or similar beliefs, membership of a trade union or professional association, physical or mental health or condition, genetic data, sexual life or judicial data) with us, that information may be used to provide a better experience and meet your particular needs. For example, if you voluntarily convey a health-related need to us, we may store and use that information in order for a Licensed Hotel to provide a room with appropriate amenities. We do not collect or store Sensitive Personal Data unless it is voluntarily provided by you. By providing such Sensitive Personal Data, you expressly consent to our collection, processing and storage of that information in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.

## BWGB - CONTROLLER OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA

BWGB is registered with the Information Commissioners office. For the purposes of the Data Protection Act 1998, we are a data controller. NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION

BWGB may also collect “Non-Personal Information,” meaning aggregated and/or anonymized information, demographic information, and any other information that does not reveal your specific identity. Because Non-Personal Information does not personally identify you, we may use and share such information with BWGB Group Companies, Licensed Hotels, Affiliates, and other third parties for any purpose, including without limitation to facilitate and improve your ongoing access to and use of our Site, to best tailor our services to suit personal interests, to analyze visiting patterns, enhance and improve customer service, and for our other business purposes. As you navigate the Site, we and our service providers may collect certain Non-Personal Information such as your computer type (Windows or Macintosh), screen resolution, OS version, Internet browser, and Internet browser version using automatic data collection technologies, such as "cookies" and so-called "pixel tags," "web beacons," "clear GIFs," and other similar technologies. For our cookies policy, please [click here](https://web.archive.org/policies/cookie-policy).

## IP ADDRESSES

Your IP address is a number that your Internet Service Provider automatically assigns to the computer that you are using to access the Site. This number is identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever users visit the Site, along with the time of each visit and the page(s) that were visited. Collecting IP addresses is standard practice on the Internet and is done automatically by many websites. We use IP addresses for purposes such as calculating Site usage levels, helping diagnose server problems, validation of a legitimate user session via Google® captcha and administering the Site. Please note that we treat IP addresses, server log files, and related information as Non-Personal Information, except when we are required to do otherwise under applicable law.

## THIRD-PARTY SITES

The Site may contain links to third-party websites. These linked sites (which may include the websites of Licensed Hotels, Affiliates, and various BWR partners or other third parties) are not under BWGB's control, and we are not responsible for the privacy practices or the contents of any such linked site (or any link contained in any linked site). We provide such links only as a convenience, and the inclusion of a link on the Site does not imply endorsement of the linked site by BWGB or the BW Group Companies. If you decide to access any of the third-party websites linked to this Site, you do so entirely at your own risk and subject to the terms and conditions of use and privacy policies for such websites. If you provide any Personal Data through any such third-party website, your transaction will occur on such third party website (not this Site) and your Personal Data will be treated in accordance with the privacy policy of that third party. **PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS POLICY DOES NOT ADDRESS THE PRIVACY OR INFORMATION PRACTICES OF ANY THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING LICENSED HOTELS AND AFFILIATES**.

## SECURITY

Because the security of your Personal Data is important to us, we have implemented security measures that provide reasonable precautions against the unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction of Personal Data. The Personal Data we collect from you online is stored by us and/or our service providers and protected through a combination of physical and electronic access controls, firewall technology, and other reasonable security measures. Nevertheless, such security measures cannot prevent all loss, access, misuse, or alteration of Personal Data, and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, we are not responsible for any damages or liabilities relating to any such incidents. Where required by law, we will notify you of any such loss, access, misuse, or alteration of Personal Data that may affect you, so that you can take the appropriate actions to protect your rights.

Please do not send us your payment information or Sensitive Personal Data through e-mail or any undesignated area (e.g., submission of your credit card number in a "comment" field). If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (e.g., if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), you must immediately notify us of the alleged problem by contacting our Customer Care Department as set forth below in this Policy. Please note that, if you choose to notify us via physical mail, this will delay the time it takes for us to respond to the alleged problem.

## YOUR CHOICES

You may always choose what Personal Data (if any) you wish to provide to us. However, if you choose not to provide certain details, some of your experiences with us may be affected (for example, we cannot take a reservation without a name, and if we cannot disclose your Personal Data to Licensed Hotels or Affiliates, we may be unable to provide you with all or certain reservation services, other services, or membership-program-related benefits. Similarly, if we cannot disclose your Personal Data to other third parties, such as BWR partners (e.g., airlines, card issuers and other third parties), we may not be able to provide all of the available membership program services to you (e.g., earning of frequent customer points with such companies), or the provision of such services may be delayed).

If you do not wish for us to use your contact information to promote our own or third parties' products or services you can [Opt-out here](https://web.archive.org/my-best-western/my-profile), or you can contact our Customer Care Department as set forth in the “Contacting Us” section of this Policy below. If you have received a promotional e-mail from us and no longer wish to receive such e-mails going forward, you may opt-out by using the unsubscribe function in the e-mail you have received from us. Please note that when you unsubscribe from receiving promotional e-mails from us, your contact details will be “suppressed” rather than deleted. This will ensure that your request is recorded and retained unless you provide a later consent that overrides it.

If you have a BWR account, we ask you to indicate your communication preferences at the time you become a member of the BWR program. Once you have indicated your preferences, you can change them by logging into your account.

Please note that if you opt-out as described above, we will not be able to remove your Personal Data from the databases of Licensed Hotels, Affiliates, or other third parties with which we have already shared your Personal Data.

We are entitled to assume you do not object to our doing any of the things mentioned in this statement unless you tell us otherwise in writing or in any other approved manner. However please allow up to one month for us to process all data regarding your privacy choices. Opting out does not apply to service messages such as booking confirmation emails and statements.

If you do not opt-out, in all future contact with you in marketing mailings, phone and SMS marketing or via e-mail marketing we will give you the opportunity to decline to receive further mailings. Except where expressly permitted by the Data Protection Act, we will only deal with the personal details you give us as set out above unless you agree otherwise. We have appropriate security measures in place to protect this information.

## SUBJECT ACCESS RIGHTS

BWGB may allow you to review certain Personal Data through the Site or through other online means. Information about the availability of online means for reviewing your Personal Data is generally available at the Site or on the printed materials where such type of Personal Data was first submitted.

You are generally entitled to ask us (by letter or e-mail) what details of yours are being held or processed, for what purpose and to whom they may be or have been disclosed. We may charge a fee to respond to such a request. We promise to respond to your request within 40 days of receiving your written request and fee. In certain limited circumstances we are entitled to refuse your request. If you believe that any of your personal details which we are processing are inaccurate or incorrect please contact us immediately.

When making a subject access request, please be sure to include your full name, address and telephone number and a copy of a document evidencing your identity (such as an ID card or passport) so we can ascertain your identity and whether we have any Personal Data regarding you, or in case we need to contact you to obtain any additional information, we may require to make that determination. We are not responsible for updating, removing or suppressing information from the databases of Licensed Hotels, Affiliates, and other third parties with whom we have already shared your Personal Data, or for limiting their use of your Personal Data.

## RETENTION PERIOD

BWGB only collects Personal Data that it believes is necessary to perform the services that you seek from BWGB and to exercise its rights and comply with its obligations as otherwise outlined in this Policy. We will keep your Personal Data only as long as we need it for the purposes for which we collect it or as otherwise permitted by law.
