As part of that commitment we have produced the following Privacy Policy statement to help you better understand the privacy issues that arise as a result of the use of our website products and services.

This policy statement will address the following:

  * The types of information we collect

## The types of information we collect

In general, when you visit our website you do not have to tell us who you are, or reveal any personally identifiable information to us. Unless you specifically agree to tell us, we will never know who you are, and you are able to interact with our website in a relatively anonymous way.

Personally identifiable information is defined as any specific data that could disclose you as an individual, such as your name, address, telephone number, billing and shipping information, credit card information or e-mail address.

When you visit our website our servers automatically record basic information about your usage, such as the type of internet browser and operating system you are using, the date, time and duration of your visit and the pages you viewed. This information is anonymous and does not identify you as an individual, nor will we combine it with information that does identify you as an individual. This information is collected and analysed to provide us with a greater understanding of how you use our website.

Where necessary we collect personally identifiable information on certain areas of our website, for example, if you register on a forum, enter a competition or subscribe to an e-mail newsletter. The personally identifiable information collected may consist of a username or unique user ID and contact information, such as your name, email address, mailing address, telephone and fax numbers. You may have the opportunity to make purchases on our website, in which case we would need to collect your order information, credit card details and delivery instructions in order to facilitate payment and shipment.

From time to time we may invite you to answer survey questions and provide certain demographic information, such as your age, sex, income bracket, country of access, and location of connection (e.g. home or work). Your response to these types of surveys is entirely voluntary and you should feel no obligation to participate.

At times we may use a feature of your browser (called a "cookie") to automatically assign you a unique user ID or a session ID. A cookie, by itself, cannot be used to find out your identity, it merely identifies your computer to our servers when you visit our website. We will not combine your user ID or session ID with information that does identify you as an individual. You may, at anytime, set your browser to allow, notify you or refuse altogether the use of cookies.

## How we use or disclose the information we collect

In general, the information we collect is used for our own analysis aimed at improving our products and services. We use personally identifiable information to fulfil your requests or orders for specific services or products. We may also use personally identifiable information to perform other functions including, demographic analysis of site usage (who is visiting our website and what they are interested in), customising advertising and content seen by our users, and improving our marketing and promotional efforts.

We will not intentionally disclose any personally identifiable information and we do not sell, trade or rent such information to third parties (such as advertisers or telemarketers).

Any personally identifiable information you provide will only be provided to third parties if:

  * You consent to such a disclosure
  * We are compelled or authorised to do so by law
  * We reasonably believe there is a threat to someone's life or health
  * Our website or business is sold to, or merged with another entity



## Use of Aggregate Data

We may collect and use certain non-personal information (e.g., the identity of your Internet browser, the type of operating system you use, your IP address and the domain name of your Internet service provider) to optimise our goods and services (which may include the display of personalised content and advertising) including our Web pages for your computer.

Best Recipes may use personally identifiable information in aggregate form to improve our goods and services including our Web sites and make them more responsive to the needs of our customers. This statistical compilation and analysis of information may also be used by News or provided to others as a summary report for marketing, advertising or research purposes.

## The quality and security of the information we hold

Any information you provide to us is stored and held under generally accepted standards of technology and operational security in order to protect your personally identifiable information from loss, misuse, alteration, or destruction. Only authorised personnel are provided access to personally identifiable information and these personnel are required to treat this information as confidential. Despite these precautions, we cannot guarantee absolutely that any and all unauthorised access to your personally identifiable information will be prevented.

## Your access to the information we hold

If you would like to access, correct, update or de-activate any information you have submitted, please send a request to [privacy@bestrecipes.com.au](mailto:privacy@bestrecipes.com.au). We will modify or de-activate any information that could be used to identify you as soon as practicable after your request, unless we are required or authorised by law not to do so. Once de-activated your data will not be accessible, however, due to system backups to various types of data storage media, your data may in some circumstances remain on these types of data storage media.

## Transborder (interstate and international) data movement

At times, personally identifiable information collected from our website may be transferred between our offices or data storage facilities located in Australia or internationally. Our website may be viewed and hosted anywhere in the world, including countries that may not have specific laws regulating the collection, use and transfer of personally identifiable data. By using our website and submitting such information on it, you voluntarily consent to such transborder transfers and hosting of such information.

## Your participation on our website

By using our website, you consent to the collection, use, and storage of your information by us in the manner described in this Privacy Policy and elsewhere on our website. We reserve the right to make changes to our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will alert you to any such changes by updating the privacy section of our website, and encourage you to check this page from time to time.

## Links to other websites

Our website provides links to other third party websites outside our network and immediate control. We do not accept any responsibility for their activities, and we advise you to examine the terms and conditions of using their websites before disclosing any information to them.

## Our policy on children's privacy protection

We understand the importance of protecting the privacy of children, especially in an online environment. Our website is not intentionally designed for or directed at children, and we do not intentionally collect or maintain information about children.
