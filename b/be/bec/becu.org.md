####  I. INTRODUCTION

Boeing Employees' Credit Union (“BECU” or “we”) is a not-for-profit credit union. We are committed to respecting and protecting the privacy of our online visitors and members. We recognize that individuals need to understand how their privacy is protected, so we have established the following privacy notice (“Privacy Notice”) for our users.

This Privacy Notice explains what personal information BECU will collect about you from our BECU websites and BECU mobile applications, both as defined below (collectively, the “online services”) as well as from third-party and offline sources. This Privacy Notice also explains how we use, protect, and disclose information to provide you with the online services and other financial services (collectively, the “financial services”).

This Privacy Notice should be read in conjunction with the Terms of Service that apply to each BECU website, including but not limited to the [BECU Website Terms and Conditions](https://web.archive.org/~/media/Files/PDF/BECUTermsandConditions.pdf?la=en) and the BECU MIX Terms of Use. When you use our financial services or otherwise provide us with your personal information, you consent to our collection, use, and sharing of the data as described in this Privacy Notice.

**Do you have a financial account with BECU?** (In other words, you are a member.) We use and share your personal information in accordance with the BECU [U.S. Consumer Privacy Notice](https://web.archive.org/~/media/Files/PDF/6524.pdf?la=en).

**What does personal information mean?** “Personal information” means personally identifiable information, such as your name, email address, telephone number, and account numbers. It does not include aggregated data that does not reveal your identity or anything about you individually. Rather, aggregated data consists of information about a group that includes you. Remember, aggregated data is not considered personal information.

**What do BECU websites refer to?** These are BECU's websites that link to this Privacy Notice, including but not limited to becu.org, becuhomeloans.org, ideaexchange.becu.org, and becubillpayment.org.

**What do BECU mobile applications (apps) include?** These are BECU's mobile apps that are available for your mobile device (e.g., phone or tablet), including BECU's mobile app that allows members to manage their account. You can download our app for iOS, Android, and Windows devices.

####  II. INFORMATION COLLECTED BY BECU

Why does BECU collect personal information? We collect personal information because this information makes it possible for us to provide you with the full benefits of our financial services. BECU collects certain information from you, your devices, the applications you use to access our financial services, and from third-party sources so that we can provide these services to you.

1\. INFORMATION THAT YOU PROVIDE TO BECU   
You may provide personal information directly to BECU both online and offline for different reasons. This information includes, but is not limited to, your name, address, email address, and phone number. You may also provide personal information to BECU online when you complete an online form on a BECU website, pay a bill online, or subscribe to eNewsletters or other electronic communications from BECU.

Other ways you may provide personal information are when you provide feedback to us through the BECU websites, respond to surveys and questionnaires that we send you, provide information to BECU member service representatives online, or provide personal information to us through other online means.

What's more, you may provide personal information offline to BECU when you complete membership or credit applications (e.g., to open a BECU account or apply for a loan), provide information to BECU member service representatives offline, deposit money, use your debit card, or provide personal information to us through other offline means.

When you sign up for or maintain a financial account with BECU, you may provide the types of personal information described in the [U.S. Consumer Privacy Notice](https://web.archive.org/~/media/Files/PDF/6524.pdf?la=en), including but not limited to your Social Security number and employment information.

In addition to the information you provide, when you use our online services, we may also automatically collect the following types of information from your devices and applications that you use. 

  * **BECU Websites** : If you use the BECU websites, we may collect certain information from your device or web browser, including but not limited to your browser type, your geographic location, the date and time of your visit, and the BECU website pages that you visit (“website data”). We may collect this information through the use of cookies, Adobe Flash objects, floodlight tags, pixel tags, web beacons, and log files.  Website data alone (i.e., when it is not associated with other personal information) is not deemed to be personal information.

  * **BECU Mobile Applications:** If you choose to use a BECU mobile app, we may collect certain information from the app and your mobile device (“mobile app data”), including but not limited to geographic location information, unique device identifier information, and website data (as defined above). If the BECU mobile app collects any sensitive information from your mobile device that is not identified here, then we will notify you before doing so.




3\. INFORMATION COLLECTED FROM THIRD PARTY SOURCES

In addition to personal information that you provide to BECU, we may also collect information about you, including personal information, from third-party sources, including but not limited to credit reports from consumer reporting agencies and information from propensity information sellers (“third-party data”). This includes, but is not limited to instances in which you affirmatively authorize third parties to provide us with information. Third-party data includes both personal information and information that is not personally identifiable to you.

When you sign up for an account with BECU, we may also collect information about you, including personal information, from third-party sources as described in the [U.S. Consumer Privacy Notice](https://web.archive.org/~/media/Files/PDF/6524.pdf?la=en) , including, but not limited to your credit history, payment history, and account balances.

4\. INFORMATION THAT YOU POST TO BECU MIX  
You may provide certain information to us if you use BECU MIX , BECU's online forum. For example, you may provide personal information when you create a BECU MIX account and when you post feedback in a forum, make suggestions, share ideas, and ask questions to BECU MIX (“forum postings”).

5\. INFORMATION COLLECTED FROM ONLINE TOOLS  
We may feature certain tools through our online services, such as online calculators (“online tools”). These online tools do not require you to log in or enter your contact information to use the online tool. The information you provide when using these online tools is not associated with you or your account and, for purposes of this Privacy Notice, is not considered to be personal information.

In addition to the uses described above, BECU may use website data to improve our financial services, as well as help us understand how members are using our financial services. This information is also collected for statistical analysis, to determine what information is of most and least interest to our members, to improve the usefulness of the financial services, and finally, for other purposes described in this Privacy Notice. BECU may share website data with our business partners and other third parties (including for the reasons listed above).

**Are you a California resident?** Under California law, you may have the right to request and receive certain information about our disclosure of your personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes, and your choices with respect to such disclosures.

Certain web browsers may provide a do-not-track (“DNT”) option. You may be able to ask your browser to inform websites that you do not wish your activities to be tracked, either with cookies or other persistent identifiers, commonly called “DNT signals.” Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret web browser-based DNT signals other than cookies, our websites do not currently respond to DNT signals.

2\. THIRD-PARTY ANALYTICS PROVIDERS  
We work with third-party analytics providers, including but not limited to Google Analytics and Google Adwords, to help us better understand how you use BECU websites.

For example, we use Google Analytics to learn more about the types of users that visit the BECU websites and to help improve the BECU websites. Google Analytics provides us with certain data regarding the demographics of the users that visit the BECU websites.
