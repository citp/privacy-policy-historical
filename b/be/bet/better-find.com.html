  information about your visit to these Web pages (including the

  about website usage. &nbsp;Web beacons collect only a limited set
  of information including a cookie number, time and date of page
  view and a description of the page on which the Web beacon
  resides. This information may be shared with one or more third
  parties so that they can understand the types of visitors to our
  website; how those visitors use our website; and the
  effectiveness of advertisements. We may also use web beacons in
  email messages sent to individuals listed in our

  <p class="c3"><span class="c0 c4">Disabling Web
  Beacons:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span> <span class="c2">Because web beacons are the same as any other content
  request, you cannot opt out or refuse them. &nbsp;However, they

  changing the cookie setup in your browser.</span></p>

  Addresses:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp; Your Internet Protocol
  ("IP") is a unique Internet "address" which is assigned to you by
  your Internet Service Provider ("ISP"). For local area network
  ("LAN"), DSL, or cable modem users, an IP address may be
  permanently assigned to a particular computer. IP addresses are
  automatically logged by web servers and collect information about
  a user's traffic patterns. &nbsp;While the IP address does not
  identify an individual by name, it may, with the cooperation of
  the ISP, be used to locate and identify an individual using the
  web. Your IP address can reveal what geographic area you are
  connecting from and which ISP you are using. We automatically
  track certain information based upon your actions on our website.
  &nbsp;We may use this information to do internal research on our
  users' demographics, interests, and behavior to better
  understand, protect and serve you and our community. This

  type of browsers used, operating system software, screen
  resolutions, color capabilities, browser plug-ins, language
