We may also process your first name, last name, address, phone and mobile phone number if you choose to add them to your profile. Finally, in certain circumstances, you may be asked to send to us a copy of your government issued ID (e.g. passport) so that we can verify your identity.

Your PII is processed so that we are able to distinguish you from other registered users on bettingexpert. Your email address is used so that we can communicate with you regarding any changes to your account or our services, as well as to send you newsletters and push notifications upon your consent.

It is your choice whether you decide to reveal your real forename, surname, address, phone and mobile phone number. This information may contribute to the personalisation of your user account and development of your communication channels with us.

Electronic identification data - When you log in to bettingexpert we process the IP address of the device you use, the type and version of browser and operating system you use, as well as the time of logging in.

We process the IP address of the device you use in order to enable communication between your device and our server and to determine your approximate geolocation, which may be further used for service customisation (for example, to provide appropriate content for your language of choice and gambling-related content that is legal in your country). Your approximate location may also be used for analytical purposes. More information about how we process your data for analytical purposes can be found in our Cookie Policy. The processing of details about the browser and operating system you use is necessary to ensure the regular provision of our services to you. We may also need this data to solve technical problems should they emerge.
