**Choice/Opt-Out**

You may, of course, decline to share your personally-identifiable information with BetterLesson, in which case BetterLesson will not be able to provide to you some of the features and functionality found on the BetterLesson Platform. We provide you the opportunity to ‘opt-out’ of having your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes, and you may update, correct, or delete your user information and preferences at any time by following the directions [here](https://betterlesson.com/community/users/edit). BetterLesson will also delete the personally identifiable information that you have provided to us: (a) upon your request, or (b) upon termination of your BetterLesson account; provided, however, BetterLesson will retain a copy in its files of all personally identifiable information, if required for legal reasons.

You will be notified prior to when your personally identifiable information is collected by any third party that is not our agent/service provider, so you can make an informed choice as to whether to share your information with that party.

Please note that if you opt out of receiving our promotional or marketing emails, you may still receive certain service-related communications from us, such as administrative and services announcements and messages about your account.

If you are an EU or Swiss person about whom we hold personally identifiable information on a customer’s behalf, you may request access to, and the opportunity to update, correct or delete, such personally identifiable information. To submit such requests or raise any other questions, please contact the business that provided your personally identifiable information. You can also contact us and we will then contact that business. We reserve the right to take appropriate steps to authenticate an applicant’s identity, to charge an adequate fee before providing access and to deny requests, except as required by the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks.

To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting your account access or making corrections to your information. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information at all times.

**Our Commitment to Data Security:**

BetterLesson uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. BetterLesson may use encryption, secure socket layer, firewall, password protection and other physical security measures to help prevent unauthorized access to your personally identifiable information including sensitive data. BetterLesson may also place internal restrictions on who in the company may access data to help prevent unauthorized access to your personally identifiable information. These precautions take into account the risks involved in the processing, the nature of personally identifiable information, and best practices in the industry for security and data protection. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to BetterLesson, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, BetterLesson makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.

If BetterLesson learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. BetterLesson may post a notice on the BetterLesson Platform if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive a free written notice of a security breach you should notify us at [privacy@betterlesson.com](mailto:privacy@betterlesson.com?subject=Privacy). ** **

**Accountability for Onward Transfer**

BetterLesson is accountable for personally identifiable information that we receive and subsequently transfer to third parties. If third parties that process personally identifiable information on our behalf do so in a manner that does not comply with the Privacy Shield Principles, we are accountable, unless we prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

Contact information and customer personally identifiable information is accessible only by those BetterLesson employees and consultants who have a reasonable need to access such information for us to fulfill contractual, legal and professional obligations. All of our employees and consultants have entered into confidentiality agreements, and/or have been subjected to thorough criminal background checks requiring that they maintain the confidentiality of customer personally identifiable information.

In the event BetterLesson discloses personally identifiable information covered by this Privacy Policy to a non-agent third party, it will do so consistent with any notice provided to data subjects and any choice they have exercised regarding such disclosure. BetterLesson will only disclose personally identifiable information to third-party agents that have given us contractual assurances that they will provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by this Privacy Policy and the Principles and that they will process personally identifiable information for limited and specific purposes consistent with any consent provided by the individual. If BetterLesson has knowledge that a third party to which it has disclosed personally identifiable information covered by this Privacy Policy is processing such personally identifiable information in a way that is contrary to this Privacy Policy and/or the Principles, BetterLesson will take reasonable steps to prevent or stop such processing. In such case, the third-party is liable for damages unless it is proven that BetterLesson is responsible for the event giving rise to the violation.

BetterLesson may use from time to time a limited number of third-party service providers, contractors, and other businesses to assist us in providing our solutions to our customers or in meeting internal business operation needs. These third-parties may access process or store personally identifiable information while performing their duties to BetterLesson. BetterLesson maintains contracts with these providers restricting their access, use and disclosure of personally identifiable information in compliance with our obligations under the Principles.

**Our Commitment to Children’s Privacy:**
