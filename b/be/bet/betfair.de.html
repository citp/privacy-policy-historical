				<h3>Introduction</h3>
					<p>Betfair wants visitors to its website to know that we are just as concerned as you are about the privacy of any personal information that you may choose to provide us ("Personal Information"). In this respect we have invested heavily in providing a world class Information Security Management System, which has been accredited with ISO 27001 certification.</p>
					<p>Personal Information is any information about you and may include your name and address, date of birth, payment card details, details of betting transactions and account transfers and any other information you may wish to provide. Betfair is endeavouring to ensure that our business practices that involve the use of your Personal Information are compliant with privacy regulations in the countries where we operate. Accordingly, in this policy document (the "Privacy Policy"), Betfair wants not only to advise you of your privacy rights but also explain how we intend to respect them.</p>
					<p>Any reference to "Betfair" or the "Group" within this Privacy Policy includes Betfair Group Plc and all or any of its direct or indirect subsidiary undertakings, joint venture partners, and their related companies wherever located in the world as may exist from time to time.</p>

						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>Private Area</h4>

				<h3>How your Personal Information will be used?</h3>
					<p>Betfair will process your Personal Information in order to allow you access and make use of our website, to allow you to participate in the services offered, to administer your account, to maintain our accounts and records, to monitor website usage levels and the quality of the service we provide and to inform you, from time to time, about products and services that we consider may interest you and for related purposes.
