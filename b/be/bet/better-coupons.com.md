This privacy policy (“Policy”) discloses the data collection and use practices of Better-coupons (“Better-coupons”) in connection with the Better-coupons Web site (the “Web Site”) and all associated Better-coupons products and services (the “Better-coupons Services”). Better-coupons will not directly inform you of any changes to the privacy policy which involve use of your personal information. If at any time you are dissatisfied with our service to you or are in disagreement with our terms and conditions or privacy policy, you reserve the option to Opt-out of our website and future communication. Better-coupons may make non-significant changes to our privacy policy and may not notify our members if said changes do not pertain to the handling of personal information.

What Information We Collect/How We Use It

We store and use the information you give us in accordance with the terms of this Policy. Our registration form (or registration information you provide our marketing partners if you joined Better-coupons though one of our partners) requests that you provide certain contact and profile information. That information includes but may not be limited to: name, address, email address, phone number, gender and birth date. Additional information may include, but not be limited to, car and lifestyle information about you and your family such as marital status and household information (spouse, children, pets, etc.), ethnicity, education, income, occupation, purchasing habits, reading habits, insurance, and participation in research surveys. In addition, we might receive information about you from outside sources and add it to your Better-coupons membership information. We do this to improve personalization of our services (for example, providing better newsletter content, advertising or special offers that we think will interest you). We also may collect information such as the identification of the server your computer is logged onto and whether you opened a Better-coupons e-mail delivered to you. We also may compare our customer list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending identical messages to our members. You can add and modify the information you have provided by sending an e-mail to information@Better-Coupons.com with your requested changes.

We use all this information in five ways:  
• to provide you with personalized information via electronic delivery, telemarketing and/or direct mail. These may include personalized offers from 3rd party sources.  
• to send you targeted advertising via electronic delivery and/or direct mail;  
• to contact you for feedback and surveys via electronic delivery and/or direct mail;  
• to send you general and administrative information about your Better-coupons membership via electronic delivery and/or direct mail; and  
• to provide your contact information to Better-coupons marketing partners whose offer(s) you have selected to receive in order for them to send you special offers via electronic delivery, telemarketing and direct mail.
