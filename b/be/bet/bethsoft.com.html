          how will it be used?</b><br>
          In order to give you the best experience on our site, ZeniMax may collect
          information about you, but only if you voluntarily provide it to us.
          Typically, we may ask a user to submit personal and/or demographic information,
          and it will usually take the form of either: <a href="#a">(1) product
          and warranty registration</a>; <a href="#b">(2) community forum registration</a>;
          <a href="#c">(3) contests and sweepstakes</a>, <a href="#d">(4) technical
          support</a>; (5) the purchase of a product or service at our <a href="#e">online
          store</a>; and (6) personal information submitted in a <a href="#f">business
          capacity</a> (e.g., resumes). The types of information that may be requested
          for each activity and the way the information may be used are detailed
          below. In the event that demographic information is requested on the
          same page as personal information, the demographic and personal information
          may be combined.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><u><a name="a"></a>Product and Warranty Registration</u>
            <p><br>
              To register on our site, we may ask you to provide personal information
              such as your name, email address, home address, and telephone number.
              We may also collect demographic information including your age,
              information about the product you purchased, the type of console
              you own, and the types of games you enjoy playing. The information
              that you submit during registration will entitle you to limited
              warranty protection and technical support. We may also use your
              registration information to notify you about updates to our products
              and services.</p>
          </li>
          <li><u><a name="b"></a>Forum Registration</u>
            <p>To register for membership in any of our online community forums,
              we may ask you to provide personal information such as your email
              address, and to create a username and password. We may also collect
              demographic information about you, including your occupation, hobbies
              and interest, and other preferences. The information that you submit
              to us for this purpose is used to give you access to our community
              forums and other community features and to allow the moderators
              and administrators of the message board to contact you.</p>
            <p>The ability to participate in the community forums by simply logging
              in is available to only those Web users that have already created
              a password during an earlier visit to the community registration
              area of our site. To login as a member, we may ask you to submit
              your username and password. This information is collected so that
              you can access and participate in the community forums without having
              to reregister.</p>
            <p>Please note that the information (e.g., email address, username,
              occupation, and interests) contained in your profile (i.e., that
              you provide when registering) may be viewable to other users of
              ZeniMax's message board. We cannot and do not guarantee that this
              information will be kept confidential or private. If you do not
              want the public to see this information, please leave the information
              blank at the time of registration or choose to make your email address
              inaccessible to other users of the forum.</p>
          </li>
          <li><u><a name="c"></a>Contests, Sweepstakes, and Promotions</u>
            <p>From time to time, we may run contests, sweepstakes or other events
              or activities ("events") on our websites. Information
              collected for these events may include personal information such
              as your email address and may be collected by or shared with a third
              party sponsor, co-sponsor, or other reputable third party (e.g.,
              marketing or promotional partner, software licensee, or game developer).
              While we have no control over the third party's use of such information,
              we will attempt to ensure that they agree to protect the confidentiality,
              security, and integrity of any personal information we share with
              them (or that they collect through our websites). If you do not
              want your information to be collected by or shared with a third
              party, you can choose not to participate in these events at the
              time the information is collected.</p>
          </li>
          <li><u><a name="d"></a>Technical Support</u>
            <p>To submit a question or problem to our technical support team regarding
              any problems you are encountering with a particular product, you
              may be asked to provide personal information such as your name,
              phone and/or fax number, home address, email address and demographic
              information such as the kind of operating system you own and a description
              of your problem. The information you provide us for this purpose
              is used to respond to your troubleshooting problem in a timely and
              accurate fashion.</p>
          </li>
          <li><u><a name="e"></a>Online Store</u>
            <p>Visitors purchasing goods and services through our online store
              will need to provide a valid credit card number and expiration date,
              in addition to name, mailing and billing addresses, phone number,
              and e-mail address. This information will be used to fulfill your
              purchase requests and may be used to assist you with questions you
              may have about an order.</p>
          </li>
          <li><u><a name="f"></a>Business Capacity</u>
            <p>ZeniMax provides on its website an email address that receives
              resumes for candidates interested in employment. Personal information
              collected from resumes will be used for the purpose of accepting
              and evaluating candidate submissions for job postings and may therefore
              be shared within our company.</p>
            <p>Portions of our site may also contain an area where businesses
              can submit a request for information about ZeniMax products and
              services (e.g., Vir2L Studios website design and development). Any
              personal information collected from such requests is used to respond
              to the specific request and may be added to our business newsletter
              mailing list.</p>
            <p>Other than as explained above, this Privacy Policy does not apply
              to personal information gathered through resumes or business requests
              for information.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Unless noted otherwise, we may also use your personal and/or demographic
          information for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we
          can constantly improve the products and services we provide you and
          to better meet your needs.</p>
        <p>No matter what method we use to collect information and no matter how
          we use that information, we will only collect the information deemed
          reasonably necessary to fulfill your online requests and our legitimate
          business objectives.</p>

        <p><b><a name="4"></a>What happens if I refuse to provide my personal
          information to ZeniMax?</b></p>
        <p>If you choose not to submit personal information when requested, you
          may not be able to participate in certain activities on our site and
          may considerably limit the services we can provide you. For example,
          if you refuse to provide your email address when registering, you will
          not be able to use our message boards. To simply use our site, however,
          you do not need to give us any personal information.</p>

        <p><b><a name="5"></a>Does ZeniMax use cookies, track IP addresses or
          use other passive means to collect information?</b></p>
        <p><u>Cookies</u></p>
        <p>ZeniMax may use cookies to improve the use of our websites. A "cookie"
          is a small file or record-keeping device that websites often store on
          a user's computer. Storage of cookies on your system provides an easy
          and convenient method for us to personalize your experience on our websites.
          For example, cookies allow us to remember your screen name, tell us
          that you have visited our website before, and may contain information
          that will make your next visit to our website more enjoyable. However,
          we do not use cookies to store personal information such as your name.
          In addition, ZeniMax will not use cookies to retrieve information from
          your computer that was not originally sent in a cookie. You can always
          disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being
          sent to your computer.</p>
        <p><u>IP Addresses</u></p>
        <p>ZeniMax may also collect your IP address for safety and security purposes.
          An IP address is a number that is used by computers on the network to
          identify your computer every time you log on to the Internet.</p>
        <p><u>Log Files</u></p>
        <p>Other non-personal information collected by ZeniMax is in the form
          of logs - files that record website activity, including how many "hits"
          a particular web page is getting (a.k.a., "click-through data").
          For example, log file entries are generated every time a visitor clicks
          the "Online Shop" icon on our site. These entries enable ZeniMax
          to assess overall site activity, track interest in advertised sales,
          track interest in purchase behavior, and troubleshoot technical concerns.</p>
        <p>Through the use of log files, we may also collect certain demographic
          information such as the type of browser you are using (e.g., Netscape,
          Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you are using (e.g.,
          Windows 98 or Mac OS), and the domain name of your Internet service
          provider (e.g., America Online, Earthlink).</p>

          with entities who use it solely to provide support for the internal
          operations of our website(s) (e.g., fulfillment of contests or online
          purchases, message board operation, and technical support processing).</p>
        <p>ZeniMax may also share your personal information with our subsidiary
          or affiliate companies for purposes of internal marketing and demographic
          studies, which help us improve and tailor the products and services
          we provide you.</p>
        <p>Other than as explained in this policy, we may disclose personal information
          in the good faith belief that we are required to do so by law, or that
          doing so is reasonably necessary to comply with legal processes; respond
          to any claims; or, to protect the rights, property, or personal safety
          of ZeniMax, our customers, or the public.</p>
        <p>In addition, information about our customers, including personal information,
          may be disclosed as part of any merger, sale, transfer of company assets,
          acquisition, bankruptcy, or similar event.</p>

          postcards) may allow children under 13 to submit personal information
          such as their email address without first telling us their age or getting
          their parent's permission. Such portions of our site(s) operate activities
          or provide services in a way that does not require prior parental consent
          under the law.</p>
        <p>We recognize the importance of safeguarding the privacy of children
          and encourage parents to check and monitor their children's use of online
          activities regularly.</p>

        <p><b><a name="12"></a>What safeguards does ZeniMax use to protect my
          personal information?</b></p>
        <p>ZeniMax maintains appropriate safeguards that ensure the security,
          integrity and privacy of the personal information we collect. Personal
          information collected by ZeniMax is stored in secure operating environments
          that are not available to the public and is only accessible by authorized
          employees. In addition, our online store uses industry-standard encryption
          to prevent unauthorized electronic access to sensitive financial information
          such as your credit card number.</p>
        <p>We also have security measures in place to protect against the loss,
          misuse and alteration of the information under our control (i.e., maintain
          data quality). Before we allow web users to access their personal information,
          for example, we verify their identity by prompting them to submit information
          such as their login name and password.</p>
