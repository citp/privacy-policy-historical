        ZENIMAX MEDIA ONLINE PRIVACY POLICY</b><br>
        <br>
        ZeniMax Media Inc. and its divisions, Bethesda Softworks LLC, Vir2L Studios

        This Privacy Policy Statement and the certification seal located above
        confirm that ZeniMax is a valid licensee and participating member in the

        To protect your privacy, we have voluntarily undertaken this privacy initiative

          information about you, but only if you voluntarily provide it to us. 
          Typically, we may ask a user to submit personal and/or demographic information, 
          and it will usually take the form of either: <a href="legal_privacy.htm#subanchor-1">(1)

          same page as personal information, the demographic and personal information

          To register on our site, we may ask you to provide personal information 
          such as your name, email address, home address, and telephone number. 
          We may also collect demographic information including your age, information 
          about the product you purchased, the type of console you own, and the 
          types of games you enjoy playing. The information that you submit during 
          registration will entitle you to limited warranty protection and technical 
          support. We may also use your registration information to notify you 
          about updates to our products and services.<br>

          To register for membership in any of our online community forums, we 
          may ask you to provide personal information such as your email address, 
          and to create a username and password. We may also collect demographic 
          information about you, including your occupation, hobbies and interest, 
          and other preferences. The information that you submit to us for this 
          purpose is used to give you access to our community forums and other 
          community features and to allow the moderators and administrators of 
          the message board to contact you.<br>
          <br>
          The ability to participate in the community forums by simply logging 
          in is available to only those Web users that have already created a 
          password during an earlier visit to the community registration area 
          of our site. To login as a member, we may ask you to submit your username 
          and password. This information is collected so that you can access and 
          participate in the community forums without having to reregister.<br>
          <br>
          Please note that the information (e.g., email address, username, occupation, 
          and interests) contained in your profile (i.e., that you provide when 
          registering) may be viewable to other users of ZeniMax's message board. 
          We cannot and do not guarantee that this information will be kept confidential 
          or private. If you do not want the public to see this information, please 
          leave the information blank at the time of registration or choose to 
          make your email address inaccessible to other users of the forum.<br>

          <br>
          From time to time, we may run contests, sweepstakes or other events 
          or activities ("events") on our websites. Information collected 
          for these events may include personal information such as your email 
          address and may be collected by or shared with a third party sponsor, 
          co-sponsor, or other reputable third party (e.g., marketing or promotional 
          partner, software licensee, or game developer). While we have no control 
          over the third party's use of such information, we will attempt to ensure 
          that they agree to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity 
          of any personal information we share with them (or that they collect 
          through our websites). If you do not want your information to be collected 
          by or shared with a third party, you can choose not to participate in

          be asked to provide personal information such as your name, phone and/or

          such as the kind of operating system you own and a description of your 
          problem. The information you provide us for this purpose is used to

          need to provide a valid credit card number and expiration date, in addition 
          to name, mailing and billing addresses, phone number, and e-mail address. 
          This information will be used to fulfill your purchase requests and

          ZeniMax provides on its website an email address that receives resumes 
          for candidates interested in employment. Personal information collected 
          from resumes will be used for the purpose of accepting and evaluating 
          candidate submissions for job postings and may therefore be shared within 
          our company.<br>
          <br>
          Portions of our site may also contain an area where businesses can submit 
          a request for information about ZeniMax products and services (e.g., 
          Vir2L Studios website design and development). Any personal information 
          collected from such requests is used to respond to the specific request 
          and may be added to our business newsletter mailing list.<br>
          <br>
          Other than as explained above, this Privacy Policy does not apply to 
          personal information gathered through resumes or business requests for 
          information.<br>
          <br>
        </ul>
        <br>
        Unless noted otherwise, we may also use your personal and/or demographic 
        information for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we 
        can constantly improve the products and services we provide you and to 
        better meet your needs.<br>
        <br>
        No matter what method we use to collect information and no matter how 
        we use that information, we will only collect the information deemed reasonably 
        necessary to fulfill your online requests and our legitimate business 
        objectives.<br>

        happens if I refuse to provide my personal information to ZeniMax?</b><br>
        <br>
        If you choose not to submit personal information when requested, you may 
        not be able to participate in certain activities on our site and may considerably 
        limit the services we can provide you. For example, if you refuse to provide 
        your email address when registering, you will not be able to use our message 
        boards. To simply use our site, however, you do not need to give us any

        <u>Cookies</u><br>
        <br>
        ZeniMax may use cookies to improve the use of our websites. A "cookie" 
        is a small file or record-keeping device that websites often store on 
        a user's computer. Storage of cookies on your system provides an easy 
        and convenient method for us to personalize your experience on our websites. 
        For example, cookies allow us to remember your screen name, tell us that 
        you have visited our website before, and may contain information that 
        will make your next visit to our website more enjoyable. However, we do 
        not use cookies to store personal information such as your name. In addition, 
        ZeniMax will not use cookies to retrieve information from your computer 
        that was not originally sent in a cookie. You can always disable cookies 
        or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent to your computer.<br>
        <br>
        <u>IP Addresses</u><br>
        <br>
        ZeniMax may also collect your IP address for safety and security purposes. 
        An IP address is a number that is used by computers on the network to 
        identify your computer every time you log on to the Internet.<br>
        <br>
        <u>Log Files</u><br>
        <br>
        Other non-personal information collected by ZeniMax is in the form of 
        logs - files that record website activity, including how many "hits" a 
        particular web page is getting (a.k.a., "click-through data"). For example, 
        log file entries are generated every time a visitor clicks the "Online 
        Shop" icon on our site. These entries enable ZeniMax to assess overall 
        site activity, track interest in advertised sales, track interest in purchase 
        behavior, and troubleshoot technical concerns.<br>
        <br>
        Through the use of log files, we may also collect certain demographic 
        information such as the type of browser you are using (e.g., Netscape, 
        Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you are using (e.g., 
        Windows 98 or Mac OS), and the domain name of your Internet service provider 
        (e.g., America Online, Earthlink).<br>

        From time to time, ZeniMax may employ and share your personal information 
        with entities who use it solely to provide support for the internal operations 
        of our website(s) (e.g., fulfillment of contests or online purchases,

        <br>

        studies, which help us improve and tailor the products and services we

        <br>
        Other than as explained in this policy, we may disclose personal information 
        in the good faith belief that we are required to do so by law, or that 
        doing so is reasonably necessary to comply with legal processes; respond 
        to any claims; or, to protect the rights, property, or personal safety 
        of ZeniMax, our customers, or the public.<br>
        <br>
        In addition, information about our customers, including personal information,

        ZeniMax collect personal information from children under 13?</b><br>
        <br>
        ZeniMax does not knowingly request or collect personal information such 
        as name, address, or email address from children younger than 13 years 
        of age. To determine who is under 13 years old, we ask all users who wish 
        to register online for a particular service (e.g., product, forum, or 
        technical support registration) to submit their date of birth. Those visitors 
        that indicate that they are under 13 are not allowed to register online.<br>
        <br>
        In some instances, certain portions of our site(s) (e.g., electronic postcards) 
        may allow children under 13 to submit personal information such as their 
        email address without first telling us their age or getting their parent's 
        permission. Such portions of our site(s) operate activities or provide 
        services in a way that does not require prior parental consent under the 
        law.<br>
        <br>
        We recognize the importance of safeguarding the privacy of children and 
        encourage parents to check and monitor their children's use of online 
        activities regularly.<br>

        safeguards does ZeniMax use to protect my personal information?</b><br>
        <br>
        ZeniMax maintains appropriate safeguards that ensure the security, integrity 
        and privacy of the personal information we collect. Personal information 
        collected by ZeniMax is stored in secure operating environments that are 
        not available to the public and is only accessible by authorized employees. 
        In addition, our online store uses industry- standard encryption to prevent 
        unauthorized electronic access to sensitive financial information such 
        as your credit card number.<br>
        <br>
        We also have security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse 
        and alteration of the information under our control (i.e., maintain data 
        quality). Before we allow web users to access their personal information, 
        for example, we verify their identity by prompting them to submit information 
        such as their login name and password.<br>
