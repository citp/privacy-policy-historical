# Betway Online Casino and Betting :: Privacy Policy

This site is operated by Sailboats Limited and Gnuf Limited (our “Site”). We have created this privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) to outline our firm commitment to your privacy. Our policy is based on the Data Protection Act of Malta and the principles held within such law. It will also inform you of type of Personal Data we process when you use our Site, why we process this Data and how we use this Data.

By using [www.betway.com](http://betway.com/) you acknowledge and accept both the terms and conditions of this privacy policy and the purposes and methods of processing for which your Personal Data is collected.

## How your Personal Data is stored and used

During the registration process and when you subsequently use your Betway account, specific personal data (“Personal Data”) is collected including, but not limited to, first and last name, date of birth, credit card data, home or other physical address, email address, phone number or other contact data.

Your Personal Data is held by us on servers based in Malta and elsewhere from time to time.

All of your Data is collected and stored in a secure and protected environment and is correct as it is provided.

You may change your personal details at anytime by [clicking here](https://web.archive.org/account/settings) and following the simple steps.

Disclosure of your Personal Data will only take place in accordance with applicable laws. Such disclosure will primarily be to other companies in our group, business partners, consultants or suppliers that are engaged to carry out financial or other processing on our behalf.

Due to the nature of the internet and its use to collect and transfer Personal Data, it may necessitate the transmission of your Personal Data outside of the EEA. By using this site you acknowledge and agree to our use of your Personal Data in this manner.

We do not collect your Personal Data when you use our Site without your knowledge or rent, sell or trade your Personal Data to any third party.

## Security of Processing

Your security as a customer is of the utmost importance to us. Online security measures such as passwords and account numbers are used when all transactions take place to ensure that no one can gain access to your financial or personal details.

When you open an account at Betway.com, your details are fully encrypted by the strictest 128-bit SSL encryption for total security. When Personal Data is transferred over the Internet, we and our e-commerce partner use 128-Bit Secure Socket Layer Encryption Technology to ensure the security of all Personal Data.

All commercial transactions at Betway are facilitated by Datacash Services Limited, the internet’s premier e-cash merchant. They provide our Customers with safe and secure e-cash and play an active role in fraud prevention and detection. Their aim is to ensure the integrity of client’s accounts and safeguard payments made to you. Risk sentinel, advanced fraud-management software that protects Betway customers from online fraud, has been implemented to provide you with ongoing protection.

## Fraud Prevention

To protect us and any other users of the Site against fraud including use of stolen credit cards, or any other fraudulent or criminal activity (including any chargeback or other reversal of a payment) we may check your details against, and share Personal Data with other online gaming sites, banks, credit card companies and other fraud prevention agencies. In addition, money laundering legislation requires all financial institutions to collect and record Personal Data to confirm a customer’s identity and to report any transactions arousing suspicion.
