            <p>At betED.com, we respect your privacy and are committed to protecting 
              your personal information. We have created this Privacy Policy to 
              let you know what information we collect when you visit the betED.com 
              web site and online service (collectively, the “Service”), 
              why we collect this information and how we use the collected information. 
              This Privacy Policy does not govern other Websites that we maintain. 
              By using the Service, you consent to the data practices prescribed 
              in this Privacy Policy. We may periodically make changes to this 
              Privacy Policy that we will include on this page. It is your responsibility 
              to review this Privacy Policy frequently and remain informed about 
              any changes to it, so we encourage you to visit this page often.</p>
            <p><strong>1. Information Collected.</strong> We consider information 
              that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited 
              to, first and last name, credit card information, home or other 
              physical address, email address, phone number or other contact information 
              to be “Personal Information.” You may be asked to provide 
              Personal Information when you use our web site, register for an

              through the Service or other communications and interactions with 
              betED.com We may also receive Personal Information from online vendors 
              and service providers that refer you to the betED.com website. In 
              addition, we may engage the services of third-party service providers 
              to provide technical support, process your online transactions and 
              maintain your online accounts. We will have access to any information 
              you provide to such vendors, service providers and third-party e-commerce 
              services so that we can process your transactions, maintain your 
              accounts, meet certain business requirements and provide you with 
              promotional offers and information regarding betED.com and our products 
              and services. We use this Personal Information to process your transactions 
              and support your use of the Service. This information may be disclosed

              operation of the Service and the programs, products and services 
              offered on the betED.com website. Your Personal Information may 
              also be shared with our affiliates, subsidiaries or agents for technical 
              support and to process transactions you initiate on the Service 
              and deliver the products and services you purchase. From time-to-time, 
              we may request information from you via surveys or contests. Participation 
              in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary, and, therefore, 
              you have the choice of whether or not to disclose such information. 
              Information requested may include contact information (such as name 
              and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip 
              code, age level). By accepting any contest prize or winnings from

              promotional information, we may also use your Personal Information 
              (including your email address) to provide you with information regarding 
              our products, services and promotions. Personal Information as well 
              as any other information collected on the Service may be disclosed 
              to our staff, affiliates and/or agents so that they can contact 
              you regarding our products, services, or promotional offers, respond 
              to your requests, provide certain services to you and operate the 
              Service. We will not sell, lease or share your Personal Information 
              except as set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p><strong>4. Certain Excluded Disclosures.</strong> We may disclose 
              your Personal Information if requested to do so by legal authorities 
              or required to do so by law, or if we believe in good faith that 
              such action is necessary to: (1) conform to applicable laws or to 
              comply with any legal process served on us, the betED.com website 
              or the Service; (2) protect and defend our rights or property; or 
              (3) act to protect the personal safety of users of the Service or 
              the public. If we should ever file for bankruptcy or be acquired 
              by a third party, merge with a third party, sell all or part of 
              our assets, or otherwise transfer substantially all of our relevant 
              assets to a third party, we are entitled to sell or share the Personal 
              Information and all other information you have provided through 
              the Service to such third party.</p>
            <p><strong>5. Access.</strong> If you are interested in confirming 
              the accuracy of the Personal Information we have collected about 
              you, or if you would like to update your Personal Information or 
              delete your Personal Information, you may contact us at any time

              us or mark any information to prohibit future use. You may “opt 
              out” of receiving any promotional communications either by 
              choosing to opt out where such option is made available on the betED.com 
              website or the Service or in an email you receive from us, or at

            <p><strong>6. Cookies.</strong> Cookies are small text files that 
              are stored on your computer when you visit certain web pages that 
              record your preferences. We use cookies to track use of the betED.com 
              website. We also may use cookies to improve the Service and make 
              it easier for you to use. You have the ability to accept or decline 
              cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if 
              you prefer you can usually modify your browser setting to decline

            <p><strong>7. Consent to Use of Anti-Cheating Software.</strong> Our 
              software package used to access and use the Service contains certain 
              features designed to detect use of automated programs that enable 
              artificial (non-human) intelligence to play on our site. Use of 
              such “bot” software programs violates our Terms and 
              Conditions of Use, and is detrimental to other players. By installing 
              our software and using the Service, you consent to our software 
              performing the functions described in this section. Our software 
              may perform any or all of the following functions in order to detect 
              the use of illicit automated programs and ensure that we maintain 
              a “cheat free” environment for all users: (1) scan your

              with the suspect application or process and compile a composite 
              mesh (i.e. a profile that characterizes the files associated with 
              the application or process) to be matched against profiles for known 
              illicit automated programs, and (2) capture a screenshot of your 
              desktop, and transmit these to betED.com for review. Our software 
              will not perform any random search of large portions of your hard 
              drive or other files, and will not transmit any information to us 
              or to any third party other than the information necessary to identify 
              use of illicit automated program as described above. Our software 
              will not alter any files or information on your computer, and will 
              not interfere with the operation of any of your applications. </p>
