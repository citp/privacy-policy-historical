### 3.3 To whom and where personal information may be disclosed?

Your Personal Information may, for the purposes described above, be transferred or disclosed to any company within the Group or, subject to appropriate agreement, to third parties, for the processing of that Personal Information on our behalf.

Those bodies may then use your Personal Information to investigate and act on any such breaches in accordance with their procedures.

Paddy Power Betfair plc operates businesses in multiple jurisdictions some of which are not located in the European Economic Area (“EEA”). Countries outside the EEA do not always have strong data protection laws. We will ensure that each Group company and their service providers process your information under strict contractual instruction, in a secure manner and in accordance with this Policy.

### _4\. SECURITY_

We recognise that online security is an area of vital importance for all our customers. It is imperative that you should have full confidence that your personal details are secure before you register an account. We employ security measures to protect your information from access by unauthorised persons and to prevent unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction and damage. We use state of the art technological security solutions, including encryption when transmitting sensitive information across the internet, which is certified by Thawte. This means that all personal and financial information sent to and from the Website are encrypted in accordance with good industry practice.

In order to protect both ourselves and our customers from identity theft we may verify the information you have provided with our banking institutions over secure lines. Again this is carried out in accordance with our data protection obligations.

You accept the inherent security implications of using the internet and Paddy Power Betfair plc will accept no liability for any direct, consequential, incidental, indirect, or punitive losses or damages arising out of such an occurrence.
