While We receive and store the Personal Information that You choose to share with Us, You may always opt-out of sharing Personal Information by discontinuing Your use of the Site and Services.  Additionally, You can always choose to opt-out of receiving service and/or promotional e-mail and electronic newsletter communications that We may now or hereafter send to customers from time to time.

We will use proprietary and third-party products and certain software tools to measure, collect, and analyze the foregoing Collected Information.

Unless otherwise provided for herein, We restrict access to Personal Information to those employees who need access to perform their essential job functions.  Please note that despite Our best efforts, no one can guarantee the security of Personal Information.  Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of Personal Information at any time.

We may disclose Your Personal Information to any of Our employees, officers, insurers, professional advisers, agents, suppliers or subcontractors insofar as reasonably necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy and, to the extent applicable, the Subscription Agreement.

We use a third-party service provider to manage credit card processing.

This service provider is not permitted to store, retain, or use Billing Information except for the sole purpose of credit card processing on Our behalf.

In certain situations, we may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
