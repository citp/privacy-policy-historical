			<div class="article-body">Corporate Communications <p><strong>BET.com Privacy Policy</strong>&nbsp;</p><p align="&quot;left&quot;">BET.com supports a general policy of openness about personal data collection and use. We have adopted and implemented this privacy policy as part of our commitment to protecting your personal information from misuse.</p><p>Please be aware that other Web sites that may be accused through our site (including stores listed on BET.com) may collect personally indefinable information about you. The information practices of those Web sites linked to BET.com are not covered by this privacy statement, and BET.com is not responsible for any information that you provide to those Web sites when you access these.</p><p><strong>What information does BET.com collect?</strong></p><p>BET.com's registration, online surveys, contest entry forms, and product order forms may call for users to provide their contact information (like their name and e-mail address), financial information (like their bank account or credit card numbers), and demographic information (like their zip code, age, or income level).</p><p>From time to time, we may use the standard "cookie" feature of major browser applications that allows us to store data about your visit. Cookies help us learn which areas of our site are useful and which areas need improvement. We also may use cookies to track visits to and business at stores on BET.com, to process the items in your shopping basket, and to track your progress and number of entries in some of our promotions, sweepstakes, and contests. Advertising networks that serve ads onto BET.com may also use their own cookies.</p><p>BET.com may also gather anonymous information, which may be used by us or shared with third parties. This is information which does not personally identify you, but which may be helpful for marketing purposes or for improving the services we offer. For example, we might tell our advertisers how many users visited a particular advertisement, and how long, so they can measure whether the ad worked. This information is also used to generate advertising rates. Generally this information is collected through "traffic data" and may entail the use of numeric codes used to identify a computer.</p><p><strong>What does BET.com do with collected information?</strong></p><p>BET.com's primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you, the user, with a customized experience on our site. This includes personalization services, interactive communications, online shopping, and many other types of services, most of which are completely free to you. In order to provide services free of charge, we display advertisements. By knowing a little about you, BET.com is able to deliver more relevant advertisements and content, and hence better service, to you.</p><p>In our role of delivering targeted advertisements, BET.com plays the middleman. Advertising gives us an advertisement and tells us the type of audience they want to reach (for example, males over 35 years old). BET.com takes the advertisement and displays it to users meeting those criteria. This kind of advertisement targeting is done with banner ads as well as promotional e-mail.</p><p>We use customer contact information from our online registration, survey, and contest and order forms for our own internal evaluation and tracking purposes and to send you information from our company and promotional material from some of our business partners (or from other companies). If you supply such contact information, it may also be used to contact you about products and services in which you have indicated an interest, and may be shared with our advertisers, business partners, or other companies who may want to contact you. (Users may opt out of receiving future mailings&nbsp;-- see the choice/opt-out section below.)</p><p>We may use cookies to deliver to you content specific to your interests, to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our site, and for other purposes. Advertisements displayed on our site may contain cookies. We do not have access to or control over information collected about you by advertisers on our site.</p><p>BET.com may use your IP address (the number assigned to your computer while it is on the Internet) to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our site. If you shop on BET.com, your IP address is used to help identify your computer and your online "shopping cart" (if any) and to gather broad demographic information. In addition, your IP address is transmitted with each message sent from your account.</p><p>Demographic and profile data from online forms or cookies may be used to tailor your experience at our site, showing you content that we think you might be interested in, and displaying the content according to your preferences. This information may be shared with our advertisers, business partners, or other companies only on an aggregate basis, unless you expressly agree that personally-identifiable information about you may be disclosed.</p><p>If you submit financial information it may be used to check your qualifications and to bill you for products and services. You may choose to submit unique identifiers (such as social security numbers) in order to allow us to verify your identity and for use as account numbers in our record system.</p><p>BET.com may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on BET.com or its parent company, subsidiaries or affiliate;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) protect and defend the rights or property of BET.com or the users of BET.com, and (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of BET.com or the public.</p><p>Personal information you provide to BET.com may be stored outside of the country in which you reside.</p><p><strong>Public Forums</strong></p><p>BET.com makes chat rooms, forums, message boards, personal Web pages and/or news groups available to its users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.</p><p><strong>Security</strong></p><p>BET.com has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Any time we ask for a credit card number we transmit that credit card number in an encrypted format. We use industry-standard, SSL (secure socket layer) encryption. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, BET.com cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.</p><p><strong>Children</strong></p><p>BET.com is a general audience site. We do not direct any of our content specifically at children under thirteen (13) years of age, and we do not collect any personally identifiable information from anyone under 13 years of age.</p><p><strong>Choice/Opt-Out</strong></p><p>BET.com gives you (or your parent(s) if you are under 18 years of age) the following options for removing your information from our database in order to stop receiving future communications from BET.com. (Please note: BET.com is not responsible for removing information from third-party lists or entities with which you have previously authorized us to share your information.)</p><p><strong>1.</strong>You can send e-mail to:&nbsp;<a href="&quot;mailto:contactus@bet.com&quot;">contactus@bet.com</a></p><p><br><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;You can send mail to the following postal address:</p><p><em><strong>BET Interactive, LLC<br>2000 M Street, NW<br>Suite 602<br>Washington, D.C.&nbsp;20036</strong></em></p><p><strong>3.</strong>&nbsp;You can call the following telephone number: 202-533-1990</p><p></p><p><strong>Correct/Update</strong></p><p></p><p>BET.com gives you the following options for informing us of changes to information you have previously provided:</p><p><strong>1.&nbsp;</strong>E-mail&nbsp;<a href="&quot;mailto:contactus@bet.com&quot;">contactus@bet.com</a></p><p><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;Send mail to the following postal address:</p><p><strong><em>BET Interactive, LLC<br>2000 M Street, NW<br>Suite 602<br>Washington, D.C.&nbsp;&nbsp;20036</em></strong></p><p><strong>3.</strong>&nbsp;Call the following telephone number 202-533-1990</p><p></p><p><strong>Contacting BET.com</strong></p><p>If you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of this site, or your dealings with BET.com, please feel free to contact:</p><p><strong><em>BET Interactive, LLC<br>2000 M Street, NW<br>Suite 602<br>Washington, D.C.&nbsp;&nbsp;20036</em></strong></p><p>Any of the policies or procedures above may be changed at any time without prior notice.
