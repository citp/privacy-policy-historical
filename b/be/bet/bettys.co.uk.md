We promise to look after your personal information and to treat your details with respect. We’ll never share your personal information with third parties for marketing purposes.

Please note we do keep hold of the personal information you provide, and any other information relating to you, to use for our own purposes, such as improving how our website works, market research, or in the prevention of Credit Card fraud. Out of necessity we may occasionally share information with relevant and trusted organisations to do this.
