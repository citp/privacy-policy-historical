This Privacy and Cookies Policy (“ **Policy** ”) explains how the Company collects, uses and discloses personal information about you when you visit the Site and when you contact the Company, whether by e-mail, post, fax or telephone using the contact options on the Site. The information you provide to us through the Site will initially be collected by the Company but may then be shared with other companies in the Bettys & Taylors Group Ltd group of companies (“ **Group** ”). All references to “the **Company** ”, “ **we** ” and “ **our** ” in this Policy therefore include the Group, unless distinguished in the text. Depending upon your relationship with the Company, we may separately provide you with further details about our use of your personal information.

**What type of information does the Company collect and why?**  
When you visit our Site, we may automatically collect standard internet and website log information and details of patterns about how website visitors behave.

This may allow us to find out which parts of the Site are popular or need changing.

If you use the “Search…” search facility available on the Site, search queries and results are logged anonymously without any user specific details being collected. Our collection of website use information may also involve the use of cookies and Web beacons. Please see the “Cookies” section below for more information.

If you want to use any of these services, you will need to provide us with some additional personal information so that we can liaise with you in order to deal with your request, query, purchase, Wish List or customer account registration. If you do choose to provide us with your personal information, we will collect that information for our own use and for the purposes described in this Policy.

This information will be collected primarily from you as information voluntarily provided to us, but we may also collect it where lawful to do so from (and combine it with information from) public sources, third party service providers, individuals who you have indicated have agreed for you to provide their personal information, government, tax or law enforcement agencies and other third parties. We may also collect personal information about you from your use of other Company websites or services.

**How does the Company use information about you?**  
The Company may use information about you for purposes described in this Policy or as otherwise disclosed to you on our Site or with our services. For example, we may use information about you for the following purposes:

  * to respond and/or deal with your request or enquiry;
  * to process and administer your order(s) or purchase(s) of our products;

  * to administer the Site;
  * for internal record keeping;
  * to contact you (directly, either by the Company or through a relevant partner or agent) by e-mail or phone for any of the above reasons;
  * subject to your consent where required under applicable laws, to carry out direct marketing and/or e-mail marketing that you have requested;
  * where necessary as part of any restructuring of the Company or sale of the Company’s business or assets;
  * to perform any contract the Company has with you; and
  * for compliance with legal, regulatory and other good governance obligations.



This list is not intended to be exhaustive and may be updated from time to time as business needs and legal requirements dictate. Some of the personal information that the Company maintains will be kept in paper files, while other personal information will be included in computerised files and electronic databases as set out in more detail below.

In most cases, the information the Company processes about you is required to deal with your request, purchase or registration, or required by law, or is necessary for the exercise of the Company’s legitimate business interests and needs.

The Company may also convert personal information into anonymous data and use it (normally on an aggregated statistical basis) for research and analysis to improve Company performance. In addition, the Company may use pixels or transparent GIF files, to help manage online advertising. Any information that we collect and share is anonymous and not personally identifiable.

**Does the Company share personal information with third parties?**  
Your personal information will be made available for the purposes mentioned above (or as otherwise notified to you from time to time), on a ‘need-to-know’ basis and only to responsible management, accounting, legal, logistics, audit, compliance, information technology and other corporate staff who properly need to know these details for their functions within the Company. Please note that certain individuals who will see your personal information may not be based at the Company or in your country (please see below).

We may share personal information within the Group as needed for reasonable management, analysis, planning and decision making, including in relation to taking decisions regarding the expansion and promotion of our product and service offering, order or customer request fulfilment and for use by those companies for the other purposes described in this Policy.

Your personal information may also be made available to third parties (within or outside the Company) providing relevant services under contract to the Company, or the Group (see below for further details), such as marketing agencies, credit card processors, auditors and compliance managers, providers of call centres and IT hosting and IT maintenance providers. These companies may use information about you to perform their functions on our behalf.

We may disclose specific information upon lawful request by government authorities, law enforcement and regulatory authorities where required or permitted by law and for tax or other purposes. Your personal information may also be made available to third parties or partners where necessary as part of any restructuring of the Company or sale of the Company’s business or assets. Personal information may also be released to external parties in response to legal process, and when required to comply with laws, or to enforce our agreements, corporate policies, and terms of use, or to protect the rights, property or safety of the Company, our employees, agents, customers, and others, as well as to parties to whom you authorise the Company to release your personal information.

We will not sell your personal information to any third party other than as part of any restructuring of the Company or Group or sale of a relevant Group business.

**Will your personal information be transferred** **abroad** **?**  
Some transfers of personal information to third party recipients have been explained above. Individuals within the European Economic Area (“EEA”) should be aware that such recipients of their personal information, within the Company or third parties (as set out in this notice), may not be located within the EEA but instead located in countries which do not have equivalent protection for personal information to that within the EEA. Steps will be taken to protect your personal information in that instance consistent with applicable law.

**What choices does the Company offer you with regard to direct marketing?**  
The Company may from time to time send you catalogues, information about new products, services, promotions and special offers which may be of interest to you and we may invite you to take part in market research or request feedback on our products and services. This communication may occur by e-mail, telephone, post or SMS. We will obtain your consent and advise you of how to opt-out of receiving such communications where we are required to do so in accordance with applicable law.

**What safeguards are in place to protect your personal information?**  
While we take efforts to safeguard your personal information which are consistent with relevant laws, the nature of the internet is such that it poses security risks for all users.

**What rights do you have to review and amend personal information?**  
You have the right to review your personal information held by the Company (including any profiling information) and have certain inaccurate information about you corrected. Under UK law, a request for access to your personal data needs to be in writing and accompanied by the statutory fee (£10).

**Keeping you informed**  
We will keep your details on record until we have completely dealt with your request, enquiry or application and then for a reasonable period afterwards, in accordance with data protection and other applicable legislation.

The Company may keep your details on record for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out above and will then endeavour to delete your details in accordance with data protection and other applicable legislation.
