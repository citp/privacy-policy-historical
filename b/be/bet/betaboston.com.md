**WHAT INFORMATION DO WE GATHER ABOUT YOU?**

The information gathered by the Services falls into two categories: (1) Personal information, which includes personal information you supply when you subscribe, order, complete a survey, register for one of our sites, enter a contest or provide your e-mail address and (2) Non-personal information collected through technology, which includes tracking information collected as you use the Services.

_**Personal Information That You Give Us**_

**Registration Information** : There is a free registration process required to access the full range of information and services offered across Boston Globe Web sites.

**Boston.com and BostonGlobe.com** require that you supply a unique e-mail address, your first and last name, and basic demographic information (zip code, birth year, and gender) in order to register. In addition, we may ask you to supply optional information on household income, job industry, and job title. In addition, BostonGlobe.com requires that you supply your credit card number or other billing information, address, and phone number. You must also agree to our [Terms of Service](http://www.bostonglobe.com/tools/help/terms-service) as part of the registration process.

**Boston Globe newspaper subscriber information** : We generally obtain your name, address, telephone number, credit card number or other billing information in order to process your newspaper subscription request. As a subscriber, we request that you also provide us with your e-mail address. If you use the Boston Globe Services Web site to manage your home delivery service, your newspaper subscriber information will be used to process online customer service requests relating to issues such as missing or late deliveries, and vacation stops and restarts.

**Registration for our Web sites via Third-Party Tools** : To help facilitate Boston.com registration, you can log in to our sites using sign-in services such as Facebook Connect or an Open ID provider. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information with us such as your name and email address to pre-populate our sign up form. Services like Facebook Connect give you the option to post information about your activities on our Web Sites to your profile page to share with others within your network. 

**Premium Products and Services** : We collect and store billing and credit card information where required for certain purchase transactions (such as paying for a subscription or classified advertisement). This information will only be shared with third parties who perform tasks required to complete the purchase transaction. Examples of this include fulfilling orders and processing credit card payments.

**User Generated Content (Including comments, profiles, and photo uploads)** : 

We offer opportunities for you to engage in public activities on our Web Sites, including submitting comments and photos in a number of areas throughout the Services. Any information you disclose in your submissions, along with your screen name or ID, or any image or photo, becomes public and may be used by The Boston Globe for online and offline promotional or commercial uses in any and all media.

“Public activities” are actions you take on our Web Sites that are designed to be visible to other users, including but not limited to comments on articles or blogs, participation in forums or discussion groups, and photo uploads. This feature may be disabled on the “edit profile” page. We may also feature, either through automation or by editor selection, specific user profiles or public activities to be promoted anywhere on the Services. If you choose to engage in public activities, we will track and aggregate these public activities on your profile page.

If you choose to engage in public activities, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these areas, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for this information. For more information, see the [Posting Policy](http://www.boston.com/help/message_board_rules/) and read the User Generated Content section of the [Terms of Service](http://www.boston.com/help/memberagreement/#three). To request removal of any personal information you submitted through engaging in public activities such as forums, contact us at [feedback@boston.com](mailto:feedback@boston.com). In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.

When you share or recommend (with or without adding your own comments) any articles or content from the Services to your Facebook profile, that action is governed by the Facebook Privacy Policy. We do not track or store a record of those comments or actions. 

Social Media Features and Widgets: Our Web Sites includes Social Media Features, such as the Facebook Like button, and Widgets, such as the Share This button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site. These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our site. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it. 

**Contests, Sweepstakes, and Special Offers** : On occasion, The Boston Globe collects personal information from users or subscribers in connection with optional sweepstakes, contests, or special offers. If this information is to be shared with a third party other than The Boston Globe we will notify you at the time of collection. If you do not want any personal information shared, you may always decline to participate in the sweepstakes, contest, or special offer.

**Special Events and Promotions** : We often receive contact information regarding customers who attend Special Events and Promotions. Such information will be used as indicated at the time of collection.

**Online Customer Panels** : We occasionally offer readers and customers the opportunity to participate in online research panels. These customers agree to participate in periodic surveys about their usage of products produced by The Boston Globe, their household/personal characteristics and their purchase behavior. Panel members are primarily contacted via e-mail, but may occasionally be contacted by telephone or postal mail. All survey data is reported/used in aggregate form only, and no personally identifiable information is released. As a panel member, we require that you supply us with your e-mail address only; name, home address and telephone number are optional. 

**Market Research and User Surveys** : Reader surveys and market research are valuable tools that help us better respond to consumer needs and opinions and help shape our product offerings. We may collect additional personal information from members in connection with optional reader surveys and market research activities. Information that you provide to answer optional survey or market research questions may be shared, in aggregate, with advertisers and partners unless we notify you otherwise at the time of collection.

**Jobs, Cars, and Real Estate:** While you are visiting certain sections of our Web Sites, please be aware that these areas are run by third parties. For instance if you are searching for a job you will be directed to use the monster.com Web site, which is framed within the Boston.com jobs section. All information collected in these areas is covered by the privacy policies of such third parties. Boston.com has no access or control over the information collected.
