## 6\. Security

Betclic uses its best endeavours to protect the confidentiality of your personal data and to prevent any unauthorised external or internal users from accessing such information without your consent. However, Betclic shall take no responsibility whatsoever for events beyond its control inclusive of, but not limited to, acts of god or natural disasters and including power cuts and strikes.

We are sure that, as our customer, you understand the evolving nature of our business due to continuous technological innovation and, although we endeavour to do our best to ensure the protection and privacy of your personal data at all times, we cannot guarantee that the performance of our service will be free from error at all times. Should any such error have an effect or consequence on the privacy of your personal data, we shall not be liable in any manner whatsoever in damages or otherwise.

We may use personal information provided by you in order to conduct appropriate anti-fraud checks. Personal information that you provide may be disclosed to a credit reference or fraud prevention agency, which may keep a record of that information. This is done only to confirm your identity - a credit check is not performed and your credit rating is unaffected.

We strongly recommend that you do not divulge your personal data to strangers or third parties during live chat. Remember that your personal data is sensitive and it’s important to stop and think before passing on personal information.

### Log Files

Like most standard website servers we use log files. This includes IP addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the Site, track user's movement in the aggregate and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.

### Data Encryption

All sensitive data which is transmitted between your computer and Betclic is transferred securely via the internet, using strong encryption. Betclic uses secure and tested encryption technology bearing certificates provided by renowned certificate authorities.

### Other security measures

When users submit sensitive information via the Site, their information is protected both online and offline. When our registration form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected using Secure Socket Layer– (SSL) technology. While on a secure page, such as our deposit page, the lock icon at the bottom, or in the url, of your web browser becomes locked. The lock icon is unlocked, or open, when users are simply 'surfing' and are not inputting sensitive information. All payments made on our Site and Mobile Offer are secured, in compliance with the relevant EU rules and regulations.

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user information offline. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only authorised Betclic employees/contractors are granted access to personally identifiable information. We perform checks on all of our potential employees/contractors to ensure that none of them have a criminal record. Our employees/contractors are regularly made aware of security best practices within the industry and security audits are carried out on a regular basis. Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment.

## 7\. Changes in our Company/Business

We will, as part of our policy, inform our customers by email prior to affecting such transfer of the personal data.

Continued use of our Site by the members after any modifications to the Site, Mobile Offer, House Rules, Terms and Conditions or Privacy &Cookies Policy will be considered as their acceptance thereof.
