## 3\. Storage of personal data

**3.1** Customer data is transmitted, stored, and processed electronically. All information which the customer transmits to `bet-at-home.com` is saved on the servers of `bet-at-home.com` and can only be accessed by trained and authorised personnel. The customer undertakes to keep passwords which provide him/her access to certain areas a secret. 

**3.2** The data, which is stored by `bet-at-home.com`, may be transmitted to a place outside of the European Economic Area ("EEA") and stored there.

By submitting their personal data to `bet-at-home.com`, the customer consents to the aforementioned transmission, storage, and processing of their data. `bet-at-home.com` takes all measures necessary to ensure that the data is handled securely and in accordance with this Data Privacy Statement. 

**3.3** Unfortunately, the transmission of information over the internet is not completely secure. `bet-at-home.com` takes all possible steps to protect the personal data of customers.
