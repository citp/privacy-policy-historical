## 6\. In the context of the GDPR you can claim the following rights regarding the processing of your data

**Right of access:** You can request a confirmation from us as to whether and to which extent we process your data.

You can request a restriction of processing your data if 

  * you contest the accuracy of the data for a period that enables us to verify the accuracy of the data,
  * the processing of the data is unlawful, but you oppose an erasure and instead request a restriction of use,

**Right to data portability:** We have to make your data that you entrusted us with available to you in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format as long as we are processing these data according to your given and revocable agreement or to complete a contract and this processing is carried out by automated means. 

**Right to object:** If your data is processed in order to take on tasks of public interest or to exercise public authority or if we refer to the necessity of processing the data to maintain our legitimate interest, you can object to the processing of your data if the protection of your data outweighs our legitimate interest. You can also revoke any agreements to `bet-at-home.com` collecting and saving your personal data at any time as long as there is no opposing contractual or legal obligation. 

**Right to complain:** If you believe that we are violating European data protection law when processing your data, we would ask you to contact us in order to clarify any questions you may have. It is of course also within your right to complain to a regulating authority within the EU. 

**Verification of identity:** In order to protect your rights and privacy, we can, if in doubt, request information to verify your identity.

**Enforcement of the rights:** If you want to enforce one of the stated rights, please use our possibilities to contact us. 

## 7\. Storage of personal data

Customer data is transmitted, stored, and processed electronically. All information you provide to us is saved on the servers of `bet-at-home.com` and only trained and authorised persons, who are bound to treat personal data confidentially and in accordance with the current date protection regulation, have access to it. The customer undertakes to keep passwords which provide him/her access to certain areas a secret. 

Unfortunately, the transmission of information over the internet is not completely secure. We take all possible steps to protect the personal data of customers. However, complete security of customers’ data can never be guaranteed. Therefore, all transfer of data by the customer is at their own risk. After `bet-at-home.com` has received the data, the company takes technical and organisational measures to ensure that `bet-at-home.com`’s systems are protected against attacks and misuse, and that the user’s personal data is protected against loss, incorrect modification, and unauthorised use by third parties. 

By default, `bet-at-home.com`’s apps save the customer’s username. The customer can change this at any time in the settings of the relevant app. 

## 8\. Use of your personal data

  * Establishing and operating your betting account; securing the functionality of all services so that they can be used to their full extent, e.g. deposits to your betting account, placing bets and playing games (fulfilling the contract)

Should we suspect that such activities are actually taking place, we are obliged to forward this information to the responsible authorities. We exercise these activities via manual and automated checks.
  * In order to fulfil our obligations in the area of responsible gaming, we observe playing and depositing patterns. That way we guarantee responsible gaming. In order to prevent fraud, money laundering, financing of terrorism or depositing funds that were earned from activities punishable by law as well as for responsible gaming purposes, we add information we receive from third parties or by accessing third party sources, including (without restrictions) information about you published on the internet to the data you provide.

Cookies enable `bet-at-home.com` to be able to offer services, to improve the security of the website, to collect information regarding transactions, and to prevent fraud. Furthermore, cookies simplify navigation and facilitate the management of the insertion of particularly relevant or useful information or adverts. 

Cookies are small files which are stored on the device of the user to which the browser or the respective app that is used is assigned and through which the party placing the cookie receives certain information. They allow anonymous recognition of the computer, but do not allow personal identification of the visitor. Cookies cannot operate programmes or transfer viruses to the device of the user. 

Visitors can prevent cookies from being set in the settings of the browser (Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox etc.) they use. To do this, visitors must select "Block all cookies" (or similar wording) by going to Settings > Privacy > Cookies. Depending on the browser, it is possible to set the system so that approval must be requested before cookies are set. Cookies which have been set can then be deleted at any time.

This occurs, in other cases, because `bet-at-home.com`’s website contains content (scripts, tracking pixels) from third parties. It is possible for third parties to set their own cookies and collect information about the online activities of visitors because a connection to the web servers of these third parties is established. 

If links to websites of third parties are available on `bet-at-home.com`’s website, visitors should be aware that these websites may set their own cookies and that their own Privacy Policies may apply.

## 12\. Tracking Tools

We use tracking tools. However, these tools do not provide us with any personal data of the users. Instead, we only receive statistical data about the use of services offered by `bet-at-home.com`. This enables us to learn, for example, what content is particularly popular, at which times the services are used very intensively, from which cities and parts of the world the users use these services, and which browsers and operating systems users generally use to access the services. We use this information to constantly improve the technical, creative, and editorial aspects of these services, and to make these services more convenient for the users. We can optimise the web design on the basis of statistical information concerning browser types and operating systems. The tools used for web analytics concern the following services. 

We hereby state that `bet-at-home.com` websites and apps use Google Analytics, a web analysis service of Google Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics uses "cookies", which are files stored on the user’s device and allow for analysis of the user’s webpage usage. The information generated by the cookie about the user’s use of this website (including their IP address) is transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there. 

If an IP anonymization service is activated on this website, Google will shorten the user’s IP address within member states of the European Union or other states within the European Economic Area. Only in rare cases will an entire IP address be sent to a Google server in the USA and shortened there. IP anonymisation is active on this website. Google uses the information collected by Google Analytics to assess the user’s usage of the website, to compile reports about the website’s activity, and to provide other services connected with the website and internet usage to the website operator. 

Google does not, under any circumstances, link any of its other data with the user’s IP address. The customer can prevent the storing of cookies by using the corresponding settings in their browser. However, it should be noted that the customer may not be able to use all functions of the services offered by `bet-at-home.com` in their entirety if the customer chooses to do this. Furthermore, the user can prevent Google Analytics from collecting data in the future by installing the following browser add-on: `<http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en>.`

The user can prevent Google Analytics from collecting data within this website in the future by clicking on this link: Set Google Analytics opt-out cookie. This is an alternative to a browser add-on and can be used for browsers on mobile devices. This opt-out choice only applies for the browser being used and for this domain. When the user clicks on the aforementioned link, an opt-out cookie is placed on their device. If cookies are deleted from the browser, the user has to click on the link again to reset the opt-out cookie. 

The user can also prevent their data from being collected via Google Analytics in the future in the apps which `bet-at-home.com` offers by deactivating "Google Analytics" in the settings of the relevant app. 

By using the services offered by `bet-at-home.com`, the user agrees to their data being processed by Google as described above and for the purpose stated above. 

Demographic data and interests are also collected via Google Analytics. This feature enables us to view anonymous and extensive data regarding the gender, age, and interests of visitors to the website. The data is collected through first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie). 

If there is a malfunction on the website or in the apps, technical information will be sent to us so that the cause of the problem can be investigated. Personal data may also be sent to us for the same reason. We use this information to constantly improve the technical aspects of our services and to make these services more convenient for our users.
