# Privacy Policy | TakeLessons

Your privacy is very important to us. We want to make your experience with us as enjoyable and rewarding as possible, and we want you to use TakeLessons.com (the “Website”) and all of our services with complete confidence. We have created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our commitment to privacy and security and supplement our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms). 

We request that you read this Privacy Policy carefully.

### Personal Information We Collect and How It Is Used

#### Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how we collect information from users of our Website, those who use our products and services (the “Services”) but do not have accounts ("Visitors"), and those who register and subscribe to our services ("Members"). It describes what we do with the information we collect, and the choices Visitors and Members have concerning the collection and use of such information. 

#### Types of Information We Collect

We collect information from Visitors and Members who access various parts of our Website and use different Services in a variety of ways, including through a mobile device. As a result, the type of information we collect depends on the ways Visitors and Members interact with us, our Website and/or our Service(s). We may offer websites, services or applications that permit browsing and do not require registration. We may also offer Members the ability to access their accounts online and offline, which may result in collection of different data. 

Information that we may collect about you through interactions includes information that you give us (such as your name, address, email address, other contact information, surveys and other information input into the Website); automatic information (data resulting from your activity, such as transaction information, IP address, log in, email, passwords and browsing activity); mobile information (location services); and information from other sources. We may also gather additional information such as the type of device and browser you are using, the IP address of your device, information about your device's operating system, and additional information associated with your device and browsing activity. We may also gather information collected through cookies, tags, and other technologies, as described further below. 

#### Use of Registration and Visitor Information

Members are asked to provide certain personal information when they sign up for our Services including name, address, telephone number, email address and billing information (such as a credit card number and expiration date). The personal information collected from Members during the registration process is used to manage each Member's account (such as for billing purposes) **and may be shared with other members to coordinate service delivery**. This information is not normally shared with unaffiliated third parties, unless specifically stated otherwise or in special circumstances. 

We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. They have access to personal information gathered through the Services needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. 

We may promote the Website, Services or a new service to members. You may manage your communication preferences within your account. 

We may also generate non-identifying and aggregate profiles from personal information Members provide during registration (such as the total number, but not the names, of Members). As explained in more detail below, we may use this aggregated and non-identifying information to sell advertisements that appear on the Services. 

#### Email Marketing from Third Party Sponsors

We may send, on behalf of third parties, promotions via mail to some or all of our Members. However, in no event do we sell or otherwise transfer to third parties the email addresses of our subscribers. We strictly maintain the confidentiality of our subscribers' email addresses, except as stated in this Privacy Policy. In addition, users are always given the opportunity of opting-out of these promotions. 

#### Voluntary Customer Surveys

We may periodically conduct both business and individual customer surveys. We encourage our customers to participate in these surveys because they provide us with important information that helps us to improve the types of services we offer and how we provide them to you. Your personal information and responses will remain strictly confidential (except where required by law), even if a third party conducts the survey. Participation in our customer surveys is voluntary. 

We take the information we receive from individuals responding to our Customer Surveys and aggregate it with the responses from other customers to create broader, generic responses to the survey questions (such as gender, age, residence, hobbies, education, employment, industry sector, or other demographic information). We then use the aggregated information to improve the quality of our services to you, and to develop new services and products. This aggregated, non-personally-identifying information may be shared with third parties. 

#### "Cookies" and How We Use Them

A "cookie" is a small data file that can be placed on your hard drive when you visit certain websites. We may use cookies to collect, store, and sometimes track information for statistical purposes to improve the products and services we provide and to manage our telecommunications networks. If you are a Member, we will use a cookie to save your settings (which saves you time) and to provide customizable and personalized services. These cookies do not enable third parties to access any of your customer information. Advertisers and partners may also use their own cookies. We do not control the use of these cookies and expressly disclaim responsibility for information collected through them. We may also provide certain widgets or tools on our sites, such as tools that allow web surfers to easily share information on another platform, such as a social media platform. At other times, information from a third party may be embedded on our site, such as a map or information streaming from another site, including communications streaming from a third party social media platform. These widgets, tools, and informational items often function through the use of third party cookies utilized by the third party site, such as the social media platform. You may wish to review information at third party sites, such as social media platforms where you have an account, to determine how these third parties treat data that they obtain through the use of cookies. 

#### Additional Technologies

We may also use additional technologies such as pixel tags, web beacons, and clear GIFs, and may permit our third party service providers to use these technologies. We use these technologies for purposes such as measuring the effectiveness of our advertisements or other communications, determining viewing and response rates, and determining which offers to present to you on our own or on third party sites. 

#### In the Event of a Change in Ownership

As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy websites, subsidiaries, or business units. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). 

In the event of a change in ownership, or a merger or an acquisition, all (or select aspects) of our customer information may be transferred. All of our subscribers and registered users will be notified of any change in ownership, merger or an acquisition of our assets by a third party. Subscribers and users may choose to access and modify any of their registration and subscription information at that time. 

#### Special Cases

It is our policy not to use or share personal information about Visitors or Members in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses. However, we may disclose personal information about Visitors or Members, or information regarding your use of the Services or Web sites accessible through our Services, for any reason if, in our sole discretion, we believe that it is reasonable to do so, including: to satisfy laws, such as the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, regulations, or governmental or legal requests for such information; to disclose information that is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms) or other policies; to operate the Services properly; or to protect us and our Members. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

### Credit Card Information

#### Your Credit Card Information is Secure

We are committed to handling your customer information with high standards of information security. Your credit card information is stored only in encrypted form and processed using a secured order server with Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology. We restrict access to your personally identifiable information only to employees with proper clearance who need to know that information in order to provide products or services to you. While we make every effort to ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent third-party "hackers" from illegally obtaining this information. 

If you to prefer to place your order by telephone, you can call us during normal business hours at 619-858-2200 with your credit card and billing information. 

#### What is your Credit Card Fraud Policy?

In the unlikely event that you experience unauthorized use of your credit card, promptly report the fraudulent activity to your credit card company. Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, you are only liable for the first $50 of the fraudulent charges. Please check with your credit card company to verify specific terms and conditions.

### Communication to Members and Visitors

We use personal information to communicate important information with our Members. Important information includes, but not limited to, student newsletters, instructor newsletters, lesson reminders, lesson comments, payment information, credit card update notifications, account status, legal updates, and other important account information. Members and, where applicable Visitors, agree to accept this communication from us. 

#### Online Advertisements

We occasionally display online advertisements on our Website and in our newsletters and alerts. We share aggregated and non-identifying information about our Visitors and Members collected through the registration process as well as through online surveys and promotions with these advertisers. Additionally, in some instances, we use this aggregated and non-identifying information to deliver tailored advertisements. For instance, an advertiser might tell us the audience they want to reach (for example, males between 25 and 55 years of age) and provide us with an advertisement tailored to that audience. Based upon the aggregated and non-identifying information we have collected, we may then display the advertisement to the intended audience. However, we do not share personal information about Visitors or Members with these advertisers to be used for other purposes. 

#### Responses to Email Inquiries

When Visitors or Members send email inquiries to us, we use the return email address to answer the email inquiry we receive. We do not use the return email address for any other purpose and do not share the return email address with any third party. 

#### Our Commitment to Data Security

Services and websites we sponsor have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. While we make every effort to ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent third-party "hackers" from illegally obtaining this information.
