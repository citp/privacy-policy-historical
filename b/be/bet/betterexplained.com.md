# Privacy Policy – BetterExplained

This website does not collect personal information. Here’s a quick summary of behavior:

  * No personal information is collected. If you leave a blog comment and include an email, this is stored inside the WordPress comment database but not exposed. This email can be used to notify you if you’ve subscribed to new comments.

  * User information is never shared with any third parties.

  * Email newsletters are opt-in, with 1-click unsubscribe.

  * All product purchases occur offsite (on Gumroad or Paypal) and payment information is not submitted directly to this website.

  * Web analytics and ad retargeting services are used, including Google Analytics, StatCounter, Clicky, Visual Website Optimizer, and AdRoll. These services typically rely on 3rd-party cookies, and can be globally disabled in your browser settings. As you browse BetterExplained, advertising cookies will be placed on your computer so that we can understand what you are interested in. Our display advertising partner, AdRoll, then enables us to present you with retargeting advertising on other sites based on your previous interaction with BetterExplained. The techniques our partners employ do not collect personal information such as your name, email address, postal address or telephone number. You can visit [this page](https://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/) to opt out of AdRoll and their partners’ targeted advertising.

  * Product links to Amazon.com may include an affiliate code.
