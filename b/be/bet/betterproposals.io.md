Some basic details about who we are. 

2\. WHO AND WHAT THIS POLICY APPLIES TO

2.1 Our Privacy Policy deals with how we handle “personal information” as it is defined in the Privacy Act (Personal Information).

2.2 We handle Personal Information for our own business, as well as potentially storing Personal Information in our systems on behalf of our customers and users that input Personal Information into our systems.

2.3 Our Privacy Policy does not apply to information we collect about businesses or companies, however it does apply to information about the people in those businesses or companies which we store.

2.4 The Privacy Policy applies to all forms of information, physical and digital, whether collected or stored electronically or in hardcopy.

2.5 Our website and services are unavailable to children (persons under the age of 18 years). If an individual is under 18 years of age, they can only use our website and services under the supervision of a parent or guardian.

This Privacy Policy applies to any information collected and/or stored about our customers and users, and any information they provide about others. 

3\. THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT

3.1 In the course of business it is necessary for us to collect Personal Information. This information allows us to identify who an individual is for the purposes of our business, share Personal Information when asked of us, contact the individual in the ordinary course of business and transact with the individual. Without limitation, the type of information we may collect is:

(a) Personal Information. We may collect personal details such as an individual’s name, location, date of birth, nationality, family details and other information defined as “Personal Information” in the Privacy Act that allows us to identify who the individual is;  
(b) Contact Information. We may collect information such as an individual’s email address, telephone & fax number, third-party usernames, residential, business and postal address and other information that allows us to contact the individual;  
(c) Financial Information. We may collect financial information related to an individual such as any bank or credit card details used to transact with us and other information that allows us to transact with the individual and/or provide them with our services;  
(d) Statistical Information. We may collect information about an individual’s online and offline preferences, habits, movements, trends, decisions, associations, memberships, finances, purchases and other information for statistical purposes; and Information an individual sends us. We may collect any personal correspondence that an individual sends us, or that is sent to us by others about the individual’s activities.

3.2 We may collect other Personal Information about an individual, which we will maintain in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

3.3 We may also collect non-Personal Information about an individual such as information regarding their computer, network and browser. This may include their IP address. Where non-Personal Information is collected the UK Privacy Principles do not apply. 

3.4 Any time an individual provides Personal Information or other information about someone other than himself or herself, the individual warrants that they have that person's consent to provide such information for the purpose specified. 

1\. We may collect or request various types of information for standard business usage such as support and marketing purposes. 

2\. We may also collect non-Personal information such as which browser you are using for example. 

3\. When you provide someone else's information, you have to have their consent first. 

4\. HOW INFORMATION IS COLLECTED

4.1 Most information will be collected in association with an individual’s use of Better Proposals, an enquiry about Better Proposals, or generally dealing with us. However we may also receive Personal Information from sources such as advertising, an individual’s own promotions, public records, mailing lists, contractors, staff, recruitment agencies and our business partners. In particular, information is likely to be collected as follows:

(a) Registrations/Subscriptions. When an individual registers or subscribes for a service, list, account, connection or other process whereby they enter Personal Information details in order to receive or access something, including a transaction;  
(b) Accounts/Memberships.  
When an individual submits their details to open an account and/or become a member with us;  
(c) Supply. When an individual supplies us with goods or services;  
(d) Contact. When an individual contacts us in any way;  
(e) Access. When an individual accesses us physically we may require them to provide us with details for us to permit them such access. When an individual accesses us through the internet we may collect information using cookies (if relevant – an individual can adjust their browser’s setting to accept or reject cookies) or analytical services; and/or Pixel Tags. Pixel tags enable us to send email messages in a format customers can read and they tell us whether mail has been opened.

4.2 As there are many circumstances in which we may collect information both electronically and physically, we will endeavour to ensure that an individual is always aware of when their Personal Information is being collected.

4.3 Where we obtain Personal Information without an individual’s knowledge (such as by accidental acquisition from a client) we will either delete/destroy the information, or inform the individual that we hold such information, in accordance with the UK Privacy Principles. 

Information will primarily be collected through usage of the system, sometimes explicitly asked for, other times by way of analytics software. 

5\. WHEN PERSONAL INFORMATION IS USED & DISCLOSED

5.1 In general, the primary principle is that we will not use any Personal Information other than for the purpose for which it was collected other than with the individual’s permission. The purpose of collection is determined by the circumstances in which the information was collected and/or submitted.

5.2 We will retain Personal Information for the period necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.

We will take reasonable steps to ensure that any disclosure to an entity outside of the UK will not be made until that entity has agreed in writing with us to safeguard Personal Information as we do.

5.8 We may utilise third-pay service providers (such as SendGrid from SendGrid, Inc., and Intercom from Intercom, Inc.) to communicate with an individual and to store contact details about an individual. These service providers are located in the United States of America.
