          In order to give you the best experience on our site, ZeniMax may collect
          information about you, but only if you voluntarily provide it to us.
          Typically, we may ask a user to submit personal and/or demographic information,
          and it will usually take the form of either: <a href="#a">(1) product
          and warranty registration</a>; <a href="#b">(2) community forum registration</a>;
          <a href="#c">(3) contests and sweepstakes</a>, <a href="#d">(4) technical
          support</a>; (5) the purchase of a product or service at our <a href="#e">online
          store</a>; and (6) personal information submitted in a <a href="#f">business
          capacity</a> (e.g., resumes). The types of information that may be requested
          for each activity and the way the information may be used are detailed
          below. In the event that demographic information is requested on the
          same page as personal information, the demographic and personal information
          may be combined.</p>

              such as your name, email address, home address, and telephone number.
              We may also collect demographic information including your age,
              information about the product you purchased, the type of console
              you own, and the types of games you enjoy playing. The information
              that you submit during registration will entitle you to limited
              warranty protection and technical support. We may also use your
              registration information to notify you about updates to our products
              and services.</p>
          </li>
          <li><u><a name="b"></a>Forum Registration</u>
            <p>To register for membership in any of our online community forums,
              we may ask you to provide personal information such as your email

              demographic information about you, including your occupation, hobbies
              and interest, and other preferences. The information that you submit

            <p>The ability to participate in the community forums by simply logging
