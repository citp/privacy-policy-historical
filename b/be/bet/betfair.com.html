	<p>We will also retain such information and may analyse it in order to investigate any actual or suspected criminal activity or, in respect of any event featured on our website, any threat to the integrity of that event and/or breaches of the rules of that event as laid down by the relevant governing (including sporting) bodies.

	<br><h3>3.3 To whom and where personal information may be disclosed?</h3><br>
	<p>Your Personal Information may, for the purposes described above, be transferred or disclosed to any company within the Group or, subject to appropriate agreement, to third parties, for the processing of that Personal Information on our behalf. The Group may, from time to time, retain trusted third parties to process your Personal Information for the purposes listed above and such processing will be governed by a contract in the form required by law.</p>
	<p>Where required by law, your Personal Information may also be disclosed to an applicable governmental, regulatory, sporting or enforcement authority. Additionally, in circumstances where we deem it appropriate, your Personal Information may be disclosed to any regulatory authority (whether at the request of such authority or otherwise) which has issued any company within the Group with a gambling operating licence.</p>
	<p>Your Personal Information may also be disclosed to any regulatory or sporting body in connection with policing the integrity or enforcing the rules of a sport or game and/or prevention and detection of crime and with whom the Group has agreements (Memoranda of Understanding or "MOUs") from time to time for the sharing of such data and where the Group considers that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that you may be involved in a breach of such rules or the law, have knowledge of a breach of such rules or the law or otherwise pose a threat to the integrity of the relevant sport or game. Those bodies may then use your Personal Information to investigate and act on any such breaches in accordance with their procedures.</p>
	<p>Paddy Power Betfair plc operates businesses in multiple jurisdictions some of which are not located in the European Economic Area (“EEA”).  Countries outside the EEA do not always have strong data protection laws. We will ensure that each Group company and their service providers process your information under strict contractual instruction, in a secure manner and in accordance with this Policy.</p>
	<br><h3>3.4 Accuracy and Access to Information</h3><br>
	<p>You are entitled and we require you to have any inaccurate information corrected so please ensure that you notify us of any updates, amendments and corrections to your information by logging into the ‘My Account’ section of your online account and amending your ‘Contact Details’ on Paddy Power and ‘My details’ on Betfair sections or by contacting our support team through one of the options available in our Help Centre. If you wish to query the nature of how we process your personal data, you can contact us at any time. Our contact details are located in the 'Contact Us' pages of our website.</p>
	<p>You also have a right to request a copy of any personal information that we hold about you. Should you wish to make such a request you should contact us in writing at: </p>
	<p>Subject Access Requests c/o Legal Department, Paddy Power Betfair plc, Waterfront, Hammersmith Embankment, London W6 9HP with a cheque payment for £10 made payable to Paddy Power Betfair plc.</p>
	<p>Or</p>
	<p>Subject Access Requests c/o Customer Services, Paddy Power Betfair plc, Power Tower, Belfield Business Park, Clonskeagh, Dublin 4, with a cheque made payable for €6.35</p>
	<p>You should include adequate information to identify yourself and such other relevant information that will reasonably assist us in fulfilling your request. Your request will be dealt with as soon as possible. Under the Data Protection Acts, we are entitled to charge an administration fee for processing such requests.</p>
	<br><h3>3.5 Retention and Disposal</h3><br>
	<p>We only keep your information for as long as is necessary for the purpose for which it was originally obtained. Please note that we may be required in certain circumstances to retain your information indefinitely (for example under our procedures on responsible gambling and self-exclusion). We will take all necessary steps to ensure that the privacy of information is maintained upon disposal.</p>
	<br><h3><u>4. SECURITY</u></h3><br>
	<p>We recognise that online security is an area of vital importance for all our customers. It is imperative that you should have full confidence that your personal details are secure before you register an account. We employ security measures to protect your information from access by unauthorised persons and to prevent unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction and damage. We use state of the art technological security solutions, including encryption when transmitting sensitive information across the internet, which is certified by Thawte. This means that all personal and financial information sent to and from the Website are encrypted in accordance with good industry practice.</p>
	<p>In order to protect both ourselves and our customers from identity theft we may verify the information you have provided with our banking institutions over secure lines. Again this is carried out in accordance with our data protection obligations.</p>
	<p>Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our websites, you are responsible for keeping the password, as well as any means to manage the password such as a registered email address, secure and confidential at all times.</p>
	<p>As the security of some communications via the internet is not completely secure, we cannot guarantee the security of any information that you disclose using your internet connection. You accept the inherent security implications of using the internet and Paddy Power Betfair plc will accept no liability for any direct, consequential, incidental, indirect, or punitive losses or damages arising out of such an occurrence.</p>
	<p>While we follow best practice, including but not limited to implementing administrative, technical and physical measures to safeguard your personal information against loss, theft and misuse you should also take personal steps to protect the security of your data both physically and electronically by following common best practice procedures such as:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Running Anti-Virus software and keeping it up to date;</li>
	<li>Applying operating system, web browser and other security updates;</li>
	<li>Ensuring your PC or other device is not left unattended whilst logged into our Websites; and</li>
	<li>Using strong passwords for all Services and logins.</li>
	</ul>
