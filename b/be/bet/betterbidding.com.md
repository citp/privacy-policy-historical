## Introduction

Your privacy is of the utmost importance to BetterBidding. Our basic principles are:

  * We respect your privacy at BetterBidding

## Security of Information

Your Information is stored on BetterBidding's servers located in the United States. We use procedural and technical safeguards to protect your personal Information against loss or theft as well as unauthorized access and disclosure to protect your privacy.

That being said, "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet and no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be absolutely secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal Information, BetterBidding cannot ensure or warrant the security of any Information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure the security of your Information on our systems.

Please note that we cannot guarantee the security of member account Information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of member Information at any time. Therefore, although we use industry standard practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal Information or private communications will always remain private.

If BetterBidding learns of a security systems breach we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. By using this web site or providing personal Information to us you agree that we can communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy and administrative issues relating to your use of this site. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice) you should notify us
