## Additional Information

No transmission of data over the Internet is guaranteed to be completely secure. It may be possible for third parties not under the control of BetseyJohnson.com to intercept or access transmissions or private communications unlawfully.

These limitations shall apply notwithstanding any failure of essential purpose or the existence of any limited remedy.
