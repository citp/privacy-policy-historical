Does betseyjohnson.com share my information with third parties?**

We contract with third parties to assist us in maintaining and managing our customer information, to fulfill promotions and to communicate with our customers. We do not authorize any of those third parties to make any other use of your information. 

When we offer contests and promotions, or join with other companies to do so, customers who choose to participate in those contests and promotions may be asked to provide personal information to participate. That information may then be used by us and by any company offering the contest or promotion to notify winners or to fulfill promotional obligations. 

In addition, when we team up with another company to offer or provide products, services, contests or promotions, we and the other company may cross-reference our customer databases to identify common customers. We and the other company may use that existing information to identify future promotional opportunities and to fulfill promotional or contractual obligations. 

If, prior to participating in a contest or promotion, you opted not to receive information about or mailings from us, you may still receive information from or about betseyjohnson.com in connection with the contest or promotion if you choose to register for or participate in it. You may opt not to participate in these contests or promotions if you do not want to receive information about betseyjohnson.com or share your information with betseyjohnson.com and the other companies sponsoring those contests or promotions. 

If you are a catalog customer, we may share your name and mailing address with third parties that have products or services we think may interest you. We also may share aggregate, non-personally identifiable information about you, such as age, gender and types of products purchased, with our business partners to fulfill our contractual obligations. Except as described above, we do not share, rent or sell any information we collect online to any unaffiliated third party. 

**How do I access my information? How do I change or delete my information?**

**How does betseyjohnson.com protect kids' privacy?**

Like you, we at betseyjohnson.com are concerned about the safety of children when they use the Internet. Consistent with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, we will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without prior verifiable parental consent. If we receive actual knowledge that a subscriber to betseyjohnson.com is under the age of 13, we will remove all personally identifiable information about that person from our files. 

**What are cookies? How does betseyjohnson.com use cookies on its site?**

A cookie is a small data file that websites often store on your computer's hard drive when you visit their sites. A cookie may contain information, such as a unique user ID that websites use to track the pages of the sites you've visited. We use cookies but do not store personally identifiable information in your cookie. 

We use cookies in order to improve your shopping experience. Cookies enable us to keep track of your order as you shop on our site. Through our use of cookies, we also track and maintain the identity of the web site you visited immediately prior to visiting our website. We do not otherwise track any information about your use of other websites. 

You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. If you turn off cookies, though, we will not be able to track your order to enable you to purchase from our site. To override your current cookie handling practices for individual sites: Select “Internet Options” from the “Tools” Menu. Click on the “Edit” button in the “Override cookie handling for individual websites” section. This will open the “Per Site Privacy Actions” dialogue box. Type “www.betseyjohnson.com” in the “Address of Website” box. Click the “Allow” button. Click the “OK” button, then close the “Per Site Privacy Actions” dialogue box. Click the “OK” button to close the “Internet Options” dialogue box and apply your changes. 

**How do I know my order information is secure?**

Protecting your order information is important to us. To check the security of your connection, look at the lower left-hand corner of your browser window after accessing the server. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending on your browser), your connection is secure. You can also double-check by looking at the URL line of your browser. When accessing a secure server, the first characters of the site address will change from "http" to "https." 

Some versions of browsers and some firewalls don't permit communication through secure servers like the ones we use to process orders at betseyjohnson.com. In that case, you'll be unable to connect to the server, which means you won't be able to mistakenly place an order through an unsecured connection.

**What about links to other websites and services?**

The betseyjohnson.com website may contain links to other sites that are not under our control. These websites have their own policies regarding privacy. You should review those policies before visiting the websites. We have no responsibility for linked websites, and we provide these links solely for the convenience and information of our visitors.
