# Disclosure Policy | beingfrugal.net

### Disclosure

I maintain affiliate relationships with the following companies:  Amazon, Google Adsense, Mvelopes, Bluehost, YNAB, MyPoints, Ebates, and the Money Saving Methods Report.  All of these are programs that I have used and love.  I do not write sponsored posts, and I have no plans to do so. If that ever changes, I will make the change in policy very clear to my readers.  I do write about companies I am affiliated with, but my opinions are always truthful.  If you have any questions about the above companies, feel free to [contact me](http://beingfrugal.net/contact-me/) with any questions. I’d be glad to discuss them with you.

### Comment Policy

I enjoy comments, good discussion, and alternative viewpoints. You are always welcome to leave a comment if you have something to add to the conversation, a question to ask, or even a viewpoint different than my own. However, I do ask that you be respectful in voicing your opinions, both to me and to other commentators. I reserve the right to remove any comments that are obviously meant to be inflammatory or comments that are spam.

### Link Exchange Policy

I do not participate in link exchanges at this time.
