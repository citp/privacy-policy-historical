**2.  Type of information collected**

On visiting the BERNINA website, there is no automatic collection of personal information about the user, such as name, address telephone number or email address unless this information is provided voluntarily by the user by filling in a form on the website or making contact with us in another way via the site. Data collection and analysis also applies to information you provide to us when you subscribe to one of our services or if you require other services. In addition, we may keep records of correspondence if you make contact with us.

BERNINA constantly strives to make our website more interesting for all our users. For this reason, statistical visitor data is collected each time the website is visited to establish which pages of the website are visited most frequently by each user. This includes the collection of data regarding the browser, operating system, weblogs and other connection data used by the user, irrespective of whether its collection is required for our or other purposes. In this context, it is sometimes necessary to use cookies.

**3.  Use of cookies**

Like many other websites, BERNINA uses cookies on this website. Cookies are small pieces of text information, which are stored by your browser (e.g. Internet Explorer or Mozilla Firefox) on your computer's hard drive. These cookies are completely anonymised and contain no personal information. Most of the cookies used by BERNINA are deleted from your hard drive at the end of the browser session (so-called session cookies). Other cookies remain on your computer and make it possible for BERNINA to recognize your computer the next time you visit (so-called permanent cookies). Cookies simplify your use of the BERNINA website and are used to make the BERNINA website pleasant and easier to use in operating it. They are used, for example, in the Welcome involving your user name, make it easy to fill in forms with your data and remember your language selection or products in the shopping cart.

At no time is spy software installed or used to gain access to data and information stored on your computer.

Cookies make it easier for you to use the BERNINA website and contain no personal information about the user. Most browsers automatically accept cookies. However, you can configure your browser so that it does not accept or store cookies. Details of how to do this can be found in the operating instructions or help files of your browser.

If you opt out of the use of cookies, your ability to use every function on this website to its fullest extent could be limited.

**4.  Use of information**

The anonymized data that are retained when accessing our website via cookies can be used for purposes of analysis and for optimizing the website in conjunction with third party services. As a result, these third parties can - to a limited extent - themselves collect personal data about BERNINA users, provided that they recognize them, for instance, by means of their own cookies or logins.

**4.1     Google Analytics and third party provider cookies**

The BERNINA website uses Google Analytics, a web analysis service by Google Inc. ("Google"), which uses cookies. This involves cookies from Google itself (Google Analytics cookies) and so-called third party provider cookies (e.g. DoubleClick cookies). The information about your use of this website, which is generated by these cookies (including your IP address), is transmitted to a server in the USA owned by Google, Inc., and stored there. Google will use this information to analyze your use of the website for BERNINA in order to compile reports about website activities and to provide additional services related to the use of the website and the use of the Internet, particularly functions for display advertising, like remarketing, reports on impressions in the Google display network, integration of DoubleClick Campaign Manager or Google Analytics reports about providing services according to demographic characteristics and interests. Where applicable, Google will also transfer this information to third parties, provided this is required by law or insofar as third parties are processing these data on behalf of Google. Google will under no circumstances link your IP address with other data. Through the use of this website you agree to the processing of the data collected by Google in the manner described above and for the purpose previously indicated. You can opt out of the placement of Google Analytics cookies through an add-on to your browser.  
By opting out of Google Analytics cookies you can exercise your right to deny the collection, processing and use of data by Google Analytics in the future. To do this you can install Google Analytics' disable add-on for browsers. As a result, you prevent Google Analytics from storing information about your website visits. Further information and tips about downloading and installing this disable add-on can be found at tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout. You can disable Google Analytics for display advertising and adjust the displays in the Google display network by accessing the display settings: https://www.google.de/settings/ads.

**4.2     Google AdWords conversion tracking**

This website also uses Google AdWords conversion tracking, a web analysis service by Google, Inc., for improving the website and the advertising activities. The cookie for conversion tracking is set when a user clicks on an ad controlled by Google. These cookies become invalid after 30 days and are not used for personal identification. If you visit certain pages of our website within these 30 days, both we and Google in the USA can recognize that you clicked on the ad and were routed to this site. Every Google AdWords customer gets a different cookie. As a result, cookies cannot be tracked via the websites of AdWords customers. The information obtained by conversion cookies is used to generate conversion statistics for us. We learn the total number of users who clicked on our ad and were routed to our site. However, we do not receive any information by which you can be personally identified.  
If you do not want to participate in the tracking, you can simply disable the Google conversion tracking cookie in your web browser's user settings. In that case you are not included in the conversion tracking statistics. Additional setting options can be found on the web page about disabling Google ads at http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/.

**4.3    Use of A/B testing by Optimizely**

Less frequently, the BERNINA website uses the Optimizely web analysis service by Optimizely, Inc., which is used for A/B and multi-version tests. This service uses cookies to identify a user's browser and to analyze the use of this website. The cookies placed by Optimizely do not collect personal data.  
More information about how Optimizely processes your data can be found at http://www.optimizely.com/privacy. You can disable Optimizely tracking at any time by following the instructions at http://www.optimizely.com/opt_out.

**4.4   Data sent to BERNINA**

Information that you provide to BERNINA yourself as a user of the website may be used by BERNINA and companies affiliated with BERNINA in order to improve the BERNINA website and to provide individual support to the user. This also includes sending the user items such as information, offers or notifications regarding BERNINA's product range and services.

**4.5   Server location**

The personal information collected is transmitted and stored in the USA (location of the server). The information will be treated in Switzerland and in accordance with the applicable Swiss data protection regulations. However, the information may be processed outside of Switzerland by personnel working for us or for our suppliers. By providing your personal information, you consent to the transmission, storage and processing of your information in accordance with these data protection regulations.

**5.   Social media content**

BERNINA may use social media plugins, e.g. by Facebook, Google+ and Twitter, on this website. These platforms have their own privacy policies over which BERNINA has no control.  
[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/policy.php)  
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/privacy)  
[Google+](https://www.google.ch/intl/en/policies/privacy/)  
If you are logged in at a social media provider's site while simultaneously visiting our site, the possibility of the provider matching the visit to your network account cannot be ruled out. If you use the plugin functions (e.g. clicking on the "Like" button, posting a comment), this information is similarly transmitted from your browser directly to the particular social network and possibly stored there. The purpose and the extent of the collection, further processing and use of the data by the networks can be found in the privacy policy notices of Facebook, Twitter and Google.  
If the user does not want any of these plugins to be loaded, it is recommended to log out of the particular social media service. In addition, various browsers can be set or upgraded with add-ons (e.g. Facebook blocker) so that the social media plugins are not loaded.

**6.  Disclosure of information**

BERNINA and its subsidiaries and affiliates within the Group use your personal information in accordance with these data protection regulations and will not disclose it to third parties. 

Exceptions to this are if you have consented to the disclosure of information to companies not affiliated to BERNINA or if BERNINA is required by law, by a government authority or a court to do so. Another exception is if service providers are engaged to support BERNINA in data processing, administering the website or in another capacity or to provide you with products and services you have requested. These third parties are obliged to maintain the same degree of security and data protection as BERNINA.

  **7.  Children as users of the website**

A note to children and their parents: children are increasingly using the Internet. Parents should ensure that their children do not submit any personal information about themselves or their parents to BERNINA. However, if personal information is transmitted by children to BERNINA, we ask parents to contact BERNINA if they want the information to be deleted. The relevant information will then be deleted as soon as possible.

**8.  Data security**

The transmission of data over the Internet is unfortunately not absolutely secure. In order to protect your information, BERNINA only collaborates with service providers and Internet providers that take appropriate technical and organisational security measures. However, BERNINA cannot guarantee the security of the data transmitted by you as a user. Any transmission of data is undertaken at your own risk.

**9.  Your information and withdrawal rights**

You have the option of informing BERNINA at any time - for example, by email - that your information should in future no longer be used to contact you. You can also cancel your participation in particular services of the BERNINA website, such as the newsletter service, at any time.

In addition, you are also able to obtain information on the processing of information or to request a copy of your personal information that has been collected about you via our website. Please send your request in writing to  BERNINA International AG, Seestrasse 161, 8266 Steckborn, Switzerland or [info@bernina.com](mailto:info@bernina.com).

**10.  Final provisions**

If the individual provisions or parts of these Privacy Policy should prove to be invalid or ineffective, the validity of the rest of the Privacy Policy will not be affected.
