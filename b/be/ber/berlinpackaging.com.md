We collect personal information about you, such as your name, credit card information, postal address, telephone, and email address when you voluntarily provide such information to us. We may collect personal information from you when you contact us using our online contact form or if you send us an email.

We may share your information among our affiliates, subsidiaries, employees, contractors, or consultants so that they may perform their duties and so that we can provide you with our products and services.

Generally, we will not sell, distribute, publish, disclose, or share your personal information to any unaffiliated third parties without your consent. In limited situations, though, we may disclose your personal information to unaffiliated third parties: (1) who provide services on our behalf to the extent such information is necessary to deliver their services; (2) in order to comply with law or respond to a legally valid inquiry or order or search warrant; (3) as part of a corporate transaction, such as a merger, or sale of assets; (4) in order to enforce our Terms & Conditions and other agreements or policies; or (5) to otherwise protect ourselves, our employees, our customers, or members of the public.
