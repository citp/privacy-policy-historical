## Information Berklee Collects from You  
(Including Personal Information)

Berklee is an institute of higher education involved in education and community development. In order for Berklee to educate its students both in class and online and provide community services, it is essential, necessary, and Berklee has lawful bases to collect; process; use; and maintain data of its students, employees, applicants, and others involved in its educational and community programs. The lawful bases include, without limitation; admission; registration; delivery of classroom, online, and study abroad education, grades, communications, employment, development, program analysis for improvements, and records retention. Examples of data that Berklee may need to collect in connection with the lawful bases are: name; email address; IP address; physical address or other location identifier, and photos, as well as some sensitive personal data obtained with prior consent. 

Most of Berklee's collection and processing of personal data will fall under the following categories: 

  1. Processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by Berklee or third parties in providing education, employment, development, and community programs. 
  2. Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract. 
  3. Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which Berklee is subject. 
  4. The data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes. 



### Types of Personal Data Collected, and Why

Berklee collects a variety of personal and sensitive data to meet one of its lawful bases, as referenced above. Most often the data is used for academic admissions, enrollment, educational programs, job hiring, provision of medical services participation in research, development, and community outreach. Data typically includes name, address, transcripts, work history, information for payroll, research subject information, medical and health information (for student health services, or travel), and donations. If you have specific questions regarding the collection and use of your personal data, please contact our data privacy officers at [dpo@berklee.edu](mailto:dpo@berklee.edu). 

If a data subject refuses to provide personal data that is required by Berklee in connection with one of Berklee’s lawful bases to collect such personal data, such refusal may make it impossible for Berklee to provide education, employment, research or other requested services. 

###  Where Berklee Gets Personal and Sensitive Personal Data 

Berklee receives personal and sensitive personal data from multiple sources. Most often, Berklee gets this data directly from the data subject or under the direction of the data subject who has provided it to a third party (for example, application for admission to Berklee through use of the Application Portal). 

Tools may be used to monitor the effectiveness of our communications with you, including email tracking, which records when an email sent from Berklee is opened and/or how many links are clicked within the message. The data from such tracking is used in an anonymized and aggregated form. In addition, we may collect other non-personal data such as IP addresses and web pages accessed on our websites.
