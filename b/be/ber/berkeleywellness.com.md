### 5.1. Our Third Party Providers.

We transfer Personal Data to our third party service providers and business partners to perform tasks on our behalf and to assist us in providing the Site, as discussed in Section 3.2. above. We use commercially reasonable efforts to only engage or interact with third party service providers and business partners that post a privacy policy governing their processing of Personal Data.

We may transfer or assign this Privacy Policy and any Personal Data to a third party entity that acquires or is merged with as part of a merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control.

### 5.4. Social Media Plugins.

The Site uses social media plugins (e.g. Facebook) to enable you to easily share information with others. When you visit the Site, the operator of the social plugin can place a cookie on your device, enabling that operator to recognize individuals who have previously visited the Site. If you are logged into the social media website (e.g. Facebook, Twitter) while browsing the Site, the social media plugins allow that social media website to share personal information about your activities on the Site with other users of their social media website. For example, Facebook Social Plugins allow Facebook to show your Likes and comments on our pages to your Facebook friends. Facebook Social Plugins also allow you to see your friends’ Facebook activity on the Site. We do not control any of the content from the social media plugins. For more information about social plugins from other media websites you should refer to those sites’ privacy and data/information sharing statements/policies.

### 5.5. Other Disclosures.

We may disclose Personal Data about you if we have a good faith belief that disclosure of such information is helpful or reasonably necessary to: (i) comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request; (ii) enforce our terms of use, including investigations of potential violations thereof; (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud or security issues; or (iv) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Remedy, our users, or the public.

## 6\. RETENTION OF PERSONAL DATA.

We reserve the right to retain any Personal Data as long as the Personal Data are needed to: (i) fulfill the purposes that are described in Section 4 (The Purposes For Which We Use Personal Data), and (ii) comply with applicable law.

## 7\. YOUR RIGHTS.

### 7.1 Rights Relating to Personal Data.

If you have an account on the Site, we provide access to—and the ability to edit or delete—certain categories of Personal Data through the account. We also permit you to:

  * Delete all content browsing information and opt-out of further participation in data associated with the current device you use to browse the Site. To exercise this right, please visit: <https://id.verticalhealth.net/preferences/>; and

Subject to applicable law, if you would like to otherwise access, amend, correct, delete, export (e.g. data portability), object to the processing of Personal Data collected in and through the Site, or withdraw your consent (as applicable), you may submit a request to privacy@remedyhealthmedia.com or write to us at:

       Attention: Privacy Officer

       2111 Wilson Boulevard, suite 330

       Arlington, Virginia 22201

       We will promptly review all such requests in accordance with applicable laws.

Depending on where you live, you may have a right to lodge a complaint with a regulatory agency if you believe that we have violated any of the rights concerning Personal Data about you. We encourage you to first reach out to us at privacy@remedyhealthmedia.com so we have an opportunity to address your concerns directly before you do so.

### 7.2. Opting-Out of Promotional Emails.

You may choose not to receive future promotional or advertising emails from us by selecting an unsubscribe link at the bottom of each email that you receive from us, or by responding to the emails directly and requesting removal if such a link is not available. Additionally, you may send a request specifying your communications preferences to [privacy@remedyhealthmedia.com](mailto:privacy@remedyhealthmedia.com "privacy@remedyhealthmedia.com"). Please note that even if you opt out of receiving the foregoing emails, we may still send you a response to any "Contact Us" request as well as administrative, maintenance and operational emails (for example, in connection with a password reset request).

## 8\. DATA SECURITY.

The security of Personal Data is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Data submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. For example, we have implemented an information security program that contains administrative, technical and physical controls that are designed to reasonably safeguard Personal Data from unlawful use, unauthorized access, or disclosure. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect Personal Data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

## 9\. TRANSFERS OF PERSONAL DATA FROM THE EU OR SWITZERLAND TO THE UNITED STATES

Remedy complies with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework (collectively, “Privacy Shield”) as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of Personal Data from European Union (the “EU”) member countries and Switzerland. Remedy has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access, and Recourse, Enforcement, and Liability. A violation of our commitment to Privacy Shield may be investigated by the Federal Trade Commission and/or the United States Department of Commerce. If there is any conflict between the policies in this Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification page, to the extent available, please visit [https://www.privacyshield.gov](https://www.privacyshield.gov/ "Privacy Shield").

In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, Remedy commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of Personal Data about you. Persons from the EU or Switzerland who have inquiries or complaints regarding this Statement should first contact us via email at: [privacy@remedyhealthmedia.com](mailto:privacy@remedyhealthmedia.com "privacy@remedyhealthmedia.com").

Remedy has committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the EU-US Privacy Shield Principles and the EU-Switzerland Privacy Shield Principles to JAMS, an alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed, please visit <https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield> for more information and to file a complaint.

These recourse mechanisms are available at no cost to you. Damages may be awarded in accordance with applicable law. Please note that if your complaint is not resolved through these channels, under limited circumstances, a binding arbitration option may be available before a Privacy Shield Panel. Pursuant to the Privacy Shield, Remedy remains potentially liable for the transfer of Personal Data to third parties acting as our agents unless we can prove we were not a party to the events giving rise to the damages.

In cases of onward transfer to third parties of Personal Data of EU or Swiss individuals received pursuant to the EU-US and Switzerland-US Privacy Shield, Remedy is potentially liable.

## 10\. CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY.

We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change the terms of this Privacy Policy at any time. You can see when this Privacy Policy was last updated by reviewing the “Last Updated” legend on the top of this page. We may provide you with notice of material changes to the Privacy Policy as appropriate under the circumstances. UNLESS OTHERWISE INDICATED, ANY CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY WILL APPLY IMMEDIATELY UPON POSTING.

## 11\. CHILDREN’S PRIVACY.

The Site is not intended for children under the age of 18. Accordingly, we do not intend to collect Personal Data from anyone we know to be under 18 years of age.

## 12\. HOW WE RESPOND TO DO NOT TRACK SIGNALS.

As explained above in Section 3.4, the technologies used on the Site may be used to track Site users over time and across third party websites to provide targeted advertising. How browsers communicate user preferences related to the Do Not Track signal is not yet uniform so a standard technological response has not yet been developed. For this reason, the Site may not respond to Do Not Track signals at this time.

## 13\. YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS.

If you are a California resident, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits you to request information regarding the disclosure of your Personal Data by Remedy to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please send an email to [privacy@remedyhealthmedia.com](mailto:privacy@remedyhealthmedia.com "privacy@remedyhealthmedia.com") or write to us:
