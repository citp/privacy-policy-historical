# Privacy Policy | Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices

BHH Affiliates, LLC, operator of the Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices franchise network, understands that privacy is an important issue for visitors to the Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices website (www.berkshirehathawayhs.com). We designed this information to help our website visitors understand what information we gather from our website, and how we handle the information once it’s gathered. 

**Personal Information Collected on this Website**  
Information provided in a request for service or information is forwarded to a Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices franchisee or business that will respond to the request. Requests for information or service relating to buying or selling a home are forwarded to an independently owned and operated Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices franchisee able to respond to the request, along with the information provided by the website visitor. If website visitors express interest in an appointment with a Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices franchisee representative, the information the visitor provides, including information used to obtain quotes, is forwarded to the Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices franchisee representative. 

Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices franchisee representatives may contact website visitors who have submitted a request for additional information about their request. 

Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices may use information submitted in one of our online forms to ask website visitors to complete a voluntary customer satisfaction survey. For Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices to understand consumer preferences, we may combine survey response information with information about customers who recently purchased products. 

However, Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices does not rent or sell visitors' personal information to non-Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Real Estate companies.
