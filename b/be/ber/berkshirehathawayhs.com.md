### Anti-Fraud Disclosure

Electronic communications such as email, text messages and social media messaging, are neither secure nor confidential. While real estate brokerages have adopted policies and procedures to aid in avoiding fraud, even the best security protections can still be bypassed by unauthorized parties. No broker or agent will ever send you any electronic communication with instructions to transfer funds or to provide nonpublic personal information, such as credit card or debit numbers or bank account and/or routing numbers.

YOU SHOULD NEVER TRANSMIT NONPUBLIC PERSONAL INFORMATION, SUCH AS CREDIT OR DEBIT CARD NUMBERS OR BANK ACCOUNT OR ROUTING NUMBERS, BY EMAIL OR OTHER UNSECURED ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION. EMAILS ATTEMPTING TO INDUCE FRAUDULENT WIRE TRANSFERS ARE COMMON AND MAY APPEAR TO COME FROM A TRUSTED SOURCE.

If you receive any electronic communication directing you to transfer funds or provide nonpublic personal information, EVEN IF THAT ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION APPEARS TO BE FROM YOUR REAL ESTATE BROKER OR AGENT, do not respond to it and immediately contact your real estate agent by telephone or another means. DO NOT USE THE CONTACT INFORMATION DISPLAYED IN THE COMMUNICATION YOU RECEIVED. Such requests, even if they may otherwise appear to be from your real estate agent or another person connected with your property transaction, are likely part of a scheme to defraud you by stealing funds from you or using your identity to commit a crime.

To notify us of suspected fraud related to your real estate transaction, [_contact us_](https://www.berkshirehathawayhs.com/pages/contact-form?form=Terms%20of%20Use%20Question&email=webmaster@HSFranchise.com).
