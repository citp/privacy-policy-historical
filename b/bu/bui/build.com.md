# Build.com: Security & Privacy

## Our Company

Build.com is a website of Build.com, Inc. Our corporate website can be viewed here. 

Our postal address is:  
282 Convair Ave.  
Chico, CA 95973

We can be reached online through our online Customer Service center and via phone at (800) 375-3403, which is our customer service call center.

## Transaction Security

We electronically verify each transaction with the credit company, processing only those orders if the credit company so authorizes it. In the case of a suspicious or declined transaction, our company may contact you to confirm the validity and ensure your identity or cancel that order with full notification.

We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input at 128-bit strength. This is often symbolized on most web-browsers by a small padlock appearing on the bottom bar of the window and the address of the window changing from http:// to https://, meaning a secure connection. In the event that an order cannot be completed, please contact our Customer Service. If our website cannot establish a secure connection, we will not risk your confidential information (it will not be transmitted).

## Information You Give Us

We receive and store any information you enter on our Web site or give us in any other way. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing future shopping suggestions, improving our store, and fulfilling your order.

***Emails:** Email addresses we receive are used to contact you concerning inquiries before, during and after your order is placed, solely concerning your order. An exception to this is our Newsletters (more information below).

## Automatic Information

We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many Web sites, we use “cookies,” and we obtain certain types of information when your web browser accesses Build.com. A number of companies offer utilities designed to help you visit Web sites anonymously. Although we will not be able to provide you with a personalized experience at Build.com if we cannot recognize you, we want you to be aware that these tools exist.

## Cookies

Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and to provide features such as the storage of items in your Shopping Cart. The “help” portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. However, if you disable cookies, you will not be able to purchase from the Web site. We recommend that you leave them turned on or please contact our Customer Service to have your order placed.

## Emails and Newsletters

Build.com uses emails as one of our primary ways to respond and communicate with our customers. All emails sent are addressing one of the three issues: a direct response to an inquiry, communication concerning an order (receipt, shipping confirmation, etc), or a promotional newsletter if you have indicated you wish to receive offers and information about our Network Stores.

From time to time, we may notify you of special offers that consider your historic purchasing activity with us. We do not share or otherwise sell your contact information to unrelated third parties.

Upon signing up to receive our promotional emails, you will periodically receive emails with specials and discounts, updates about our Network Stores, and information about the lines and products featured on our sites.

If you wish to stop receiving our promotional emails, you’ll find clear and easy unsubscribe instructions in each email. You may also change your subscription status at any time either by logging into your account and editing your “Change Billing Info” or by sending an email to newsletters@Build.com. Lastly, if you wish to reach us by phone, representatives in our call center can also alter your subscription preferences.

## Sharing Information

Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others.

## Conditions of Use, Notices, and Revisions

If you choose to visit Build.com, your visit and any dispute over privacy is subject to this notice and our Conditions of Use, including limitations on damages, arbitration of disputes, and application of the law of the state of California. If you have any concern about privacy at Build.com, please send a thorough description to our Customer Service team and we will try to resolve it. Our business changes constantly. This Notice and the Conditions of Use will change also, and use of information that we gather now is subject to the Privacy Notice in effect at the time of use. Please check our website frequently to see recent changes.
