## DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

Information about our customers is an important aspect of our business. BuildDirect undertakes to treat this information with integrity and does not and will not sell, or disclose your information unless for business purposes or as required by law. We will use contractual or other arrangements to protect information disclosed to third parties, who perform services on our behalf. These third parties include, but are not limited to, delivery service providers who ship and deliver your online orders. By providing information to us, you are consenting to the transfer of your personal information outside of Canada.

### BuildDirect may disclose your personal information:

  * when the services we are providing to you require us to give information to third parties, for example: providing government-assigned identification numbers to customs brokers or other third parties responsible for processing customs clearance for shipments
  * if we engage a third party to provide services to us (such as payroll processing for employees, computer back-up services, archival file storage, customer relationship management, advertising distribution, behavior tracking, marketing animation, delivering orders, processing credit card payments ) and the third party is bound by confidentiality obligations 
  * we may have to share information with vendors and manufacturers to respond to your feedback, comments or reviews
  * where it is necessary to collect a debt owed to BuildDirect or its agents, or to pay a debt owed by BuildDirect
  * to protect us if we suspect fraud we may disclose your information as part of an investigation
  * to respond to an emergency where the health or safety of any individual is reasonably believed to be threatened
  * if the information is already publicly known; and when we are required or authorized by law to do so
  * or in other circumstances where you have consented to the disclosure
  * we may collect, use and disclose Information without your consent when we are required or authorized by law to do so.



## HOW BUILDDIRECT SECURES YOUR INFORMATION 

BuildDirect takes all reasonable steps to ensure that your Information is kept safe from loss, unauthorized access, modification or disclosure.

### The steps we take to protect your information include:

  * Use of secure socket layer (SSL) to encrypt credit card transactions 
  * Use of authentication to access your account
  * Periodical reviewing of security measures.



Beyond the implementation of conscientious information protection best practices, you should be aware that Internet communications are not absolutely private or confidential. Ultimately, you are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any Personal Information in your possession. Note that certain parts of the site services such as blog and learning center posts are public and your comments may be viewed by other users and site visitors.

## ACCESS TO YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

### Withdrawing Consent 

Individuals have the right to withdraw their consent to the collection, use, or disclosure of information at any time, except where that withdrawal would frustrate the performance of a legal obligation by BuildDirect.

### Accessing or Correcting Your Information

Individuals have the right to know what Information BuildDirect has collected about them, how that information is being used and to whom it has been disclosed, as well as to verify and amend that information if it is incorrect. If necessary, BuildDirect will correct the Information if requested to do so.

### Removing Information stored by BuildDirect

Upon reasonable written notice given to BuildDirect, all Information held by BuildDirect that is identifiable to that individual will be removed from our records and confirmation of that removal will be provided to the individual. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you withdraw consent, BuildDirect nonetheless reserves the right to retain, collect, use and disclose information without your consent where we are permitted by law to do so.

### Denial of Access to Information

Your right to access your Information is not absolute. We may deny access when:

  * denial of access is required or authorized by law;
  * granting you access would have an unreasonable impact on other people’s privacy
  * protecting our firm’s rights and property
  * the request is deemed to be frivolous or vexatious.



If we deny your request for access to, or refuse a request to correct your Information, we will explain why.

### Unsubscribing from marketing and promotional material 

From time to time, BuildDirect may engage a third-party marketing agency to distribute advertisements to consumers who have expressed an interest in receiving such material. For this purpose, the marketing agency may use its own distribution list. This list is not under BuildDirect’s control and may not be shared with BuildDirect. In relaying an opt-out request to a third-party marketing agency, BuildDirect therefore accepts no responsibility for any consequences to the requester arising from the actions of the agency. 

You may wish to opt out of receiving certain information or marketing and promotional material distributed directly by BuildDirect. You may do so by selecting the opt-out or unsubscribe feature in our online communications including our online newsletter and product updates or through the following link: [https://app.svwps.com/builddirect/builddirect/unsub/unsub.html ](https://app.svwps.com/builddirect/builddirect/unsub/unsub.html)
