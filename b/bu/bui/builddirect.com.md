## DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

Information about our customers is an important aspect of our business.

We will implement appropriate technical and organizational measures (including contractual or other arrangements) to protect information disclosed to third parties, who perform services on our behalf. These third parties include, but are not limited to, delivery service providers who ship and deliver your online orders and technology service providers who provide services in support of BuildDirect’s business.

Your personal information may be stored and processed in any country where we have facilities or in which we engage third party service providers. By using the Site and/or providing personal information to us, you consent to the transfer of information to countries outside your country of residence, which may have different data protection rules than in your country. While such information is outside of Canada, it is subject to the laws of the country in which it is held, and may be subject to disclosure to the governments, courts or law enforcement or regulatory agencies of such other country, pursuant to the laws of such country. However, our practices regarding your personal information will at all times continue to be governed by this Privacy Policy and, if applicable, we will comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) requirements providing adequate protection for the transfer of personal information from the EU/EEA to third country.

### BuildDirect may disclose your personal information:

  * when the services we are providing to you require us to give information to third parties, for example: providing government-assigned identification numbers to customs brokers or other third parties responsible for processing customs clearance for shipments;
  * if we engage a third party to provide services to us (such as payroll processing for employees, computer back-up services, archival file storage, customer relationship management, advertising distribution, behavior tracking, marketing animation, delivering orders, processing credit card payments ) and the third party is bound by confidentiality obligations;
  * with vendors and manufacturers to respond to your feedback, comments, reviews and/or claims;
  * where it is necessary to collect a debt owed to BuildDirect or its agents, or to pay a debt owed by BuildDirect;
  * as part of an investigation to protect us if we suspect fraud;
  * to respond to an emergency where the health or safety of any individual is reasonably believed to be threatened;
  * if the information is already publicly known;
  * when we are required or authorized by law to do so; and/or
  * in other circumstances where you have consented to the disclosure.



### We may collect, use and disclose information without your consent when we are required or authorized by law to do so.

## HOW BUILDDIRECT SECURES YOUR INFORMATION 

BuildDirect takes all reasonable steps to ensure that your information is kept safe from loss, unauthorized access, modification or disclosure.

### The steps we take to protect your information include:

  * Premises security
  * Restricted file access to your information
  * Deploying technological safeguards like encryption, access control, and firewalls to protect against hacking or unauthorized computer access
  * Use of secure socket layer (SSL) to encrypt credit card transactions 
  * Use of authentication to access your account
  * Periodical reviewing of security measures.



Beyond the implementation of conscientious information protection best practices, you should be aware that Internet communications are not absolutely private or confidential. Ultimately, you are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any personal information in your possession. If you believe your personal information has been compromised, please contact us as set forth in the “Governance” section of this Privacy Policy. If we learn of a security systems breach, we will inform you and the authorities of the occurrence of the breach in accordance with applicable law. Note that certain parts of the Site services including but not limited to blog and learning center posts are public and your comments may be viewed by other users and Site visitors.

## RIGHTS REGARDING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

### Withdrawing Consent 

Individuals have the right to withdraw their consent to the collection, use, or disclosure of information at any time, except where that withdrawal would frustrate the performance of a legal obligation by BuildDirect.

### Accessing or Correcting Your Information

Individuals have the right to know what Information BuildDirect has collected about them, how that information is being used and to whom it has been disclosed, as well as to verify and amend that information if it is incorrect.

### Other Provisions Under the GDPR

Under the GDPR, you may be entitled to additional rights, including: (i) the right to object to unlawful data processing, under certain conditions; (ii) the right to demand that we restrict processing of your personal information, under certain conditions, if you believe we have exceeded the legitimate basis for processing, processing is no longer necessary, or believe your personal information is inaccurate; (iii) the right to data portability of personal information that you provided us in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format, under certain conditions; (iv) the right object to decisions being taken by automated means which produce legal effects concerning you or similarly significantly affect you, under certain conditions; (v) the right to lodge a complaint with data protection authorities.

### Unsubscribing from Marketing and Promotional Material

From time to time, BuildDirect may engage a third-party marketing agency to distribute advertisements to consumers who have expressed an interest in receiving such material. For this purpose, the marketing agency may use its own distribution list. This list is not under BuildDirect’s control and may not be shared with BuildDirect. In relaying an opt-out request to a third-party marketing agency, BuildDirect therefore accepts no responsibility for any consequences to the requester arising from the actions of the agency.
