In order to use some of our Services, You will need to register and create, or otherwise accept, a user account (“User Account”). Note that when You log into a User Account, You are agreeing to be bound by this Privacy Policy and the Terms and Conditions, and are also “accepting” Your User Account.

Your information may be collected by COMPANY or by a third party, such as a co-sponsor or a vendor involved in, or providing services in connection with, a Special Promotion, or an e-commerce partner in the case of a Purchase.

If You make a Purchase or enter a sweepstakes or other Special Promotion on one of our sites or through our Services, COMPANY will collect Your personally identifiable information, and You are deemed to consent to us providing Your information to third parties who provide certain services such as processing of credit card transactions, customer service, promotion or sweepstakes administration, order fulfillment and/or prize delivery, as applicable. (As more fully described below in Section XII, these third parties are generally prohibited from using this information for their own marketing purposes and/or from sharing, selling, or otherwise distributing any personal data of our customers, unless You choose to opt in for such additional uses and/or disclosure by the third parties, under their respective privacy policies.). Also, by entering a sweepstakes or other Special Promotion, You are agreeing to the official rules that govern that sweepstakes or other Special Promotion, which may contain specific provisions applicable to You, including, except where prohibited by law, allowing the sponsor(s) of the promotion to use Your name, voice or likeness in advertising or marketing associated with the promotion.

If You make a purchase or enter a promotion (such as a sweepstakes) in which COMPANY is participating on a third party’s website (or through some other means or medium), we will collect Your information from the third party only if You opt-in to receive additional communications from us, or we are required to fulfill some function in relation to Your activity (e.g., to send Your order or deliver a prize).

If You submit to the Website a comment, photograph or other content to be published, online or offline (including on-air, in a DVD, or any other format), we may publish Your name or other personally identifiable information in connection with publishing the content and You are hereby deemed to give us permission to do such.

**VI. Information Collected by Other Means or Media**

In some situations, we may also collect personally identifiable information and other information about You through other means, directly or indirectly. For example, if You access any COMPANY content, or purchase such content via Your wireless carrier or through another third party, COMPANY may collect information directly from You or through the third party. Likewise, if You use our software, or provide information to other companies who share information about their customers, we may collect additional information about You. In each of these cases, COMPANY will apply this Privacy Policy to any personally identifiable information.

**VII. Information About Other People**

Some COMPANY Websites and Services may ask You to submit personally identifiable, as well as other information about other people and/or their affiliated companies.

Such information may be used to facilitate transactions among Users, COMPANY, and third parties.

You are hereby accepting and agreeing to such use and sharing of information.

**VIII. Customer Service**

Some Services may offer support and technical assistance through customer service centers via telephone, online chat, or e-mail. Whenever You communicate with customer service, You do so with the understanding that an operator may view and make changes to the information in Your User Account in order to provide the assistance that You need.

**IX. Non-Personally Identifiable Information That We Collect**

Web beacons can be very small and invisible to the user, but, in general, any electronic image viewed as part of a web page or e-mail, including HTML based content, can act as a web beacon. COMPANY may use web beacons to count visitors to the web pages on the Website or to monitor how our users navigate the Website, and COMPANY may include web beacons in e-mail messages in order to count how many messages sent were actually opened, acted upon or forwarded.
