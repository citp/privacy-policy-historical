your concerns with regard to how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will use and share information about you carefully and sensibly. This Privacy Policy describes what information we collect about you, how we collect it, how we use it, with whom we may share it, and what choices you have regarding it. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and is a part of the <a href="http://www.builtinchicago.org/terms-use">Terms of Use</a> of our Website (the “Site”). &nbsp;The services provided on the Site are referred to as “Services”. We encourage you to become familiar with this Privacy Policy and our <a href="http://www.builtinchicago.org/terms-use">Terms of Use</a>. By accessing and using the Site, you agree that you have read and understand this Privacy Policy and that you accept and consent to the privacy practices (and any uses and disclosures of information about you) that are described in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy may change from time to time. Your continued use of the Site after we make changes is deemed to be acceptance of those changes, so please check the Privacy Policy periodically for updates.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">This Privacy Policy applies only to information collected at this Site. It does not apply to any other websites. &nbsp;For instance, if you click “Apply Now” on a job posting on the Site, we may redirect you to such employer’s career site to submit a resume or application. &nbsp;Information collected through such third party sites is not subject to this Privacy Policy, but instead is subject to such third party service provider’s privacy policy. &nbsp;We encourage you to seek out and read the privacy policy of each website that you visit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What information do we collect, and how do we collect it?</p><p dir="ltr">We refer to information that can personally identify you, such as your name, address and email address as “Personal Information”. While you may browse the Site without providing Personal Information, when you create an account and otherwise use the Services, you will provide certain Personal Information, such as your name, email address, username and password, work and educational history, and other information that populates your online profile. &nbsp;We and our third party service providers (“Contractors”) may use the Personal Information you provide to us to search for publicly available information (such as your business expertise, skills, current and past job titles, education, activity on other publicly available websites, and your city location) to create an enhanced profile that is available on the Site to a limited number of users. If you choose to login to the Site with a third-party social media site such as Facebook or Google, we may collect Personal Information from such third party social media site, in which case we will ask for your consent prior to your logging in to the Site using your social media account.</p><p dir="ltr">We use your Personal Information to provide the Site and Services to you, including, but not limited to maintaining your profile page, supplementing your profile page with publicly available information, contacting you to deliver information that we believe is targeted to your interests, informing you of any relevant job postings that may be of interest to you based upon your expressed interests and Usage Information related to you, to manage your participation in events, and to otherwise provide any additional and new services that may be of interest to you. Except as specifically stated in this Privacy Policy, we do not disclose your Personal Information to third parties. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, we may collect and display information that does not personally identify you. This includes, but is not limited to, information about general industry trends, job availability and skills needed for these jobs, salary trends, and other information related to job seeking, recruiting and branding, all of which are provided to best deliver Services to you (“Aggregate Information”).</p><p dir="ltr">As with many other websites, Built In and its Contractors may also collect certain non-personal statistical information pertaining to you and the equipment and communications method that you use to access the Internet and our Site.
