# Privacy Policy | About ~ Build a Joomla Website

We respect your privacy and we are committed to ensuring that best practices are used throughout our website.

## Browsing our site

Just about every website collects data every time you visit. This includes information such as which pages you visit, how long you stay, which country where you're currently browsing, which web browser you use and so on. One or more "cookies" are stored in your web browser that are used to track your "session". This information helps website owners better understand their visitors and can be used to improve the website. Only generic data is collected. No personal details such as names or addresses are able to be collected while browsing a site anonymously.

We collect this data using Google Analytics.

## Purchasing our tutorials

When you purchase access to our online tutorials, we need to collect personal information such as your name and address. We store these details in our database, which is on our own server that only ourselves and our upstream provider can access.

We absolutely, positively never sell, rent or otherwise disclose your details to any third party organisation, except to our payment processor as is required to fulfil your transaction.

#### Credit Card details

We never get to see your credit card details and as such we can't store that information.

## Communication

If you purchase our tutorials, we will send you one or more emails to confirm your transaction. These are one-time emails.

In addition, we send you follow-up emails that may include information and offers directly relating to the product you purchased. You're welcome to opt-out of these emails using the unsubscribe link that appears at the top and bottom of each email. This is a single click unsubscribe and you don't have to jump through any hoops to be removed from the list.

## Contact

If you have any questions or concerns regarding your privacy, please [contact us](http://www.buildajoomlawebsite.com/contact-us).
