the
provision of goods and services to you. We also process your personal

aggregate to assess how people have moved through an event.

site.&nbsp; A cookie may be a session cookie, that is, a cookie
that remains on your browser while you are logged on to a particular

a persistent cookie, a cookie that remains on your browser over a
period of time.&nbsp; Information from a cookie may be collected

individual profile or record.&nbsp; That individual record may
either be unique but anonymous, or the profile can be linked with

to understand how our web sites are used and improve their usefulness
to our audiences.</li><li>

but anonymous basis. These cookies may, for example, remember
your language preferences or recognize an individual’s activity within
a single session.</li><li>
If you register for a site, we use a
cookie to associate your presence with a specific user name and
password or account.&nbsp;We may use a persistent cookie to
recognize you automatically each time you return, but only if you ask
us to do so. We may also use cookies to prepopulate your
login or forms you fill out on the site with information you have
already provided. Finally, we may use certain demographic
information to enable third party ad servers (see below) to show you
ads based on information about you in your business capacity, for
example, your title within a company or the size of that company.</li><li>
Some of sites may also allow third
party ad servers to serve their own cookies to display advertising on
our web sites. We do not determine, control or have access to their
cookies.&nbsp; In addition, some of the ads they serve may generate
their own cookies.&nbsp; For more information on our cookie policy,
