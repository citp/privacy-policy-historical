# Privacy Policy | BUOYWEATHER.COM

## OUR PROMISE

Surfline\Wavetrak, Inc. ("Buoyweather", "we", "our", or "us") respects your privacy and strives to earn and keep your trust. 

This Privacy Policy applies to information we collect from all sources, including without limitation in connection with our websites, mobile sites, applications, widgets, and electronic newsletters or communications (collectively the "Services") that link to this Privacy Policy. 

Questions regarding this policy and our practice should be directed to [Buoyweather Support](https://web.archive.org/web/20181223065101id_/http%3A//www.buoyweather.com/Support@buoyweather.com), by e-mail to Support@Buoyweather.com, or by postal mail to Buoyweather, 300 Pacific Coast Highway, Suite 310, Huntington Beach, CA 92648.

**Privacy Policy**  
This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to our [Terms of Use](http://www.buoyweather.com/info.jsp?id=21738) ("Terms"). It tells you what information we collect, how we protect it and what choices you have about how that information is used. Most information collected is to enable us to best meet the needs of our users, as action sports participants, in a highly customized and responsive manner, however we may also use collected information for business reasons, such as analytics, evaluation of the Services, improvement of the Services, and other uses set forth herein.

Any capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meaning provided for such terms in the Terms.

**Children's Privacy**  
Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, Buoyweather does not knowingly collect or maintain personal information from persons under 13 years-of-age. If Buoyweather learns that personal information of persons under 13-years-of-age has been collected on or through the Services, Buoyweather will take the appropriate steps to delete this information. If you are the parent or legal guardian of a child under 13 who has become a registered user or subscriber of Buoyweather or any of the Services or otherwise set up an Account, then please contact Buoyweather at [Buoyweather Support](https://web.archive.org/web/20181223065101id_/http%3A//www.buoyweather.com/Support@buoyweather.com) to have that child's account terminated and personal information deleted.

**Public Forum Discussions and Comments**  
Please note that any information that you reveal in a public forum (such as a bulletin board or comments) will be seen by third parties not related to Buoyweather and is therefore not subject to this privacy policy. All such information may be disclosed, used, or reproduced by Buoyweather in accordance with our Terms.

## SECTION 3 - SECURITY

We use encryption and authentication tools to protect the security of personal information that you share with us. However, no data transmission over the internet (or, with respect to our mobile services, over cellular phone networks) can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect Personal information, we cannot and do not guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit to or from the Service, and you do so at your own risk.

Except as set forth herein, we restrict access to your personal information such that those Buoyweather employees, contractors, and agents who need to know such personal information in order to operate, develop or improve our Services or otherwise fulfill their obligations to us are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, we will have no obligation for the security, privacy, or confidentiality of any information which: 

  1. Is submitted to a third party as authorized under the terms of this Privacy Policy.
  2. You provide, directly or indirectly, to a third party, including without limitation through use of the Services of such third party, including without limitation through loading or clicking on any advertisements, accessing any information hosted by a third party, or otherwise submitting any information directly to such third party.

You will ensure that you run proper anti-virus software, firewalls, anti-malware software, and enact any other necessary security measures to prevent the unauthorized access or use of the Credentials or the Services, or the capture of any personal or other information from you as a result of any keyloggers, virus, trojan, or other objectionable software.

We have no obligation with respect to any User Content you submit, including without limitation user comments, photographs, videos, and other media, and all such User Content will be shared or publicly available in accordance with the functionality of the Services. If you provide any User Content which contains personal information, location information, or other information, you are agreeing that such information may be made public and disclosed to all users of the Services. 

  


## SECTION 4 - YOUR PRIVACY CHOICES

If you would like to opt out from our sharing of your personal Information with unaffiliated third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes you may do so exclusively through the following methods: (a) using an unsubscribe link in a communication from us; (b) by adjusting your settings in your Account through our website; or (c) contacting support at support@Buoyweather.com and requesting that we opt you out of such sharing. We may ask you to provide additional information for identity verification purposes, or to verify that you are in possession of an applicable email account. If you have signed up to receive our e-mails and prefer not to receive marketing information from this Service, follow the "unsubscribe" instructions provided on any marketing e-mail you receive from this Service. 

Any unsubscription or opt-out from our sharing of your personal information or communications in accordance with this Privacy Policy will be effective after we have received your request, verified your identity (if applicable), and had a reasonable time to implement your request.

California Residents -- Your California Privacy Rights  
California's "Shine the Light" law, Civil Code section 1798.83, requires certain businesses to respond to requests from California customers asking about the business' practices related to disclosing personal information to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. Alternately, businesses may have in place a policy not to disclose personal information of customers to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes if the customer has exercised an option to opt-out of such information-sharing. We have such a policy in place.

As discussed above in Your Privacy Choices, if you wish to opt-out of our sharing of your personal Information with third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes or to find out more about your opt-out rights, please contact Buoyweather support as described above.

Some of our Services contain links to other sites whose information practices may be different than ours. Visitors should consult the other sites' privacy notices as we have no control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties. Buoyweather Services covered by this privacy statement sometimes may offer content (e.g., contests, sweepstakes, or promotions) that is sponsored by or co-branded with identified third parties. By virtue of these relationships, the third parties may obtain personally identifiable information that visitors voluntarily submit to participate in the site activity. We have no control over these third parties' use of this information. The site will notify you (in its privacy policy or elsewhere) at the time of requesting personally identifiable information if these third parties will obtain such information.

We also use the services of reputable third parties to provide us with data collection, reporting and web analytics, as well as to assist with delivery of relevant content, marketing messages and advertisements. These third parties may view, edit or set their own cookies. We, our third party service providers, advertisers and/or partners may also place web beacons for these third parties. The use of these technologies by these third parties is subject to their own privacy policies and is not covered by this privacy statement. We will have no obligation or responsibility with respect to any information collected by a third party. For more information on how our sites may use third-party ad servers and your ability to opt-out of targeted advertising from such third party ad servers, please see the section below on "Third Party Ad Servers".

Any information linked to on a third party website or domain, or embedded in the Services but hosed on a third party domain, belongs to such third party and any information submitted or collected as a result of the access or use thereof is subject to the privacy policy of such third party.

## INTERNATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS

We are headquartered in the United States and any information that you submit or we otherwise obtain will be transferred to, collected, and held in the United States.

## DO NOT TRACK DISCLOSURE

Some browsers or other tools include "Do Not Track" (DNT) features which, when turned on, send a signal to websites you visit indicating that you do not wish to be tracked across websites over time. The Worldwide Web Consortium (W3C) has been working with industry groups and regulators to develop a DNT browser technology standard to provide a common understanding as to how to interpret the DNT signals, but to date no standard has been adopted. Since there is no standard at this time, Buoyweather does not currently respond to DNT signals. 

  


## CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY

Buoyweather may change this Privacy Policy at any time by posting revisions to our site. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent, and we expect most such changes will be minor. In the event that any changes are made to use of your Personal information, you will be informed via e-mail, and will afford you the opportunity to opt-out of any further use. Your use of the site constitutes acceptance of the provisions of this Privacy Policy and your continued usage after such changes are posted constitutes acceptance of each revised Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy or any revised policy, please exit the site immediately.

_This Privacy Policy was last updated on March 22, 2018._
