#### Privacy policy

This is our privacy policy. If you want to learn about our privacy features, please [read about them in our FAQ.](https://web.archive.org/web/20100612073050id_/http%3A//bu.mp/faq "Bump Frequently Asked Questions")

  1. We do not collect or store any of the contact information that users enter and transfer to other users using Bumptm.
  2. We will take appropriate measures to protect your data through security techniques like encryption (see our FAQ for more details).
  3. We will not share your contact information with anyone you have not authorized (such as by confirming a contact exchange using Bumptm).
  4. We will never sell, rent, or share your personal information with anyone.
  5. We may share information about user behavior in the aggregate only. For example, we could publish a map of "where in the world are people Bumping?"
  6. We won't spam you or any of your contacts, ever. Although we do have features so that you can "tell a friend" about us, these messages will not be sent by us or our server.
  7. In the future, we may develop features that require modification of this privacy policy. In that event, we will notify active users by sending a message to the Bumptm application and posting a message to our blog (we don't save your contact information so we cannot contact you directly).



By using Bumptm, you are agreeing to the limited use of your personal information as described below. We will notify all active users of any significant changes to this policy by sending a message to the Bumptm application and posting a message to our blog (we don't save your contact information so we cannot contact you directly).

Your privacy and security are really important to us. If you have any concerns that aren't covered here, please email us at privacy@bumptechnologies.com.

#### What information does Bump Technologies collect?

We collect aggregate anonymous usage data to help our engineers improve the service. Examples of this include how often users use the app, geographic distribution of users, and server load information (ex, number of bumps per second worldwide). All of this data is used in aggregate and contains no personal information entered by the user.
