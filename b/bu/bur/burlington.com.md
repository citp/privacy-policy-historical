the information you submit to us generally remains private, and is used only for the

Information Gathered By the Company
In general, except for information obtained from users seeking employment with the
Company, we gather information about all of our users collectively, and not on an
individual basis, for purposes such as determining which parts of our Web Site areas
users access most frequently. This information helps us determine which parts of our
Web Site are most beneficial for users, and how we can continually create a better overall
experience for you. We use such data in the aggregate and anonymously. We may share
this information within the Company so that we may understand how the Company’s

others. The use of information gathered from users seeking employment with the
Company is discussed below (under “Resumes”).

telephone number or other pertinent information. If you give us permission, we may use
that information to make you aware of additional products and services, which may be of
interest to you, or to contact you regarding changes in our Web Site. From time to time,
we also may ask you for other information, such as information on your interests, your

We do not disclose information about your individual visits to our Web Site, or personal

number, etc., to any persons or firms, except when we believe the law requires it;
however, as indicated above, we may record and share aggregated information with our
business partners.
Online Order Security
When you place an order online, your personal details and credit card information are
scrambled using SSL encryption technology before being sent over the Internet. Although
we cannot guarantee encryption or the privacy of your personal details and credit card
information, SSL makes it very difficult for your information to be stolen or intercepted
while being transferred.
Cookies
To enhance your experience on our Web Site, we use a feature on your Internet browser
called a "cookie". Cookies are small files that your Web browser places on your
computer's hard drive. They are used for a variety of reasons, such as remembering user
names and passwords and preferences, tracking click streams, and for load balancing. By
using cookies, we can deliver faster service, consistent, updated results, and a more
personalized experience on our Web Site. Your browser gives you the option to reject
cookies. However, setting your browser to reject cookies generally hinders the browser’s
performance and will adversely affect your experience while using our Web Site.
Resumes
If you are at least eighteen (18) years old and seeking employment with the Company,
our Web Site can assist you with submitting your resume to us during times when we
have an open position. Information that you submit to us is encrypted using SSL
encryption technology, but we cannot guarantee that third parties will not intercept the
transmission and gain access to such information. Once we receive this information, we
will use reasonable efforts to assure that this information is not shared with persons
outside of the Company, except in circumstances where we believe that disclosure is
required by law. If you are under 18 years of age and seeking an internship with the
Company, we ask that you obtain your parents permission before sharing any of your
personal information with us.


Changes to our Privacy Policy
From time to time, we may change our Privacy Policy. If we decide to change our
Privacy Policy, we will post those changes on our site so that you will always know what
information we gather, how we might use that information, and whether we will disclose
it to anyone. If, at any time, you have questions or concerns about the Company’
commitment to privacy, please feel FAX us as follows: International Textile Group
