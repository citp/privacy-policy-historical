Information gathered automatically is used for only two purposes: site management and, in the case of suspected unauthorised activity, law enforcement and possible criminal prosecution (See the Security Notice under “Terms of Use”).

The Bureau Veritas websites automatically log visitor information from which summary statistics are created. 

We use summary statistics to help us make our site more useful to visitors, such as assessing what information is of most and least interest to visitors, and for other purposes such as determining the site's technical design specifications and identifying system performance or problem areas.

The following are representative of the types of information automatically collected and stored about your visit:

·        the Internet domain and Internet Protocol (IP) address from which you access our website 

·        the type of Internet browser and the operating system of the computer you use to access our site

·            the date and time you visit our site 

·        the pages you visit our site

Unless you indicate otherwise, we collect your information only for the purpose of answering your question or dealing with your comment and to enable Bureau Veritas to contact you with regard to the services on our site for which you have expressed interest.

 **Security  
** This website takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and offline. All of our users' information is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices.

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100 % secure. Accordingly, despite our efforts to protect your personal information Bureau Veritas cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, or to or from our online products or services. You transmit all such information at your own risk. However, once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.

Bureau Veritas' policy does not extend to anything that is inherent in the operation of the Internet, and therefore beyond Bureau Veritas' control, and is not to be applied in any manner contrary to applicable law or governmental regulation.

 **Notification of Changes**  
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an e-mail. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
