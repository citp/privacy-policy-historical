Our Privacy Policy

We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it. We will never sell or rent your personal information (i.e. name, address, telephone number, billing and payment information, and email address) with any third party unless you give us your express permission. We will share your information for business purposes, such as to fulfill your order, verify your credit card information, protect you from fraud, as well as to better serve you and improve our website. This may involve a third party such as an address verification service or banking institution. In certain circumstances, we may share your information in response to valid legal processes or if it is required by law.

Links to Other Sites

In some areas of our website, we may provide a link to another website. Other websites have their own policies regarding privacy and security, and these may vary from ours.

The Collection and Use of Personal Information

We collect personal information from you when you use our website, such as when you place an order or create a registry. To protect your account, you may be asked to confirm some of your personal information if you have a question about an order. If you give us your personal information in the course of a sales transaction, registry creation, in response to a customer survey, or during other interactions with our website, we will retain this information.

Updating your Personal Information

Any time you wish to change your personal information, go to "My Account" at the top of any page.

Protecting your Information

Log out when you are done on the website to protect yourself against unauthorized access to your account. To log out at any time, click the "Log Out" link.

Keep your password safe - do not share it with anyone.

Emails from Us

If you choose to join our mailing list when you place an order, we may periodically send you emails or other marketing communications informing you of promotions and offers. You may opt-out of receiving these communications at any time by changing your preferences on the "Account Information" page in "My Account". If you opt-out, you will still continue to receive order and registry information, answers to customer service questions, and information about changes in our website that might be relevant to you personally.

Children Under 13 Years of Age

It is not our intent to collect personal information about children under the age of 13. A child who is 13 but not yet 18 years of age may use this website only if a parent or legal guardian agrees to be bound by the website's [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/web/20060616205108id_/http%3A//www.burlingtoncoatfactory.com/IWStoreBCF.process?tem=termsofuse.tem) on the child's behalf. Children under 13 years of age may not use this website.

Cookies and other Computer Information

When you use our website, we place a "cookie" (a small text file) on your computer to identify you. Like many other websites, we use cookies to identify you to provide a more convenient shopping experience. If you wish, you can visit our website without cookies, but then certain features, including adding items to a shopping cart, making a purchase, or using a registry, will not be available.

We have carefully selected a web analytics company to help us collect information through the use of cookies to understand how our customers use our website, but we do not permit this company to collect personal information, such as, credit card, username, or password information. Any information that is collected for us is returned to us through a secure web connection. Any data collected or analysis performed is kept confidential. When you visit our website, you can choose to remain anonymous.. In order to find out about the different levels of privacy and confidentiality available, please click here.

Security Notice

The security of your personal information is very important to us. In our efforts to protect your online transactions, we use a technology called Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). If your browser is capable of SSL (and most are), your personal information will be automatically encrypted, or encoded, before it is sent over the Internet.

BurlingtonCoatFactory.com and BabyDepot.com have digital certificates from Verisign, Inc., a well-known provider of Internet trust services. If you enter any protected part of the website where your personal information is needed, a "closed lock" or other icon will appear in the bottom of the page. Site security information can be seen if you click on this icon. This icon alerts you that your personal information is being encrypted when it is transmitted to BurlingtonCoatFactory.com or Baby Depot.com. Additionally, on all protected pages of our website, the address will begin with https://.

We will never send your credit card information via email. 

Notices and Changes

Because our business changes all the time, so does our Privacy Policy and our Security Notice. Please check our website for changes. If you have questions or concerns with respect to our Privacy Policy or our Security Notice, please feel free to [contact us](http://wwwsrc.coat.com/contact/contactus_online_form.shtml?Problem=Other&Subject=Other+questions+and+comments&submit.x=16&submit.y=6).
