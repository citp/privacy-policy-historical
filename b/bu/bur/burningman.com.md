# Burning Man :: Privacy Policy

**WHAT THIS POLICY COVERS**  
This policy covers how we treat personal information that we receive when you use the burningman.com site.

"Personal information" is information that can be linked to you as an individual, like your name, address, e-mail address, or phone number. By visiting this web site, you are accepting the practices described in this privacy policy.

**INFORMATION YOU KNOWINGLY GIVE TO US**  
We receive and may store any personal information you actively send us or enter on our web site. You provide such information when you register for the ePlaya community boards; register as an Image Gallery or Playa Artifacts contributor; fill out an online registration or other form; submit images, contribute to Tales from the Playa, or ePlaya discussions; sign up for our mailing lists or newsletter distribution lists; or send us e-mails. You also enter personal information when you purchase tickets to the Burning Man event or other items on line at our web site. Other information you enter, such as your terms and survey responses, are only compiled statistically and are not recorded permanently or in a personally identifiable way.

**INFORMATION THAT IS AUTOMATICALLY COLLECTED BY OUR SYSTEM**  
We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us through the internet.

We use a cookie to store your login ID and password and to synchronize your responses to one questionnaire with other relevant questionnaires. A cookie is an alphanumeric identifier that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your web browser to allow our system to recognize your browser and to provide you certain browsing convenience. You can configure your browser to reject cookies, but if you do so, you might not be able to experience all the interactive features of our web site.

In addition, like many other web sites, we automatically log certain technical information about your visit, like IP (internet protocol) addresses, Browser type, ISP (internet service provider), referring and exit pages. We compile and analyze this information statistically and diagnostically in order to administer the web site, analyze usage trends, and keep up the site's technical performances. This information may also help us understand our user base demographically, but we do not use this information to identify individual users.

**WHAT WE DO WITH YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION**  
We use the personal information that we receive to operate the web site and produce the Burning Man event. We do not rent, sell, or share your personal information with any other entity, except when:  


  * We have your permission; or
  * We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process; or when we must exercise our legal rights, protect our property, defend against legal claims, or otherwise comply with the law, or
  * We believe it is appropriate in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected illegal activities, fraud, threats to personal safety, or violation of this web site's terms of use.
  * When you order tickets to the Burning Man event and other items on line at this web site, your order is processed in collaboration with In Ticketing, a separate company. The information you submit in connection with your online ticket order is governed by [In Ticketing's privacy policy](http://tickets.burningman.com/info.php?i=910).
  * Burning Man and/ or the Black Rock Arts Foundation may at times contact you at your email address to keep you informed about their local events and other Burning Man related opportunities. Should you not want to receive such information, you will find details about how to opt out the first time you are contacted.



In the unlikely event that Burning Man is acquired or transferred, or changes entity status, the personal information will be among the transferred assets but will remain subject to any existing privacy policy.

**CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY**  
The only people who have access to personal information collected on this web site are employees who have a need to know and who are bound by nondisclosure agreements and this privacy policy. We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect the personal information that we store.

However, whenever you submit expressive content to the Image Gallery, Playa Artifacts, Tales from the Playa, or ePlaya, you understand that the submission will be made public on the web site, and that such submission may contain personal information. We are not responsible for the personal information that you or others choose to post in this manner. You may be identified as the author of any posted expressive content unless you tell us otherwise.

We will identify your ePlaya submissions by the handle you register and will not disseminate any other registration information without your authorization. However, if you contact other posters by e-mail, your personal information may be included in the header, as with any e-mail.

In general, we cannot guarantee your anonymity whenever you interact with our web site. You might want to be aware of a number of other companies and web sites that offer utilities designed to help you visit web sites anonymously, but we cannot make any representation about their effectiveness or functionality with our web site.

Also, please note that the burningman.com website may contain links to third Party web sites. These third party websites may send their own cookies to collect data and solicit personal information. Therefore, we cannot guarantee your privacy when visiting such third sites, nor the accuracy or acceptability of any services provided by such third parties.
