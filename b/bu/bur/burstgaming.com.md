# Privacy Policy | Burstgaming

(Last Updated on November 19, 2006)

Burstgaming (together with its subsidiaries, "Burstgaming" or "we") considers the protection of personal privacy to be one of our most important values. This privacy policy ("Policy") gives you specific information on how we protect your privacy, how we treat personal information, and the choices you have. This privacy policy complies with the Safe Harbor framework under the E.U. Data Protection Directive. In addition, Burstgaming self-certifies compliance with the Safe Harbor framework to the U.S. Department of Commerce. 

This Policy applies to all web sites and services owned or provided by Burstgaming and its subsidiaries,which we refer to here collectively as "Burstgaming Sites". Burstgaming Sites include, but are not limited to, Burstgaming.com, as well as other Burstgaming-branded services. From time to time we may add new sites, domain names or services to those listed above. Please note that this Policy applies only to sites owned and services maintained by Burstgaming or its corporate subsidiaries and not to web sites or services provided by other companies or organizations to which we link. 

As a condition of using the Burstgaming Sites, you agree to be bound by the terms of this Policy. Additional terms and conditions which govern your use of the Burstgaming Sites are contained in our User Agreement, and, as applicable, in certain other service-specific license agreements or terms of use, which you will be notified of at the time of your registration for the applicable services. 

The Policy is accessible through the Burstgaming Sites in several ways, including from a link entitled "Privacy" at the bottom of the Burstgaming.com home page. You acknowledge that this Policy may change over time. If we make a material change to the terms of this Policy, we will give you 30 days notice of those changes ("Notice Period") through reasonably prominent disclosure, including via email. However, you should check the Burstgaming Sites (and Burstgaming.com in particular) regularly for these and other important announcements. Your continued use of the Burstgaming Sites following the Notice Period will sBurstgamingify that you agree to these changes. 

  
Information Collection, Storage and Use 

We refer to information that identifies an individual as "Personal Information." In general, Burstgaming collects Personal Information from users of the Burstgaming Sites in connection with access to certain online areas or services, including during (i) registration for certain online community services and tools such as message boards, chat rooms or other community services; (ii) registration for special communications, such as email updates and newsletters; (iii) subscription registration; (iv) user surveys; (v) events, sweepstakes, contests or promotions; and (vi) registration for online multi- or single-player gaming, either through the Burstgaming Sites, within a game publisher's site or through the game itself. Your Personal Information is stored on Burstgaming computer servers (or those of its service providers) located in the United States. 

We may gather navigational, click stream data that indicates the areas of the Burstgaming Sites you visit or access. This navigational data does not identify you as an individual user (i.e., based on your PII). We may enter into agreements with outside companies that possess the technology that allows Burstgaming to customize the advertising and marketing messages you receive on the Burstgaming Sites. Your non-PII and click stream data about your activities on the Burstgaming Sites may be shared with these companies so this customization can be accomplished. These companies have agreed not to share your information with any third party or use it for any other purpose. Anonymous click stream and demographic information may also be shared with Burstgaming's advertisers and business partners. We also use and share navigational data in aggregate, non-personal form in order to understand how our users as a group use the Burstgaming Sites. 

Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information in public areas of an Burstgaming Site, such as the member home pages and message boards, your information can be viewed and possibly used by others. We advise users to be especially careful in such public areas about disclosing Personal Information, such as full name, home address, or phone number. 

Below are more details about the Personal Information we, or third parties may gather from you and how we may use it. 

A. Email Newsletters. Burstgaming offers email newsletters to its registered users. We will use your email address to send you only the specific newsletter(s) that you sBurstgaminged up for.

If you are not already a registered user of the Burstgaming Sites you may be asked to provide Personal Information in connection with your use of such services. We share Personal Information with game owners/publishers that offer such services to enable those entities to operate the services you have elected to receive.
