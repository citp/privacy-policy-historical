            </div>
          </center>

<div class="privacy">
  <p>Fundamentally, the privacy of web users must be protected and  the most effective way to preserve that privacy is to confine their data  to the site level. Burst Media as well as adConductor collect no  personally identifiable data, and therefore, protect user privacy.  Burst's TRUSTe license verifies this privacy stance.</p>

  <p>This privacy policy applies to http://www.burstmedia.com, http://ads.addesktop.com, http://www.burstnet.com and http://www.AdConductor.com owned and operated by Burst Media Corporation (“Burst Media” or “Burst”). This privacy policy describes how Burst Media collects and uses the personal information you provide on our web sites:  http://www.burstmedia.com, http://ads.addesktop.com, http://www.burstnet.com and http://www.AdConductor.com.</p>

  <h1>TRUSTe</h1>


  <p>Internet user privacy and confidentiality is of the utmost  importance to Burst, our web publisher members, and our advertiser  clients. Our reputation and integrity are directly related to how we  serve our clients and customers. Please find a description below of how  Burst strives to protect the privacy of Internet users and maintain the  Internet as a highly credible medium.</p>

<div>
  <h1>FOR THOSE WHO VIEW AN AD ON A SITE THAT IS A MEMBER OF Burst</h1>
</div>
<div>
  <h3>Data Collection of User Information</h3>
</div>
<div>
  <p>All users who receive an ad served by Burst retain complete  anonymity where Burst is concerned. As ads are delivered, Burst does not  acquire or collect any personal information about you. Your name,  address, phone number, and email address all remain your private  property. Burst does, however, collect information that is specific to  how you use the Internet. This non-personally identifying information  can include, and is not limited to, the server you are logged onto, the  geographic location of the ISP you use, the type of browser you use, and  your IP address. This information is obtained solely for the purpose of  targeting ads and measuring a given ad's effectiveness on behalf of  Burst clients and customers.</p>
  <p>There are instances where a user may provide specific personal  information in response to an ad containing a survey, purchase  agreement, or registration questionnaire. For such programs, Burst (or a  third party working in conjunction with Burst and the advertiser)  acquires this information on behalf of the advertiser client. The client  uses this information to deliver the goods or services requested by the  user. When requested, Burst may employ this information in a compiled  format without identifying users specifically to provide to the  advertiser client precise profiles of the types of individuals  responding to the ads.</p>
</div>
<div>
  <h3>USE OF HEALTH RELATED INFORMATION</h3>
</div>
<div>
  <p>Burst is a member of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI)  and adheres to its Code on Health-Related Data.   Burst Media does not  collect or use "sensitive consumer information" (as defined in the NAI's  Self-Regulatory Code of Conduct) in its online behavioral advertising  activities and does not offer or sell to its clients segments based on  sensitive consumer information. "Sensitive consumer information"  includes social security numbers or other government-issued identifiers,  insurance plan numbers, financial account numbers, information that  describes the precise real-time geographic location of an individual  derived through location-based services such as through GPS-enabled  devices, and precise information about past, present, or potential  future health or medical conditions or treatments, including genetic,  genomic and family medical history. Burst Media maintains internal  policies and procedures designed to safeguard against the collection or  use of such information.</p>
  <p>Burst may use general health related information with  customized advertising campaigns.  General health-related information  that is not based on a precise medical treatment or conditions is not  considered "sensitive consumer information."  This information can  include, but is not limited to the following examples: retargeting based  on previous visit to an advertiser's website, retargeting based upon  the visit to a general health/fitness/wellness/nutrition website, or  retargeting based on the visit to a website where interest can be  inferred from common content e.g., pregnancy can be inferred from a  visit to a infant car-seat review page. </p>
</div>
<div>
  <h3>P3P</h3>
</div>
<div>
  <p>The Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P) provides a way for  Ad Networks and websites to publish their privacy policies in a  machine-readable syntax. An Ad Network or website will deploy P3P in  order to make its privacy practices more accessible to the site's  visitors. A visitor's Web browser can download the machine-readable  privacy statements, and compare the contents of those statements to the  user's preferences. This way, the user's browser can automatically  notify the user when they visit a site whose practices match the user's  preferences or warn the user if the practices and preferences don't  match. Burst Media has incorporated this technology in its ad servers.  Our syntax reflects our current privacy policy.</p>
</div>
<div>
  <h3>The Cookie Principle</h3>
</div>
<div>
  <p>Burst may use cookies to improve your Web browsing experience. A  cookie is a small text file that is stored on your computer for the  purpose of identifying your web browser. When you are served a Burst ad,  Burst may assign in a cookie various information on ads you've seen,  information on sites you've visited and activities performed to your  computer browser. We do this to understand the way a user responds to  the ads we deliver. For example, this information lets us keep track of  how many times you view an ad we distribute. Likewise, the cookie can  help make sure you do not see the same ad over and over - thus enhancing  your online Web viewing experience.</p>
  <p>Burst Media collects this information via our technology and it  may be stored for up to 2 years for the purpose of: 1) analyzing  campaign results, 2) ensuring that our technology is functioning  properly, and 3) preventing fraud across our sites.</p>
  <p>We do not link the information we store in cookies to any  personally identifiable information you submit while on our site or our  member sites. We may obtain anonymous information about you - such as  sites you have visited or products you have researched - from  third-party sources, and combine it with data that we have collected to  better target advertising that match your interests. Most Web browsers  automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to  prevent that use if you desire.</p>
  <p>In an effort to respect your privacy, Burst Media gives all  internet users the choice to opt-out of receiving Burst Media cookies.  If you would like to opt out, please visit our Cookie Opt-out Program at <a href="index.php/company/opt-out" target="_blank">www.burstmedia.com/company/opt-out</a>. Alternatively, you may also choose to opt out of receiving Burst Media cookies through the Network Advertising Initiative's <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="_blank">Consumer Opt-Out Program</a>.</p>
</div>
<div>
  <h3>Third-Party Measurement Services</h3>
</div>
<div>
  <p>Often, advertisers will employ a third-party service provider  other than Burst for serving the advertisements and for tracking the  performance of an ad program. These companies may employ cookie and 1x1  pixel technology to measure and improve the effectiveness of ads for  their client. These companies may collect and use anonymous information  about your visits to our member websites and other websites. The  information collected can include:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Date/time of your visit</li>
    <li>The banner ad that was shown</li>
    <li>Unique user ID</li>
    <li>Your IP address</li>
    <li>The URLs of sites you visit</li>
  </ol>
  <p>This information can also be used for online preference  marketing ("profiling") purposes. In these instances, Burst has no  control over the information collected by the third-party, and may not  be held responsible for the actions of the third-party measurement  service where collected information is concerned.</p>
  <p>If you would like more information about this practice and to  know your choices about not having this information used by these  companies, <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="_blank"> click here</a>.</p>
