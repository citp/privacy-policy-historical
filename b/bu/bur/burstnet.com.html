						<p>Fundamentally, the privacy of web users must be protected and the most effective way to preserve that privacy is to confine their data to the site level. Burst Media as well as AdConductor collect no personal information, and therefore, protect user privacy. Burst's TRUSTe license verifies this privacy stance.</p>
						<p>This privacy policy applies to http://www.burstmedia.com, http://ads.addesktop.com, http://www.burstnet.com and http://www.AdConductor.com owned and operated by Burst Media Corporation (�Burst Media� or �Burst�). This privacy policy describes how Burst Media collects and uses the personal information you provide on our web sites:  http://www.burstmedia.com, http://ads.addesktop.com, http://www.burstnet.com and http://www.AdConductor.com.  It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information and how you can access and update this information.</p>
						<div class="clear"></div>
					</div>
					<div class="hblock gap"><h2>TRUSTe</h2></div>
					<div class="pblock">		
						<p>Internet user privacy and confidentiality is of the utmost importance to Burst, our web publisher members, and our advertiser clients. Our reputation and integrity are directly related to how we serve our clients and customers. Please find a description below of how Burst strives to protect the privacy of Internet users and maintain the Internet as a highly credible medium.</p>

					<div class="hblock gap"><h2>FOR THOSE WHO VIEW AN AD ON A SITE THAT IS A MEMBER OF BURST</h2></div>
					<div class="hblock gap"><h3>Data Collection of User Information</h3></div>
					<div class="pblock">		
						<p>All users who receive an ad served by Burst retain complete anonymity where Burst is concerned. As ads are delivered, Burst does not acquire or collect any personal information about you. Your name, address, phone number, and email address all remain your private property. Burst does, however, collect information that is specific to how you use the Internet. This non-personal information can include, and is not limited to, the server you are logged onto, the geographic location of the ISP you use, the type of browser you use, and your IP address. This information is obtained solely for the purpose of targeting ads and measuring a given ad's effectiveness on behalf of Burst clients and customers.</p>
						
						<p>There are instances where a user may provide specific personal information in response to an ad containing a survey, purchase agreement, or registration questionnaire. For such programs, Burst (or a third party working in conjunction with Burst and the advertiser) acquires this information on behalf of the advertiser client. The client uses this information to deliver the goods or services requested by the user. When requested, Burst may employ this information in a compiled format without identifying users specifically to provide to the advertiser client precise profiles of the types of individuals responding to the ads.</p>
					</div>
                    <div class="hblock gap"><h3>PRIVACY</h3></div>
					<div class="pblock">
						<p>Burst Media is a member of the Network Advertising Initiative (�NAI�) and is in compliance with the NAI�s Self-Regulatory Principles, and adheres to the Digital Advertising Alliance�s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising Digital Advertising Alliance�s <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/" target="_blank">Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising</a>.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="hblock gap"><h3>USE OF HEALTH RELATED INFORMATION</h3></div>
					<div class="pblock">
						<p>Burst is a member of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) and adheres to its Code on Health-Related Data. Burst Media does not collect or use "sensitive consumer information" (as defined in the NAI's Self-Regulatory Code of Conduct) in its online behavioral advertising activities and does not offer or sell to its clients segments based on sensitive consumer information. "Sensitive consumer information" includes social security numbers or other government-issued identifiers, insurance plan numbers, financial account numbers, information that describes the precise real-time geographic location of an individual derived through location-based services such as through GPS-enabled devices, and precise information about past, present, or potential future health or medical conditions or treatments, including genetic, genomic and family medical history. Burst Media maintains internal policies and procedures designed to safeguard against the collection or use of such information.</p>
						<p>Burst may use general health related information with customized advertising campaigns. General health-related information that is not based on a precise medical treatment or conditions is not considered "sensitive consumer information." This information can include, but is not limited to the following examples: retargeting based on previous visit to an advertiser's website, retargeting based upon the visit to a general health/fitness/wellness/nutrition website, or retargeting based on the visit to a website where interest can be inferred from common content e.g., pregnancy can be inferred from a visit to a infant car-seat review page.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="hblock gap"><h3>P3P</h3></div>
					<div class="pblock">	
						<p>The Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P) provides a way for Ad Networks and websites to publish their privacy policies in a machine-readable syntax. An Ad Network or website will deploy P3P in order to make its privacy practices more accessible to the site's visitors. A visitor's Web browser can download the machine-readable privacy policies, and compare the contents of those statements to the user's preferences. This way, the user's browser can automatically notify the user when they visit a site whose practices match the user's preferences or warn the user if the practices and preferences don't match. Burst Media has incorporated this technology in its ad servers. Our syntax reflects our current privacy policy.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="hblock gap"><h3>The Cookie Principle</h3></div>
					<div class="pblock">	
						<p>Burst may use cookies to improve your Web browsing experience. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on your computer for the purpose of identifying your web browser. When you are served a Burst ad, Burst may assign in a cookie various information on ads you've seen, information on sites you've visited and activities performed to your computer browser. We do this to understand the way a user responds to the ads we deliver. For example, this information lets us keep track of how many times you view an ad we distribute. Likewise, the cookie can help make sure you do not see the same ad over and over - thus enhancing your online Web viewing experience.</p>
						
						<p>Burst Media collects this information via our technology and it may be stored for up to 2 years for the purpose of: 1) analyzing campaign results, 2) ensuring that our technology is functioning properly, and 3) preventing fraud across our sites.</p>
						
						<p>We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personal information you submit while on our site or our member sites. We may obtain anonymous information about you - such as sites you have visited or products you have researched - from third-party sources, and combine it with data that we have collected to better target advertising that match your interests. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent that use if you desire.</p>
						
						<p>In an effort to respect your privacy, Burst Media gives all internet users the choice to opt-out of receiving Burst Media cookies. If you would like to opt out, please visit our Cookie Opt-out Program at <a href="http://www.burstmedia.com/optout.html" target="_blank">www.burstmedia.com/optout.html</a>. Alternatively, you may also choose to opt out of receiving Burst Media cookies through the Network Advertising Initiative's <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="_blank">Consumer Opt-Out Program</a>.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="hblock gap"><h3>Third-Party Measurement Services</h3></div>
					<div class="pblock">	
						<p>Often, advertisers will employ a third-party service provider other than Burst for serving the advertisements and for tracking the performance of an ad program. These companies may employ cookie and 1x1 pixel technology to measure and improve the effectiveness of ads for their client. These companies may collect and use anonymous information about your visits to our member websites and other websites. The information collected can include:</p>
	
						<ol class="indent">
							<li>Date/time of your visit</li>
							<li>The banner ad that was shown</li>
							<li>Unique user ID</li>
							<li>Your IP address</li>
							<li>The URLs of sites you visit</li>
						</ol>

						<p>This information can also be used for online preference marketing ("profiling") purposes. In these instances, Burst has no control over the information collected by the third-party, and may not be held responsible for the actions of the third-party measurement service where collected information is concerned.</p>
