**Tracking Technologies / Cookies**

Like many websites, we use “cookies” to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies for two purposes. First, we utilize persistent cookies to save your login information for future logins to our Site. Second, we utilize session ID cookies to enable certain features of our Site and Services, to better understand how you interact with the Site and to monitor aggregate usage by and web traffic routing on our Site. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you close your browser. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of our Site.

**Analytics / Log Files**

As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the Site, to track users’ movements around the Site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We do not link this automatically-collected data to Personal Information.

**3rd Party Tracking**

The use of tracking technologies by our service providers or technology partners on the Site is not covered by our Privacy Policy. These 3rd parties may use cookies, clear gifs, images, and scripts to help them better manage their content on our Site. We do not have access to or control over these technologies. We do not tie the information gathered to our Customers’ Personal Information.

**Behavioral Targeting / Re-Targeting**

We partner with a third party ad network to display advertising on our Site. Our ad network partner uses cookies and Web beacons to collect non-Personal Information about your activities on this Site to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests. Web beacons are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, Web beacons are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by Web beacons to our Customers’ Personal Information. If you wish not to have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking Here. Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads.

**Security**

The security of your Personal Information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number or log-in information) on our Site, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). In some cases, we also encrypt sensitive information where it is stored on our systems. We follow generally accepted standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Site, you can contact us using the information below.
