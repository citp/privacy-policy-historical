</font></p><p align="CENTER"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>I.	Information Which We Collect</b></font></p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">

<p>	We may request that you voluntarily supply us with personal information, including your e-mail address, postal address, home or work telephone number, credit card number (only if you choose to purchase a product online), for purposes such as correspondence, making a purchase, or participating in online contests, surveys or games.

Cookies were designed to help a web site recognize a user's browser as a previous visitor and thus save and remember any preferences that may have been set while the user was browsing the site.  <b>A cookie cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive, pass on a computer virus, or capture your e-mail address.</b>  Our web sites may use cookies to enhance your visit.

<p>	We may require you to supply us with personal information (demographic information such as average age, income, education, population data, zip codes) during a "registration" process online prior to using certain features of our site.  For example, you may be required to register to use chat rooms, forums, to access archival stories, to subscribe to newspapers, and to access other features.

Any information we collect is used for its own internal purposes to improve the content of the web sites, to enhance users' experiences when visiting our sites, to customize the content and/or layout of our pages, and to provide the services required by an individual user.  We do not use personal identifying information for any reason that is not disclosed either in this Policy or at the time the information is requested.  We never send e-mail to you unless you request a particular service, or consent to being contacted by e-mail.  There are instances where you will have the opportunity to subscribe to an e-mail list that will send information about the site or our advertisers to your e-mail address, but this will be done only with your permission and consent</p>
