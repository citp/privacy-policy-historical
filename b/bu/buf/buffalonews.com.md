Your privacy is very important to us. To make use of certain features of our website; ie, [Free email](http://mail.buffalo.com/), [MyBuffalo.com](http://www.mybuffalo.com/), [BuffaloNews.com article commenting](http://account.mybuffalo.com/register/agreement/), etc., visitors need to register and provide certain information as part of the registration process. The information you provide will help us to provide the services you request from us.

Registration at BuffaloNews.com, Buffalo.comSM, and MyBuffalo.com is voluntary, but certain information is required to complete the registration process. By providing required registration information, you agree to receive periodic email notifications of new features, products, offers, or newsworthy items that may interest you. You will have the ability to opt out of these email messages or to discontinue the use of your registered account at any time.

We utilize a standard feature of browser software called a "cookie" to assign each visitor a unique number that resides on your browser. We use this as a form of identification. Although a cookie can't identify a visitor, it only identifies the computer that a visitor uses to access our site. Unless you voluntarily provide personal information through registration for one of our services, we don't know who you are, even if we assign a cookie to your browser. Our cookie cannot read data off of your hard drive. Our partners, affiliates, sponsors and advertisers may assign their own cookies to your browser when you access their sites, a process we do not monitor or control.
