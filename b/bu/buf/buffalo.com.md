**Buffalo.com SM Privacy Policy ** (updated 4/3/00)

Your privacy is very important to us. To make use of certain features of our website; ie, [Free email,](http://mail.buffalo.com/), stock portfolio, [E-vents@Buffalo.comSM](http://www.buffalo.com/calendar/), [MyCalendar@Buffalo.comSM](http://www.buffalo.com/calendar/my_calendar/accounts/), etc., visitors need to register and provide certain information as part of the registration process. The information you provide will help us to provide the services you request from us. One of the things we will do with this information is offer more personalized features and make our features and our site more useful to you. 

Supplying such information is voluntary, but it makes it possible to supply personalized services to you. For example, if you supply the stocks you want to monitor, then we can offer the personalized portfolio service to you; if you supply your email address and areas of interest, we can send you email notifications of new features or newsworthy items that may interest you; if you supply information on how to contact you, we can notify you if you're a winner in one of our many promotional contests. 

We utilize a standard feature of browser software called a "cookie" to assign each visitor a unique number that resides on your browser. We use this as a form of identification, although a cookie can't identify a visitor, it only identifies the computer that a visitor uses to access our site. Unless you voluntarily provide personal information through registration for one of our services, we don't know who you are, even if we assign a cookie to your browser. Our cookie cannot read data off of your hard drive. Our partners, affiliates, sponsors and advertisers may assign their own cookies to your browser when you access their sites, a process we do not monitor or control.
