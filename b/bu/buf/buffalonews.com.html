<p>Your privacy is very important to us. To make use of certain features of our website; ie, <a href="http://mail.buffalo.com/">Free email</a>, <a href="http://www.mybuffalo.com/">MyBuffalo.com</a>, <a href="http://account.mybuffalo.com/register/agreement/">BuffaloNews.com article commenting</a>, etc., visitors need to register and provide certain information as part of the registration process. The information you provide will help us to provide the services you request from us.</p>
