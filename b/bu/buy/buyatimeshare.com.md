**INFORMATION WE COLLECT**

**Personal Information**

We collect information that you choose to provide us and that personally identifies you, such as your name, address, zip code, telephone number, e-mail address, payment information, and other personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”).  You may be asked to provide us with Personal Information when you register with the Website(s) and at other times.  To perform the services offered through the Website(s) we need to collect and distribute your personal information to our trusted business partners who fulfill the services you request.  The decision to provide this information is optional.  However, if you choose not to provide the requested information, you may not be able to use some or all of the features of the Website(s) or Services. 

**Usage Data and Site Activity**

We automatically collect information in connection with the actions you take on the Website(s) and in connection with using the Services (“Usage Data”).  For example, each time you use the Website(s) we automatically collect the type of web browser you use, your operating system, your Internet Service Provider, your IP address, the pages you view, and the time and duration of your visits to the Website(s). 

**Cookies and Web Beacons**

We may use cookies (a small text file placed on your computer to identify your computer and browser). We may also use web beacons (an electronic file placed on a website that monitors usage). We use cookies to improve the experience of the Website(s) and Services, such as saving your preferences from visit to visit to present you with a customized version of the Website, without requiring you to log into the Website(s) each time you visit.  Most web browsers are initially set up to accept cookies.  You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.  However, certain features of the Website(s) or Services may not work if you delete or disable cookies. 

We may work with third-party advertisers, search provider and ad networks (“Advertisers”).  Advertisers may collect and use information about your use of the Website(s) or Services as well as other websites and services to provide advertisements about goods or services that may be of interest to you.  These companies may use cookies and other online tracking technologies to collect such information.  Our Privacy Policy does not cover any use of information that an ad network may collect from you.  Advertisements may be shown via the Website(s), the Services or on third-party websites.  You can visit the Network Advertising Initiative website at [www.networkadvertising.org](http://www.networkadvertising.org/), which offers information about Internet advertising companies and how to opt out of their information collection.

**User Activity Tracking**

We may employ software technology that enables us to track certain aspects of a User's visit to the Website.  This technology helps us better manage content on the Website by informing us what content is effective.  The software typically uses two methods to track User activity: 1) "trackers" and 2) "clear gifs".  Trackers are pieces of executable code that are embedded in a web page that track usage activity including which pages are viewed, when they are viewed, and how long the pages are viewed.  Clear gifs are tiny graphics with unique identifiers, which are embedded in web pages and email messages that track whether or not a User has viewed a particular web page or email message.  User activity information may be associated with additional information about a User's session, such as IP Address and the type of browser used, and personally identifiable information, if provided by the User.

If you arrive at the Website(s) by "clicking through" from another website, and you have registered with that other website, then certain information about you that you provided to that other website, such as the terms you were searching on that led you to the Website, may be transmitted to us and we may use it.  You should review the Privacy Policy of any website from which you reached the Website(s) in order to determine what information was collected by that website and for what purpose(s) you agreed that website could use that information.   We may or may not retain information about you provided to us by other websites.  If we do, we will only use it in accordance with this Privacy Policy.  Such information may or may not be associated with other User activity data or personally identifiable information.

**Social Media Widgets**

The Website(s) include social media features, such as the Facebook Like button, Google Plus, Pinterest and Twitter widgets.  These features may collect information about your IP address and the pages you visit on our site.  A cookie may be set to ensure that a feature properly functions.  Your interactions with features are governed by the privacy policies of the companies that provide them.    

**HOW WE USE AND SHARE INFORMATION**

**Generally**

We use Personal Information for internal purposes, such as to

  * Provide you with the Website(s) and Services;
  * Process or complete transactions requested by you;
  * Improve the Website(s) and Services, including customization and personalization;
  * Notify you of new services via mail, email, telephone and/or text messaging;
  * Otherwise communicate with you about the Website(s), the Services, the Operator and other matters via mail, email, telephone and/or text messaging;
  * Compile anonymous information and analyses;



**Surveys**

From time-to-time our Website(s) may request Personal Information from Users via surveys. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and the User therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose Personal Information.  The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code). Contact information will be shared with the survey sponsors to execute the survey. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of the Website. Users' Personal Information collected through surveys may be shared with our trusted business partners and other third parties as permitted by this Privacy Policy.

**About the Process You are Using**

We offer to advertise timeshares owned by one person to those interested in buying or renting those timeshares.  If you choose to offer to sell, buy or rent a timeshare, any information collected from you by the party receiving the offer will not be governed by this Privacy Policy.   We are not responsible for the policies or practices of those receiving any information about you as a result of your correspondence regarding the sale, purchase or rental of a timeshare.  We expressly disclaim any and all liability or responsibility whatsoever for the success or suitability of any such business dealing.  Final assessment of any offer or timeshare sold, purchased or rented, including the fairness and accuracy of such transaction, and the task of seeing any transaction through to its conclusion is solely the User’s responsibility.  We do not function as a buyer or seller agent in any way and do not represent any party in any transaction.  

**Third-Party Providers**

From time to time, we may establish a business relationship with other businesses whom we believe trustworthy and who we believe have privacy practices that are consistent with ours (“Third-Party Providers”).  For example, we may contract with Third-Party providers to provide certain services such as hosting and maintenance, marketing and promotions, payment processing, data storage and management, and validation services to confirm the contact information you provide.  We only provide our Third-Party Providers with the information necessary for them to perform these services on our behalf.  Each Third-Party Provider is expected to use reasonable security measures appropriate to the nature of the information involved to protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure.  Third Party Providers are prohibited from using Personal Information other than as specified by us. 

**SECURITY**

We recognize the importance of safeguarding the confidentiality of your Personal Information.  Accordingly, we employ reasonable administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect such personal information from unauthorized access, disclosure and use.  However, no data transmission over the Internet or other network can be guaranteed 100% secure.  As a result, while we strive to protect information transmitted on or through our Website(s), we cannot and do not guarantee the security of any information you transmit on our Website(s), and you do so at your own risk.

**CALIFORNIA “Do Not Track” DISCLOSURE**

Do Not Track is a web browser privacy preference that causes the web browser to broadcast a signal to websites requesting that a user’s activity not be tracked.  At this time, our systems do not respond to “do not track” signals.

**OTHER WEBSITES**

Please be aware that our affiliated institutions, promotional partners, advertisers, sponsors, and other third-party websites accessible through the Website(s) may have their own privacy and data collection policies and practices.  We are not responsible for any actions, content of websites or privacy policies of such third parties.  You should check the applicable privacy policies of those third parties when providing information through linked websites.

**COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT**

We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law.  We may disclose Personal Information and any other information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties if, in our discretion, we believe it is necessary or appropriate to respond to legal requests (including court orders and subpoenas), to protect the safety, property or rights of the Operator, Users or any other third party, to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical, or legally actionable activity, or to comply with law.

**OTHER TRANSFERS**

We may share Personal Information and Usage Data with businesses controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Operator.  If the Operator is merged, acquired or sold, or in the event of a transfer of some or all of our assets, we may disclose or transfer Personal Information and Usage Data in connection with such transaction.  You will have the opportunity to opt out of any such transfer if, in our reasonable judgement, the new entity plans to handle your information in a way that differs materially from this policy. 

**HOW LONG WE RETAIN YOUR DATA**

We retain your Personal Information for as long as we have a relationship with you.  We also retain your Personal Information for a period of time after our relationship with you has ended where there is an ongoing business need to retain it.  This includes retention to comply with our legal, regulatory, tax and/or accounting obligations.  We do so in accordance with our data retention policies and applicable law. 

**CHILDREN’S PRIVACY**

This website is not intended for children under the age of 13 and we do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13.  If we become aware that we have inadvertently received Personal Information from a child under the age of 13, we will delete such information from our records. 

**UPDATING AND CORRECTING INFORMATION**

You may correct and update your Personal Information by logging into your account or sending us an email at [info@buyatimeshare.com](mailto:info@buyatimeshare.com).  To assist us in processing your request, please include the phrase “Update Information” in the header of the email.  You may also send us a letter with your specific request at the following address:

              **BuyATimeshare**

**Attention: Information Update**

**               5406 Hoover Blvd #4**

Please provide your name, address, email address, and the information that you would like us to update.  You may ask to have to have information deleted or removed.  However, you cannot delete information included with past transactions, and it may not be possible for us to completely delete all of your information from backup media.
