> Log Files
> 
> As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.  This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. 
> 
> We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. 
> 
>   
>  We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information.  IP addresses are tied to personally identifiable information to authenticate transmissions submitted on forms. 
> 
>   
>  Cookies  
>  A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. We do link the information we store in cookies to personally identifiable information you submit while on our site to track who submits what information.
> 
> We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies.  We use session cookies to track advertising effectiveness. A session ID cookie expires when you close you browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file.
> 
> We set a persistent cookie to track links sent to us by our affiliates.  If you reject cookies, you may still use our site.  This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by BuySellWebsite.com only.
> 
>   
>  Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)
> 
> Our third party advertising partners, both Overture and Google, employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective.  Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information to help us better target our advertising.
> 
> To learn more about our advertising company’s use of clear gifs, please go to Overture.com and Google.com
> 
> We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients.  This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.  If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see “Choice and Opt-out.”
> 
> Security
> 
> We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.  No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. However, our payment processor, Paypal, uses SSL encryption to secure payment transmission.
