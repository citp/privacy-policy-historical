  safeguards in compliance with applicable US federal and state
  regulations. We use computer safeguards such as firewalls and data
  encryption, we enforce physical access controls to our buildings and
  files, and we authorize access to personal information only for those
  employees who require it to fulfill their job responsibilities.
</p>

  designed to reduce the chance that someone on your network at work or
  at your Internet service provider may try to compromise your private
  information as it travels from your Web browser to our secure server.

<p></p>
<p>
  To purchase or sell advertising opportunities, we need to share some

  sign-up, the number of transactions you have completed, and other
  information may be viewed by other users.
</p>

  to anyone you have entered in a transaction with, except with your
  express permission or if we are required to do so to comply with a
  subpoena or other legal process.
</p>
<p>
  We may share your personal information with:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Other companies to help detect and prevent potentially illegal
  acts, provide joint services and for other business purposes.

      <li>we need to do so to comply with law
      </li>
      <li>we believe in good faith that the disclosure of personal
      information is necessary to prevent physical harm or financial
      loss, to report suspected illegal activity, or to investigate
      violations of our User Agreement.
