<h3>How Do We Use Your Information?</h3>

<p>BuyerZone uses the information we gather to put buyers and sellers into contact with one another, to provide other features and functionality of this site, to improve your experience on our site through analysis and communication, for other purposes described in this policy, and for purposes disclosed to you when you provide information.</p>

<p>
    <strong>To Facilitate Transactions.</strong> Buyers or suppliers will receive emails and other communications from us to fulfill or facilitate the purpose for which the information was provided or a request to use a service on this site. You cannot opt out of emails that are necessary to provide our services. By using BuyerZone's services offered on this site, you agree that we may use your personally identifiable information to contact you and deliver information to you related to those services.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Analysis.</strong> In our ongoing effort to improve the content and services we offer, we continually analyze the information we receive to identify trends and patterns in user behavior. Your personally identifiable information, when used in such a manner, is aggregated with others to amass enough data for such analysis and is not personally identifiable.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Testimonials and Feedback.</strong> We sincerely appreciate the feedback we receive from our users. Your feedback, both positive and negative, is forwarded to the appropriate departments at BuyerZone as necessary so we can continue to monitor and improve the service we provide. We may also share testimonials in our marketing literature but will do so without including personally identifiable information unless we have expressly received your permission to do so. If you would like your testimonial removed, please contact us
    <a href="http://www.buyerzone.com/about-us/contact/">here</a>.</p>

<p>
    <strong>Newsletters.</strong> BuyerZone offers valuable content through email newsletters for both buyers and suppliers. If you no longer wish to receive any newsletter, we encourage you to opt out of these communications by changing your notification preferences as described below.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Other communications.</strong> BuyerZone may send you email and other communications related to this site, your use of our services and the status of your account, which may include site updates and responses to your inquiries. In addition, BuyerZone sends periodic surveys and other communications, all of which you can opt out of receiving by changing your notification preferences as described below.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Affiliates.</strong> We may share your information with our direct parent company, Purch, for any uses consistent with those disclosed in this privacy policy. We may use the information you provide us to send you email and other communications on behalf of other Purch member companies. These communications may include email newsletters, as well as offers for other BuyerZone and Purch services. All email newsletters will provide you with an opportunity to opt out of receiving future issues of the newsletter. All promotional offers will include an opportunity to opt out of receiving future promotions from the brand whose product/service is being promoted.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Third Party Offers.</strong> We also may use your information to send you e-mail and other communications on behalf of third parties. Each of these communications will include instructions for opting out of receiving future third party offers from us. You may also opt out of receiving third party offers from this Site at any time by sending an e-mail to
    <a href="mailto:customercare@buyerzone.com">customercare@buyerzone.com</a> with the subject line
    <strong>"opt out — third party."</strong></p>

<h3>How Do We Share Your Information With Others?</h3>

<p>Our customer information is an important part of our business. As a result, we only disclose this information as described in this section. Our sharing of information to outside parties is described below. As part of our service to customers, we provide information to suppliers so that they can respond directly to you when you submit a Request for Quotes.</p>

<p>
    <strong>Prospective Buyers.</strong> To facilitate our business of matching buyers and suppliers, prospective buyers using our services will be provided information about suppliers relevant to the buyer's request or inquiry using such services. This includes supplier contact information, company background information and, where appropriate, ratings or reviews.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Suppliers.</strong> Similarly, suppliers whose products or services are relevant to a prospective buyer's request, and/or marketers, resellers and other service providers performing marketing, fulfillment and/or similar services on behalf of such suppliers with respect to the prospective buyer's request, may be provided with that prospective buyer's information. We contractually limit use of the buyer's information (including all forms of contact information submitted) by the seller to communicating with the buyer, or permitting its marketers, resellers or other service providers to communicate with the buyer, about their desired purchase. In addition, suppliers may receive information about buyers in a manner that does not disclose personally identifiable information. Examples include data that are aggregated across a group of buyers or feedback that is provided without attribution to a specific person or company.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Agents.</strong> From time to time, we may use the services of third-party companies to help facilitate our business activities. These include bill collection services, affiliate or incentive program providers, customer service organizations, e-mail and postal mail brokers, and marketing service providers. These companies are subject to confidentiality agreements with us and are prohibited from using the information we provide for any reason except to perform the functions that BuyerZone has outlined for them.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Network Members.</strong> BuyerZone has relationships with third parties to provide our services more broadly throughout the Internet to both buyers and suppliers. When a user has utilized these services through a member of our network, we will share information about these users with the affiliate as necessary. This information is typically reported in an aggregated format.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Advertisers.</strong> We may provide your information to third party advertisers (and/or to their service providers on their behalf) to market their products or services under contractual requirement to keep your personally identifiable information confidential and use it only to market and provide (directly and through third parties engaged by them for such purpose) their products or services. You may opt out of such disclosures by sending an e-mail to
    <a href="mailto:customercare@buyerzone.com">customercare@buyerzone.com</a> with the subject line: "<strong>do not disclose.</strong>" We also aggregate information about our collective users for potential advertisers who are interested in understanding whether their offering would be suitable to our audience. This information does not include personally identifiable information like your company name or email address.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Business Transfers.</strong> It is possible that our business may be merged with or sold to another business entity. During such a transaction, business information is typically one of the assets shared in the combined entity. In the event that this occurs, your personally identifiable information will be protected by the BuyerZone privacy policy in effect at the time. If your personally identifiable information will be used contrary to this policy, you will receive notice as described in the "Notification of Changes" section below.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Legal Requests.</strong> BuyerZone is interested in protecting its members and the community at large. We will release account and other personally identifiable information to legal authorities when we believe it is appropriate to comply with the law, rules or regulations or to protect persons or property. In addition, BuyerZone may choose to release information about you to relevant parties in relation to investigations of fraud, piracy or other unlawful activity.
</p>

<h3> Information Security</h3>

<p>Your information is stored on servers that are protected against unauthorized access through the use of safeguards such as "firewalls," encryption and Secure Socket Layers.

<p>

To update your communication preferences, contact our Customer Care department at
    <a href="mailto:customercare@buyerzone.com">customercare@buyerzone.com</a>.
