      <h1>Privacy Policy - BuyerZone </h1>
      <p>Your privacy is very important to  us. This privacy policy of BuyerZone.com, Inc. (“BuyerZone”) describes the  information we gather, how we share that information and what we do to protect  your information.</p>
      <p>Use of the  site indicates agreement with this privacy policy. This privacy policy was last  updated February, 2008.</p>
      <h2>WHAT INFORMATION DO WE GATHER?</h2>
      <p>Information we automatically collect via industry standard web log files  includes the URL from which you visited, the page you are visiting, your  computer browser information and your IP address. We may also use automatic data  collection devices such as “cookies” and “clear GIF’s” (also known  as "pixel tags" or "beacons").</p>
      <p>Cookies contain specific pieces of  information on your computer hard drive, and can be set to store information  during a visit or for a longer period of time. Cookies are also used to help  streamline your experience on the site, automatically logging you in during  future visits, for example. You are free to disable cookies at any time if your  browser permits. However, by doing so, you may not be able to use certain  features of our site. If you are unable to submit a Request for Quotes while  having cookies disabled, please contact our Customer Care department at 1-888-393-5000.</p>
      <p>A  clear GIF is a small graphic image, typically used in connection with cookies,  that is placed on a web site or in an email message.&nbsp; A clear GIF can  monitor certain user behavior, such as your usage of the web site, whether you  opened an email message or whether you clicked on a URL in an email message. We  do not collect personally identifiable information in this way, but if you  provide us with personally identifiable information, we may associate that  information with the information that is collected automatically.</p>
      <p>As a prospective buyer using offerings  on our site (such as our Request for Quotes service) to receive information  from or about sellers, you are required to provide additional information so  BuyerZone can deliver these services to you. This includes contact information,  basic demographic information, and your purchasing requirements. The  information collected varies according to the different purchasing categories  and can be viewed by visiting the different forms located throughout our site.  We may also ask you for feedback about our service, which is collected and  stored to allow us to continually improve our offerings.</p>
      <p>As a supplier using offerings on  our site (such as our Request for Quotes service to receive information from or  about prospective buyers), you must provide information that allows us to  deliver our service to you. This includes your contact information, information  about your desired target markets, and billing information. Any credit card  information we receive is stored securely via encryption and an SSL connection;  our security measures are reviewed later in this document.</p>
      <p>We also require you to provide  certain information when you request our newsletters, sample lead service or  other content or submit information for posting on public areas of this site (e.g.,  blogs, moderated discussions or bulletin boards).</p>
      <p>Additionally, we may request that  your provide demographic information. The specific information requested varies  according to the different types of content you may request.</p>
      <p>Some of the materials included on this site, including advertising, may be  served by third parties. These third parties, in the course of serving such  materials, may collect information regarding your use of this site and how you  respond to e-mail communications, using methods that may include automatic data  collection, and may use this information in order to present advertisements or  other content that may be of interest to you on both this site and other web  sites.&nbsp; Collection, use, disclosure and security of information collected  by third parties are subject to the privacy policies of those third parties. If  you would like more information about this practice or to opt out of having  this information used by certain third-party ad servers to provide targeted  ads, please visit <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp">http://www.networkadvertising.org/</a>.</p>
      <h2>HOW DO WE  USE YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
      <p>BuyerZone uses the information we gather to put buyers and sellers into contact  with one another, to provide other features and functionality of this site, to  improve your experience on our site through analysis and communication, for  other purposes described in this policy, and for purposes disclosed to you when  you provide information.</p>
      <p><strong>To Facilitate Transactions.</strong>&nbsp; Buyers or suppliers will receive emails and  other communications from us to fulfill or facilitate the purpose for which the  information was provided or a request to use a service on this site. You cannot  opt out of emails that are necessary to provide our services. By using  BuyerZone's services offered on this site, you agree that we may use your  personal information to contact you and deliver information to you related to those  services.</p>
      <p><strong>Analysis.</strong> In our ongoing effort to  improve the content and services we offer, we continually analyze the  information we receive to identify trends and patterns in user behavior. Your  personal information, when used in such a manner, is aggregated with others to  amass enough data for such analysis and is not personally identifiable.</p>
      <p><strong>Testimonials and Feedback.</strong> We  sincerely appreciate the feedback we receive from our users. Your feedback,  both positive and negative, is forwarded to the appropriate departments at  BuyerZone as necessary so we can continue to monitor and improve the service we  provide. We may also share testimonials in our marketing literature but will do  so without including personally identifiable information unless we have  expressly received your permission to do so.</p>
      <p><strong>Newsletters.</strong> BuyerZone offers  valuable content through email newsletters for both buyers and suppliers. If  you no longer wish to receive any newsletter, we encourage you to opt out of  these communications by changing your notification preferences as described below.</p>
      <p><strong>Email Services.</strong> BuyerZone may offer  services such as "Tell a Friend" that allow visitors to notify other  people via e-mail about its services. When an email address is provided for these  communications, it is not used by us for any purpose other than to forward the  requested information.</p>
      <p><strong>Other communications.</strong> BuyerZone may  send you email and other communications related to this site, your use of our  services and the status of your account, which may include site updates and  responses to your inquiries. In addition, BuyerZone sends periodic surveys and  other communications, all of which you can opt out of receiving by changing  your notification preferences as described below.</p>
      <p><strong>Affiliates.</strong>&nbsp; We may use the information you  provide us to send you e-mail and other communications on behalf of other Reed  Elsevier member companies.&nbsp; These communications may include e-mail  newsletters, as well as offers for other BuyerZone and Reed Elsevier  services.&nbsp; All email newsletters will provide you with an opportunity to  opt out of receiving future issues of the newsletter.&nbsp; All promotional  offers will include an opportunity to opt out of receiving future promotions  from the brand whose product/service is being promoted.</p>
      <p><strong>Third Party Offers.</strong>&nbsp; We also may use  your information to send you e-mail and other communications on behalf of third  parties.&nbsp; Each of these communications will include instructions for  opting out of receiving future third party offers from us.&nbsp; You may also  opt out of receiving third party offers from this Site at any time by sending  an e-mail to <a href="mailto:privacymanager@reedbusiness.com">privacymanager@reedbusiness.com</a> with the subject line “<em><strong>opt out – third  party</strong></em>.”</p>
      <h2>HOW DO WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION WITH OTHERS?</h2>
      <p>Our customer information is an important part of our business. As a result, we only  disclose this information as described in this section. Our sharing of  information to outside parties is described below.</p>
      <p><strong>Prospective Buyers.</strong> To facilitate  our business of matching buyers and suppliers, prospective buyers using our  services will be provided information about suppliers relevant to the buyer’s  request or inquiry using such services. This includes supplier contact  information, company background information and, where appropriate, ratings or  reviews.</p>
      <p><strong>Suppliers.</strong> Similarly, suppliers whose  products or services are relevant to a prospective buyer’s request, and/or  marketers, resellers and other service providers performing marketing,  fulfillment and/or similar services on behalf of such suppliers with respect to  the prospective buyer’s request, may be provided with that prospective buyer’s  information. &nbsp;We contractually limit use  of the buyer's information (including all forms of contact information  submitted) by the seller to communicating with the buyer, or permitting its  marketers, resellers or other service providers to communicate with the buyer,  about their desired purchase.&nbsp; In  addition, suppliers may receive information about buyers in a manner that does  not disclose personally identifiable information. Examples include data that  are aggregated across a group of buyers or feedback that is provided without  attribution to a specific person or company.</p>
      <p><strong>Agents.</strong> From time to time, we may use  the services of third-party companies to help facilitate our business  activities. These include bill collection services, affiliate or incentive  program providers, customer service organizations, e-mail and postal mail  brokers, and marketing service providers. These companies are subject to  confidentiality agreements with us and are prohibited from using the  information we provide for any reason except to perform the functions that  BuyerZone has outlined for them.</p>
      <p><strong>Affiliates.</strong>&nbsp; We may share your information with our direct  parent company, Reed Elsevier Inc., and other Reed Elsevier  member companies for any uses consistent with those disclosed in this privacy  policy.</p>
      <p><strong>Network Members.</strong>&nbsp; BuyerZone has relationships with third  parties to provide our services more broadly throughout the Internet to both  buyers and suppliers. When a user has utilized these services through a member  of our network, we will share information about these users with the affiliate  as necessary. This information is typically reported in an aggregated format.</p>
      <p><strong>Advertisers.</strong> We may provide your  information to third party advertisers (and/or to their service  providers on their behalf) to market their products or services under  contractual requirement to keep your personally identifiable information  confidential and use it only to market and provide (directly and through third  parties engaged by them for such purpose) their products or services.&nbsp; You  may opt out of such disclosures by sending an e-mail to <a href="mailto:privacymanager@reedbusiness.com">privacymanager@reedbusiness.com</a><strong> </strong>with the subject line: “<em><strong>do not disclose.”&nbsp; </strong></em>We also aggregate information  about our collective users for potential advertisers who are interested in  understanding whether their offering would be suitable to our audience. This  information does not include personally identifiable information like your  company name or email address.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Transfers.</strong> It is possible  that our business may be merged with or sold to another business entity. During  such a transaction, business information is typically one of the assets shared  in the combined entity. In the event that this occurs, your personal  information will be protected by the BuyerZone privacy policy in effect at the  time. If your personal information will be used contrary to this policy, you  will receive notice as described in the "Notification of Changes"  section below.</p>
      <p><strong>Legal Requests.</strong> BuyerZone is  interested in protecting its members and the community at large. We will  release account and other personal information to legal authorities when we  believe it is appropriate to comply with the law, rules or regulations or to  protect persons or property. In addition, BuyerZone may choose to release  information about you to relevant parties in relation to investigations of  fraud, piracy or other unlawful activity.</p>
      <h2>INFORMATION SECURITY</h2>
      <p>Your information is stored on servers that are protected against unauthorized  access through the use of safeguards such as "firewalls," encryption  and Secure Socket Layers. We utilize many security techniques to protect your  personal information. However, it is impossible to guarantee a perfect security  system.</p>
      <h2>ACCOUNT INFORMATION AND PREFERENCES</h2>
      <p>BuyerZone provides a number of ways for you to manage your personal  information.</p>
      <p><strong>Account information.</strong> If you need  to update your account information, such as your contact email address, you may  do so by contacting our Customer Care department at <a href="mailto:customercare@buyerzone.com.">customercare@buyerzone.com</a>.</p>
      <p><strong>Notification Preferences.</strong> You have  the ability to "opt out" or unsubscribe from certain e-mail  communications, such as periodic surveys and our monthly email newsletter, that  are not related to a requested service and/or the status of your account. To  update your communication preferences, contact our Customer Care department at <a href="mailto:customercare@buyerzone.com.">customercare@buyerzone.com</a>.  If you do contact the Customer Care department, please be sure to specify the  type of email communication(s) from which you would like to opt out.  Information about how to unsubscribe is also included in every communication we  send.</p>
      <p><strong>Password.</strong> BuyerZone suppliers may  be issued a User ID and password to access their account. As a supplier, you  are responsible for all actions taken with your user ID and password, including  fees charged to your account. Do not share your password with any third  parties, as you may be legally liable for any fees that are incurred. If you  believe that your password has been compromised, you should immediately change  your password or contact Customer Care at <a href="mailto:customercare@buyerzone.com.">customercare@buyerzone.com</a> or 888-393-5000.</p>
      <h2>CHILDREN</h2>

      <h2>LEGAL DISCLAIMER</h2>
      <p>Although we have attempted to address the various privacy-related issues you  are likely to encounter, we cannot ensure that all of your private  communications and other personal information will never be disclosed in ways  not otherwise described in this privacy policy. Therefore, although we use  industry standard practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you  should not expect, that your personal information or private communications  will always remain private from unauthorized access.</p>
      <p>Also, BuyerZone contains links to  other sites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy  practices of these other sites. We encourage you to read the privacy statements  of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information.  This privacy policy applies to information collected by BuyerZone alone.</p>
      <h2>NOTIFICATION OF CHANGE</h2>
      <p>We may amend this privacy policy for minor changes at any time by posting the  amended terms on the Site. All minor amended terms shall be effective upon  posting. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you by  email or by posting a prominent notice for 30 days prior to the change taking  effect.</p>
