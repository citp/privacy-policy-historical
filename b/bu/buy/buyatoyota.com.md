From time to time, we may use your Personally Identifiable Information to enable you to participate in promotional activities, such as sweepstakes, contests, games, special events, blogs and chats ("Programs"). Sometimes Programs are made available through joint efforts with an affiliated or unaffiliated business partner. If you choose to participate, we may use the information you provide in connection with the Program as part of your Personally Identifiable Information. For example, we may send you email messages related to the Program or your account activity, or for selection and notification of sweepstakes or contest winners.

Your Personally Identifiable Information may also be shared with and used by our business partners or affiliate companies if you indicate your interest in receiving communications directly from that business partner or affiliate company.

Sometimes the rules, terms and conditions or disclaimers that apply to a particular Program include information on how we may use the information that you provide to us through your participation in the Program. If there is a conflict between the rules, terms and conditions that apply to a particular Program and this Privacy Policy, those terms and conditions applying to the particular Program will govern. Please review all of the information about a Program before you provide us with any personal information.
