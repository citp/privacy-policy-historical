<p><font size="2"><font color="#333333"><b>10. Sharing of Information</b></font><br>
BuyAFollower only shares personal information with other companies or individuals outside of BuyAFollower in the following limited circumstances:<br>

</font></p>

<p><font size="2"><font color="#333333"><b>a.</b></font> We have your consent. We require opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal information.<br>
<br>
<font color="#333333"><b>b.</b></font> We provide such information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies or other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of processing personal information on our behalf.

<br>
<font color="#333333"><b>c.</b></font> We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against imminent harm to the rights, property or safety of BuyAFollower, its users or the public as required or permitted by law. </font></p>
<br> 

<p><font size="2">If BuyAFollower becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will provide notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. Please <a href="contact.php" title="">contact us</a> for any additional questions about the management or use of personal data.</font></p>
<p><font size="2"><font color="#333333"><b>11. Security</b></font><br>

These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations. </font></p>
<p><font size="2"><font color="#333333"><b>12. Integrity</b></font><br>
BuyAFollower processes personal information only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this Privacy Policy or any applicable service-specific privacy notice.

When you use BuyAFollower services, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort. Some of our services have different procedures to access, correct or delete users’ personal information.</font></p>
