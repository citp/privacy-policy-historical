**The term "Bumrungrad Web" covers www.bumrungrad.com and www.e-vitallife.com (each a "website" and, collectively, the "Bumrungrad Web").**

**This privacy policy applies to Bumrungrad Web only and does not cover information collected on any third-party sites to which this Bumrungrad Weblinks. This policy covers information collected in conjunction with the use of Bumrungrad Web; it does not apply to patient medical records (which have their own, stricter privacy and confidentiality policies).**

**This privacy policy is part of, and must be read in conjunction with, Bumrungrad Web's Terms of Use. You can read the entire Terms of Use by clicking here or the menu at the bottom of every page of Bumrungrad Web.

  **Purpose of the Privacy Statement:**  
Bumrungrad Web respects the privacy of visitors to this Bumrungrad Web and understands that information about you, your health, and your health care is sensitive. Bumrungrad Web will not sell or rent your personally identifiable information.

We encourage you to read this Internet Privacy Statement before using this Bumrungrad Web or submitting information. By using Bumrungrad Web, you acknowledge that you understand and agree to the terms of the Internet Privacy Statement.

  **Information Voluntarily Provided by Users:**

You can visit much of Bumrungrad Web without telling us who you are or providing us with other personally identifiable information. Some areas of the Bumrungrad Web allow you to contact us to ask questions or provide comments. When you communicate with us and request a response, we ask for your name and contact information. We use this information so that we can respond more efficiently and keep track of our correspondence.

When you request an appointment we will ask for additional information. Our purpose is to begin identifying your medical and timing needs so that we can propose or schedule the appropriate services for you. This also helps us begin setting up a record for you, so that registration is easier when you arrive at the hospital. Finally, by requesting some basic information we discourage correspondence from those who are not serious about their healthcare, or might be contacting us for the wrong reasons. This allows us to focus more attention on patients who genuinely seek our help.

  **Use and Disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information That You Provide Voluntarily:**

If you do provide us with personally identifiable information, such as your name, postal address, e-mail address, telephone number, you agree that we may contact you through a variety of means such as postal mail, phone, or e-mail to provide you with information we believe may be of interest to you, unless you opt out of this service by contacting us as indicated below.

  **Use and Disclosure of Non-Personally Identifiable Information:**
