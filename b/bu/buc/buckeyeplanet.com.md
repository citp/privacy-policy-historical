INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE

BP generally collects personal information with your specific knowledge and consent. For instance, when you register for any portion of BP's services, enter a sweepstakes or contest, or complete a survey, you are asked to provide, among other things, information like your e mail address, name, telephone number, fax number, and information about interest in our services, products, and programs. Optional demographic information may also be requested. The more information you provide, the better we are able to customize our services to suit your needs and preferences.

In addition, when you use BP's website and/or service(s), we may also automatically collect information about you or your computer, including without limitation, the internet address that you just came from, the internet address that you go to next, the internet address that referred you, the type of browser software you are using, the domain name of your Internet Service provider, and your Internet Protocol address.

USE OF INFORMATION PROVIDED BY YOU

BP uses the information you supply to provide you with the services that you request.

Similarly, if you enter one of our contests or sweepstakes, we will use the information provided to notify you if you win. We may also use the information supplied to communicate with you about new features, products or services, and/or to improve the services that we offer to you.

BP may, as necessary, allow access to our database to third parties that provide us services, such as, the technical maintenance of our website. BP limits such access for the purposes of providing our website and/or services.

As our business changes, we may buy or sell various assets. In the event all or a portion of the assets owned by BP are sold, assigned, transferred or acquired, the information from and about BP's users may be among the transferred assets.

Our website uses cookies (i.e., small bits of text that our servers place into a file on your computer's hard drive).

"PRIVATE" MESSAGING

Our website offers an in-house means of communication called 'Private Messaging.' BP reserves the right to read and transfer these messages under extraordinary circumstances, including but not limited to examples such as legal compulsion by authorities, unlawful physical threats or activities, and mass spamming. In six years, we have only had to do this twice, and we do not maintain administrative tools to accomplish the task. We leave it a difficult undertaking because we abhor the practice under anything less than obligation by law. If you require an off-site means of communication, use email.

CHILDREN UNDER 13 YEARS OLD
