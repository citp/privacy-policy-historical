#### Personal Information

Buca strives to maintain precautions, internal controls and procedures to ensure that the personal information you share with Buca is handled in a safe, secure and responsible manner.  Buca employs security measures and safeguards to help protect the confidentiality and integrity of personal information and to reduce the risk of loss, unauthorized access, misuse, disclosure or alteration of the personal information in Buca's control.  Remember that any information or data transmitted electronically using the internet may not be absolutely secure. Buca assumes no liability for the loss of any information that you transmit to us using the internet.

#### Credit Card

Because your credit card security is a high priority, Buca and Buca's third party processing merchants take numerous steps to ensure your payment information is processed confidentially.  Website use is secured during transmission using industry standard e-commerce security technology such as Transport Layer Security (TLS) and its predecessor, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), encryption technology. Buca uses TLS and SSL technology to prevent such information from being intercepted and read as it is transmitted over the Internet.

Buca understands if you do not feel comfortable sending your credit card information to us over the Internet; therefore, Buca will accept your valid payment when you visit a Buca restaurant location or contact a Buca restaurant location via telephone. If you wish to purchase a gift card please visit the nearest Buca restaurant and indicate that you wish to purchase a gift card.

#### Linking To Third Party Websites

When you click on Website links that may navigate you to a third-party website, you will be subject to that third party's privacy policy.  While Buca supports the protection of privacy on the internet, Buca is not responsible for the actions of any third-party websites.  Buca encourages you to carefully read and review the posted privacy statements of any and every website you visit, whether you are linking from the Website or browsing on your own.
