        directly. Using the information you give us, we may contact you with information or
        special offers. We will not require you to disclose more information that is reasonable
        necessary to participate in an activity as a condition or participation. The Buckle, Inc.
        will not sell or disclose personal information to outside third parties. If you do not
        wish to be contacted by us in the future, simply reply to the unwanted e-mail message and

        their children to explore our site together and participate in our online drawings, Buckle
        Talk e-mails and other promotional activities. In accordance with the Children’s
        Online Privacy Protection Act, we are requesting that any guest who is under 13 years of
        age provide us with the name and e-mail address of a parent or guardian whom we may
        contact in order to obtain consent prior to collecting or using any personal information
        from such pre-teen guest. The Buckle, Inc. will contact the parent or guardian via e-mail
        and request his/her consent for the pre-teen’s registration and The Buckle,
        Inc.’s internal use of such information. A parent or guardian may view the
        pre-teen’s registration information, ask to have it deleted and/or refuse to allow
        any further collection or use of the pre-teen’s information. Any such requests should

        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><strong>Transaction Security:&nbsp; </strong>We have made
        every effort to ensure that the information transmitted to us online is secure through the
        use of a secure server. With respect to online sales, the person whose name appears on the
        card must be the one who places the order.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The Buckle uses secure sockets layer (SSL) for securing
        communications and transactions across the Internet.&nbsp; The SSL protocol uses digital
        certificates to create and secure, confidential communications "pip" between the
        purchaser and our web entity.&nbsp; Data transmitted over an SSL connection can not be
        tampered with or forged without the two parties becoming immediately aware of the
        tampering.&nbsp; A key or padlock icon in the lower corner of the browser window
        identifies the security mode of a browser.&nbsp; When the browser is running in
        "normal" mode, the key looks broken or the padlock looks open.&nbsp; Once an SSL
        connection has been established, the key becomes whole, or the padlock becomes closed,
        indicating that the browser is not in "secure" mode.&nbsp; SSL is supported in
        the vast majority of browsers, which means that almost anyone with a browser can benefit
        from SSL encryption.</font></p>
