### BuzzCity Account

You may access some of our services by signing up for a BuzzCity Account and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address and a password). Some of the account information will be used to authenticate you when you access BuzzCity services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can edit your account at any time through your BuzzCity Account settings.

### Cookie

A cookie is a small file containing data that is sent to your computer when you visit an Internet site. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may be used to store user preferences and other information. You can delete all or some cookies, configure your browser to refuse cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some Internet site features or services may not work properly or function as intended without cookies.

### IP address

Every computer connected to the Internet is assigned a source identifier known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These identifiers are usually assigned in organisation-based or country-based blocks, hence an IP address can often be used to identify the country from which a computer is connecting to the Internet.

### Non-personally identifiable information

This is information that is recorded about users such that it does not reflect or reference an individually identifiable user.

### Personal information

This is information which you provide to a service provider or an Internet site which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address or billing information, or other data which can be reasonably linked to an individual or organisation.

### Pixel tag

A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on an Internet site or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking activity on Internet sites, or when emails are opened or accessed, and is often used in combination with cookies.

### Sensitive personal information

This is a particular category of personal information relating to confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs or sexuality.

### Server logs

On most Internet sites, servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit the sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.  
Here is an example of a typical log entry where the search is for “cars”, followed by a breakdown of its parts:

`98.76.54.321 - 01/Feb/2010 10:20:30 - http://www.mysite.com/index?q=search - Firefox 22.0.1; Windows NT 6.2 – abcdef1234567890`

  * `98.76.54.321` is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the Internet Service Provider; depending on the service, a same or different address may be assigned to users by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet;
  * `01/Feb/2010 10:20:30` is the date and time of the query;
  * `http://www.mysite.com/index?q=search` is the requested URL, including the search query;
  * `Firefox 22.0.1; Windows NT 6.2` is the browser and operating system being used; and
  * `abcdef1234567890` is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer during the first visit (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last visit, then a new cookie ID may be assigned to the user during the next visit from the particular computer).



### Unique device identifier

A unique device identifier consists of several characters that is incorporated into a device by its manufacturer or by the network operator and can be used to uniquely identify that device. Different device identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed. A given device may have one or more different unique device identifiers. Unique device identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, information synchronization services such as for email, mobile application stores, remembering the preferences of users and for providing relevant advertising.
