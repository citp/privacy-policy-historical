### Tracking Technologies

**Log Files**  
BuzzBoard also collects anonymous demographic information, which is not unique to you, such as your ZIP code, age, gender, preferences, interests, and favorites using log files.

There is also information about your computer hardware, tablet hardware and software that is automatically collected by BuzzBoard. This information can include: your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times, geo-location, actions on the platform, and referring website addresses. This information is used by BuzzBoard for the operation of the service, to maintain quality of the service, and to provide general statistics regarding the use of BuzzBoard website and/or BuzzBoard and/or other BuzzBoard products and services. For these purposes, we do link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information such as name, email address, address, and phone number.

**Cookies**  
The BuzzBoard website uses “cookies” to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web server. Cookies are not used to run programs, or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.

**Advertising**  
We partner with a third party ad network to either display advertising on our website, or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our ad network partner uses cookies and web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this and other websites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests. If you do not wish to have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt out by clicking here [http://preferences.truste.com/](http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/). Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads.

**Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)**  
We employ [or our third party advertising partner employs] a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. web beacons/web bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages, and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We tie [do not tie] the information gathered by clear gifs to our customer’s personally identifiable information.

We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications, and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.

**Third Party Tracking Technologies**  
The use of cookies and web beacons by any tracking utility company is not covered by our privacy statement. We do not have access or control over these third party tracking technologies.

**Legal Disclaimer**  
BuzzBoard websites will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law, or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law, or comply with legal process served on BuzzBoard or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of BuzzBoard (including enforcing this agreement); and, (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of BuzzBoard or the public.

**Access to Personally Identifiable Information**  
If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct, update, request deletion on our site by emailing us at [support@buzzboard.com](mailto:support@buzzboard.com) to our Privacy team. We will respond to all access requests within 30 days. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.

If you request that your user information be deleted from our records, there may be a brief delay in our processing that request, as we will verify that the request is valid and originates from you as opposed to an unauthorized third party. If you request that your information be deleted, we reserve the right to terminate and/or limit your access to the BuzzBoard website.

If you provide BuzzBoard with user information, you have the following rights with respect to that information:

  * To review the user information that, you have supplied to us
  * To request that we correct any errors, outdated information, or omissions in user information that you have supplied to us
  * To request that your user information not be used to contact you
  * To request that your user information be removed from any solicitation list that we use
  * To request that your user information be deleted from our records
  * To opt out of being solicited by this website or third parties



To exercise any of these rights, please contact us at [support@buzzboard.com](mailto:support@buzzboard.com) __

**Security of your Personal Information**  
No method of safeguarding information is 100% secure. BuzzBoard uses a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. BuzzBoard secures the personally identifiable information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When sensitive personal information (such as a credit card number) is collected on our site and/or transmitted to other websites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.
