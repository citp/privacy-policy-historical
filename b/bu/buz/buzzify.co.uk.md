# Privacy Policy - Buzzify

This Privacy Policy has been prepared to meet the requirements of the Data Protection Act 1998, and it only relates to the collection, protection, disclosure and use of personal data belonging to living individuals. It does not relate to data, which emanates from companies or other entities. Buzzify is registered with the Information Commissioner’s Office (“ICO”) under the Act with registration number ZA007309 and will act as the data controller.

This Policy (together with our Terms & Conditions and Cookie Policy and any other documents referred to in it) sets out the basis on which any personal data we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be processed by us. Please read the following carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your personal data.

### 1\. INFORMATION WE MAY COLLECT FROM YOU

1.1 We may collect and process the following data about you:

1.1.1 information that you may provide by filling in online forms and registration forms on this website (the “Site”), and we may also ask you for information in the event you report a problem with our Site;

1.1.2 correspondence, or a record of it should you contact us;

1.1.3 surveys that we use for research purposes, which we may ask you to complete, although you do not have to respond to them;

1.1.4 details of your visits to our Site (including, but not limited to, traffic data, location data, weblogs and other communication data, whether this is required for our own billing purposes or otherwise) and the resources that you access;

1.1.5 information to help verify your identity;

1.1.6 information from third parties in respect of you, which may include your employer, a referee or a person residing or working from another country.

### 2\. IP ADDRESSES AND COOKIES

Please also refer to the Cookie Policy.

2.1 A “cookie” is a small electronic file that collects information when someone visits a website. A cookie can identify the pages that are being viewed, and this can assist us to select the pages that the viewer sees. Some cookies only exist whilst viewers are online, but “persistent” cookies – which are not session-based – remain on the viewer’s computer, so that he or she can be recognised as a previous visitor when he or she next visits our Site. This allows us to collect information about a viewer’s browsing habits whilst on our Site, and this can be useful in assisting us to monitor and improve our services.

2.2 We do not store sensitive information such as account numbers or passwords in “persistent” cookies, and cookies in themselves, do not contain enough information to identify you. You will only acquire a personal identity in relation to your browsing habits after you have formally provided us with your personal data for the purposes outlined below.

2.3 In addition to using cookies, we might also use web tools to collect information about your browsing activities whilst on our Site. In this respect the information that is provided is similar to the information supplied by cookies, and we use it for the same purposes.

2.4 Any information that we acquire about you using cookies or web tools is subject to the same restrictions and conditions as any other information we collect about you.

2.5 Some of our advertisers may also use cookies or web tools that are set by other people such as advertising agencies, or the businesses to which the advertisements in question relate. We do not have access to any information that might be collected in this way, and, if you are concerned, you should contact the advertiser for more information.

2.6 If you want to delete any cookies already stored on your computer or stop the cookies that keep track of your browsing patterns on the Site, you can do so by deleting your existing cookies and/or altering your browser’s privacy settings to block third party cookies (the process you follow will differ from browser to browser). Please note that deleting our cookies or disabling our future cookies means that you may not be able to access certain areas or features of the Site

### 3\. WHERE WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL DATA

3.1 Buzzify employs industry standard security measures to ensure the security of all data. Any data that is stored on Buzzify secure servers is treated as proprietary and confidential and is not available to the public.

Buzzify routinely evaluates its data security practices to identify security threats or opportunities for improvement.

3.2 No transmission of data over the Internet is guaranteed to be completely secure. It may be possible for third parties not under the control of Buzzify to intercept or access transmissions or private communications unlawfully. While we strive to protect your data, Buzzify cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us.
