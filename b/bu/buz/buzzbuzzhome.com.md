BuzzBuzzHome has created this Privacy Policy in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to your privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this Web site. 

We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our web site. Your IP address is also used to gather broad, aggregated demographic information. Our site may use cookies to make sure you do not see the same ad repeatedly (although, at the present time we do not plan on hosting any advertisements on our site). We use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests, to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our site, and for the other purposes set out below: 

We use cookies to remind us who you are and to find your account information in our database when you access a service so you do not need to log in at every visit. This helps us to provide you with service tailored to your specific needs and interests. A cookie is created when you register for a service. 

We use cookies to estimate our audience size. Your browser is given a unique cookie that helps us determine whether yours is a repeat visit or a first visit. 

We use cookies to determine the browser the visitor uses so the site can be designed to work properly with the most common versions of different browsers. 

Again, although we do not intend to host advertisements on BuzzBuzzHome, should we ever decide to, advertisers that place ads with BuzzBuzzHome.com have the right to use cookies at their discretion. 

Our site's registration forms require users to give us your first name, last name, email address and password. BuzzBuzzHome does not use or disclose personal information for purposes other than those for which it was collected, except with the consent of the individual or as required by law. BuzzBuzzHome retains personal information only as long as necessary for the fulfillment of those purposes. 

This site contains links to third party sites. BuzzBuzzHome is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such web sites. BuzzBuzzHome's co-branded sites and content partner sites may have privacy policies independent of BuzzBuzzHome. This Privacy Policy extends only to data collected on pages hosted on BuzzBuzzHome servers. BuzzBuzzHome may share aggregate information with trading partners, co-branded sites, and advertisers. However, this aggregated information does not contain personally identifiable information. 

Demographic and profile data is used to tailor our visitor's experience at our site and display the content according to their preferences. This information is shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis only. 

SECURITY

This site has reasonable security measures in place to protect against loss, misuse and interception by third parties. BuzzBuzzHome assumes no liability for interception, alteration or misuse of information transmitted over the Internet. 

CHOICE/OPT-OUT

In the Registration process where we request information about the visitor, our site provides users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving email or other forms of communications from BuzzBuzzHome. To opt-out of receiving emails click on the “track” tab and change the email alert frequency to no alert for search alerts and development alerts.
