  2. **Collection**


  * 2.1. The data we collect about you depends on the Services that you use (and how you use them). If you register as a user of any of our Services, we may ask you to provide your name, email address, contact telephone number (landline and/or mobile), the company you work for, your address, a username and password, and other data relevant to the Services we provide. If you are not an administrative user for your account, the same data about you may be provided by a colleague or other third party. We may also collect other data directly from you, from time to time.


  * 2.2. We collect payment data from you in order to take payment for our Services.


  * 2.3. If you contact our support services, we will collect the data we need to categorize your question and respond to it. We also use this data to track potential issues with our Services and customize our support responses to better serve you.


  * 2.4. We collect data about you when you use any part of our Services. For example, if you are logged in to your BuzzSumo account, we will collect data as to how often you use our Services, what content you looked at or what alerts you created, and other data about how you interact with our Services. We may also collect data about how you interact with messages we send to you, for example whether you opened an email or read an in-app message.


  * 2.5. We collect data about the device you use to use our Services, including operating system details, web browser type, your mobile device identifier and mobile operating system, and the name of your ISP or mobile carrier. We may also collect your location data if your device permits this.

We will also explain the consequences should you decide not to provide information which we have indicated is mandatory. In some circumstances this may mean we are unable to provide you with a certain service or product.


  3. **Using your data**


  * 3.1. The legal basis for our processing of data about you is generally pursuant to our “legitimate interests”. Our legitimate interests are in providing our Services to our customers, which includes providing technology that empowers our customers to act with more certainty in a way that is easy-to-access and use. However, the legal basis for our processing of data may also be where we have your consent (for example where consent is required to send certain marketing communications), where the processing is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations (for example where we receive requests from regulatory authorities), or necessary for the performance of a contract (for example to process your login information so that you can use our Services).


  * 3.2. We use data and content that you and other users provide or make available to us to provide the Services to you and our other customers. We also use data to conduct research and development for the improvement of our Services so that we can provide all of our users with a better experience.

In respect of marketing communications, you can opt out of receiving future communications in the footer of each email we send to you.
