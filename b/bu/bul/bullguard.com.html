TRUSTe is an independent organisation whose mission is to build

<p>If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you
may contact BullGuard directly by using the contact information
printed at the end of this statement.<br>
<br>
If you do not receive acknowledgment of your inquiry or your
inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should then
contact TRUSTe: <a href="http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php">http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php</a><br>
<br>
TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with the Web site to resolve

<br>
BullGuard takes privacy issues very seriously. When you visit our
Web site we want it to be completely transparent which personal
data are collected and kept by BullGuard and our partners, and the
choices you have to correct or avoid providing these data. Certain
services, such as online payments, can only be performed with a
transfer of personal details, whilst other details are collected to
map the choices of our customers, in order to improve the BullGuard
products and Web site. The important part is that you have to make
an informed choice as to which data you wish to provide. The text
below sets out what kind of data we collect, how we collect it, how
we keep it, with whom we share it, how you can change it and how
you can avoid providing it. Your trust is very important to
us.<br>
<br>
The information that we collect helps us personalise and
continually improve your experience with BullGuard. This Privacy
Statement describes BullGuard's approach to privacy and how we
collect and use any personal information about you. This will
enable you to make choices as to whether you wish to supply such
information.<br>
<br>
This Privacy Statement is subject to changes. Any changes in our
privacy policy or practices regarding personally identifiable
information will be posted on this Web site 30 days before they
take effect. If we make material changes to this policy, we will
notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home
page<em>.</em><br>
<br>
<br>

it</strong><br>
<br>

always indicate this in your account settings at: <a href="/login.aspx">https://www.bullguard.com/login.aspx</a><br>

<br>
<br>
<strong>Website statistics</strong><br>
<br>
While you visit the BullGuard Web site, we use your IP address to
track your activity and log your browser type, which pages you
view, how you got to our Web site and any links you use to leave
our site. At no point is this correlated with any personal
information. These patterns provide us with useful information as
to what you as a customer expect from our site and how we can
improve content and navigational tools. It is important to
emphasise that we do not track you once you leave the BullGuard Web
site.<br>
<br>
We take advantage of the third-party tracking services provided by
Index Tools, who use cookies to track non-personally identifiable
information about visitors to our site. As part of this process,
the type of operating system used, screen settings and IP addresses
are captured to provide volume statistics and track the success of
our marketing and public information programmes.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>What we do with the information</strong><br>
<br>
Information about our customers is an important part of our
business, and we do not share or sell your information with third
parties for their promotional use. We may share it with third
parties who would use it solely to ensure we are providing you with
the best user experience.<br>
<br>
We share customer information only with companies acting as agents
on behalf of BullGuard. We use an agent to process your payments on
our site when you make a purchase. Our agents are not authorized to
use your financial information for any other purposes beyond
fulfilling your payment.<br>
When you create a profile on our forums, we display your username,
on our site. We provide you the option of either displaying or
hiding your email address and allowing users to contact you via
email. You should be aware that any personally identifiable
information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by
other users of these forums, and could be used to send you
unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally
identifiable information that you choose to submit in these
forums.<br>
<br>
We use your personally identifiable information including your
name, email and address to register your account on our site so you
can manage your purchases, to register you &amp; create your
profile on our forums. We also associate your IP address with your
account to determine geographic location. We also use your
collected name &amp; email to service your "Live Chat"
requests.<br>
<br>
As we continue to develop our business, we may sell or buy other
companies or entities. In such transactions, customer information
is generally one of the transferred business assets. In the event
that BullGuard or substantially all of its assets are acquired,
customer information may be one of the transferred assets. Any such
change in ownership will be displayed on this website's homepage
and communicated directly to users who have submitted their e-mail
address to us 30 days prior to such a sale to provide you the
choice to opt-out of having your information transferred.<br>
<br>
We will share your personally identifiable information with third
parties when we find it necessary to so such as to comply with a
government subpoena, court order or judicial proceeding. We may
also share your information in the event that it was necessary in
protecting the copyrights or safety of BullGuard and or its
users.<br>
