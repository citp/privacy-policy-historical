# BullGuard | Privacy Policy

BullGuard Limited (“BullGuard”) is committed to protecting and respecting your privacy.

**Scope of this policy**

This policy provides an overview of the privacy practices exercised by BullGuard in relation to your use of its website at [www.bullguard.com](http://www.bullguard.com/) (the “site”) and its products and services, unless any terms and conditions under which products or services are provided to you indicate otherwise. 

Please take the time to read this policy carefully and to ensure that you understand BullGuard’s views and practices regarding your personal information and how it will be treated.  If you require further clarification or guidance on any point you are invited to Contact Us  with your questions.  

By visiting the site or using any of BullGuard’s products or services you are deemed to accept and consent to the practices described in this policy.

**Information BullGuard may collect**

BullGuard may collect and process the following data about you:

  * **\- Information you provide.** You may give BullGuard information about yourself by filling in forms on the site or by corresponding with BullGuard by phone, e-mail, chat or otherwise. This includes information you provide when you register and use a BullGuard account, purchase and manage products, use the help centre or technical support centre, participate in forums or other social media functions on the site and if you report a problem with the BullGuard site or a product. The information you provide may include your name, address, e-mail address, phone number and financial and credit card information.
  * **\- Information BullGuard collects about you.** When you visit the site or use its products BullGuard may automatically collect the following information:


  *    \- technical information, including the Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer or mobile device to the Internet, your login information, browser type and version, devices used or which connect to your network from time to time, time zone setting, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system and platform;
  *    \- information about your visit, including the full Uniform Resource Locators (URL) clickstream to, through and from the site (including date and time); products you viewed or searched for; page response times, download errors, length of visits to certain pages, page interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs), and methods used to browse away from the page.


  * **\- Information BullGuard receives from other sources.** BullGuard works closely with third parties (including, for example, business partners and sub-contractors in technical, payment and delivery services, advertising networks, analytics providers, search information providers, credit reference agencies) and may receive information about you from them.
  *  



The information that BullGuard collects and processes about you as described above falls into two broad categories: **Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”)** which is information that can be used to identify you as an individual and **Non-Personally Identifiable Information (“NPII”)** which is information that cannot be used to identify you as an individual.  In general, information of the type listed under the headings “Information you provide” and “Information BullGuard receives from other sources” will be PII whilst “Information BullGuard collects about you” will be NPII.  Where “Information BullGuard collects about you” contains any PII BullGuard will anonymise the information for statistical and analytics purposes.  With the exception of your IP address, which BullGuard will link to your BullGuard account for the purpose of identifying your geographic location, BullGuard never correlates NPII with PII that it holds.

**Additional collection of NPII in respect of Mobile Products**

When you download the BullGuard mobile security and antivirus product and install it on your mobile device, BullGuard collects further Non-Personally Identifiable Information (NPII). During the mobile product download and installation process BullGuard collects NPII using the Google Analytics Software Development Kit (the Analytics SDK).  The Analytics SDK allows BullGuard to measure user interactions with its mobile products by collecting the electronic “pings” emitted by a device each time it lands on a different page during the download and installation process.  BullGuard collects data about the total number of devices landing on each page which it can break down to show statistical data for the different device types and languages used.  The Analytics SDK is not used by BullGuard to track the usage path for individual devices and cannot be linked by BullGuard to any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) that it holds on any individual.

  If you do not wish BullGuard to collect additional NPII please refrain from downloading and installing BullGuard mobile products.

**Uses made of the information**

BullGuard uses information about you in the following ways: 

  * \- **PII.** BullGuard will use this information:


  *    \- to carry out obligations arising from any contracts entered into with you and to provide you with the information, products and services that you request;

  *    \- to provide you with reminders and renewal notifications relating to the BullGuard products and services that you use;
  *    \- to notify you about changes to BullGuard’s services or terms;
  *    \- to ensure that content from the site is presented in the most effective manner for you and for your computer;

  *    \- to measure or understand the effectiveness of advertising served to users of the site and to target relevant advertising to users by demographic.
  *    \- BullGuard uses the additional NPII collected during downloading of mobile products to identify general user trends which can help it to ensure that the download and installation process for its mobile products is as efficient as possible, quickly identify the existence of any technical fault preventing users from downloading and/or installing mobile products.

**Where BullGuard stores your personal data & how it keeps data secure**

The data that BullGuard collects from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for BullGuard or for one of BullGuard’s suppliers. Such staff may be engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.

BullGuard asks you not to share a password with anyone.

Any payment information that you provide is passed directly to a payment processor over a secure connection.  Only the payment processor will store the entire credit card number.  BullGuard stores the last 4 digits of your credit card number and the expiry date so that it can offer you automatic renewal of subscriptions and provide you with reminder notifications if your card has expired.  During the order process you may be directed onto pages hosted by BullGuard's online payment provider.  Such pages will maintain the look and feel of the BullGuard sites but will identify the online payment provider in the URL.
