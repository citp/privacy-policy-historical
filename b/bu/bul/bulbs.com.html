				<br>
				<font class="title">bulbs.com Assures Your Privacy</font><br>
				When you visit any web site, your computer exchanges information with 
				other computers. Except for information or commands you enter yourself, most of this process eliminates your need to enter 
				numerous technical codes. That's what makes your bulbs.com experience so user friendly! At bulbs.com, we support your right 
				to decide what information you share and how it is used!<br><br>

				At bulbs.com, we take security very seriously. All of our employees 
				have reviewed our Privacy Policy. They must log in to a secure administration site with a username and password to
				view any customer/sales information. Our security is checked monthly by our technical team, so you can rest assured
				that your information is private. For transferring sensitive information such as credit card accounts, we rely on 
				Verisign's secure encryption technology.<br><br>

				<i>If this policy is ever changed, all users will be notified via email
				of the changes.</i><br><br><br>

				<font class="ctitle"><a name="anchor1">1. What visitor information does bulbs.com gather or keep track of? Why?</a></font><p></p>
				
				<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">We gather information with the following objectives in mind:<br>

				</font></p><ol><li><font face="Arial">To fulfill your order accurately and quickly.</font></li><font face="Arial">
				<li>To learn how we can improve your purchasing experience.</li>
				<li>To help us meet our commitment to privacy.</li>
				<li>To facilitate convenient re-ordering each time you visit bulbs.com.</li></font></ol><p></p>

				<font class="title">Information You Yourself Enter:</font><br>

				<font face="Arial">When you visit bulbs.com, you have the option of getting a bulbs.com username. Getting 
				a username is easy:<br>

				<ol><li>You enter your name and e-mail address.</li>
				<li>You choose your own username (we check that somebody else isn't already using it).</li>
				<li>You choose and confirm a password, or you can ask us to remember you automatically.</li></ol></font><p></p>

				<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">By getting a bulbs.com user name, you get free access to these valuable features:<br>

				</font></p><ul><li><font face="Arial">Unlimited access to your personal account history, saved for easy re-ordering/account review.</font></li><font face="Arial">
				<li>Get access to special promotions and our newsletter.</li>
				<li>View delivery details, tracking, and order-status instantly.</li></font></ul><p></p>

				<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">If you choose not to get a username, you can still see prices online, but you can't 
				get a full quote (i.e., case lot discounts or volume purchase discounts related to your order). You must have a username to 
				place an order from bulbs.com.</font></p>

				<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">At any point while you're browsing, you can record an item in your personal account. 
				When you're done browsing, you can revisit your personal account, and if you want to place an order, you indicate the 
				item(s) and click the <b>Click to Pay</b> button. This takes you to a screen which asks for shipping information: name, 
				address, and preferred contact time/method in case we need to get in touch with you about your order. The same screen also 
				gives you a price quote for the item(s) you're ordering, including price, any applicable sales tax, discounts, promotions, 
				handling, and delivery costs (applicable only if a shipping method other than UPS Ground is selected).</font></p>

				<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The <b>Complete Order</b> button then takes you to a screen which offers options for 
				payment: you can enter credit card information, or you can opt to contact us by e-mail or phone about paying by (Check, 
				Money Order, Purchase Order).</font></p><font face="Arial">

				<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The information gathered as part of your purchasing is used <i>only</i> to process 
				your purchase. The only information that is ever shared with anyone is:<br>

				</font></p><ul><li><font face="Arial">Credit card or check information, with the financial institution that processes your payment</font></li><font face="Arial">
				<li>Your name/company, the contents of your order, and transaction number with our distributor</li>
				<li>Shipping information, with the shipper.</li></font></ul><p></p>

				<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Your information may also be collected from the Job Opportunities page (email address 
				and resume), Contact Us (email and name), and Ask Dr. Bulb (email, name, and optional phone number).</font></p>

				<font class="title">Information Tracked Automatically</font><br>

				<font face="Arial">When you log onto the Internet, your computer connects to your Internet service, 
				declaring its on-line presence by requesting an IP (Internet protocol) address-- sort of like asking for an assigned seat in 
				an electronic classroom. Your Internet service's computer responds by placing you at a particular set for the session. Some 
				providers assign you a permanent or "static" IP address, but most use temporary ones. This helps assure your privacy, because 
				it's difficult-to-impossible to collect personal information about you via a temporary address.</font><br><br>

				<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Our site keeps a general list of visitors' IP addresses. This gives us broad, generic 
				information such as how many AOL® users log onto bulbs.com, and it helps us maintain bulbs.com's compatibility with many 
				different Internet services.</font></p>

				</font><p align="justify"><font face="Arial">bulbs.com records browser types and versions so we can answer questions such as, "How many of our visitors 
				were using Internet Explorer 4.0® last month?" That tells us what portions of our site visitors can and can not use, 
				motivating us to keep our web site up to date.</font></p>

				<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">We record how many people visit each page on our site. This helps answer questions 
				such as, "What items or pages are drawing a lot of interest this month?"</font></p>

				<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">We may also record which site or search engine referred you to bulbs.com. This 
				information enhances your shopping experience: images look better, pages load more quickly, and bulbs.com remains compatible 
				with more browsers and systems.</font></p>

				<font class="title">Why we use Cookies</font><br>
				
				When you visit bulbs.com, we send you back a <u>cookie</u>- a list of data which 
				enhances your shopping convenience. This information is only available to be sent back to the computer that sent it to 
				you so that you can create a list of those items you are purchasing.<br><br>

				<br><br><img src="themes/spacer_line.gif" width="100%" height="1"><br><br><br>
				
				<font class="ctitle"><a name="anchor2">2. What does bulbs.com do with this information?</a></font><br><br>

				<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">bulbs.com is deeply committed to keeping your information secure. We use the 
				information you share with us to fulfill your order or inquiry and to keep you up-to-date on the status of your order. 
				bulbs.com will automatically inform you via email of the completion of your order the moment it is shipped out to you.</font></p>

				<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">The financial institution processing your payment may send us supplemental 
				information if a problem is encountered while completing your transaction. Likewise, the shipping carrier may send 
				us supplemental information if a problem is encountered during/with delivery. This information is used only in processing 
				your order(s) from bulbs.com.</font></p>

				<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">If you sign up for our optional newsletter, we'll send you email messages from time 
				to time announcing what's new and exciting at bulbs.com, including special offers and promotions. Every email newsletter 
				from bulbs.com includes instructions for unsubscribing.</font></p><font face="Arial">

				<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Information about your browser helps us improve our site's appearance and 
				currency/compatibility with your system. We need traffic reports (information about sites that refer visitors to us) so that 
				we can select the best places to reach people interested in shopping for light bulbs online.</font></p><font face="Arial">

				<br><br><img src="themes/spacer_line.gif" width="100%" height="1"><br><br><br>
				
				<font class="ctitle"><a name="anchor3">3. Does bulbs.com ever share such information? With whom?</a></font><br><br>

				<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">We do not sell, rent, share, trade or give away any of the information you provide us, 
				with exception to the financial institution that processes your payment and the shipping carrier that delivers your order. 
				No third party will solicit you as a result of the information you provide to us.</font></p>

				<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">bulbs.com offers you an email link on the <b>Help</b> page, so you can write to us with 
				comments or ask for information. Any email you send us is kept confidential and will not be posted on our site without your 
				written permission.</font></p>

				<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">In the unlikely event that bulbs.com, Inc., or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.  </font></p>


				<br><br><img src="themes/spacer_line.gif" width="100%" height="1"><br><br><br>

				<font class="ctitle"><a name="anchor3"></a><a name="anchor4">4. Can I tell bulbs.com <u>not</u> to gather or keep track of 
				information I've provided? How?</a></font><br><br>

				<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Yes. You can set your browser not to accept cookies, but if you do you will not be 
				able to place orders online. If you place an order online and your browser is set to receive cookies, we have the ability 
				to review which pages/items you viewed on our site and requested quotes for.</font></p>

				<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">You always have the option of placing your order via phone, fax or postal mail. Please 
				see the <b>Help</b> page on bulbs.com for details on how to do this.</font></p>

				<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">If you've opted to receive our email newsletter, you'll find instructions for removing 
				yourself from our subscriber list at the end of each newsletter.</font></p>

				<br><br><img src="themes/spacer_line.gif" width="100%" height="1"><br><br><br>

				<font class="ctitle"><a name="anchor3"></a><a name="anchor5">5. How do I correct or update information about me and my order(s)?</a></font><br><br>

				<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">If you would like to change, correct, or update information about you or your order in 
				any way prior to shipment, please contact our Customer Service representatives at 1-888-455-2800.</font></p>

				<p align="justify"><font face="Arial">If you have subscribed to our email newsletter and would like to change the email
