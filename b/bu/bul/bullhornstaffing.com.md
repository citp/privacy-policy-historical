### Bullhorn Safe Harbor Privacy Policy Statement

Bullhorn is committed to the highest standards of data privacy rights for its customers and partners. In addition to our web privacy policy, Bullhorn self-certifies with the U.S. Department of Commerce's EU Safe Harbor Framework which concerns the transfer of data from the European Union to the United States.

Bullhorn complies with the U.S. - E.U. Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of personal data from European Union member countries. To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view Bullhorn's certification, please visit <http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/>.

The Department of Commerce's Safe Harbor Framework provides a set of principles that support the EU Data Directive of data protection. The following principles are part of Bullhorn's privacy protection process and are used in the collection and handling of data from the European Union.

  * Security - Bullhorn takes reasonable precautions in its protection of data and any misuse, loss, destruction, alteration, and unauthorized access or disclosure.
  * Access - Bullhorn will provide access to personal information to individuals and allow them to correct, amend, or delete information where it is inaccurate unless the cost of such access is prohibitive in relation to the risk of privacy or where the rights of another individual would be violated.
  * Data Integrity - Bullhorn takes reasonable steps to ensure that any personal data it collects is relevant for the purpose it is being used and that the information is reliable, accurate, complete, and current.
  * Enforcement - Bullhorn will attempt to resolve any privacy concerns directly with individuals. In the event a resolution cannot be made, individuals may engage Bullhorn's independent recourse mechanism, ([TRUSTe](https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request)).
