This policy (together with our terms and conditions <a href="http://www.bullring.co.uk/terms">http://www.bullring.co.uk/terms</a>and any other documents referred to on it) sets out the basis on which any personal data we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be processed by us. Please read the following carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your personal data and how we will treat it.<br>
<br>
For the purpose of the Data Protection Act 1998 (the Act), the data controller is Bullring Limited Partnership of registered address 201 Bishopsgate, London EC2M 3AE <br>

This includes information provided at the time of registering to use our site, subscribing to our service, posting material or requesting further services. We may also ask you for information when you enter a competition or promotion sponsored by us, and when you report a problem with our site. In addition, we may collect and process information provided by you on publically accessible areas of third party sites. We do not sell your Personal Information. <br>
<br>
In the case of actions listed above, you will be able to ‘unsubscribe’ to these at any time. It is completely optional for you to register, participate or otherwise provide us with Personal Information in the above situations. <br>
<br>
We may disclose your Personal Information to any member of our group, which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries (if applicable), as defined in section 1159 of the UK Companies Act 2006 together with our franchisees.

We take your online privacy very seriously, so if you need any assistance in unsubscribing to future communications please contact us. We will promptly take action to ensure that you are “opted-out” from receiving any further mailing or other information.
