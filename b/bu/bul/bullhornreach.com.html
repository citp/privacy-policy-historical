<h2 style="margin-top:50px;">Introduction</h2>
<p>Bullhorn, Inc. and, as applicable its parents, subsidiaries,  branches and affiliates (collectively, "Bullhorn" or "we")  knows that you care how information about you is used and shared and that you  want to understand the privacy-related choices that you can make. &nbsp;This Privacy Policy states Bullhorn's Privacy  Policy for the Bullhorn Reach™ web site (the “Website”), services, and  functions including free services and Premium Services (collectively  "Bullhorn Reach" or the "Service"). &nbsp;This Privacy Policy does not apply to  Bullhorn's other services and sites.</p>
<h2>The Use of Your  Information Can Depend on How You Use the Service</h2>
<p>The Users of the Service ("Users") include (1)  registered users and (2) users (e.g. candidates) that access functionality that  does not require registration to have access to and use the Service (such as,  but not limited to, browsing publicly available content). &nbsp;The way that you use the Service will affect  what information about you the Service obtains and how it is used. &nbsp;You should read the following carefully and  note the policies and practices that affect you and information that we gather  about you.</p>
<h2>Registration</h2>
<p>Registration for the Service is optional, but registration  is required to use much of the functionality. &nbsp;During registration, you will be required to  provide personal and business information, as Bullhorn may request, which may  include: your name, company, company location, your title, work phone, email  address, your resume, and a selected username and password. Some information is  required if you want to register, and some is optional. &nbsp;Bullhorn will provide a way to correct and  update your personal data so that you can keep it accurate as well as the  ability to remove it if you wish.</p>
<h2>Your Profile</h2>
<p>Aside from your username and password, some or all of the  information that you provide about yourself during registration (or as updated)  will become part of your online profile ("Profile"). &nbsp;The Bullhorn Reach functionality will provide  you with certain choices regarding what your Profile contains and what  information in it is published for view by others. &nbsp;You may elect to make some or all of your  Profile information available on the Bullhorn Reach web site or to social  networks such as Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn. &nbsp;Some of that information will also be  available to search engines to locate. <br>
  <br>
If you are a job candidate, your Profile information may be made available to recruiter  Users with whom you choose to communicate or to whom you choose to make your  Profile accessible.</p>
<h2>Postings, Public  Forums and Discussions</h2>
<p>When you use the Service to post information in any  interactive areas, including job offers or any job related information, any  information you share through the Service may be available to other Users and  may be publicly available, including to social networks that you select and to  search engines.&nbsp; We recommend you be  careful in sharing your personal information. &nbsp;If you choose to disclose your identity to  third parties using the Service, you do so at your own risk. &nbsp;Bullhorn is not responsible for the actions of  third parties who learn your personal information.</p>
<h2>Your Obligations  Regarding Use of Discovery Functions</h2>
<p>Bullhorn Reach discovery functionality will allow registered  Users to gather information for their own use from certain social media sites  (for example to monitor changes in pages that they are linked to or their  friends' pages). &nbsp;Much of this information  is non-public, for example, information that is available to you because you  are a "friend" of a social media account user. When you use this kind  of information, you must respect the privacy rights and expectations of each  person whose social media page or content you access by means of Bullhorn  Reach. You are also obligated to comply with the privacy policies of the social  media sites from which this information was obtained, and you may not download,  save, distribute, or publish such non-public information from these social  media sites.</p>
<h2>Messages and  Responding to Offers</h2>
<p>If you see a job offer or other content that interests you  posted on Bullhorn Reach, you may choose to respond by means of the Service's  messaging functionality. &nbsp;Such job offers  and content may be found on Bullhorn Reach, extended via social media sites, or  be found elsewhere on the Internet. &nbsp;When  you send a reply through the Service, your reply will be forwarded to the  indicated Bullhorn Reach User's account (normally the account of a recruiter). &nbsp;When you send such messages, your name and  e-mail address will be identified in the message and the addressee may view and  use your information. &nbsp;Bullhorn is not  responsible for the actions of its Users with regard to personal information  that other Users may provide them. &nbsp;Our  services will archive your messages for such time period as we may select.</p>
<h2>Cookies and  Tracking</h2>
<p>A "cookie" is a small text file made up of letters  and numbers and, if User agrees, is stored on a User's browser or computer hard  drive for record-keeping purposes. &nbsp;This  helps us to provide you with a good experience when you browse our Website and  also allows us to improve the Website.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  Cookies may be used and activated for all Users of the Service, including those  that are not registered with Bullhorn Reach. &nbsp;Most Internet browsers automatically accept  cookies. Your web browser allows you to control and limit cookies on your  computer. If you reject cookies, you may still use the Service, but your  ability to use some functionality is likely to be affected and some may not  operate at all. In addition to cookies, we may use other common tracking and  targeting methods. Information provided by these means may be used to provide  Bullhorn Reach functionality, to deliver content or advertising targeted to  your interests, and to better understand the use of the Service.<br>

Session cookies help us  make sure you are who you say you are after you've logged in and are required  in order to use the Bullhorn application.<br>
  Persistent cookies that only Bullhorn can read and use, to  identify the fact that you are a Bullhorn customer or a visitor, who has  registered for the Bullhorn Community or to receive certain types of content.  Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you've closed your browser or  turned off your computer. They include such information as a unique identifier  for your browser. We are especially careful about the security and  confidentiality of the information stored in persistent cookies. For example,  we do not store account numbers or passwords in persistent cookies. Users or  visitors who disable their Web browsers' ability to accept cookies will be  unable to use all aspects of our service or the Bullhorn Community.<br>

  <li style="margin-left:20px !important; margin-bottom:10px !important; line-height:1.5em !important;"><strong>Content Providers</strong>.&nbsp; Third party content providers that supply  only content may only provide content on the Service, and are not permitted to  collect any User personal information nor does Bullhorn share any User personal  information with these parties, except as otherwise described in this Privacy  Policy or with the User’s express consent.</li>
  <li style="margin-left:20px !important; margin-bottom:10px !important; line-height:1.5em !important;"><strong>Other Third Parties</strong>.&nbsp; Bullhorn may share User’s information, such  as, but not limited to, User’s e-mail address, registration date and job  filters with certain third parties that can use such information to send  e-mails that might suit User’s interests or needs.
