    <h1>Bullhorn Reach™ Privacy Policy</h1>

<p><u>Introduction</u></p>
<p>Bullhorn, Inc. ("Bullhorn" or "we") knows that you care how information about you is used and shared and that you want to understand the privacy-related choices that you can make.  This Privacy Policy states Bullhorn's Privacy Policy for the Bullhorn Reach? web site, services, and functions including free services and Premium Services (collectively "Bullhorn Reach" or the "Service").  This Privacy Policy does not apply to Bullhorn's other services and sites. </p>
<p><u>The Use of Your Information Can Depend on How You Use the Service</u></p>
<p>The Users of the Service ("Users") include (1) registered Users and (2) Users that access functionality that does not require registration (such as browsing publicly available content).  The way that you use the Service will affect what information about you the Service obtains and how it is used.  You should read the following carefully and note the policies and practices that affect you and information that we gather about you.</p>
<p><u>Registration</u> </p>
<p>Registration for the Service is optional, but registration is required to use much of the functionality.  During registration, you will be required to provide personal and business information, as Bullhorn may request, which may include: your name, company, company location, your title, work phone, email address, your resume, and a selected username and password.  Some information is required if you want to register, and some is optional. Bullhorn will provide a way to correct and update your personal data so that you can keep it accurate as well as functionality to remove it if you wish.</p>
<p><u>Your Profile</u></p>
<p>Aside from your username and password, some or all of the information that you provide about yourself during registration (or as updated) will become part of your online profile ("Profile").  The Bullhorn Reach functionality will provide you with certain choices regarding what your Profile contains and what information in it is published for view by others. You may elect to make some or all of your Profile information available on the Bullhorn Reach web site or to social networks such as Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn.  Some of that information will also be available to search engines to locate.</p>
<p>If you are a job candidate, your Profile information may be made available to other recruiter users with whom you choose to communicate or to whom you choose to make your Profile accessible.</p>
<p><u>Postings, Public Forums and Discussions</u></p>
<p>When you use the Service to post information in any interactive areas, including job offers or any job related information, any information you share through the Service may be available to other Users and may be publicly available, including to social networks that you select and to search engines.  We recommend you be careful in sharing your personal information.  If you choose to disclose your identity to third parties using the Service, you do so at your own risk.  Bullhorn is not responsible for the actions of third parties who learn your personal information.</p>
<p><u>Your Obligations Regarding Use of Discovery Functions</u></p>
<p>Bullhorn Reach discovery functionality will allow registered Users to gather information for their own use from certain social media sites (for example to monitor changes in pages that they are linked to or their friends' pages).  Much of this information is non-public, for example, information that is available to you because you are a "friend" of a social media account user.  When you use this kind of information, you must respect the privacy rights and expectations of each person whose social media page or content you access by means of Bullhorn Reach. You are also obligated to comply with the privacy policies of the social media sites from which this information was obtained, and you may not download, save, distribute, or publish such non-public information from these social media sites.</p>
<p><u>Messages and Responding to Offers</u></p>
<p>If you see a job offer or other content that interests you posted on Bullhorn Reach, you may chose to respond by means of the Service's messaging functionality.  Such job offers and content may be found on Bullhorn Reach, extended via social media sites, or be found elsewhere on the Internet.  When you send a reply through the Service, your reply will be forwarded to the indicated Bullhorn Reach User's account (normally the account of a recruiter).  When you send such messages, your name and e-mail address will be identified in the message and the addressee may view and use your information.  Bullhorn is not responsible for the actions of its Users with regard to personal information that other Users may provide them. Our services will archive your messages for such time period as we may select.</p>
<p><u>Cookies and Tracking</u></p>
<p>A "cookie" is a small text file that is stored on a User's computer for record-keeping purposes. Bullhorn Reach uses cookies.  We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with the Service, to monitor aggregate usage by our Users and web traffic, and to improve the Service.  We may also permit the use of cookies by third parties for serving ads on the Service or to provide web analytic services, however we are not responsible for third party cookie use.  Cookies may be used and activated for all Users of the Service, including those that are not registered with Bullhorn Reach.  Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies.  Your web browser allows you to control and limit cookies on your computer.  If you reject cookies, you may still use the Service, but your ability to use some functionality is likely to be affected and some may not operate at all.  In addition to cookies, we may use other common tracking and targeting methods.  Information provided by these means may be used to provide Bullhorn Reach functionality, to deliver content or advertising targeted to your interests, and to better understand the use of the Service.</p>
<p><u>Use of Your Information Generally</u></p>
<p>Generally speaking, we use personal information that we collect to process your requests or transactions, to provide you with information or services you request, to provide you with content or services that suit your interests and needs, to monitor your use of the Service, to inform you about other information, events, promotions, products or services we think will be of interest to you, to facilitate your use of, and our administration and operation of the Service, and for the purpose for which the information was provided.</p>
<p>For example, we may use the information that we collect: </p>
<ul>
    <li>to send you a welcoming email and to contact you about your use of the Service, to provide the services, products or information you request and to process any transactions in connection therewith; </li>
    <li>to respond to your emails, submissions, comments, requests or complaints; </li>
    <li>to request feedback and to enable us to develop, customize and improve the Service and our publications, products and services; </li>
    <li>to contact you about our or a third party's services, products, activities, special events or offers and for other marketing, informational, product development and promotional purposes; </li>
    <li>to personalize and improve site content and features and your experience on the site, such as providing ads, content or features to match your Profile and interests; </li>
    <li>to notify contest winners; and </li>
    <li>for the specific purpose for which the information was provided. </li>
</ul>
<p>Personal information provided online may be linked together or merged with other personal information so that we may better understand your needs and inform you about our products or services and those of our partners. In addition, if we receive information from third parties with whom we have business relationships, we may combine this information with the other personal information we maintain about you. In either case, this Privacy Policy governs this information. </p>
<p><u>Emails and Opt-Out</u></p>
<p>If you do not wish to receive promotional emails from Bullhorn Reach, you can opt-out by clicking the relevant link in any email communications you receive or indicating this preference in your account profile.</p>
<p>Bullhorn may also use your registered name and email address to provide you with significant announcements about the Service, about any User account you may create, about fulfillment of a specific transaction you have requested, or about significant developments that may affect your use of the Service. You cannot opt-out of this kind of email.</p>
<p><u>Certain Information Uses with Third Parties</u></p>
<p>All financial and billing information that we collect through the Service is used solely to check the qualifications of prospective customers and to bill for the Service. Billing information is not used by Bullhorn for marketing or promotional purposes.</p>
<p>Bullhorn may use third-party processors to manage credit card processing information that you may supply to us.  Such a processor is not permitted contractually to store, retain, or use the information provided except for the sole purpose of credit card processing. Other third parties, such as content providers, may provide content on the Service but they are not permitted to collect any User personal information nor does Bullhorn share any User personal information with these parties.</p>
<p><u>Anonymous Data</u></p>
<p>Bullhorn may track your use of the Service, including IP addresses of Users, to analyze trends, administer the Service, record transactions, and gather demographic information for aggregate use or for other uses. </p>
<p>Bullhorn may share aggregated demographic and usage information with its partners and advertisers or other third parties. This aggregated information is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. Bullhorn is the owner of aggregated demographic and usage information.</p>
<p><u>Links</u></p>
<p>The Service may contain links to other sites. Bullhorn is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.  Bullhorn encourages Users to be aware when they leave the Service and to read the privacy statements of sites that collect personally identifiable information.</p>
<p><u>Security</u></p>
<p>The Service has security measures in place to help protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the data under our control.  Bullhorn operates the Service in a server environment that uses a firewall and other security technology.  Usernames and passwords must be entered each time a User logs on. These safeguards help protect against unauthorized access or inappropriate use of data.</p>
<p>The Service may ask Users to enter financial information (such as a credit or debit card number). Such information is encrypted during transmission through the Internet using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) software.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding such measures, Bullhorn does not guarantee you that no unauthorized data access or breach will occur.  Bullhorn is not responsible for the privacy or security of any information, personal or otherwise, that you may choose to provide, publish, communicate, transmit, or exchange using the Service.</p>
<p><u>No Use by Minors</u></p>
<p>Children under the age of 18 are not permitted to register on the Service or use any functions for which registration or identification is required.</p>
<p><u>Release of Information for Legal Reasons</u></p>
<p>Bullhorn may release information concerning your use of the Service (including, but not limited to, public content, registration information, and network records) when it believes in good faith that such release is appropriate to comply with the law (for example, pursuant to a statutory demand, subpoena, warrant or court order), to protect against fraudulent, abusive or unlawful use of the Service, to protect Bullhorn's or third party rights or property, enforce any contract between you and Bullhorn, for the purpose of resolving a problem, support issue, or suspected violation of the Bullhorn Reach Terms of Use, or if Bullhorn reasonably believes that a situation involving danger of financial harm, death, or injury to any person requires disclosure.</p>
<p><u>Business or Asset Transfer or Sale</u></p>
<p>If another company acquires our company or all or substantially all of the assets used in our company or in this line of business, that company may obtain your information and assume rights and obligations pursuant to this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><u>Feedback to Bullhorn</u></p>
<p>You may choose to provide Bullhorn with your comments, suggestions, or information about bugs found. Bullhorn may retain your name or username and email address in order to follow up with you or thank you for the suggestion.</p>
<p><u>Sharing of Personal Information Generally</u></p>
<p>We do not share the personal information we collect from you through this Service with third parties except as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><u>Changes to this Privacy Policy</u></p>
<p>Bullhorn reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy by posting changes on the Service at any time.  Unless there is need for change on an expedited basis, we will give thirty (30) days notice.  Please check back from time to time so that you can understand how our policies may have changed. </p>
<p><u>EU Safe Harbor Principles</u></p>
<p>Bullhorn, with regard to Bullhorn Reach, adheres to the Safe Harbor Agreement concerning the transfer of personal data into Bullhorn Reach from the European Union to the United States of America.  Accordingly, we follow the Safe Harbor Principles published by the U.S. Department of Commerce ("Principles") with respect to such data.</p>
