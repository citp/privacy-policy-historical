##  5\. Use of cookies on our websites

In common with many websites, we use "cookies" to help us gather and store information about visitors to our websites. A cookie is a small data file that our server sends to your browser when you visit the site. The use of cookies helps us to assist your use of certain aspects of the site. You can delete cookies at any time or you can set your browser to reject or disable cookies. You can obtain information about how to manage cookies at [www.aboutcookies.org](http://www.aboutcookies.org/).

We primarily use information from cookies for the following purposes:

  1. Traffic monitoring, e.g., the IP address from which you access the site, the type of browser and operating system used to access the site, the date and time of your access to the site, the pages you visit, and the Internet address of the website from which you accessed the site. 
  2. To register you in programs and to recognize your website preferences. 
  3. To recognize repeat visitors for statistical / analytical purposes. 
  4. Anonymous tracking of interaction with online advertising, e.g., to monitor the number of times that a banner ad is displayed and the number of times it is clicked. 
  5. To compile and report to third parties (such as advertisers) aggregate statistics about our users in terms of numbers, traffic patterns and related site information. 
  6. Use of personal information 



We may also use clear gifs (also known as web bugs or web beacons), which are tiny graphics embedded in web pages and email messages that we use, in connection with cookies, to collect non-personal information from users to analyze site usage, manage content on the site, track visits to other related sites, and track the performance of online advertising. 

We may also connect the information that we collect through cookies and clear gifs with other personal information that you provide to us in order to:

  1. customize or personalize your experience of the site; for example, so that we can greet you on the site by name; 
  2. conduct transactions, such as credit card sales; and 
  3. monitor your use of our website(s) in order to make our communications to you as relevant as possible and for other marketing and advertising research purposes. 



We may use personal information collected from you in order to provide you with specific services that you request as well as in order to provide you with additional services that may be of interest to you. For example, we may use your personal information in the following ways:

Marketing Communications. We may use your personal information in order to communicate with you about our products and services and those of our subsidiaries, affiliates, and parent companies and any of their related businesses. 

Marketing analysis. We may use information for internal marketing analysis, for example, to assess trends amongst our consumers or to measure the amount of traffic to our websites.

Transactional purposes. We may use your personal information in order to respond to your queries and requests, maintain your accounts, and to manage transactions such as credit card payments for any goods that you order from us or any of our agents, or for the fulfillment of such transactions (e.g., delivery). 

Forward to a friend. When you provide us with information regarding another individual, such as when you request that we send someone information from one of our website, we will only send that individual the information that you specifically requested that we send. We will not send them additional communications based on you providing us with their information.

##  7\. Disclosure of personal information

We value your personal information and only share such information with third parties that provide adequate protection for such information. From time to time we may disclose personal information to:

(c) third parties who, in our reasonable judgment, are providing or seeking the information as the authorized or appointed legal agent of the subject individual; or  
(d) carefully selected third parties, including our affiliates, to send you third party marketing and promotional information that may be of interest to you.

(e) a person or entity, including our affiliates, in the event of a sale, merger, consolidation, change in control, transfer of substantial assets, financing, reorganization or liquidation, whereby we transfer, sell, or assign to such third party information concerning your relationship with us, including without limitation, personally identifiable information that you provide and other information concerning your relationship with us; and

You should not provide personal information about yourself in public (or interactive) areas of the site. Such personal information is not covered under this Privacy Statement. 

##  9\. Security

We take security seriously and we take precautions to keep your personal information secure. We have put in place appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard the information we collect. We have no control over the privacy of any communications while in transit to us. We recommend that you not include confidential, proprietary or sensitive information in such communications. 

In the unlikely event that we believe that the security of your personal information in our possession or control may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you of that development. If a notification is appropriate, we would endeavor to do so as promptly as possible under the circumstances, and, to the extent we have your e-mail address, we may notify you by e-mail.

If you would like to unsubscribe from BULLEIT BOURBON communications or from all communications about Diageo brands, please contact: [ bulleitbourbon@consumer-care.net](mailto:bulleitbourbon@consumer-care.net.). 

##  11\. Portfolio permissions

If you have given permission to receive communications about Diageo brands generally (for example, by opting to receive news and special offers by email about Diageo’s other great alcohol brands) you may from time to time receive communications about brands to which you have not opted-in specifically. Information about many of Diageo’s brands can be found at [www.diageobrands.com](http://www.diageobrands.com/). 

We may occasionally send you communications about brands not featured on www.diageobrands.com (e.g. new brands). We recommend that you refer to [www.diageobrands.com](http://www.diageobrands.com/) from time to time as the list of brands featured will be updated periodically.

Providing general permission for us to communicate with you about our brands does not mean that you will receive communications about all Diageo’s brands. We will only communicate with you about those brands that we think may be of particular interest to you. Any such communications will provide you with an opportunity to unsubscribe from the brand in question and/or from all communications about Diageo brands.

If you have any privacy-related questions, concerns or complaints, please contact: Digital Governance Director, Diageo plc, 8 Henrietta Place, London, W1G 0NB, E-mail: [privacy@diageo.com](mailto:privacy@diageo.com)

We encourage you to read the privacy statements and terms and conditions of linked or referenced websites you enter. 

As required, this Privacy Statement will be supplemented by additional legal requirements in jurisdictions where we conduct business.
