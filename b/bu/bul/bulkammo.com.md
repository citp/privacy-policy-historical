# Privacy Policy

**How We Value Your Information**

Safeguarding your information is very important to us. BulkAmmo.com maintains compliance with the PCI-DSS framework regulated by the world’s largest credit card companies. Our entire checkout funnel is secured with SSL encryption, and it feeds directly into the secure Authorize.net payment gateway. By ordering online, no person at BulkAmmo.com is able to retrieve your credit card information. Subject to the below, we do not permit third parties to track or collect your information while you are on our site.

**How We Use and Share Your Information**

If you place an order with BulkAmmo.com or create a customer account, we will ask you for certain personally-identifiable information (“PII”). If you create a customer account, you can edit your PII in your account settings. We will ask for the following PII:

* First and Last Name
* Billing Address
* Shipping Address
* Phone Number
* Email Address
* Credit Card
* ID Card (if required by your state's law)

We use your PII to process your orders and to better assist you if any issues arise and to occasionally inform you of product specials or simply to send you a follow up e-mail thanking you for your business. Also, parts of the order fulfillment process require us to share your PII with other parties like credit card processors and banks, outsourced support staff, digital marketing service, the fulfillment warehouse, and delivery companies. All of the people in this process highly value your PII.

We use Google Analytics and Advertising Features, but that process does not collect any of your PII. Instead, it uses “cookies” (first and third party), which are small text files placed on your computer, to collect anonymized visitor data like age, gender, and interests. We use these reports to improve product offerings, improve your experience on the site, and figure out how we can better serve you. By using this site, you are agreeing to submit this anonymous usage data to make your experience better. You also agree to Google Analytics' policies found here: <http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners>. You can opt out of Google Analytics by changing your settings on Google Ad Preferences, by visiting the [Google Analytics opt-out page](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/ "Google Analytics opt-out page") and installing the add-on for your browser, or by opting out via the Network Advertising Initiative [here](http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#!/ "here"). Given our policy not to track or follow you while browsing other sites, we do not respond to Do Not Track signals. 

Other than what is outlined in this Privacy Policy, we will not give, sell, rent, or loan any of your information (PII or non-PII) to any third party. The only exceptions to this rule are if you consent to disclosure, or if we feel disclosure is necessary (1) to respond to a subpoena or other valid legal request; or (2) to protect the property or well-being of our business or our community.

**How We Can Be Contacted**

From time to time, this Privacy Policy may be revised to reflect updated policy terms. Updates will be published on this page. As always, never hesitate to contact us if you have any questions. We can be reached by phone at (800) 720-6035 or by email at [customerservice@bulkammo.com](mailto:customerservice@bulkammo.com).
