# Cookie and Privacy Policy | Bullhorn Reach

_Introduction_

Bullhorn, Inc. and, as applicable its parents, subsidiaries, branches and affiliates ( collectively, "Bullhorn" or "we") knows that you care how information about you is used and shared and that you want to understand the privacy-related choices that you can make. This Privacy Policy states Bullhorn's Privacy Policy for the Bullhorn Reach™ web site (the “Website”), services, and functions including free services and Premium Services (collectively "Bullhorn Reach" or the "Service"). This Privacy Policy does not apply to Bullhorn's other services and sites.

 _The Use of Your Information Can Depend on How You Use the Service_

The Users of the Service ("Users") include (1) registered Users and (2) Users that access functionality that does not require registration (such as browsing publicly available content). The way that you use the Service will affect what information about you the Service obtains and how it is used. You should read the following carefully and note the policies and practices that affect you and information that we gather about you.

 _Registration_

Registration for the Service is optional, but registration is required to use much of the functionality. During registration, you will be required to provide personal and business information, as Bullhorn may request, which may include: your name, company, company location, your title, work phone, email address, your resume, and a selected username and password. Some information is required if you want to register, and some is optional. Bullhorn will provide a way to correct and update your personal data so that you can keep it accurate as well as the ability to remove it if you wish.

 _Your Profile_

Aside from your username and password, some or all of the information that you provide about yourself during registration (or as updated) will become part of your online profile ("Profile"). The Bullhorn Reach functionality will provide you with certain choices regarding what your Profile contains and what information in it is published for view by others. You may elect to make some or all of your Profile information available on the Bullhorn Reach web site or to social networks such as Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn. Some of that information will also be available to search engines to locate.  
If you are a job candidate, your Profile information may be made available to recruiter Users with whom you choose to communicate or to whom you choose to make your Profile accessible.

_Postings, Public Forums and Discussions_

When you use the Service to post information in any interactive areas, including job offers or any job related information, any information you share through the Service may be available to other Users and may be publicly available, including to social networks that you select and to search engines. We recommend you be careful in sharing your personal information. If you choose to disclose your identity to third parties using the Service, you do so at your own risk. Bullhorn is not responsible for the actions of third parties who learn your personal information.

 _Your Obligations Regarding Use of Discovery Functions_

Bullhorn Reach discovery functionality will allow registered Users to gather information for their own use from certain social media sites (for example to monitor changes in pages that they are linked to or their friends' pages). Much of this information is non-public, for example, information that is available to you because you are a "friend" of a social media account user. When you use this kind of information, you must respect the privacy rights and expectations of each person whose social media page or content you access by means of Bullhorn Reach. You are also obligated to comply with the privacy policies of the social media sites from which this information was obtained, and you may not download, save, distribute, or publish such non-public information from these social media sites.

 _Messages and Responding to Offers_

If you see a job offer or other content that interests you posted on Bullhorn Reach, you may chose to respond by means of the Service's messaging functionality. Such job offers and content may be found on Bullhorn Reach, extended via social media sites, or be found elsewhere on the Internet. When you send a reply through the Service, your reply will be forwarded to the indicated Bullhorn Reach User's account (normally the account of a recruiter). When you send such messages, your name and e-mail address will be identified in the message and the addressee may view and use your information. Bullhorn is not responsible for the actions of its Users with regard to personal information that other Users may provide them. Our services will archive your messages for such time period as we may select.
