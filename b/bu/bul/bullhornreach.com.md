# Privacy Policy | Bullhorn Reach

_Introduction_

Bullhorn, Inc. ("Bullhorn" or "we") knows that you care how information about you is used and shared and that you want to understand the privacy-related choices that you can make. This Privacy Policy states Bullhorn's Privacy Policy for the Bullhorn Reach? web site, services, and functions including free services and Premium Services (collectively "Bullhorn Reach" or the "Service"). This Privacy Policy does not apply to Bullhorn's other services and sites. 

_The Use of Your Information Can Depend on How You Use the Service_

The Users of the Service ("Users") include (1) registered Users and (2) Users that access functionality that does not require registration (such as browsing publicly available content). The way that you use the Service will affect what information about you the Service obtains and how it is used. You should read the following carefully and note the policies and practices that affect you and information that we gather about you.

_Registration_

Registration for the Service is optional, but registration is required to use much of the functionality. During registration, you will be required to provide personal and business information, as Bullhorn may request, which may include: your name, company, company location, your title, work phone, email address, your resume, and a selected username and password. Some information is required if you want to register, and some is optional. Bullhorn will provide a way to correct and update your personal data so that you can keep it accurate as well as functionality to remove it if you wish.

_Your Profile_

Aside from your username and password, some or all of the information that you provide about yourself during registration (or as updated) will become part of your online profile ("Profile"). The Bullhorn Reach functionality will provide you with certain choices regarding what your Profile contains and what information in it is published for view by others. You may elect to make some or all of your Profile information available on the Bullhorn Reach web site or to social networks such as Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn. Some of that information will also be available to search engines to locate.

If you are a job candidate, your Profile information may be made available to other recruiter users with whom you choose to communicate or to whom you choose to make your Profile accessible.

_Postings, Public Forums and Discussions_

When you use the Service to post information in any interactive areas, including job offers or any job related information, any information you share through the Service may be available to other Users and may be publicly available, including to social networks that you select and to search engines. We recommend you be careful in sharing your personal information. If you choose to disclose your identity to third parties using the Service, you do so at your own risk. Bullhorn is not responsible for the actions of third parties who learn your personal information.

_Your Obligations Regarding Use of Discovery Functions_

Bullhorn Reach discovery functionality will allow registered Users to gather information for their own use from certain social media sites (for example to monitor changes in pages that they are linked to or their friends' pages). Much of this information is non-public, for example, information that is available to you because you are a "friend" of a social media account user. When you use this kind of information, you must respect the privacy rights and expectations of each person whose social media page or content you access by means of Bullhorn Reach. You are also obligated to comply with the privacy policies of the social media sites from which this information was obtained, and you may not download, save, distribute, or publish such non-public information from these social media sites.

_Messages and Responding to Offers_

If you see a job offer or other content that interests you posted on Bullhorn Reach, you may chose to respond by means of the Service's messaging functionality. Such job offers and content may be found on Bullhorn Reach, extended via social media sites, or be found elsewhere on the Internet. When you send a reply through the Service, your reply will be forwarded to the indicated Bullhorn Reach User's account (normally the account of a recruiter). When you send such messages, your name and e-mail address will be identified in the message and the addressee may view and use your information. Bullhorn is not responsible for the actions of its Users with regard to personal information that other Users may provide them. Our services will archive your messages for such time period as we may select.

_Cookies and Tracking_

A "cookie" is a small text file that is stored on a User's computer for record-keeping purposes. Bullhorn Reach uses cookies. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with the Service, to monitor aggregate usage by our Users and web traffic, and to improve the Service. We may also permit the use of cookies by third parties for serving ads on the Service or to provide web analytic services, however we are not responsible for third party cookie use. Cookies may be used and activated for all Users of the Service, including those that are not registered with Bullhorn Reach. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. Your web browser allows you to control and limit cookies on your computer. If you reject cookies, you may still use the Service, but your ability to use some functionality is likely to be affected and some may not operate at all. In addition to cookies, we may use other common tracking and targeting methods. Information provided by these means may be used to provide Bullhorn Reach functionality, to deliver content or advertising targeted to your interests, and to better understand the use of the Service.

_Use of Your Information Generally_

Generally speaking, we use personal information that we collect to process your requests or transactions, to provide you with information or services you request, to provide you with content or services that suit your interests and needs, to monitor your use of the Service, to inform you about other information, events, promotions, products or services we think will be of interest to you, to facilitate your use of, and our administration and operation of the Service, and for the purpose for which the information was provided.

For example, we may use the information that we collect:

In either case, this Privacy Policy governs this information.

You cannot opt-out of this kind of email.

_Certain Information Uses with Third Parties_

All financial and billing information that we collect through the Service is used solely to check the qualifications of prospective customers and to bill for the Service. Billing information is not used by Bullhorn for marketing or promotional purposes.

Bullhorn may use third-party processors to manage credit card processing information that you may supply to us. Such a processor is not permitted contractually to store, retain, or use the information provided except for the sole purpose of credit card processing. Other third parties, such as content providers, may provide content on the Service but they are not permitted to collect any User personal information nor does Bullhorn share any User personal information with these parties.

_Anonymous Data_

Bullhorn may track your use of the Service, including IP addresses of Users, to analyze trends, administer the Service, record transactions, and gather demographic information for aggregate use or for other uses. 

Bullhorn may share aggregated demographic and usage information with its partners and advertisers or other third parties. This aggregated information is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. Bullhorn is the owner of aggregated demographic and usage information.

_Links_

The Service may contain links to other sites. Bullhorn is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. Bullhorn encourages Users to be aware when they leave the Service and to read the privacy statements of sites that collect personally identifiable information.

_Security_

The Service has security measures in place to help protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the data under our control. Bullhorn operates the Service in a server environment that uses a firewall and other security technology. Usernames and passwords must be entered each time a User logs on. These safeguards help protect against unauthorized access or inappropriate use of data.

The Service may ask Users to enter financial information (such as a credit or debit card number). Such information is encrypted during transmission through the Internet using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) software.

Notwithstanding such measures, Bullhorn does not guarantee you that no unauthorized data access or breach will occur. Bullhorn is not responsible for the privacy or security of any information, personal or otherwise, that you may choose to provide, publish, communicate, transmit, or exchange using the Service.

_Release of Information for Legal Reasons_

Bullhorn may release information concerning your use of the Service (including, but not limited to, public content, registration information, and network records) when it believes in good faith that such release is appropriate to comply with the law (for example, pursuant to a statutory demand, subpoena, warrant or court order), to protect against fraudulent, abusive or unlawful use of the Service, to protect Bullhorn's or third party rights or property, enforce any contract between you and Bullhorn, for the purpose of resolving a problem, support issue, or suspected violation of the Bullhorn Reach Terms of Use, or if Bullhorn reasonably believes that a situation involving danger of financial harm, death, or injury to any person requires disclosure.
