##### **Collected Information**

We require customers who register to use the services ("Services") to give us contact information, such as their name, company name, address, phone number, and e-mail address, and financial qualification and billing information, such as billing name and address, and the number of users within the organization that will be using the Services. Bullhorn uses the information that we collect to set up Services for individuals and their organizations. We may also use the information to contact customers to further discuss customer interest in our company, the Services that we provide, and to send information regarding our company or partners, such as promotions and events. 

Customer email addresses and any personal customer information will not be distributed or shared with any third parties. We may also email information regarding updates to the Service. Except as we explicitly state at the time we request information, or as provided for in the Bullhorn Terms of Use, we do not disclose to any third-party the information provided. All financial and billing information that we collect through the Site is used solely to check the qualifications of prospective customers and to bill for Services. Billing information is not used by Bullhorn for marketing or promotional purposes. Bullhorn uses a third-party intermediary to manage the credit card processing. This intermediary is solely a link in the distribution chain, and is not permitted to store, retain, or use the information provided, except for the sole purpose of credit card processing. Other third parties, such as content providers, may provide content on the Web Site but they are not permitted to collect any information nor does Bullhorn share any user information with these parties. Customers will be using the service to host data and information ("Data"). Bullhorn will not review, share, distribute, print, or reference any such Data except as provided in the Bullhorn Terms of Use, or as may be required by law. Individual records may at times be viewed or accessed only for the purpose of resolving a problem, support issue, or suspected violation of the Terms of Use, or as may be required by law.

Of course, customers are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of their user registration and password. Bullhorn may also collect certain information from customers of the Site, such as Internet addresses. This information is logged to help diagnose technical problems, and to administer our Site in order to constantly improve the quality of the Service. Bullhorn may also ask visitors, who register for the Bullhorn Community, to provide certain information, such as email addresses to use and receive content from the site. Bullhorn will provide these visitors with the ability to opt-in or opt-out of future communications from the company. Bullhorn will not disclose the collected information to third parties without the permission of the visitor.

##### **Cookies**

When you interact with Bullhorn we strive to make that experience easy and meaningful. When you log on to Bullhorn, our Web server sends a cookie to your computer. Cookies are files that Web browsers place on a computer's hard drive and are used to tell us whether customers have used the Service previously. Standing alone, cookies do not identify you personally. They merely recognize your browser. 

There are two types of Cookies: session and persistent-based. Session cookies exist only during an online session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser software or turn off your computer. Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you've closed your browser or turned off your computer. They include such information as a unique identifier for your browser. 

Bullhorn uses session cookies containing encrypted information to allow the system to uniquely identify you while you are logged in. This information allows Bullhorn to process your transactions and requests. Session cookies help us make sure you are who you say you are after you've logged in and are required in order to use the Bullhorn application. Bullhorn uses persistent cookies, that only Bullhorn can read and use, to identify the fact that you are a Bullhorn customer or a visitor, who has registered for the Bullhorn Community or to receive certain types of content. We are especially careful about the security and confidentiality of the information stored in persistent cookies. For example, we do not store account numbers or passwords in persistent cookies. Users or visitors who disable their Web browsers' ability to accept cookies will be unable to use all aspects of our service or the Community. 

##### **Third-Party Sites**

Bullhorn contains links to other web sites. Bullhorn is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these other web sites. Customers and visitors will need to check the policy statement of these others web sites to understand their policies. Customers and visitors who access a linked site may be disclosing their private information. It is the responsibility of the user to keep such information private and confidential. 

##### Security

Our Site has security measures in place to help protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the Data under our control. When our Site is accessed using Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 5.0 or higher, Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology protects information using both server authentication and data encryption to help ensure that Data is safe, secure, and available only to you. Bullhorn also implements an advanced security method based on dynamic data and encoded session identifications, and hosts the Site in a secure server environment that uses a firewall and other advanced technology to prevent interference or access from outside intruders. Finally, Bullhorn provides unique user names and passwords that must be entered each time a customer logs on. These safeguards help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of Data.
