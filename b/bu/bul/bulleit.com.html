                <h4>What is  personal information?</h4>
                <p>Personal information is information about an identifiable  individual, as defined by applicable law.</p>
                <h3><a name="_4._Collecting_personal" id="_4._Collecting_personal"></a>4.  Collecting personal information</h3>
                <p>It is your choice to provide us  with personal information.&nbsp; We will only  collect personal information that you choose to provide. In certain instances,  we may provide you with the option to select whether you would like to receive  information from us or from trusted third parties (for example, by choosing to  opt in or opt out of receiving special promotional offers). In some  circumstances, you will not have the option to opt out, such as when we are  satisfying the obligations of a contract with you, administering a transaction  requested by you, or required by law. <strong></strong></p>
                <p>You may choose to provide us  with personal information if, for example, you: contact us with an enquiry;  register on the site; forward an item to a friend; purchase an item; fill out a  survey or other form with your personal information included; ask us to provide  you with information; enter a competition; post information to public areas of  the site; or take advantage of a promotion.&nbsp; </p>
                <p>By providing any personal  information to us, you fully understand and clearly consent to the transfer of  such personal information to, and the collection and processing of such  information in, other countries or territories. Any such transfer and  processing by us will be in accordance with this Privacy and Cookie Notice.<strong> </strong></p>
                <h3><a name="_5._Use_of" id="_5._Use_of"></a>5. Cookies</h3>
                <p>Like many other websites, we use  "cookies" to help us gather and store information about visitors to  our websites. </p>
                <p>Cookies are text files  containing small amounts of information which are downloaded to your device  when you visit a website. Cookies are then sent back to the originating website  on each subsequent visit, or to another website that recognises that cookie.  Cookies are useful because they allow a website to recognise a user’s device.</p>
                <p>You can find more information about cookies at: www.allaboutcookies.org.  Cookies do lots of different jobs, like letting you navigate between pages  efficiently, remembering your preferences, and generally improve your  experience. They can also help to ensure that adverts you see online are more  relevant to you and your interests.</p>
                <h4>What types of cookies are used on this site?</h4>
                <p>The cookies which may be used on  this site have been categorised based on the categories set out in the  International Chamber of Commerce UK Cookie guide as follows:</p>
                <h5>Category  1: Strictly Necessary Cookies </h5>
                <p>These cookies are essential in order to enable you  to move around the website and use its features, such as accessing secure areas  of the website. Without these cookies services you have asked for, like  shopping baskets or e-billing, cannot be provided.</p>
                <h5>What  type of Strictly Necessary Cookies do we use on our website?</h5>
                <p>Examples of Strictly Necessary Cookies we may use  on this website include Content Management Cookies which are required by the  site for the content management system to work and Template Preference Cookies  which are necessary for mobile sites and enable the site to look and feel the  way it is intended to.</p>
                <p>We may also use a Social Sharing Cookie. This is a cookie that  identifies you with social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter and  allows interaction between your activity on social networking sites and on  our website through your direction,  and makes your transition between the sites more seamless. </p>
                <h5>Category  2: Performance Cookies</h5>
                <p>These cookies collect information about how  visitors use a website, for instance which pages visitors go to most often, and  if they get error messages from web pages. These cookies don’t collect  information that identifies a visitor. All information these cookies collect is  aggregated and therefore anonymous. It is only used to improve how a website  works.</p>
                <h4>What  type of Performance Cookies do we use on our website?</h4>
                <p>We use Google Analytics  to help analyse use of our website. This analytical tool uses 'cookies', which are text files placed on your  computer, to collect standard internet log information and visitor behaviour  information in an anonymous form. The information generated by the cookie about  your use of the website (including your IP address) is transmitted to Google.  This information is then used to evaluate visitors’ use of the website and to  compile statistical reports on website activity. To opt out of being tracked by  Google Analytics across all websites visit <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank" title="External link">http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>.</p>
                <h5>Category  3: Functionality Cookies</h5>
                <p>These cookies allow the website to remember  choices you make (such as your user name, language or the region you are in)  and provide enhanced, more personal features. For instance, a website may be  able to provide you with local weather reports or traffic news by storing in a  cookie the region in which you are currently located. These cookies can also be  used to remember changes you have made to text size, fonts and other parts of  web pages that you can customise. They may also be used to provide services you  have asked for such as watching a video or commenting on a blog. The  information these cookies collect may be anonymised and they cannot track your  browsing activity on other websites.</p>
                <h4>What  type of Functionality Cookies do we use on our website?</h4>
                <p>With  your consent we may place a cookie to remember your preferences (Preference  Cookie) so that you do not need to re-enter your details (country/age and  language preferences) on our gateway page. This is not suitable if you share  your computer with someone else.</p>
                <p>We may also use Session Cookies, which are temporary  cookies that aid the user journey around the site, and will remember  preferences you have selected during the session. These cookies are deleted as  soon as you leave the site.</p>
                <h5>Category  4: Targeting Cookies or Advertising Cookies</h5>
                <p>These cookies are used to deliver adverts more relevant  to you and your interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you  see an advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of the  advertising campaign. They are usually placed by advertising networks with the  website operator’s permission. They remember that you have visited a website  and this information is shared with other organisations such as advertisers.  Quite often targeting or advertising cookies will be linked to site  functionality provided by the other organisation.</p>
                <h4>What type of Targeting  Cookies or Advertising Cookies do we use on our website?</h4>
                <p>We do not currently use these types of cookies but may do so in the  future. In the event that we do start to use these types of cookies we will  revise this Privacy and Cookies notice accordingly to let you know what type of  Targeting or Advertising Cookies we are using.</p>
                <h3>How do I disable/enable cookies?</h3>
                <p>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies by modifying the  settings in your browser. However, you may not be able to use all the  interactive features of our site if cookies are disabled.</p>
                <p>There are a number of ways to manage cookies. Please refer to your  browser instructions or help screen to learn more about these functions. For  example, in Internet Explorer, you can go to the Tools/Internet options/Security  and Privacy Tabs to adapt the browser to your expectations. If you use  different computers in different locations you will need to ensure that each  browser is adjusted to suit your cookie preferences.</p>
                <p>Some modern browsers have a feature that will analyse website privacy  policies and allow a user to control their privacy needs. These are known as  'P3P' features (Privacy Preferences Platform).</p>
                <p>You can easily delete any cookies that have been installed in the cookie  folder of your browser. For example, if you are using Microsoft Windows  Explorer:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>open 'Windows Explorer'</li>
                    <li>click on the 'Search' button on the tool bar</li>
