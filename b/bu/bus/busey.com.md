                                                                   PRIVACY POLICY
Protecting your privacy is important to us. We want you to know and understand what information we collect and how we use it. In order to provide our
customers with a broad range of financial products and services as effectively and conveniently as possible, we provide our affiliates, and other
companies that help us serve you, access to certain customer information. The privacy of this information is protected not only by state and federal
regulations, but also by our commitment to you, our customer. The following policy serves as a standard for all of our employees regarding the
collection, use, retention, and security of nonpublic personal information.
What Information We Collect
“Nonpublic personal information” is information, not lawfully available to the general public, which we obtain about you in connection with providing a
financial product or service to you. For example, nonpublic personal information includes information regarding your account balance, payment
history, and overdraft history.
We may collect the following types of nonpublic personal information about you from the sources listed:
             Information we receive from you on applications or other loan and account forms, such as your name, address and social security number,
             assets, income or medical history;
             Information about your transactions with our affiliates or us, such as your account balance and payment history; and,
             Information we receive from credit bureaus and other companies, such as your creditworthiness and payment history.
What Information We Disclose
We may share information about our experiences or transactions with you, such as your account balance and your payment history with us, with
companies related to us by common control or ownership (“affiliates”). We may also share additional information about you or your account, such as
information we receive from you in applications and information from credit reporting agencies, with our affiliates. You may direct us not to share
information from your applications, consumer reports or from other outside sources among our affiliates by contacting us as follows: Call 800-
672-8739 or write to us at Busey, Attention: Customer Support Center, P.O. Box 17430, Urbana, IL. 61803-74330. First Busey Corporation owns

We do not disclose nonpublic information about our customers or former customers to any non-affiliated entity (i.e., third parties that are not members
of our corporate family) except as permitted or required by law. This can include disclosing nonpublic personal information about you to assist in
servicing your loan or account; to protect against potential fraud or unauthorized transactions; to respond to judicial process; to comply with federal,
state, or local legal requirements; to report to credit bureaus; and to comply with your request.
We may disclose any of the information we collect, as described above, with companies that work for us to provide marketing services on our behalf or
other financial institutions with which we have joint marketing agreements. All of these companies are contractually obligated to keep the information
that we provide to them confidential and secure, and to use the information only to provide the services we've asked them to perform for you and us.
If you decide to close your account(s) or become an inactive customer, we will continue to adhere to the privacy practices described in this notice.
Our Security Procedures
We also take steps to safeguard customer information. We restrict access to your personal and account information to those employees who need to
know that information to provide products or services to you. Associates are educated on the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of customer
information, and are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of customer information. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural
safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard your nonpublic personal information.
We are equally committed to protecting the privacy of customer information for online banking. Customers wanting to know more about online banking

Providing Privacy Information to Customers and Responding to Inquiries
We provide a copy of this policy when we establish a customer relationship with a consumer, and thereafter on at least an annual basis. This policy is

information should call 800-672-8739 or write to us at Busey, Attention: Customer Support Center, P.O. Box 17430, Urbana, IL. 61803-7430. Please
