# Privacy Policy | BusinessOnLine

BusinessOnline respects and protects the privacy of its customers. Therefore, we would like to share with you the following practices that govern how we use, share and protect the information you provide to us through our Website.

### Personal Information

BusinessOnline collects personal information (such as names, telephone numbers and email addresses) only from visitors to our Website that fill out the BusinessOnline “Get a Quote” Registration form. If you fill out the Registration form, the personal information provided by you to BusinessOnline could be used by us to process your order, initiate contact with you regarding your request for a quote, deliver services, send you newsletters and updates and other information, update our records, communicate with you about our services and generally maintain your accounts with us.

### Security Measures

All Registration information provided by you is stored by BusinessOnline in a password protected database on a secure server. However, no Internet or e­mail transmission is ever fully secure or error free. In particular, e­mail sent to or from our site may not be secure, and you should therefore take special care in deciding what information you send to us via e­mail. Although we take commercially reasonable measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information, we cannot assure you that your personal information will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy. You acknowledge that we are not responsible for any intercepted information sent via the internet.

### Opt Out

BusinessOnline may also use your contact information to tell you about products or services that we think might interest you or to invite you to participate in a product or service-related survey. In all instances, you will have the option of opting out and/or unsubscribing from BusinessOnline’s e-mails. Because the nature of our business does not appeal to children under the age of 13, we do not knowingly acquire or receive any information from children.

### Sharing of Information

We do not sell your personal information to third parties. We may share your personal information with third parties to provide products, services and content you’ve requested, when we have your permission or under the following circumstances:

  * In the process of fulfilling your orders or your use of our services, BusinessOnline may by necessity provide some of your information to third parties.  We may occasionally employ other companies to perform functions on our behalf for business purposes.  Examples could include, without limitation, sending postal mail and email, providing services, gathering or analyzing data and providing marketing assistance.  These companies will have access to your personal information only to perform their functions and may not use it for any other purpose.
  * BusinessOnline might share your personal information with its third party partners who might initiate contact with you to deliver content and to provide updates and communications regarding their products and services.  You will have the right to opt-out of or unsubscribe to any such email contacts.
  * We may share your personal information with our parent company, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under a common control that we may have now or in the future, in which case we will require them to honor this Privacy Policy.
  * In the event of a corporate sale, merger, acquisition or dissolution, personal information could be shared or become one of the transferred assets.  Any use of personal information by such third party transferee would then be in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy or the transferee’s privacy party.
  * BusinessOnline may disclose your personal information if we believe we are required to do so by law, court order, subpoena from a court with proper jurisdiction, regulation or other government authority or otherwise in cooperation with an ongoing investigation by a governmental authority or agency.
