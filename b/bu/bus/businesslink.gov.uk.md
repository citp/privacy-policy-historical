# Privacy policy | Business Link

### Overview

We have a legal duty to protect the privacy of all personal and business data obtained from you while you are using this website. This privacy policy explains what information we may collect from you and the purposes for which it will be used. By using this website you give your agreement to the data practices described in this policy.

This website only collects personal and business data from you with your permission, for example if you register or fill in a form. No personal or business data is collected from you without you knowing about it.

Some web usage and technical information is collected by this website to help us improve our service to you, but this does not contain any personal data.

### Changes to this policy

We may make changes to this privacy policy at any time. Changes will be posted here and are effective immediately. Regularly reviewing this page ensures that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances, if any, we will share it with other parties.

### 1\. Who manages this website?

Businesslink.gov.uk is managed by HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC), on behalf of the government, and delivered by Serco Ltd. 

Where this privacy policy refers to the interaction of this site with government departments, HMRC are also one of those departments.

### 2\. What information do we collect and how do we use it?

Depending on which services you use on this website, you may be asked to provide information, or we may collect information from you as explained below.

### 2.1 Information that you provide to us

We collect and process data that you provide for specific purposes. You will be asked to provide information about yourself when you use certain site facilities, in order to complete your request or transaction. This may include personal information such as your name, email addresses, mailing address and telephone number. We use this data to provide you with the information, products or services that you request from us and to communicate with you. We may keep a record of any contacts you have with us. We may use the information that you provide for record keeping, statistical, or research purposes.

We only retain this information where required to do so by law - for the length of time needed to provide the service or information you have requested (including any retention period specified by law or by government policy), or for the length of time that you choose to store information or permit us to contact you if you have registered with our website.

If you are a registered user, we may use your details to offer personalised or local services, to notify you of changes to our service, to ask your opinions and to help us to improve our services. When you register with the site, you can choose to store information in your 'My Business' area, for example to save the results of tools that you have completed.

In order to provide the information, products or services that you have requested we will share your data as required with other organisations - for example with a publications distribution organisation if you order a publication, with a local business support organisation or Business Link operator if you request local contact or support, or with the relevant government department, agency or authority to complete a request or transaction.

If you are registered with more than one regional Business Link site, the information in My Business will be shared with the other sites you have chosen to register with.

### 2.1.1 The Government Gateway

When you register with this website, or use certain services on this or linked sites, you will be asked to register and obtain a User ID and password from the Government Gateway, or to enter your existing User ID and password. Your name, User ID, password and email address will be securely stored on the Government Gateway servers. Certain government transactions or services, such as Income Tax Self Assessment, will also require you to enter 'known facts', which are information known to yourself and to the relevant government department, agency or authority, in order to enrol with the Government Gateway for that service. You can [find out about the Government Gateway on the Government Gateway website \- Opens in a new window](http://www.gateway.gov.uk/ "Register online for eGovernment services in the UK

### 2.2 Website usage information

As well as the information that you provide to us as set out above, we receive and store a range of website usage information whenever you use this website. We use this to:

  * assess the effectiveness of marketing campaigns
  * develop and deliver services and information that better meet your needs
  * inform you of events, services and products which we believe to be relevant to you, where you have consented to be contacted for such purposes



Web usage information is collected by our web server and from other sources including search engines, internet service providers, page tagging techniques including JavaScript, and cookies. We use IP addresses to analyse trends, track users' movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.

The type of website usage information that we collect during your visits to our site includes, for example the date and time, pages viewed or searched for, publications ordered, guides printed, tools used, subscriptions and referrals made, some truncated postcode or telephone area code information entered on forms (this is not traceable back to you) and other information relating to your browsing activity on our website. Where you are a registered user of our website and have logged in, we may collect web usage information to enable us to build a demographic profile. We may also use web usage information to create statistical data regarding the use of our website. We may then use or disclose that statistical data to others for marketing and strategic development purposes, but no individuals will be identified in such statistical data.

### 2.2.1 Cookies

Cookies are small files that are often created when you visit a website, and which are stored in the cookie directory of your computer. A cookie often includes an anonymous unique identifier. Cookies do not damage your computer. Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but to protect your privacy your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites. You do not have to accept cookies. You can decide if you want to accept cookies by changing the settings on your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. Switching off cookies will still allow you to view the majority of content on our site, although it may restrict your use of our interactive tools, and of some services available through linked sites.

There are two types of cookie. Persistent cookies remain on your computer for a specified time. We use persistent cookies to:

  * identify that a registered user has returned
  * collect information on website usage as described above.



Session-specific cookies are deleted when you leave the website. We use session-specific cookies to:

  * hold the information given while using an interactive tool on the website
  * hold your details when you are logged into the site
  * hold your search criteria while you are carrying out a search of the website
  * collect information on website usage as described above



You can [find out about cookies and how to manage them on the aboutcookies.org website \- Opens in a new window](http://www.aboutcookies.org/ "find out about cookies and how to manage them on the aboutcookies.org website - Opens in a new window") or [read about managing cookies on the allaboutcookies.org website \- Opens in a new window](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/ "Uses for cookies, privacy and security information and web-browsing tips - Opens in a new window").

### 3\. Information sharing and disclosure

We will only disclose your information to others where there is a lawful basis to do so. This includes parts of HMRC beyond those managing this website. We will not disclose your information except where:

  * this is necessary to provide or complete a relevant service to you (see examples at section 2 above)
  * this is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy policy
  * this is required by applicable laws or court orders (for example to prevent or detect crime)
  * you give us permission to do so



We will not sell, rent or disclose your information to any third parties other than those set out in this privacy policy without your consent. We do not transfer your personal information outside of the European Economic Area.

You can [read more detailed information about the circumstances in which HMRC can share information internally, or disclose it to others, in the published guidance on the HMRC website \- Opens in a new window](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/idgmanual/IDG40000.htm "More detailed information about the circumstances in which HMRC can share information internally, or disclose it to others - Opens in a new window").

### 4\. Linking to other websites

This website contains links to many other government and non-government websites. Anonymous visit or session information may be passed to other websites for the web usage information purposes described above. None of this information can be related to an individual user of the website. The operators of other sites may collect information from you, which will be used by them in accordance with their own terms and conditions, and privacy policies.

This privacy policy applies only to our website. We are not responsible for privacy practices within any other websites. You should always be aware of this when you leave this website and we encourage you to read the privacy statement on any other website that you visit.

### 5\. Security

We use leading technologies and security measures to safeguard your information and keep strict security standards to prevent any unauthorised access to it. Our registration system makes use of the Government Gateway. We use industry-standard SSL encryption software when processing sensitive information such as usernames and passwords.

### 6\. Your access to your information

You have a right to request a copy of any personal information that we hold about you. You can [read about how to request a copy of any information held about you on the HMRC website \- Opens in a new window](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/leaflets/dp-fs1.htm "Read about how to request a copy of any information held about you - Opens in a new window").

You will be asked for appropriate identification when you request copies of personal information.

If you register with this website, your account will include a personal storage area called 'My Business'. You can access and change your stored information at any time by logging in.
