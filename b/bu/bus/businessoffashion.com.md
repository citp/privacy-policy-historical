2.3 BoF shall take steps to ensure that any transfer of your personal information to a country or territory outside the European Economic Area, whose laws provide for a lesser standard of protection for your personal information than that provided under European law, shall be made subject to arrangements which will require that your personal information be processed to a standard compliant with European data protection laws.
