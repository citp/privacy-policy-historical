Privacy Policy for Business Owners Idea Cafe

Idea Cafe Inc. has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our respect for user privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices. Please note that this policy may be modified from time to time; the most current version will always be available here on this web page. 

**Use of Technical Contact Data**

Idea Cafe may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. 

**Links To Other Sites**

Idea Cafe contains links to other sites. Idea Cafe is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. 

**Voluntary Opt-in Registration**

Idea Cafe's voluntary registration form requires users to give certain information in order to become a registered "Regular" member. Regulars (members) receive certain privileges, such as access into restricted site areas, a free subscription to our own Biz Tips newsletter, plus contest eligibility and profile submissions; membership privileges may change from time to time. The registration form also gives users the opportunity to provide additional information voluntarily. Idea Cafe totals the data provided by all users to create our site user demographic reports: we share these demographic totals with interested parties. Idea Cafe uses contact information from the registration form to enable our users to receive information we believe would be helpful to them via email, mail or other methods. This information may come directly from us or from partners and advertisers we have screened and approved. Any third-party email offers we approve provide the user an instant link to opt out if he or she no longer wishes to receive such offers. Users may also opt-out of receiving future mailings of newsletters and letters directly from Business Owners Idea Cafe; see the choice/opt-out section below or the shortcut section above. 

**Other Opt-in Areas**

Onsite, Idea Cafe has optional areas (such as contests, public forums, profiles, awards/greetings, newsletter/information requests and similar) in which we ask visitors for contact information. We use the contact data submitted to send users various notifications, including but not limited to that their awards/greeting were received, their forum message(s) responded to, and to send information from Idea Cafe and other legitimate resources. In some areas, by posting or submitting, the user agrees to convey certain publication rights; where this is the case, what the user is agreeing to will be clearly marked near the input area, so the user can determine what he or she wants to do. 

**Public Forums**

Idea Cafe makes public forums (including but not limited to CyberSchmooz, profiles, etc.) available for our users' participation. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and each user should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information. 

**Security**

Idea Cafe has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. All information is stored on a secure server and password protected.
