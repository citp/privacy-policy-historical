# Business Bee - Business Directory

**Here at BusinessBee, we take your privacy very seriously.**

**The Collection of Information**  
|  |  There are only 2 ways in which we collect information on companies to add to our listings 

  1. We use 'bots' (programs hosted on our servers) that surf the internet, picking up the domain names of companies, whose websites we then visit to attempt to gather the following information: 
    1. contact details such as telephone and fax numbers, and email addresses.
    2. address details such as postcode/zipcod, country, and county/district/state.
    3. the html title, meta description, meta keywords, and a list of non-html displayed words.
Each company is then contacted via email, and given the option to keep their free listing, upgrade to a paid listing, or to remove their company from our listings.  
If a company wishes to be removed, thier domain name, and company name ONLY are kept on our servers in a list of companies not to be contacted again.
  2. By people using the 'Add My Company' service to add either thier own company or third party company. All companies added in this manner are checked to ensure they are a valid company with valid products or services, and are then contacted by email to make sure they wish to be listed.
