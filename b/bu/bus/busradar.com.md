## Data protection

Operator of the website busradar.com and long-distance bus app as well as responsible place in the sense of the data protection right is Green Parrot GmbH, Gartenstrasse 67, 76135 Karlsruhe ("we") You can reach us under [[email protected]](https://web.archive.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) and our data protection officer under [[email protected]](https://web.archive.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#82f2f0ebf4e3e1fbc2e0f7f1f0e3e6e3f0ace1edef).

Below is an overview of the collection and processing of your data in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Federal Data Protection Act (FDPA).

**I. What data is collected?**

**1\. Automatically collected data when visiting the website**

We collect information and data that is automatically transmitted or generated by your browser each time you visit our website, such as: your IP address, the URLs of the websites from which you came to our websites, the browser used, the browser language, the operating system and interface used, the access device with which the services are used, the date and time of access, the pages accessed our websites and the time you spend on our websites. The data is stored for a period of 12 months and then automatically deleted.

**2.   Search and bookings**

If you search for bus connections with us, you can carry out the respective booking directly with the provider in the search results. For this reason you will be redirected by link to the page of the respective provider. The provider receives information about the desired connection (type, date etc.). The booking is then made directly through the website of the respective provider. The respective provider is solely responsible for further data processing. We do not process personal data in connection with bookings.

We store data about search queries and redirects on provider pages, including the respective IP address of the search request, for a period of up to 12 months. These are all pseudonymous data. We do not know who is conducting searches on our platform.

**3.   Forum**

If you want to post in our discussion forum, you must usually first register as a user (in some forums posting as a guest is also possible). To do this, you can choose a pseudonym as the user name. We need your e-mail address to register. As a registered forum user you can set whether and which e-mail notifications (for example about new forum postings) you want to receive and which language you prefer. We do not collect any other personal data. User registration is solely for the purpose of using the forum. In particular, we do not combine the registration data with search queries.

We retain your registration data as long as you maintain your user account with us. You can delete your user account at any time (function "delete account" in the user settings). Forum posts published by you remain valid even after deletion of your user account, so that in particular discussions remain comprehensible. But then we replace your username with the identifier "Deleted member".

**4.   Support requests**

If you contact us or our Customer Support (for example, by e-mail, telephone or contact form) or use our feedback tools, we will use the information you provide (your contact information) to respond to your request. Your requests will be kept for a period of one year after answering. As far as business letters in the sense of Trade or tax law, we keep the correspondence for the statutory periods (usually six years).

**Newsletter **

**5\. Newsletter and marketing e-mails**

If you have subscribed to our newsletter, you will receive by e-mail regularly a newsletter and marketing e-mails which contain information about our offer and advertising for offers of third parties (especially bus lines and connections, travel, accommodation).

You may give your consent to receive such emails at any time, e.g. revoke via the unsubscribe link in our emails.

With revocation or cancellation of the newsletter, your contact details will be deleted.

**6\. Use of cookies, web-beacons and similar procedures**

Like almost all service providers, we use cookies, web beacons or similar procedures when you visit our websites or use our services.

Cookies are small text files that are stored by your browser on your computer or mobile device, and allow the recognition of your computer or device, possibly even across different websites. The cookies do not contain any personal information. Some of the cookies we use are deleted after the end of the browser session, after closing your browser (so-called session cookies). Other cookies remain on your device and allow us or our affiliate to recognize your browser on your next visit (persistent cookies).

You can prevent the use of cookies by setting your browser software accordingly. However, it is possible that certain areas of the sites or offers may not work as intended (such as setting up your user account, ordering, or saving your preferred transportation).

Web beacons are small graphics files ("pixels") that can be integrated into our website and that can be used to record user behavior. Similar methods are e.g. Flash cookies, HTML5 cookies or other local (browser or device) storage methods in which - similar to cookies - data can be stored in your browser or device at the next visit to recognize a session again.

The use of cookies and similar methods enables us to collect information about users in order to make the use of the websites easier or more comfortable for them or to enable certain offers.

We use cookies for the following purposes:

  * Provision of forum functionality for registered forum users
  * Storage of information on whether the information on the cookies has been accepted
  * Storage of the information on which currency the user has selected
  * Anonymized statistics of searches and redirects.



These cookies set by us are deleted after one year at the latest.

If necessary, we also use cookies for web analytics, retargeting and conversion tracking services (see below).

If you click on our websites to access the websites of other providers (for example, in order to make a booking with one provider), it is possible that these other websites also place cookies on your computer. We have no control over these cookies and the data collected and can not be held responsible.

**7\. Retargeting**

Our landing pages use so-called "retargeting tags" to place interest-based advertising on third-party websites. Retargeting tag is a JavaScript element that is placed in the source code of the website. When a user visits a page on such a website containing a retargeting tag, an online advertising provider ("retargeting provider", eg, Google, Facebook) places a cookie on that user's computer and maps that particular retargeting audience list added. The respective retargeting providers use the cookie to capture interest data (e.g., the pages or search queries visited on our website) using pseudonyms. This information will then be used by the retargeting providers to show interest-based advertising. No personal data will be stored and no user profiles will be merged with personal data. However, the retargeting provider may be able to identify you and associate your use of our site with you, especially if you are a registered user of the retargeting provider (for example, have a Google or Facebook account).

We use the following retargeting providers:

Users of this site may disable the use of cookies by Google and retargeting by visiting Google Ads Preferences ([http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/](https://www.google.com/ads/preferences/)).

For more information about Google's data processing, please visit <https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/technologies/ads/> and <https://policies.google.com/privacy/partners>  
Google has signed up to the EU-US Privacy Shield, <https://www.privacyshield.gov/EU-US-Framework>.  
  
On the website [youronlinechoices.com](https://www.youronlinechoices.com/) you can read more about cookies and the individual providers. There you can also opt out of usage-based online advertising through one or more tools. To go directly to the preference manager, please click [here](https://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/your-ad-choices).

In doing so, we set a persistent cookie that will allow you to recognize and take account of your opt-out during later visits to our website. Please note that it must be reset after deleting all cookies. Opt-out cookies prevent the future collection of your data when visiting this website from a specific device or browser. However, to prevent detection on different devices, the opt-out must be performed on all devices / browsers used.

**8\. Conversion Tracking**

We use the offer of external advertising partners to draw attention to our offers with the help of advertising material on external websites. We also use marketing tools to determine how successful the individual advertising measures are ("conversion tracking"). We are interested in showing you advertisements that are of your interest, to make our website more interesting to you and to achieve a fair calculation of advertising costs.

For this purpose, our advertising partners set cookies and web beacons (see above), which can be used to measure certain parameters for performance calculations, such as the display of ads or clicks by the users. These cookies are not used to identify you personally. As long as the cookie is valid, the advertising partners will be able to recognize that you have clicked an ad and reached a specific landing page (eg, form entry, confirmation page, newsletter signup). The cookie will generate conversion statistics from the advertising partners. These statistics include the number of users who clicked on one of our ads. In addition, it counts how many people have reached a landing page that has been tagged with a "conversion tag" (remarketing tag, see above). However, the statistics do not contain any data that could identify you.

We do not collect and process any personal data in the aforementioned advertising measures. We receive only statistical analysis from our advertising partners. On the basis of these analysis, we can identify which one of the advertising activities are particularly effective. We do not receive any further data from the use of the advertising material and in general we cannot identify the users on the basis of this information.

Due to the conversion tracking tools used, your browser automatically establishes a direct connection with the server of the advertising partners. We do not have any control over the size and other usage of data collected through the use of this tool by the advertising partners. Through the integration of marketing tools advertising partners receive the information that you called the corresponding part of our website or clicked on an ad from us. If you are registered with our advertising partners (such as Facebook or Google), they may associate the visit with your account. Even if you are not registered or have not logged in, there is a possibility that the provider will find and store your IP address.

We use conversion tracking from the following advertising partners:
