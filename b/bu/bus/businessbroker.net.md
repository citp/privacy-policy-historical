Privacy Policy for Advertisers

When you advertise on BusinessBroker.net we ask for your name, e-mail address, mailing address, phone number, and other information. This information is sometimes displayed to users of our websites in order to generate leads. BusinessBroker.net or our business partners and sponsors may use your information to contact you about services and opportunities, to take surveys, and to offer other related services. In addition to your contact information, we may also ask for your credit card number. Your credit card number will remain confidential and will only be used for proper billing purposes. By agreeing with these terms you agree that we may use and store your information, including credit card information, in accordance with this privacy policy. You are not permitted to use our services unless you agree with these terms.

FOR SITE USERS

All BusinessBroker.net site users and service customers agree and understand that BusinessBroker.net is in no way providing any legal, accounting, or business advice relating to the purchase or sale of any business or franchise, the hiring of any service advertiser, or the purchase of any products advertised on the website. We strongly recommend that all users consult with a qualified third party not associated with BusinessBroker.net prior to engaging in any of these activities. We are merely a lead generating advertising service for our clients.

Request Form & Contact Form Usage Policy

Users are permitted to use the email contact forms and/or our lead submission forms only for the purpose to gain further information from the business for sale, franchisor and/or business opportunity. The email contact forms and/or lead submission forms on our website are only to be used to send inquiries about buying a particular business for sale, franchise, or other related business opportunity. By submitting your information you expressly confirm that you have a genuine interest in each of the concepts for which you have requested information; that you wish for a representative from each of the concepts to contact you; and that the information that you have submitted is true and correct.

We are grateful that you have taken the time to come to our site and inquire about the exciting businesses for sale, franchises, and business opportunities we have listed. In order to provide the best service possible to both you and our clients we must insist that you respect and understand this Policy. By submitting your information you expressly agree to receive a phone call, text message, or e-mail message from the entity from whom you requested information. BBN may also contact you to confirm your request for more information via phone, email, or text message.

Submitting contact information that is either false or is done without interest to the particular business for which you have submitted your information is called “spamming”. Spamming of any sort on our site is not permitted as it hurts the integrity, credibility, and value of our business. Moreover, it jeopardizes our ability to continue to provide our services to legitimate users. Unauthorized use of the email contact forms to contact advertisers or “spamming” on our website will be billed to the responsible party at a rate of $1,000 per unauthorized contact. By using the website and submitting a contact form you agree with these conditions.

Collection & Use of Information from Site Users

You may browse our website at any time without providing your contact and/or personal information. If, however, you are interested in a particular business for sale, franchise, service, opportunity and/or any additional information from BusinessBroker.net (and/or our advertisers) you may register with us and provide your personally identifiable information, which is information that, alone or in combination with other information, allows us to identify you, such as your name, address, phone number, email address, contact preferences, financial information or information relating to a support or service issue. Any and all lead and contact information submitted to BusinessBroker.net is forwarded directly to our database; and thus any and all lead and contact information BusinessBroker.net collects remains the property of BusinessBroker.net. We may also use this information to send you (or have sent to you) additional information about other business opportunities/service providers that we determine may fit your criteria. BusinessBroker.net and/or its advertisers may also contact you for other business purposes, such as to conduct surveys or to offer business consulting/coaching services or related services. Please note that each franchisor and/or service provider is responsible for its own privacy practices.

We share your information with the franchises and business for sale opportunities in which you have expressed interest. If you no longer want to receive information from a franchise or business opportunity, please contact that franchise or business for sale or business broker directly.

If you provide us with your personally identifiable information, you are giving us permission to use that information for the specific purpose for which it is provided and for any other purpose described in this Privacy Policy, which are described in detail below under “ **How We Use the Information** ”.  By providing us with personally identifiable information, you expressly consent to our collection, storage, use, and disclosure of your personally identifiable information as described in this Privacy Policy. Users unwilling to provide personally identifiable information online can choose not to provide such information, and in some (but not all) situations users may be able to work with a sales representative or customer service representative to utilize our Services or other offerings without providing personally identifiable information.  In addition, if you do provide us with your personally identifiable information, you have the ability to prevent us from sharing your information with third parties if you wish, as described below under “ **Your Options Regarding Personally Identifiable Information** ”.

We also may collect, store and use certain non-personally identifiable information we receive when you use our Services, and we may aggregate data and information provided by or collected from multiple users (which may include you) in a manner that is not personally identifiable to any individual user.  All non-personally identifiable information collected by us through our Services and all aggregated/compilations of data we create are the exclusive property of BBN.  Nothing in this Privacy Policy limits our right to use any such non-personally identifiable or aggregated information in any way (including, but not limited to, monitoring user traffic patterns, analyzing and quantifying user preferences, improving the design and content of our Services, and enabling us to personalize your user experience) or prohibits us from sharing non-personally identifiable or aggregated information with third parties.

How We Use the Information

Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we share personally identifiable information collected through our Services with unaffiliated third parties only as described below.  (Please see “ **Your Options Regarding Personally Identifiable Information** ” below for information on how to avoid having your personally identifiable information shared by us.)

  * _Third Party Service Providers_ :  We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples may include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing credit card payments and providing customer service. In connection with their performance of functions on our behalf, we may share personally identifiable information with such companies and individuals as needed for them to perform their functions, but we do not permit such entities and individuals to use personally identifiable information for other purposes.
  * _Business Transfers_ :  As we continue to develop our business we might sell or buy companies, subsidiaries or business units. In such transactions, personally identifiable information is generally one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy (unless the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the event that we are acquired or assigned, personally identifiable information will be one of the transferred assets. In such event, this Privacy Policy may be amended as set forth below or the collection and uses of your personally identifiable information may be governed by a different privacy policy.
  * _Protection of Our Services and Others_ :  We reserve the right to release personally identifiable information to unaffiliated third parties when we believe its release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce or apply our Terms and Conditions and other agreements, or protect the rights, property or safety of BBN, our users or others. This includes exchanging information with other unaffiliated third parties in connection with fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
  * _With Your Consent_ :  Other than as set out above, you will receive notice and have the opportunity to withhold consent when personally identifiable information about you might be shared with unaffiliated third parties.
  * _User Submissions_ :  If you participate in any online forum/communities, chat sessions and/or blogs, or otherwise post in any user comment field visible to other users of our Services, any information that you submit or post will be visible to and may be read, collected or used by others who use our Services.  We are not responsible for any information, including personally identifiable information, you choose to submit in any such user comment field.



Your Options Regarding Personally Identifiable Information

Except where we believe the release of your personally identifiable information is necessary or appropriate (a) to allow third party service providers to perform functions on our behalf or (b) to comply with law, enforce or apply our Terms and Conditions and other agreements, or protect the rights, property or safety of BBN, our users or others, you may opt out of our sharing your personally identifiable information with unaffiliated third parties by contacting us directly via our Contact Us Form on our website. We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our website.

Third Party Online Advertising

We sometimes partner with third party ad networks to manage our advertising on other sites. An ad network partner uses cookies and web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this and other web sites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests (interest-based ads). For more information on this practice, or to opt out of having this information used by these companies, please visit the Network Advertising Initiative here on [this webpage:](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp)

If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by following the directions below. Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads.

To opt-out of interest-based ads, personalized ads, and/or Google's use of cookies on Google, go to this [Google Ad Settings webpage](http://www.google.com/settings/ads) and make a selection next to "Opt-Out Settings" to prevent targeted advertising on Google's own sites, or across the web.

To opt-out of interest-based ads on Facebook, go to [Digital Advertising Alliance](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/) in the USA, [Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada](http://youradchoices.ca/) in Canada or the [European Digital Advertising Alliance](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/) in Europe and select "Facebook Inc." from the list.

Google® AdWords

This website uses the Google AdWords remarketing service to advertise on third party websites (including Google) to previous visitors to our site or to audiences similar to people who have visited our site. It could mean that we advertise to previous visitors who haven't completed a task on our site, for example using the contact form to make an inquiry. This could be in the form of an advertisement on the Google search results page, or on sites across the internet in the Google Display Network. Third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on someone's past visits to a website. Of course, any data collected will be used in accordance with our own privacy policy and Google's privacy policy.

You can set preferences for how Google advertises to you using the [Google Ad Preferences page](http://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/) to opt out of interest-based advertising entirely by cookie settings or [permanently using a browser plugin.](http://www.google.com/settings/ads/plugin?hl=en)

Cookies

We also collect and use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our website server, and to administer our website. We use cookies on this site. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer or mobile device’s browser for record-keeping purposes. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your e-mail address or reveal other personally identifiable information unless you choose to provide this information to us by, for example, registering at one or more of our websites. However, once you choose to furnish us with personally identifiable information, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie.

We use a third-party tracking service that uses cookies to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our site in the aggregate to capture usage and volume statistics to improve our Web site.

Collection of Information by Third-Party Sites, Services, Ad Servers and Sponsors

Our Services may contain links to other websites or services whose information practices may be different than ours. For example, while using one or more of our websites, you may link to a third party’s website via a window opened within (or on top of) our website. Some of our Services may allow users to interface with third party websites or services, such as Facebook and Twitter. You will remain logged into those third party websites or services until you actively log off. By interfacing with those third party websites or services, you are allowing our Services to access your information that is or becomes available via such third party websites or services, and you are agreeing to those third party’s applicable terms and conditions. Once you log onto any such third party websites or services, the content you post there may also post to our Services. Our Privacy Policy and procedures may or may not be consistent with the policies and procedures of such third party websites or services, and when you visit such websites or services our Privacy Policy does not apply to personally identifiable information and other data collected by the third party. You should consult, read and understand the privacy notices of such third parties before choosing to provide personally identifiable information on any such websites or services.

E-Mail Newsletter Marketing

BBN does send e-mails providing franchise and business for sale updates and entrepreneur related articles to users who have provided BBN their e-mail address. If you wish to UNSUBSCRIBE from our e-mails, please follow the simple Unsubscribe instructions which are located at the bottom of each e-mail. If for some reason the Unsubscribe function does not work please [Contact Us](https://web.archive.org/contactus.aspx) via our website.

Mobile Apps & Location Information

When you download or use our mobile Application (the “apps”), we may collect certain information automatically, such as the type of mobile device you use, your mobile devices' unique device ID, the IP address of your mobile device, your mobile operating system, the type of mobile Internet browsers you use and information about the way you use the apps. The apps may also collect precise information about your device's real-time location (from cell towers or global positioning system technology (“GPS”)). This information is used to provide services like localized search results and to market certain of our products and services to you. You can disable location-sharing at any time in your device settings. We also use an encrypted version of your device's unique device ID to track app usage and to send any mobile alerts that you ask to receive.

California Do Not Track Notice

Certain websites and other technology can track their users over time to, for instance, provide targeted advertising. Do Not Track (“DNT”) mechanisms allow Internet users to control, and where desired, prevent the tracking of their online activities across such websites and technology. Currently, various Internet browsers offer a DNT option that sends signals to websites visited by the browser about the user's DNT preference – you can usually access your browser's DNT option in your browser's preferences. Specifically as DNT relates to your use of our Services, we currently do not have the capability to recognize or respond to web browser Do Not Track signals and other similar mechanisms. In addition, in the DNT context, other parties do not have the ability to collect your personally identifiable information through advertising technologies deployed in ads that may appear within our Services.

Canada's Anti-Spam Law

Commercial electronic messages that are sent from or accessed in Canada, including emails and text messages (“CEMs”), are governed by Canada's Anti-Spam Law and its relevant rules and regulations (“CASL”). CASL requires that any CEMs sent to Canadian recipients in connection with our Services comply with certain consent and informational requirements (generally speaking, CASL prohibits sending CEMs to Canadian recipients without the prior consent of the recipient). Consent may either be implied (which is temporary) or express (which is permanent, unless and until withdrawn). Examples of implied consent to receive CEMs include (i) your having purchased something from us within the past two years, (ii) your download of software included within our Services or (iii) your giving us your business card at a trade show. You provide express consent when you affirmatively elect to receive CEMs in response to a clear solicitation to do so (for instance, filling out a form on one of our websites where the form clearly states that you will receive CEMs from BBN). When applicable, BBN will ask for your express consent to receive CEMs, and will respect your decision. Under any circumstances, however, you have the right to withdraw your consent – whether express or implied – by following the instructions to unsubscribe found in emails sent to you or by contacting us via the contact information provided below.

Our Commitment to Security

We have in place what we believe to be reasonable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access of, maintain data security for and correctly use the personally identifiable information you have provided or that we otherwise collect through our Services. However, while such efforts are intended to ensure the confidentiality of your personally identifiable information available to us as a result of your use of our services, we cannot and do not warrant or guarantee the absolute safety and security of your personally identifiable information.

  * We work to protect the security of your personally identifiable information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input. To assist in keeping your personally identifiable information safe, you must use an SSL-enabled browser (i.e., Internet Explorer).
  * It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password, your computer and your mobile device(s). Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer. Additionally, change your passwords often using a combination of letters and numbers, and make sure you use a secure Web browser.
