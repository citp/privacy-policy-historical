	  <p><strong>Privacy Policy</strong><br>
  PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF USE  CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THIS WEBSITE.</p>
<p>We understand that your privacy while using our Site is  important, especially when conducting business or providing sensitive personal  information. This notice will govern our Privacy Policy for users of this or  any other BUSTERS website, whether or not a transaction of any sort is  conducted while visiting.</p>
<p><strong>Your Personal  Information</strong><br>
  The information we learn from customers helps us to  personalize and continually improve our customer service, while developing ways  to improve your experience at BUSTERS. Following is some of the information we  gather about our users.<br>
  Information You Provide Us: When you complete a Customer  Profile or other form online or communicate with us via e-mail, letter, fax or  phone, we receive and store the information you've provided. This information  is basic, including: name, addresses, phone, fax and cell phone numbers, e-mail  address, interests and business information (if applicable). We use this  information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests,  communicating with you and customizing future services for you.</p><p>Third Party Vendors: In addition to collecting your  information, we have third party vendors who will also collect your information  in order to provide the products and/or services you've requested (e.g. credit  card companies or banks, fulfillment companies, call centers, suppliers,  affiliates and marketing companies). In general, these companies are  intermediaries acting solely to provide services related to your request. Most  of these vendors have their own privacy policy to protect your information, and  have access to personal information needed to perform their functions on behalf  of BUSTERS, but may not use the same for other purposes.</p><p>Are Cookies Used By BUSTERS: We use cookies to obtain a  variety of information which provides us details as to what product and  information interest our visitors the most. Cookies can also be used to protect  your information. If you wish to disable our cookie from obtaining this  information, you can seek programs that will allow you to visit our site  anonymously.<br>
  Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to  your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to  recognize your browser. We can see what pages you click through, plus store  items in your Shopping Cart between visits. The 'Help' portion of the toolbar  on most browsers will instruct you on how to prevent your browser from  accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a  new cookie, and/or how to disable cookies altogether. Please note that  disabling cookies will prevent you from using many of our services.</p><p>This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service  provided by Google, Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics uses  "cookies", which are text files placed on your computer to help the  website analyse how visitors use the site. The information generated by the  cookie about your use of the website (including your IP address) will be  transmitted to and stored by Google servers. Google will use this information  for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on  website activity for website operators and providing other services relating to  website activity and internet usage. Google may also transfer this information  to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties  process the information on Google's behalf. Google will not associate your IP  address with any other data held by Google. You may refuse the use of cookies  by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser, however please note that  if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of this  website. By using this website, you consent to the processing of data about you  by Google in the manner and for the purposes set out above.</p><p>Information from other sources: We might receive information  about you from other sources and add it to our account information. Examples  may include, but not be limited to, updated delivery and address information  from our carriers or other third parties, which we use to correct our records  and deliver your next purchase or communication more easily; account  information, purchase or redemption information, and page-view information from  some merchants with which we operate co-branded businesses or for which we  provide technical, fulfillment, advertising, or other services; search term and  search result information from some searches conducted through the Web search  features offered by certain organizations; search results and links, including  paid listings (such as Sponsored Links); and credit history information from  credit bureaus, which we use to help prevent and detect fraud and to offer  certain credit or financial services to some customers, and information from  data providers.</p>
<p><strong>Does BUSTERS Share the  Information It Receives?</strong><br>
  Simply said, no. Under no circumstances will we ever give  away or sell your personal information to anyone else for any reason  whatsoever, without prior written approval from yourself. Any information we  gain through our use of customer polls, surveys, cookies, session tracking or  anything else, is used internally and for the sole purpose of providing you  better service. If you are on our mailing list and you ask us to remove you, we  will immediately and will not attempt to sell on your information. As we do  with our own, we respect your privacy.</p><p>Information about our customers is an important part of our  business, and we are not in the business of selling it to other companies. We  share customer information only as described in this statement and with  subsidiaries of BUSTERS with controls that are either subject to this Privacy  Notice or follow the practice at least as protective as that described in this  Notice.</p>
<p><strong>How Secure Is  Information About Me?</strong><br>
  All of our employees and partners are familiar with our  security policy and practices. Your personal information is only accessible to  a limited number of qualified people who are given a password in order to gain  access to the information. We audit our security systems and processes on a  regular basis. Sensitive information, such as credit card numbers or social  security numbers, is protected by encryption protocols, in place to protect  information sent over the Internet.</p><p>While we take commercially reasonable measures to maintain a  secure site, electronic communications and databases are subject to errors,  tampering and break-ins, and we cannot guarantee or warrant that such events  will not take place and we will not be liable for any such occurrences. You  will find that almost all Internet e-commerce providers make this same claim,  especially if they use privacy policy templates such as this one to make known  their company or organization privacy policies.<br>
  We reveal only the last five digits of your credit card  numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card  number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing. Protect  against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer by signing  off when you finish using a computer.</p>
<p><strong>What Choices Do I  Have?</strong><br>
  As discussed above, you always have the choice not to  provide information, even though it might be needed to make a purchase with BUSTERS.  You can add or update certain information on your Personal BUSTERS pages at any  time. If you do not want to receive e-mails or other mail from us, simply click  the Preferences link at the footer of any email sent by BUSTERS and you will be  removed from our mailing list. To remove other personal information from BUSTERS,  please contact our offices. Please note that you cannot opt-out of  communication pertaining to services such as making a purchase on BUSTERS.</p>
<p><strong>Conditions of Use,  Notices, and Revisions</strong><br>
  If you choose to visit BUSTERS, your visit and any dispute  over privacy is subject to this Notice and our Conditions of Use, including  limitations on damages, arbitration of disputes, and application of the laws of  the Republic of South Africa. If you have any concern about privacy at our  site, please contact us with a thorough description, and we will try to resolve  it.</p><p>Because our business changes constantly, our Privacy Notice  and the Conditions of Use will change also. We may e-mail periodic reminders of  our notices and conditions, unless you have instructed us not to, but you  should check our Web Site frequently to see recent changes.<br>
  Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Notice applies  to all information that we have about you and your account. We stand behind the  promises we make, however, and will never materially change our policies and practices  to make them less protective of customer information collected in the past  without the consent of affected customers.</p><p>BUSTERS features public forums where users with similar  interests can share information and support one another or where users can post  questions. Our communities are open to the public and should not be considered  private.<br>
  Any information you share in any online community area is by  design open to the public and is not private. You should think carefully before  posting any personal information in any public forum. What you post can be  seen, disclosed to or collected by third parties and may be used by others in  ways we cannot control or predict, including to contact you for unauthorized  purposes. As with any public forum on any site, the information you post may  also show up in third-party search engines like Google, Yahoo, MSN, Bing etc.</p>
<p><strong>Consumer Protection  Act (CPA)</strong><br>
  South African CPA laws shall supersede any BUSTERS terms and  conditions which conflict with the act or any other laws in the Republic of  South Africa.<br>
