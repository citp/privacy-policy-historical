	  <p>Usage of our software allows you and your organization to fulfill the regulatory requirements of GDPR. It is important to note that we do not retain or store any data you add to our software.

When adding Office 365, Google Calendar or Contacts accounts to BusyCal and BusyContacts, we instead rely on industry standards such as OAuth to authenticate you. Your username, password or OAuth tokens are stored securely in the system Keychain. The Keychain is part of macOS and iOS, where credentials from system apps as well as third party apps are stored securely. Your account information, including the data you sync, is <b>never</b> transferred or shared outside of your machine or mobile to any third party server neither our own.</p>
	  <h3>Licensing</h3>
	  <p>Placing an order or purchasing a copy of our software requires you to share your email address with us, which is then tied to the serial number generated in order to uniquely identify your installation(s). This information is stored and used solely for licensing and invoicing purposes.

	  <h3>Application Logs</h3>

      <p>Non-personal information is data that cannot, on its own, be used to uniquely identify a specific individual in any way or form. This information is usually in the form of crash logs and related analytics. We may collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-personal information for any purpose. We use Google Firebase (previously known as Fabric / Crashlytics) for this purpose.</p>
	  <h3>Cookies and Other Technologies</h3>
      <p>Our website, services, apps, email communications and advertisements may use "cookies" and other technologies such as "pixel tags" and "click-through URLs".
