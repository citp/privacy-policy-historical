                <p>Business Breakthroughs International ("Company" or "we"), owns and operates the websites located at <a href="http://www.chetholmes.com">www.chetholmes.com</a>, &amp; <a href="http://www.chetholmes.info">www.chetholmes.info</a> and <a href="http://www.businessbreakthroughs.com">www.BusinessBreakThroughs.com</a>. The Company delivers advertisements and offers by email to its "list members," that is, people who sign up for offers through our opt-in process via our Site or through one of our many partners' sites.</p>

                <p>List members can unsubscribe at any time, no questions asked. You can remove yourself from any or all of the lists you signed up for by following the instructions contained in every marketing email sent. Business Breakthroughs International bulk commercial e-mail messages sent by Chet Holmes and its affiliate partners are labeled (though not by a standard method) and include opt-out instructions and the sender's physical address</p>
                
                <p>We want our list members to feel comfortable using the Site and participating in the Service and products so we have created this Privacy Policy to let you know what information we may collect from you on the Site, through the Service and how we may use that information. Please take a moment to review the terms of our Privacy Policy. By using the Site and participating in the Service or Surveys, you agree to accept the terms of our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Site or participate in the Service or Surveys.</p>
                
                <h2>PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
                
                <p><strong>Collection and Use</strong><br>
                To simply view the Site without registering for the Service or for the Surveys, you will not be required to provide any personal information. However, to register for the Service or to participate in the Surveys, whether at our Site or at one of our partners' sites, you may be asked to provide your email address. To serve you better and send you the most relevant offers, we may also seek other personally and non-personally identifiable information about you from you, our marketing partners where you have given them your consent, or where such information is otherwise publicly available. Such information may include postal, demographic or transactional information.</p>
                
                <p>If you provide us with your email address or other personal information, or if we obtain such information about you from you or from one of our marketing partners, we will retain and use that information solely for the purpose of sending you advertisements, offers and Surveys from selected marketers in categories of interest to you. When necessary, we may also use your personal information to ensure compliance with Company policies and applicable law.</p>
                
                <p>In addition, if you participate in a Survey, you will be asked to provide certain information, personal and not, in order for us to determine your suitability for particular Surveys, as certain Surveys may be directed only to those participants who meet a particular demographic profile. You will be asked to answer certain "pre-qualification" questions on a pre-qualification page hosted us by. The information we collect on this page will be used to determine whether you are eligible to participate in the Survey and will also be maintained by us to enable us to provide you with more relevant offers and information in the future.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Disclosure of Personal Information</strong><br>
                Except for the limited situations discussed in this Privacy Policy, we will not share your personal information with any third parties. We may sometimes use other businesses to perform certain services for us that will enable us to send you more relevant offers. In such instances, we may provide your personal information to those businesses but they are not permitted to retain or use your information for any other purpose. We will not disclose your personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes.</p>
                
                <p>As Company develops, we may buy other businesses or their assets or sell our business assets. Customer information is generally one of the business assets involved in such transactions. Thus, in the event that Company or all of its assets are acquired, customer information, including any visitor information collected through the Site or the Service, would be one of the transferred assets.</p>
                
                <p>Finally, Company reserves the right to disclose list member information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) Company's rights or property, other visitors, list members, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. Company also reserves the right to disclose visitor or list member information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.</p>
                
                <h2>AGGREGATE INFORMATION</h2>
                
                <p>From time to time, we may collect general, non-personal, statistical information about the use of the Site and the Service, such as how many visitors visit a specific page on the Site, how long they stay on that page, and which hyperlinks, if any, they "click" on. The Company also collects and reports aggregate statistical information on the open rates and response rates generated by the email campaigns we send. We collect this information through the use of technologies such as "cookies" and "IP addresses", which are discussed in greater detail below. We collect this information in order to determine what types of advertisements are of interest to list members and to therefore enhance the Service. We may also group this information into aggregate visitor data in order to describe the use of the Site and Service to our existing or potential business partners or other third parties, or in response to a government request. However, please be assured that this aggregate data will in no way personally identify you, other list members or any other visitors to the Site.</p>
                
                <p><strong>IP Addresses</strong><br>
                An IP address is a number that's automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the web. Web servers, the computers that "serve" web pages, automatically identify your computer by its IP address. Company collects IP addresses for purposes of system administration, to report aggregate information to third parties and to track the use of the Site. When visitors request pages from the Site or click on a link in a mailing sent through the Service or through our servers log the visitors' IP addresses. We reserve the right to use IP addresses to identify a visitor or list member when it will enhance the users experience or if we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with the Site's policies or to protect Company, the Site, its visitors, the Service, the list members or others.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Cookies</strong><br>

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or data repository can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while Company strives to protect your personal information and privacy, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you disclose or transmit to us online and cannot be responsible for the theft, destruction, or inadvertent disclosure of your personal information.</p>

                <h2>CHANGES TO THESE TERMS</h2>
                
                <p>The terms of this Privacy Policy may change from time to time.

                <p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83 allows customers of the Company who are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes.
