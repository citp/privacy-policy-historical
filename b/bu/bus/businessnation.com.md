If you do provide personally identifiable information to us, either directly or through a reseller or other business partner, we will:

  * not use or disclose the information except:
    * to provide you with information we believe you need to know or may find useful, such as news about our services and products, etc.,
    * as necessary to provide services or products you have ordered, by providing it to a carrier to deliver products you have ordered;
    * in other ways described in this privacy policy or to which you have otherwise consented;
    * in the aggregate with other information in such a way so that your identity cannot reasonably be determined (for example, statistical compilations);

If you submit personally-identifiable information after such a transfer, that information may be subject to the successor entity’s privacy policy;
    * as necessary to enforce the Terms of Service;
    * as necessary to protect the rights, safety, or property of the Site, its users, or others; this may include exchanging information with other organizations for fraud protection and/or risk reduction.
