              <td align="justify" class="text1">We understand that privacy online is important          to users of our Site, especially when conducting business. This          statement governs our privacy policies with respect to those users of          the Site ("Visitors") who visit without transacting business          and Visitors who register to transact business on the Site and make use          of the various services offered by businessleadsfinder.com (collectively,          "Services") ("Authorized Customers").<br>
                <br>
                <strong>"Personally Identifiable Information"</strong><br>
                refers to any information that identifies or can be used to identify,          contact, or locate the person to whom such information pertains,          including, but not limited to, name, address, phone number, fax number,          email address, financial profiles, social security number, and credit          card information. Personally Identifiable Information does not include          information that is collected anonymously (that is, without          identification of the individual user) or demographic information not          connected to an identified individual.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>What Personally Identifiable Information is collected?</strong><br>
                We may collect basic user profile information from all of our Visitors.          We collect the following additional information from our Authorized          Customers: the names, addresses, phone numbers and email addresses of          Authorized Customers, the nature and size of the business, and the          nature and size of the advertising inventory that the Authorized          Customer intends to purchase or sell.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>What organizations are collecting the information?</strong><br>
                In addition to our direct collection of information, our third party          service vendors (such as credit card companies, clearinghouses and          banks) who may provide such services as credit, insurance, and escrow          services may collect this information from our Visitors and Authorized          Customers. We do not control how these third parties use such          information, but we do ask them to disclose how they use personal          information provided to them from Visitors and Authorized Customers.          Some of these third parties may be intermediaries that act solely as          links in the distribution chain, and do not store, retain, or use the          information given to them.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>How does the Site use Personally Identifiable Information?</strong><br>
                We use Personally Identifiable Information to customize the Site, to          make appropriate service offerings, and to fulfill buying and selling          requests on the Site. We may email Visitors and Authorized Customers          about research or purchase and selling opportunities on the Site or          information related to the subject matter of the Site. We may also use          Personally Identifiable Information to contact Visitors and Authorized          Customers in response to specific inquiries, or to provide requested          information. &nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  <strong>With whom may the information may be shared?</strong><br>
                Personally Identifiable Information about Authorized Customers may be          shared with other Authorized Customers who wish to evaluate potential          transactions with other Authorized Customers. We may share aggregated          information about our Visitors, including the demographics of our          Visitors and Authorized Customers, with our affiliated agencies and          third party vendors. We also offer the opportunity to "opt          out" of receiving information or being contacted by us or by any          agency acting on our behalf.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>How is Personally Identifiable Information stored?</strong><br>
                Personally Identifiable Information collected by businessleadsfinder.com is          securely stored and is not accessible to third parties or employees of          businessleadsfinder.com except for use as indicated above.

  <br>
  <strong>What choices are available to Visitors regarding collection, use and          distribution of the information?</strong><br>
                Visitors and Authorized Customers may opt out of receiving unsolicited          information from or being contacted by us and/or our vendors and          affiliated agencies by responding to emails as instructed, or by          contacting us at <a href="mailto:businessleadsminer@gmail.com" class="style1">businessleadsminer@gmail.com</a><br>
  <br>
  <strong>Are Cookies Used on the Site?</strong><br>
                Cookies are used for a variety of reasons. We use Cookies to obtain          information about the preferences of our Visitors and the services they          select. We also use Cookies for security purposes to protect our          Authorized Customers. For example, if an Authorized Customer is logged          on and the site is unused for more than 10 minutes, we will          automatically log the Authorized Customer off.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>How does businessleadsfinder.com use login information?</strong><br>
                businessleadsfinder.com uses login information, including, but not limited          to, IP addresses, ISPs, and browser types, to analyze trends, administer          the Site, track a user's movement and use, and gather broad demographic          information.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>What partners or service providers have access to Personally          Identifiable Information from Visitors and/or Authorized Customers on          the Site?</strong><br>
                businessleadsfinder.com has entered into and will continue to enter into          partnerships and other affiliations with a number of vendors.<br>
                Such vendors may have access to certain Personally Identifiable          Information on a need to know basis for evaluating Authorized Customers          for service eligibility.<br>
                Our privacy policy does not cover their collection or use of this          information.<br>
                Disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information to comply with law. We          will disclose Personally Identifiable Information in order to comply          with a court order or subpoena or a request from a law enforcement          agency to release information. We will also disclose Personally          Identifiable Information when reasonably necessary to protect the safety          of our Visitors and Authorized Customers.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>How does the Site keep Personally Identifiable Information secure?</strong><br>
                All of our employees are familiar with our security policy and          practices. The Personally Identifiable Information of our Visitors and          Authorized Customers is only accessible to a limited number of qualified          employees who are given a password in order to gain access to the          information. We audit our security systems and processes on a regular          basis. Sensitive information, such as credit card numbers or social          security numbers, is protected by encryption protocols, in place to          protect information sent over the Internet. While we take commercially          reasonable measures to maintain a secure site, electronic communications          and databases are subject to errors, tampering and break-ins, and we          cannot guarantee or warrant that such events will not take place and we          will not be liable to Visitors or Authorized Customers for any such          occurrences.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>How can Visitors correct any inaccuracies in Personally Identifiable          Information?</strong><br>
                Visitors and Authorized Customers may contact us to update Personally          Identifiable Information about them or to correct any inaccuracies by          emailing us at <a href="mailto:businessleadsminer@gmail.com" class="style2">businessleadsminer@gmail.com</a><br>
  <br>
  <strong>Can a Visitor delete or deactivate Personally Identifiable          Information collected by the Site?</strong><br>
                We provide Visitors and Authorized Customers with a mechanism to          delete/deactivate Personally Identifiable Information from the Site's          database by contacting <a href="mailto:businessleadsminer@gmail.com" class="style2">businessleadsminer@gmail.com</a>.          However, because of backups and records of deletions, it may be          impossible to delete a Visitor's entry without retaining some residual          information. An individual who requests to have Personally Identifiable          Information deactivated will have this information functionally deleted,          and we will not sell, transfer, or use Personally Identifiable          Information relating to that individual in any way moving forward.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>What happens if the Privacy Policy Changes?</strong><br>
                We will let our Visitors and Authorized Customers know about changes to          our privacy policy by posting such changes on the Site. However, if we          are changing our privacy policy in a manner that might cause disclosure          of Personally Identifiable Information that a Visitor or Authorized          Customer has previously requested not be disclosed, we will contact such          Visitor or Authorized Customer to allow such Visitor or Authorized          Customer to prevent such disclosure.<br>
