<b>IP ADDRESSES AND COOKIES</b> <br>
We may collect information about your computer, including where available your 
IP address, operating system and browser type. This is usual data that is 
collected where log files are in use. This is statistical data about our users� 
browsing actions and patterns, and does not identify any individual. The

<b>MORE ABOUT COOKIES</b><br>
A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an anonymous unique 
identifier. When you visit a Web site, that sites computer asks your computer 
for permission to store this file in a part of your hard drive specifically 
designated for cookies. Each Web site can send its own cookie to your browser if 
your browser�s preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser 
only permits a Web site to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not 
the cookies sent to you by other sites. Some of our business partners (e.g., 
advertisers) use cookies that originate from their sites. We have no access or 
control over those cookies. <br>
<br>
<b>WHAT IS A LOG FILE?</b><br>
A log file is a recording of everything that goes in and out of a particular 
server. It is a concept much like the black box of an airplane that records 
everything going on with the plane in the event of a problem. The information is 
frequently recorded chronologically, and is located in the root directory, or 
occasionally in a secondary folder, depending on how it is set up with the 
server. The only person who has regular access to the log files of a server is 
the server administrator, and a log file is generally password protected, so 
that the server administrator has a record of everyone and everything that wants 
to look at the log files for a specific server.<br>
<br>
<b>USE OF INFORMATION </b><br>
We may use information held about you to allow you to use interactive elements 
and features of our site, to carry out any obligations arising from any contacts 
between us and you, to present information in the most effective way for you and
