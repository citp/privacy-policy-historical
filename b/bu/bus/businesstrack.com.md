The Personal Information We Collect Through This Site is the Personal Information You

The personal information we collect about you on this website is the information that you provide
to us. This information may include, for example, name, mailing address, email address, phone
number and similar information. In some cases you may provide it directly, such as by entering
information into an application or online form, and in some cases you may provide it indirectly,
such as the IP address of the computer or device you use to connect with us online. We may
use the personal information you provide us to:
         provide you with the information you have requested,
         facilitate and complete merchant-initiated or authorized transactions,
         provide analytics and other value-added services,
         comply with federal, state and local laws, including credit reporting laws and card
          association rules,

         occasionally send you other information about First Data and its services that we believe
          you would find interesting.
When You Browse the First Data Website, We Do Not Seek to Determine Your Identity.
Personal information, such as your email address, is not included in cookies and is not collected
unless you provide it to us. FDMS does not disclose domain name or aggregate information to
third parties other than vendors who assist us with our website and who are under contractual
confidentiality requirements.
From time to time, however, we may disclose this information to fulfill legal or regulatory
obligations or if we determine such disclosure is legally advisable or necessary to protect our
rights, the rights of others, or to prevent harm (for example, for fraud prevention purposes we may
confirm that your IP address matches the location you enter into an online form). In addition, we
may aggregate data about users of our site and use it for statistical or analytic purposes. This
information helps us to better understand our site’s users and how to improve our site and our
offerings.


Information about Online Tracking
Some browsers incorporate a Do Not Track feature that signals to websites you visit that you do
not want to have your online activity tracked. Tracking is not the same as using or collecting
information in connection with a single website. For these purposes tracking refers to collecting
personally identifiable information from consumers who use or visit a website or online service as
they move across different websites over time.
How browsers communicate the Do Not Track signal is not yet uniform. As a result this site is not
yet set up to interpret or respond to Do Not Track signals communicated by your browser. Even
so, as described more fully throughout this Online Privacy Statement, we limit our use and
collection of your personal information.
For a description of Do Not Track protocols for browsers and mobile devices, or simply to learn
more about the choices available to you, you can visit the All About Do Not Track website:
http://allaboutdnt.com.
Use of Cookies on this Website
This web site may use cookies solely to aggregate information about the pages that users visit so
that we can update and redesign, as necessary, our web site in order to provide you with the
most useful information.
A cookie is a small file, typically of letters and numbers, downloaded on to a device such as a
computer when a user accesses certain websites. Cookies allow a website to recognize a user’s
device.
Cookies can expire at the end of a browser session (from when a user opens the browser window
to when they exit the browser) or they can be stored for longer.
Session cookies – allow websites to link the actions of a user during a browser session. They
may be used for a variety of purposes such as remembering what a user has put in their
shopping basket as they browse around a site. They could also be used for security or to facilitate
use of webmail. These session cookies expire after a browser session so would not be stored
longer term.
Persistent cookies – are stored on a users’ device in between browser sessions which allows
the preferences or actions of the user across a site (or in some cases across different websites)
to be remembered. Persistent cookies may be used for a variety of purposes including
remembering users’ preferences and choices when using a site or to target advertising.
First and third party cookies – Whether a cookie is ‘first’ or ‘third’ party refers to the website or
domain placing the cookie. First party cookies in basic terms are cookies set by a website visited
by the user - the website displayed in the URL window. Third party cookies are cookies that are
set by a domain other than the one being visited by the user. If a user visits a website and a
separate company sets a cookie through that website this would be a third party cookie.
For more information about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set and how to
manage, block and delete them, see: http://www.allaboutcookies.org/.

cookies sent to you from this website but parts of the website may not then work.
