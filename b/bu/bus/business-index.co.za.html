<p>This privacy policy applies to all personal information collected by business-index.co.za via the internet.</p>
<p>business-index.co.za recognises the importance of your privacy, and that you have a  right to control how your personal information is collected and used.  We know that providing personal information is an act of trust and we  take that seriously. Unless you directly give us consent to do  otherwise, business-index.co.za will only collect and use your personal information as  set out below.</p>
<h4>Collection of information</h4>
<p>The four main ways we collect personal information about you are:</p>
<ul>
<li> when information about you is posted on a business-index.co.za website, either by you or by a third party; </li>
<li> when you log into a business-index.co.za website or otherwise submit personal information to business-index.co.za </li>
<li> when you use a business-index.co.za website, in which case our system automatically  collects information relating to your visit to that website, such as  your IP address; and </li>
</ul>
<p>The type of information that we collect from you may include the following:    your name, phone number, address, email address, company position/title, credit card details,    IP address, cookies, personal information that you include in your business listing or personal information    that you email/send using email functionality on the website.</p>
<h4>Our use of cookies</h4>
<p>Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to your computer's hard disk for record keeping purposes.    Most web browsers are set to accept cookies.    business-index.co.za uses cookies to make your use of our website and services as convenient as possible.    Cookies in and of themselves do not personally identify users, although they do identify a user's browser.    Cookies are useful to estimate our number of users and determine overall traffic patterns through our website.</p>
<p>If you do not wish to receive any cookies you may set your browser to refuse cookies.    This may mean you will not be able to take full advantage of business-index.co.za's services.</p>
<p><em>Google cookies</em></p>
<p>business-index.co.za uses Google to serve advertisements when you visit a business-index.co.za website.

<ul>

<ul>
<li> the use or disclosure is for one of the purposes described above or otherwise permitted by this policy; </li>
<li> it is required or permitted by law (including by relevant privacy laws); </li>
<li> we believe it necessary to provide you with a service which you have requested; </li>
<li> to protect the rights, property or personal safety of another business-index.co.za website user, any member of the public or business-index.co.za; or </li>
<li> any of the assets and/or operations of business-index.co.za are being transferred to another party. </li>
