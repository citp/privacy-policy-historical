### Compliance Matters

The Compliance Matters tool requires you to provide an email address to save an action list and send reminders. Business.govt.nz does not collect or store these email addresses. Some browsers may auto fill an email address previously entered if the cache has not been cleared but this is not related to any action by business.govt.nz.

MBIE will be collecting statistics from the Compliance Matters tool including information on items saved to action lists. This information is anonymised and cannot be traced back to an email address used to save an action list.

### Employee Cost Calculator

The Employee Cost Calculator tool requires you to provide an email address to email their calculation results. Business.govt.nz does not collect or store these email addresses. Some browsers may autofill an email address previously entered if the cache has not been cleared but this is not related to any action by business.govt.nz.

MBIE will be collecting statistics from the Employee Cost Calculator tool including information on refinements made by users to the calculation results. This information is anonymised and cannot be traced back to an email address used to save an action list.

### Employment Agreement Builder

The Employment Agreement Builder (EAB) tool requires you to send your completed agreement(s) to a secure email address. You will also be asked for an email address if you start an employment agreement and intend to finish it at a later date. These email addresses will be stored within the EAB tool and used to send you a link to return to your draft agreement. Stored email addresses are inaccessible to MBIE and the EAB tool service provider.

The tool will temporarily store this email address until the agreement has been completed. Once you complete your employment agreement, your email address will be permanently deleted from the tool and business.govt.nz. These email addresses will not be used for marketing purposes unless you opt-in to receive marketing emails.

In the event that you do not complete an employment agreement, private information, for example employer and employee names, will be automatically deleted. You will have to retype these fields when you return to your draft agreement. Any draft agreement that hasn’t been reopened in 90 days will be automatically deleted, along with your email address.

Once you have completed your employment agreement, all information will be permanently deleted from the tool and business.govt.nz.

MBIE will be collecting statistics from the EAB tool. This information is anonymised and cannot be traced back to an email address used to create an agreement.

### Self-assessment tools

In order to display your results, the self-assessment tools ask for some anonymous information about your business, including:

  * industry
  * number of people employed
  * how long your business has been operating.



If you want to save your results and come back to them later, business.govt.nz collects your email address to send a link to the results — and offers the option to sign up to two separate newsletters. This email address will only be used again by business.govt.nz if you subscribe to one or both newsletters. Note that if you save your results but do not subscribe to a newsletter, your email address is not retained, and will not be further accessed or used by MBIE.

###  Workplace Policy Builder

The Workplace Policy Builder (WPB) tool requires you to send your completed workplace policy to a secure email address. You will also be asked for an email address if you start a workplace policy and intend to finish it at a later date. These email addresses will be stored within the WPB tool and used to send you a link to return to your draft policy. Stored email addresses are inaccessible to MBIE and the WPB tool service provider.

The tool will temporarily store this email address until the workplace policy has been completed. Once you complete your workplace policy, your email address will be permanently deleted from the tool and business.govt.nz. These email addresses will not be used for marketing purposes unless you opt-in to receive marketing emails.

In the event that you do not complete your workplace policy you will have to retype these fields when you return to your draft workplace policy. Any draft workplace policy that hasn’t been reopened in 90 days will be automatically deleted, along with your email address.

Once you have completed your workplace policy, all information will be permanently deleted from the tool and business.govt.nz.

MBIE will be collecting statistics from the WPB tool. This information is anonymised and cannot be traced back to an email address used to create a workplace policy.
