**How we use cookies**

 _What is a cookie?_   
A cookie is a text-only string of information that a website transfers to the cookie file of the browser on your computer's hard disk so that the website can remember who you are.   
A cookie will typically contain the name of the domain from which the cookie has come, the "lifetime" of the cookie, and a value, usually a randomly generated unique number. Two types of cookies are used on this website-session cookies, which are temporary cookies that remain in the cookie file of your browser until you leave the site, and persistent cookies, which remain in the cookie file of your browser for much longer (though how long will depend on the lifetime of the specific cookie).   
Cookies can help a website to arrange content to match your preferred interests more quickly. Most major websites use cookies. Cookies cannot be used by themselves to identify you. _How do you use cookies and what information do you collect about me?_

Sites linked to Businesspatrol.com may also use cookies. Please check the individual privacy policies of such sites to find out more. _What is a web beacon?_   
A web beacon-sometimes referred to as a clear GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) or pixel tag-is a line of code that we have installed on some of our pages to help us learn more about how our visitors interact with the content and services that we offer, and to count the traffic to different areas of the website. A web beacon is a 1x1 pixel tag that is invisible to you and doesn't affect the content you see.   
This helps us provide a better service to you by allowing us to understand which areas of the site are more popular with visitors than others. Web beacons are not used to collect any personal information about you. But allow us to gather aggregated information about the use of our site. Businesspatrol.com pages may also contain web beacons inserted by our advertising agency so that we can measure the effectiveness of our advertising on other websites. Web beacon files enable our agency to recognise a unique cookie on your web browser, which in turn enables us to learn which advertisements bring users to our website. The web beacon only records a limited amount of information that includes the cookie number, the page id and the time and date the page was accessed, it does not contain your name, address, telephone number or e-mail address.   
[Find out more about web beacons](http://www.yell.com/legal/cookies/home.html#11). _How to manage the use of cookies on our website?_   
You can manage the cookies in the cookie folder of your browser. You can either delete cookies from your cookie folder once you have left our site, or you can set your preferences before you enter our website.   
Deleting or rejecting cookies may impair your experience of our website. You may not be able to access some pages or complete some transactions securely.
