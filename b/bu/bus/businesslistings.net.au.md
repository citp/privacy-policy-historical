###  What are cookies? How does BusinessListings.net.au use cookies?

A cookie is a small data file that websites often store on your computer's hard drive when you visit their sites. A cookie may contain information, such as a unique user ID that websites use to track the pages of the sites you have visited. We use cookies but do not store personally identifiable in your cookie. 

We use cookies in order to improve your search and advertising experience. Cookies enable us to keep track of your search preferences and advertising selections as you use our site. 

You can refuse cookies by turning them off your browser. If you turn off cookies, though, we will not be able to track your order to enable you to purchase advertising from our site. Nor will we be able to recognise you as a registered advertiser, which allows you to access your account information. 

###  Is my information secure?

Protecting your advertising order information is important to us. BusinessListings.net.au uses Secure Pay's Internet Payment Gateway to provide a secure environment for the authorisation of credit card transactions over the internet. Confidential information including client credit card details are encrypted the moment they are transmitted from the clients browser to the banking network using industry standard SSL (Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology) 128-bit RC4 encryption technology. 

A clients credit card details are not stored anywhere on the internet and the only company who has access to this data is the merchants bank. The bank also sends confirmation information via the same encryption technology back to the clients browser. These secure processes provide clients with peace of mind when purchasing on line. 

Some versions of browser and some firewalls do not permit communication through secure servers like the ones we use to process orders at BusinessListings.net.au. To check the security of your connection, look at the lower left hand corner of your browser window after accessing the server. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending on your browser), then SSL is active. You can also double check by looking at the URL line of your browser. When accessing a secure server, the first characters of the site address will change from "http" to "https". 

If your browser of firewall doesn't support SSL you will not be able to connect to the server, which means you wont be able to mistakenly place an order through an unsecured connection. If you cannot access the secure server for any reason, please contact us.
