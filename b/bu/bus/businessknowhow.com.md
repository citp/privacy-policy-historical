# Business Know-How® Privacy Statement

Business Know-How is committed to maintaining your trust. Our privacy policy will assist you in understanding how we use the personal information you provide to us.

**Privacy of our email lists**  
Attard Communications, Inc maintains several email lists to keep our web site members informed about new features and events. Our list is made up only of those individuals who specifically request and confirm that they want their name be added to our mailing list. A subscriber can opt-out at any time by clicking the unsubscribe link at the bottom of emails that BusinessKnowHow sends.

We do not sell,rent, loan, trade, or lease the addresses on our list to anyone. From time to time, we do send out special offers on behalf of advertisers to our members. When we do such mailings, the advertisers send us the advertisements, and we send the email. Thus  the advertisers do not have access to your personal contact information unless you respond to their ads and provide them with personal information yourself.

**Personal Information**

When you subscribe to our newsletter or fill out a form, we collect your email address and other data you enter into the forms. We use that information to deliver our newsletter or any giveaways you may have requested.  If you take one of our surveys, we may aggregate the responses you provide with those of other respondents to produce and publish reports that describe the overall results of the survey. Such reports indicate information such as the percentage of users who responded in a certain way to questions.

**California Online Privacy Protection Act**

CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. - See more at: http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf
