# Privacy | Business Queensland

The Queensland Government manages personal information in line with the [_Information Privacy Act 2009_](https://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/view/html/inforce/current/act-2009-014).

We collect and manage your personal information as described on this page, unless stated otherwise. 'Personal information' has a broad definition and may include, but is not limited to, your name, address, phone number, email address - basically any information from which you can be identified.

## Information we may request

We may ask you to provide personal information if you request a service from us, submit an enquiry or seek feedback, but only in order to:

  * meet your needs (e.g. answer a question, or suggest appropriate content or services for you)
  * better understand customer needs (e.g. assess or improve the quality of our services to you)
  * meet legal requirements.



Business Queensland delivers services on behalf of more than a dozen Queensland Government departments. That number will grow as more agencies, including statutory authorities, migrate their business-facing services to Business Queensland.

The personal information you provide will be stored in our Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system and may be shared with authorised officers within other government agencies who also provide government services to business and industry. Your personal information will only be sought in order to respond to your specific request and consequent service requirements, to provide you with the best service possible.

This information may be linked to the information collected above to improve your experience on our site. You will be able to opt out of this process at any time.

## Use and disclosure of personal information

To meet your needs or answer your questions, we may share your personal information with other government agencies who are also bound by the [_Information Privacy Act 2009_](https://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/view/html/inforce/current/act-2009-014). Sharing of your information will be based on your needs and we will only disclose your personal information in order to meet your requested service requirements.

Information stored in the CRM may also be used for service analysis and to communicate to you relevant and related government services (e.g. workshops, seminars, grant programs, etc). You will be able to opt out of receiving any optional services at any time.

The Queensland Government is committed to ensuring you are satisfied with the service we provide and may from time to time invite you to complete a survey about your satisfaction. Surveys may be conducted by contracted service providers who will be required to comply with the provisions of the _Information Privacy Act 2009_.

We will not add you to a mailing list, or give your personal information to third parties without your consent, except to provide you with services or improve our service to you, as indicated above, unless required by law.

In the future, you may be able to sign on to our site using a secure, government authentication process which will give us information about your business from the Australian Business Register. This will allow pre-filling of online forms and other facilities to streamline the use of our services. If you choose to sign in, your business information may be linked to the information above, with the aim of improving our service to you. You will be able to opt out of this proposed service at any time.
