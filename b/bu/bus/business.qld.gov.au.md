# Privacy | Business Queensland

The Queensland Government manages personal information in line with the [_Information Privacy Act 2009_](https://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/view/html/inforce/current/act-2009-014).

'Personal information' has a broad definition and may include, but is not limited to, your name, address, phone number or email address - basically any information that will identify you.

If you provide your personal information, we may collect and manage it in our Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system as described on this page, unless we tell you otherwise when we collect your personal information.

## Information we may request

We may ask you to provide information that includes personal information when we contact you, for example, if you:

  * request a service, submit an enquiry or seek feedback through the Business Queensland website
  * attend 1 of our events or meetings (e.g. we may ask you to leave a business card or sign an attendance register)
  * respond to 1 of our surveys
  * apply to participate in our grant or mentoring programs.



We will only request your personal information for the purposes of:

  * meeting your needs (e.g. providing a requested service or referring your request to the appropriate Queensland Government agency)
  * seeking to better understand customer needs (e.g. collecting feedback and information on issues impacting small business, and assessing the quality of our services to you)
  * to establish a register of our customers for the purpose of initiating future contact in relation to issues affecting small business and Queensland Government services.



Business Queensland delivers information and services on behalf of multiple Queensland Government departments. The number of services will grow as more agencies, including statutory authorities, migrate their business-facing services to Business Queensland.

The personal information you provide will be stored in our Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system. This information may be shared with authorised officers within other government agencies so they can respond to your specific request, or to engage with you as a small business operator to help improve the quality of government services provided to business and industry.

## Use and disclosure of personal information

To meet your needs or answer your questions, we may share your personal information with other Queensland Government agencies who are also bound by the [_Information Privacy Act 2009_](https://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/view/html/inforce/current/act-2009-014). We will only disclose your personal information with those agencies in order to meet your requested service requirements.

Information stored in the CRM may also be used for service analysis and to communicate relevant and related government information and services to you (e.g. workshops, seminars, grant programs). You will be able to opt out of receiving these communications at any time.

The Queensland Government is committed to ensuring you are satisfied with the service we provide and may from time to time invite you to complete a survey about your satisfaction.
