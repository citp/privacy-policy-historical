You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies or notify you when a cookie is set.

Other entities' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, and not this policy. Advertisers or other entities do not have access to busuu's cookies.

**4\. DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION**

We display your Profile information (except for your email address and password) to people browsing for friends, and to support other Site functions. busuu does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with third parties except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or in the following circumstances:

  * where busuu is responding to a subpoena, court order, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or to defend ourselves against legal claims;
  * where busuu believes it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of busuu's Terms of Service, or as otherwise required by law;
  * where you are using a Paid Service (including a Premium Membership) in your capacity as a student or an employee or other third party using the Paid Service, we may in such circumstances share your personal information with your educational establishment, your employer or any third party paying for the Service on your behalf (as the case may be) to allow them to monitor your use of the Paid Service;
  * where busuu transfers information about you if busuu is acquired by or merged with another company. If this happens, busuu will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.



Please remember that whenever you disclose personal information online, that information can be collected and used by others. By posting personal information online that is publicly accessible, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties as a result.

We may also disclose your personal information to any member of our group, which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries (as defined in section 1159 of the UK Companies Act 2006, now and in the future).

**5\. THIRD PARTY ADVERTISING**

busuu displays targeted advertisements based on personal information. Advertisers may assume that people who interact with, view, or click targeted ads meet the relevant targeting criteria (for example, men ages 18-24 from a particular geographic area). busuu does not provide any personal information to the advertiser when you interact with or view a targeted ad. However, by interacting with or viewing an ad you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad. We may also carry out targeted advertising to you on behalf of one or more third parties, but in doing so we will not share your email address or other personal information with such third parties.

**6\. CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY**

We shall take measures to protect personal data using reasonable and industry standard security safeguards against loss or theft, as well as unauthorised access, disclosure, copying, improper use or modification.

Your personal data is password protected and, other as set out in this Privacy Policy, can only be seen by you and us. You agree to keep your password(s) confidential and not to disclose them to anyone else, or allow them to be disclosed.

busuu limits access to personal information about you to employees who busuu reasonably believes need to come into contact with that information, to provide products or the Service to you, or in order to do their jobs.

busuu has physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with regulations to protect personal information about you. However, data transmissions over the internet cannot be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Consequently, busuu cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to busuu. In particular, by accessing and using the Service, you do so at your sole risk and you are responsible for restricting access to your computer and ensuring that your computer is free from all types of malicious code, spyware, viruses, Trojans, etc. that may track any data you enter into the Service, including e-mail address, and payment related information.  We are not responsible for any loss or damage arising from the user’s failure to comply with this paragraph.

However, when you pay for a Paid Service, busuu uses secure payment service providers to make sure that your payments are secure.

**7\. THIRD PARTY WEBSITES**

Where the Site, or any other part of the Service, links to other websites, such other websites do not operate under this Privacy Policy. busuu recommends that you examine the privacy statements posted on such other websites to understand their procedures for collecting, using, and disclosing personal information.
