Privacy Policy**

Because we want to demonstrate our commitment to your privacy, we are posting this Privacy Policy to notify you of:

1.   What personally identifiable information is collected from you through our web site

2.   The organization collecting the information 

3.   How the information is used 

4.   With whom the information may be shared 

5.   What choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution of the information 

6.   The kind of security procedures that are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under our control 

7.   How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information. 

We collect information at this website on our own behalf, and on behalf of our customers, so that they may respond to our users' requests for assistance.  We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement.  We collect personally identifiable information at several different locations on our website:  
 

**Insurance Request**  
When requesting assistance from a life or health insurance agent, a user is required to give their contact information (such as name, phone, and email address).  This information is used to contact the user to provide the requested assistance.  It is optional for the user to provide additional information (such as age, gender, and health information), but encouraged so the agent can more readily respond to the user's request for assistance. All Insurance Request information is shared with one and only one agent, a third party customer of Budget Life, so that the agent can provide the requested assistance. 

  **  
Life Insurance Agent Specials**  
When requesting information about our agent special offers, a user is required to give their contact information (such as name, phone, and email address).  This information is used to contact the user to provide the requested assistance.

  **  
Contact and Help Requests**  
When filling out our contact or help request forms, a user is required to give their contact information (such as name, phone, and email address).  This information is used to contact the user to provide the requested assistance.

  
**Cookies**  
A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored an your computer's hard drive.  We do not use cookies, unless you arrived at our site from one of our affiliate sites, in which case we may use a cookie to record the web site from which you arrived. This cookie is only used to give the proper credit to the web site that referred you to our site. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. 

  
**Log Files**  
We use Internet industry standard practices using IP addresses to track visits, analyze trends, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.  IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.

  
**Links  
**This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.  We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information.  This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.

  
**Security  
**We take every precaution to protect our users’ information.  When you submit sensitive information via our website, your information is protected as follows: 

When our request form asks you to enter sensitive information (such as age, gender or health information), that information is encrypted and is protected with industry standard SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) software.  While on a secure page, such as our Insurance Request form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just "surfing." 

If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email to [info@budgetlife.com](mailto:info@budgetlife.com).

  
**Correcting/Updating Personal Information:  
**If your personally identifiable information changes (such as your zip code), or if you no longer desire our service, you may email Customer Service at [ info@budgetlife.com](mailto:info@budgetlife.com), or phone or mail us at:

**Choice/Opt-out   
** We do not share users' information, except for the purpose of servicing the user's request, as indicated in this policy under "Insurance Request." If a user does not want this information to be shared, the user should not fill out the request form. The user can still use all of the other services provided at our website, including a personalized rate estimate that does not require the use of personally identifiable information. 

  
**Notification of Changes  
**If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes at our website so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.  If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email.  Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
