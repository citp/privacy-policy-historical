# Discount Guns for Sale - Buds Gun Shop

Your satisfaction and sense of privacy is a priority for us, so we take a number of steps to ensure your safety and to give you a pleasurable shopping experience with us.

**Credit Card Numbers**  
Your credit card transaction is conducted through a secure server. Your credit card number is stored only long enough for a charge to be made to it. Once the charge is completed, the number is removed from our server to guarantee your safety and privacy.

**E-mail Addresses**  
We understand the annoyance of receiving junk e-mail. So, we want you to know that your e-mail address will never be given out or sold to any outside party, even ones that you might be interested in. This ensures that when you give your e-mail address to us for ordering or account purposes, you will not receive any other e-mail resulting from that action.

Our regular e-mails are limited to order confirmations, customer questions, and possibly an optional newsletter. If you have an account with us, you may choose to not receive our newsletter if we offer one.

**Personal Information**  
We never give out your e-mail address, as described above. Any names or addresses provided will only be used by you the customer, and by us -- BudsGunShop.Com -- for ordering or shipping purposes. BudsGunShop.Com complies with all applicable federal, state and local laws governing the sale, transfer and ownership of firearms. 

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Website. These companies may use information about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, click [HERE](http://www.networkadvertising.org/).
