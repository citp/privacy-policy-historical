        <div class="privacy">
            <p>We have created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to your privacy and security. BudgetAir ("BudgetAir.com") pledges to protect you with our Privacy Policy which defines our policies on the collection, use and protection of personal information of BudgetAir users.

<h3>Web Beacons</h3><p>We and our third-party tracking service partners employ a software technology called Web Beacons that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective.  Web Beacons are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.

In addition, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) requires all travelers to provide their date of birth and gender which must be included within all bookings completed through BudgetAir.  We may also ask you for other personal information, such as your frequent traveler numbers. We need this information to process, fulfill and confirm your reservations and transactions.</p>

<p>BudgetAir currently contracts with several online partners to help manage and optimize our internet business and communications. We use the services of a third party provider to help us collect data and measure the effectiveness of our advertising and how visitors use our website. To do this, we use web beacons and cookies provided by the third party service provider on this website. The type of information we collect includes e.g., the product codes and prices for merchandise that visitors purchase, the pages visited, etc. By supplementing our records, this information helps us learn things like what pages are most attractive to our visitors, which of our products most interest our customers, and what kinds of offers our customers like to see. Although the third party service provider logs the information coming from our website on our behalf, we control how that data may and may not be used. If you do not want to help us learn how to improve our site, products, offers and marketing strategy, you can "opt-out" of our ability to analyze such data by sending an e-mail to the following e-mail address <a href="mailto:optout@budgetair.com">optout@budgetair.com.</a></p>

<p>We may also share your information: (i) in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process, (ii) to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal or suspected illegal activities, (iii) to protect and defend our rights and safety; and (iv) to enforce our Terms, (v) in relation to a divestiture, merger, or sale of assets.</p>

<h2>Other websites:</h2>

<p>When you click through to a third party website, our Privacy Policy no longer applies. We encourage you to carefully read the Privacy Policies of these other websites. BudgetAir does not control any cookies or other features that third parties may use, and the information practices of these advertisers are not covered by this Privacy Policy. Please be aware that these third parties may also contact you to obtain additional information to fulfill your travel reservation.</p>

<h2>Children's privacy:</h2>

<p>BudgetAir does not sell travel or other services for purchase by children and does not knowingly collect information from people under the age of 18. If we become aware of the fact that a minor is attempting to submit personal information, we will inform the minor that he or she is ineligible to do so. We will then remove this information from our records.</p>
