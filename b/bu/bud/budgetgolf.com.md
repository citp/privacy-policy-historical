**Cookies**  
The Site uses a feature of Internet Web browsers called a Cookie, which is a file that a User's Web browser places on a User's computer's hard drive, to assign an identification code to the computer and to collect anonymous browsing information. On this Site, cookies are used in conjunction with session variables to track a User's shopping cart and expire as soon as an order is completed or if a shopping cart sits idle for a lengthy period without being checked-out.

BudgetGolf does not use Cookies to retrieve Information about Users from a User's computer unless the User knowingly and willingly provided such Information. For instance, BudgetGolf’s cookies do not collect any Information and the cookies do not collect, store or contain any credit card information.

You may set your Internet Web browser to notify you when you receive a cookie or to prevent cookies from being sent. If you prevent a cookie from being sent, you may limit the functionality BudgetGolf can provide you when you visit the Site, especially when purchasing an item on the Site.

Because we care, this Site has security measures to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the Information under our control, including credit card information that is submitted to BudgetGolf. When Users place orders or access their account information, the Site uses secure server software (SSL), which encrypts all information Users' input before it is sent to us. In addition, we do not store User's credit card numbers in their online accounts so if someone obtains your account log in information, they will not be able to view a User's credit card number. Thus, we have taken steps to protect the Information we collect from you from unauthorized access. Unfortunately, no system is perfect; therefore, BudgetGolf makes no representations or warranties with regard to the sufficiency of these security measures. BudgetGolf shall not be responsible for any actual or consequential damages that result from a lapse in compliance with this Privacy Policy because of a security breach or technical malfunction.
