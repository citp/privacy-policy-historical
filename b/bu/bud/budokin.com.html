    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>
      BudoKin is committed to respecting the privacy of your personal information collected from its website.
      This website Privacy Notice explains our policy for dealing with personal information that we collect through our website under the domain name "budokin.com"
      (BudoKin Site).
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout this Privacy Notice, we refer to your "personal information" which means information which identifies you as an individual
      or from which your identity can be reasonably ascertained. Your home address and home telephone number are examples of personal information.<br>
      We will post any changes to this BudoKin Site Privacy Notice on the BudoKin Site,
      so we encourage you to check this BudoKin Site Privacy Notice from time to time.
    </p>

    <h3>Information collected on this website</h3>
    <p>
      The information about you which we may collect through the BudoKin Site includes any messages or comments you submit to us via the BudoKin Site. This includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>any details you provide to us as part of a payment or donation process; </li>
      <li>any messages or comments you email us which may include personal information such as your name and email address; </li>
      <li>information collected when you participate in an online survey; and </li>
      <li>your email address if you subscribe to our newsletters or mailing lists. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In common with many websites we may also collect aggregated information which tells us about visitors to the BudoKin Site but not the identity of those visitors.
      For example, we may collect information about the date, time and duration of visits and which pages of the BudoKin Site are most commonly accessed.
      This information is used by us to help to administer and improve the BudoKin Site.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may browse through information-only areas of the BudoKin Site without providing any personal information to us.
      However, we may not be able to provide the full range of services through the BudoKin Site if we are not provided with the information outlined above.
    </p>
    <p>
      BudoKin respects the privacy of all current and prospective supporters.
      If you do not wish to receive communication from us, please us as set out below.
    </p>

    <h3>Cookies</h3>
    <p>
      Like many websites, the BudoKin Site may use "cookies" which store some information on computers accessing the BudoKin Site.
      Cookies may be used by us for a variety of purposes. For example, we may use cookies to recognise a computer which has previously visited this BudoKin Site and customise
      the BudoKin Site according to previous preferences and site behaviour.
      Cookies may also be used to manage security and store information about the type of browser being used.
      With most Internet browsers, users can erase cookies from their computer,
      block all cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. However,
      some parts of this BudoKin Site may not function fully for users that disallow cookies.
    </p>

      In addition to providing our products and services to you, we may use or disclose personal information that we collect about you:

      <li>for administrative purposes including research, planning, service development, security and risk management; </li>
      <li>where a third party acquires or wishes to acquire, or makes inquiries in relation to acquiring, an interest in BudoKin; or </li>
      <li>to the extent that we are required or authorised by law to do so. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We may also share personal information with our related bodies corporate and with third parties.

    </p>

    <h3>How we handle email and "Contact us" messages</h3>
    <p>
      BudoKin may preserve the content of any email, or "Contact us" or other electronic message or form, that we receive.
      Any personal information contained in those messages will only be used or disclosed in ways set out in this BudoKin Site Privacy Statement.

    <h3>Security</h3>
    <p>We use a number of mechanisms to protect the security and integrity of your personal information.
      Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed as completely secure.
      So while we strive to protect such information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk.
      Once any personal information comes into our possession, we will take reasonable steps to protect that information from misuse and loss and from unauthorised access,
      modification or disclosure.
