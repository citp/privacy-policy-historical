<h3>Privacy statement</h3>
<br>
<h3>1.1 General</h3>
<p>Careful treatment of your personal data is very important both to you and budgetair.ie. All information you provide us with shall be treated with the greatest of care. Your personal details will only be used in the way described in this privacy statement.</p>
<h3>1.2 Disclosure of personal details to third parties</h3>
<p>budgetair.ie will not disclose any personal information to third parties, unless this is required for performing services or required by legal provisions. Our suppliers are increasingly required to provide various local authorities, such as the customs and immigration authorities with personal data and travel details of their customers. This is, for instance, required by airline companies and if you travel to or via the United States or Canada. Disclosure of this information is for your own safety. Although budgetair.ie is required to provide your personal details to the supplier, the necessity stated above is a responsibility and activity of the supplier. If you have any objection to this, you should report this prior to confirming your booking. budgetair.ie reserves the right to provide details to the competent authorities, in the event of fraud or misuse of means of payment, or in the event that a user intentionally causes damage through the use of our website.</p>

<p>Our website can be consulted anonymously. Only when you order products, book a trip, want to request the newsletter or wish to contact us by email form, we ask you to enter relevant personal details.</p>
<h3>1.4 Profile</h3>
<p>Our website can save your profile which is secured by a login name and password. A profile offers you extra convenience when making a booking.

<h3>1.6 What details do we collect?</h3>
<p>In order to guarantee the correct execution of the trip you have booked, we ask you to enter both your personal details and the details of your travel companions.

<ul>
<li>your full name as per your passport, including gender, initials, full first name, middle name and surname;</li>
