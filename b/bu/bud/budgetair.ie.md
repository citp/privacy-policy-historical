# Privacy Policy - BudgetAir.ie

**BOOKING ON-LINE**

As a valued BudgetAir customer, your personal privacy is very important to us. We take great care with personal information that is provided to us on-line, taking steps to keep it secure and to ensure it is used only for legitimate purposes. By using the Budgetair website, you accept the practices described in this privacy policy. We may update our privacy policy from time to time to take account of changing requirements such as changes in technology or legislation and we request that you refer back to this privacy policy frequently to become aware of any such revisions. In addition we recommend that you review the private policy of any other website accessed through the Budgetair website as these sites may be subject to different privacy practices. Budget Travel Limited shall not be responsible for these websites or the information made available thereon.

**USE OF CUSTOMER INFORMATION**

Your information is collected when you request information from us, contact us or make a booking with us. We will up-date your information whenever we get the opportunity to keep it current, accurate and complete.

Any information obtained via this website or any other website controlled by Budget Travel Limited will be used by Budget Travel Limited to identify you as a customer, to process your booking, to verify credit or other charge card details and to deliver relevant information to you in connection with your travel and any other ancillary services which you may wish to avail of. For these purposes, we may transit your personal information to our own offices, authorized agents, other carriers and services providers, credit and charge card companies and data processing companies working on our behalf. Your personal information and any records relating to your travel will also be retained for audit functions. We ask for your telephone number so that we can contact you urgently if there is a problem with your reservation.  
We may use the information collected by us to notify you about new Budgetair services, important operational changes and special offers that we think you will find valuable.

Some of your information may be considered sensitive personal data under the EU Data Protection Directive, for example information relating to health. Should this arise, we will require you to consent to the use of such information. We will endeavor to draw your attention to this if it applies, when you first supply us with your information.

**DIRECT MARKETING MATERIAL**

If you do not want to receive any marketing material from us, you may indicate this us when making your booking on our website. If you change your mind you should inform us in writing.

**USE OF "COOKIES" AND LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES**

If our contract and dealing with you is via our website, we may use "cookies", which is a small piece of data sent from our web server to your computer and stored in a text file on your hard drive. Cookies allow us to identify your computer but not you personally. You can set your web browser to refuse cookies. We use cookies to measure site usage and related information. If you are making a purchase, we may also use cookies to keep track of the transaction from one web page to another.

Our website may contain links to other websites not controlled by us. These sites may send you cookies and collect data and personal information. We are not responsible for the actions, content or the privacy policies of those websites to which our website may link.  


**CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION**

When you book a holiday on-line, we offer the use of secure software that encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. The use of Secure Socket Layer (SSL) Technology means that all personal information, such as your credit card number will be encrypted as it travels from your computer to the Budgetair on-line booking engine. When received, the information is decrypted and processed in the same way as a normal credit card transaction by telephone. If your browser supports SSL, and if you entered our site via our secure server access, then transmission of any sensitive data would be protected.

If your browser does not support SSL we recommend that you upgrade to the latest version of any browser to enhance the security of further transactions, otherwise transmission of your personal data may not be protected and Budget Travel disclaims any responsibility in this regard. We have taken all reasonable steps to have in place appropriate security measures to protect your information.
