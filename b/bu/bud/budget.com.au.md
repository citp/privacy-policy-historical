Our Privacy Statement covers:

  * How we collect your information
  * How we use your information

How we collect your information 

We will only collect information relevant to our business relationship with you. This includes information necessary to provide you with goods and services you have requested, information necessary to protect or enforce our legal rights or interests, or is required by law.

The information we collect will depend on the services that you use, and is likely to include your name, address, contact telephone numbers, email address, drivers' license, and credit card details. We may also ask your age group so that we can provide you with the correct cost of insurance for your rental. If you elect to pay for your rental in cash we will ask you to provide us with two referees that can confirm your details and verify your honesty. This helps us to protect our assets.

We also collect information about your use of our products, services and special offers. We may ask you to provide other details voluntarily from time to time to enable us to improve our service or consider the wider needs of our customers or potential clients.

Wherever possible we will collect your personal information directly from you. If your personal information is collected from a third party we will take reasonable steps to ensure that you are aware that this has been done.

We consider it is the responsibility of parents to monitor their children's use of our website. Nevertheless, it is our policy not to require personal information from persons known to be under the age of 18 years old or offer to send any promotional material to persons in that category.

The Use of Cookies

We may send cookies (pieces of programming) to your computer when you visit our site. Cookies can be stored on your hard drive (persistent cookies) or in memory (session cookies). Cookies enable us to enhance the web offerings to you and to optimise your online experience. We will not collect any of your personal information with our cookies.

Persistent cookies identify pages accessed and provide personalised features, for example choosing which page you would like to make your start page. They are used to help us develop the design and layout of the web site, improve applications and measure their effectiveness.

Session cookies are used for security purposes as part of our customer identification process. These cookies allow you to be recognised once you have logged in and provide you with confidential access to your rental records.

We may also allow third parties to collect statistical data from our site using their persistent cookies. However these cookies do not capture information that can personally identify you. They are simply used to measure the effectiveness of our site.  
  
How we use your information 

The information you provide is used for the following purposes:

  * To provide you with the services you require (for example confirming quotes or bookings, hiring a vehicle, and advising you of any upgrades or changes to our services.)
  * To carry out our business which includes account management, planning, product and partnership selection.
  * To fulfill our legal requirements (for example disclosure to law enforcement agencies)  




We may also use your contact details to advise you of any special offers that we believe meet your needs. You can notify us at anytime if you do not wish to receive these, and we will ensure that similar offers are not sent to you in the future. 

You can make such a request by emailing us or

Phoning our customer services department. 

We will ask you for your drivers license number, to identify you and ensure your records are updated correctly.  
  
Disclosing Your Information 

We respect the privacy of your personal information and we will take all reasonable steps to keep it confidential.

We will not sell or otherwise provide your personal information to a third party, or make any other use of your personal information, for any purpose which is not incidental to the primary purpose of collection, being for the provision of goods or services requested by you. For removal of doubt, personal information will not be used for any purpose which a reasonable person in your position would not expect.

We do provide your information to other select organisations that perform certain functions for us. We bind these suppliers to the same standard of care as we do ourselves so that they cannot provide your information to anyone else.

We also share your personal information with other Budget Companies (including our franchise network) within Budget Group Incorporated when necessary to meet your service needs. These companies share our commitment to the Privacy Principles. 

Otherwise we will only disclose your personal information without your consent if this is:

  * Necessary to provide you with the goods and services you have requested
  * Necessary to protect or enforce our legal rights or interests or to defend any claims made against us by any person (including you)
  * Necessary to lessen a serious threat to a persons health or safety or
  * If required by law.

  
How we protect your personal information 

We will use up to date techniques and processes, which meet current industry standards to ensure that your personal information is kept secure and confidential.

Only employees of Budget Rent a Car and those who perform services on our behalf, and are authorised to handle your information, will have access to your personal information.

We will not retain any of your personal information for any longer that it is required by us, except to fulfill our legal obligations.

With your help we will take all reasonable steps to make sure that the personal information is kept complete and up to date.  
  
How to access your information 

You may ask us to give you access to the personal information that we hold about you at any time. This access is subject to some exceptions for example, you may not obtain access to information relating to existing or anticipated legal proceedings.

You can request access to your information by emailing or phoning us. You will be asked to specify the information that you want access to, and you will need to verify your identity before we are able to provide the information. This is a free service unless the information you request requires us to access archived material or spend significant time in preparation or research. If this occurs we will advise the likely cost in advance and can help refine your request if necessary.

We are committed to ensuring the information we hold on you is up to date and accurate. If you do find inaccurate information let us know and we will take all reasonable steps to correct the information. 

If you believe the personal information that we hold on you is in accurate, or incomplete and Budget does not agree with you, we will provide a statement expressing your disagreement with the information where that information is kept.
