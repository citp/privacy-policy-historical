# Budget Australia >> Privacy Policy

Budget Rent a Car Australia Pty Ltd Privacy PolicyWe at Budget Rent a Car Australia recognize the importance of protecting your personal information. The Commonwealth Privacy Act 1988 (Privacy Act) regulates the handling of personal information (for example, name and address details) by Australian private sector organisations. This policy explains how Budget Rent a Car Australia protects your privacy and summarises how we collect, use and disclose personal information that you might provide us. When you make an application to use our service, you consent to us using and disclosing your personal information consistent with this policy. Please refer to the section in this policy titled “What you consent and agree to”. This policy is applicable to personal information that we hold about you in Australia. Because the Budget Rent a Car Group (as to which see below) operates a vehicle rental system in many countries, your personal information will also be held in and accessible by Budget Rent a Car Group staff or franchise and licensee operators located in other countries. This privacy policy does not apply to information held by the Budget Rent a Car Group outside Australia. Some of the countries that the Budget Rent a Car Group operates in have privacy or data protection laws for private sector organisations similar to the law in Australia, other countries that the Budget Rent a Car Group operates in do not. In this policy we also explain how you can contact us if you have a query about any personal information that Budget Rent a Car Australia may be holding about you. We recommend that you take the time to read this privacy policy and retain it for future reference.
