          Budget Blinds, Inc. (“Budget Blinds”) knows that you care about how  your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy  seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy  policy. By visiting Budget Blinds’ Web site, or using any of our  services, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies  outlined in this Privacy Policy. <br>
          <br>
          This Privacy Policy covers Budget Blinds’ treatment of personally  identifiable information (“Personal Information”) that Budget Blinds  gathers when you are accessing Budget Blinds’ Web site and when you use  Budget Blinds’ services. This policy does not apply to the practices of  Budget Blinds that Budget Blinds does not own or control, or to  individuals that Budget Blinds does not employ or manage. <br>
          <br>
          <strong>Types of Information Collected</strong> <br>
          The information we gather from visitors to the Budget Blinds Web  site enables us to personalize and improve our services. We collect the  following types of information from our visitors: <br>
          <br>
          <strong>Personal Information You Provide to Us</strong> <br>
          We receive and store any information you enter on our Web site or  provide to us in any other way. The types of Personal Information  collected includes: your name, address, email address, telephone and  facsimile number. You can choose not to provide us with certain  information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of some of  the services offered through this Web site. The Personal Information  you provide is used for such purposes as responding to your requests  for certain products, services and information, identifying you, and  communicating with you about specials and new products and  opportunities. <br>
          <br>
          Personal Information Collected Automatically <br>
          We receive and store certain types of information whenever you  interact with our Web site or services. Budget Blinds automatically  receives and records information on our server logs from your browser  including your IP address, Budget Blinds cookie information, and the  page you requested. <br>
          Generally, our service automatically collects usage information,  such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our site and its  components. Budget Blinds only uses this data in aggregate form, that  is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify  you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out  how often visitors use parts of the Web site or services so that we can  make the Web site appealing to as many visitors as possible, and  improve those services. <br>
          <br>
          <strong>Email Communications</strong> <br>
          We may send email communications to you to inform you about  specials, product updates, new products and/or information about the  Budget Blinds and Closet Tailors franchise opportunity. If you do not  want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, you may “opt out” by  visiting <a href="http://www.budgetblinds.com/enewsletter.html">http://www.budgetblinds.com/enewsletter.html</a> <br>
          <br>
          <strong>Cookies</strong> <br>
          Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your  computer’s hard drive through your browser to enable our systems to  recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our site are  visited and by how many people. Budget Blinds cookies do not collect  Personal Information, and we do not combine the general information  collected through cookies with other Personal Information to tell us  who you are or what your email address is. <br>
          <br>
          Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature,  which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as  (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you  to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. We  strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however,  because cookies enable you to take advantage of some of our Web site’s  features. <br>
          <br>
          <strong>Sharing of Personal Information</strong> <br>
          Personal Information about the visitors to our Web site is an  integral part of our business. We neither rent nor sell your Personal  Information to anyone. We will share your Personal Information only  with subsidiaries that are under the direct control of Budget Blinds  and as described below. <br>
          <br>
          If Budget Blinds, or substantially all of its assets were acquired,  or in the unlikely event that Budget Blinds goes out of business or  enters bankruptcy, visitor information would be one of the assets that  is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such  transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Budget Blinds may  continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy. <br>
          <br>
          We may release Personal Information when we believe in good faith  that release is necessary to comply with the law; or protect the  rights, property, or safety of Budget Blinds, our employees, or others.  This includes exchanging information with other companies and  organizations for fraud protection. <br>
          <br>
          Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your Personal  Information may be shared with third parties, and will be able to  prevent the sharing of this information. <br>
          <br>
          <strong>Security of Personal Information</strong> <br>
          We use industry-standard Secure Socket Layer (SSL) software to  protect the security of your Personal Information during transmission.  This software encrypts all of the information you input. <br>
          <br>
          <strong>Changes to this Privacy Policy</strong> <br>
          Budget Blinds may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. Use  of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in  effect at the time such information is used/collected. If we make  changes in the way we use Personal Information, we will notify you by  posting an announcement on our Web site. <br>
          <br>
          <strong>Contacting Us</strong> <br>
          If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, the practices  of this Web site, or your dealings with this Web site, please send an  email to <a href="mailto:info@budgetblinds.com">info@budgetblinds.com</a>
