# BuddyBackup: Safe, Free and Secure Data Backup

We take your privacy and the protection of your personal data seriously. We will only store, process and disclose your personal data in accordance with the law. 

##  Privacy when using the BuddyBackup software 

(In this context “user” is anyone using the BuddyBackup software and “buddy” is a user whom you have manually given permission to backup to you). 

###  Information Collected by the Software 

When you setup your BuddyBackup account we will ask for your e-mail address. This will only be used by us to send you important account information (e.g. password reminders) and information about the BuddyBackup software. 

The password you choose during setup is optionally saved securely on our server. This is purely to allow you to request a password reminder if you forget your password. You can choose to remove your password from our server at any time (see [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20181221185721id_/http%3A//buddybackup.com/help/manual/password-security.aspx)). In this case please be aware if you forget your password you will not be able to restore your backups. You can also choose to not provide your password during setup; in this case we will never know your password. 

We do not store your backups or details about your files on our servers. 

We will NEVER access your backups stored on your buddies’ computers, or access details about your files. If you choose to not store your password on our server as described above, we CANNOT access your backups as in this case you hold the only copy of your password. 

The BuddyBackup software will capture your public and private (local) IP addresses in order to help you connect with your buddies. 

We will keep a record of your last logon time and a figure of the total amount of data you have backed up (but not details about filenames, files sizes or numbers of files). This is purely for administrative purposes, and to help us improve the BuddyBackup service. 

We use a Crash Report Tool to collect (with your permission) information about crashes or software errors in BuddyBackup. These reports may contain other personal information about you or your files. You will be asked for permission by the software before it sends this report, and you can decline to send it. Received reports will be stored securely and used purely for improving the software. 

###  How your information is stored 

All the information we collect is stored securely on our server using firewalls, and is protected by strong passwords. 

Your backups are encrypted before sending to your buddies/USB drive. No other BuddyBackup user can read your files, not even your buddies. If you choose a [strong password](http://www.microsoft.com/protect/fraud/passwords/create.aspx) and you keep your password secret, your files/backups will be very secure. 

###  Use of information collected by the software 

We will only pass personal data captured by the BuddyBackup software to third parties where required to do so by law, where it is necessary to carry out or enforce a contract between us (and in that case subject to appropriate safeguards) or where we have your explicit permission to do so, with the following exception: 

  * Your IP addresses and e-mail address are provided to your named buddies. This information is sent securely using SSL.
