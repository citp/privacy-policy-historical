These technologies also permit us to keep a record of your previous choices and preferences so that we can personalize your shopping experience and save you the trouble of reentering information already in our database. Generally, the information we collect using these Web technologies does not identify you personally, however, it may be linked to information that does identify you personally, such as the information you provide when you make a purchase or register to use a special feature of our site. If you do not wish to receive cookies, you may set your browser to reject cookies or to alert you when a cookie is placed on your computer. You may also delete our cookies as soon as you leave BUDK.com.

### Information We Collect From Other Sources

### Use of Cookies and Similar Technologies by Our Advertising Agents

BUDK.com uses third-party advertising companies to place online advertisements on our behalf at websites other than BUDK.com. These advertising companies may use cookies and Web beacons (also known as “pixel tags”) to target and measure the effectiveness of their advertisements. For example, our advertising companies may place Web beacons on their clients’ Web sites. When you visit these Web sites, the Web beacon “tags” your computer with a “cookie” that collects and stores information about your visit to their client’s Web site. This information does not identify you personally. Our advertising companies use the information they collect about your use of their clients’ Web sites to customize the advertisements you see when you visit their clients’ Web sites. Our advertising companies’ use of cookies and Web beacons is covered by their privacy policies, not by this Online Privacy Statement.
