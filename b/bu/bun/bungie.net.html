<h4>BUNGIE.NET PRIVACY STATEMENT</h4>
<p><b>(Last updated April 2005)</b></p>
<div class="RuleLargeTop"></div>
<p>The Bungie Web sites consisting of Bungie.com, Bungie.net, "7th Column" and 
the Bungie Store are operated by the Microsoft Corporation or its suppliers. This 
Privacy Statement applies to the Bungie Web sites you are currently viewing and 
describes what information is collected and used on this Web site. By using 
the Bungie Web sites, you consent to the data practices described in this 
Statement.</p>
<p><b>Collection of your Personal Information</b></p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p><p>The use of Bungie.net does not require you to
disclose any personal information. However, the site offers you the opportunity
to register for an account, which permits you to use additional features
offered on Bungie.net, including Bungie Communities, Forums and the Bungie
Store. Should you choose to register for an account you will be asked for personal
information such as your name and e-mail address. You may also be asked for
additional personal information should you choose to subscribe to newsletters or enter
sweepstakes.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Bungie.net uses the Microsoft® Passport Network to provide sign-in
services. If you create a Passport at Bungie.net, you are simultaneously
registering with the site and opening a Passport Network account. To learn more
about the Passport service, the information stored by Passport, and how
Passport uses and helps protect your personal information, please read the <a href="https://accountservices.passport.net/PPPrivacyStatement.srf?lc=1033?id=42917&amp;ru=http%3a%2f%2fwww.bungie.net%2fHelp%2fNoticePage.aspx%3fsection%3dPrivacyStatement">Passport Network 
Privacy Statement</a>.</p> 
&nbsp;
<p>If you are a subscriber of the Xbox Live service, your
gamertag, nicknames and statistics such as high scores may be displayed on Bungie.net;
and your online presence will be visible to those on your Xbox Live friends
list. You will also have the opportunity to link your Xbox Live gamertag to your Passport Network account so that your experience can be personalized and so that you will have access to
additional features. If you have already linked your Xbox Live Gamertag and
your Passport Network account on the Xbox.com Web site, Bungie.net will have access to that
linkage and you will not be required to do it again. Otherwise, Bungie.net will
automatically redirect and sign you in to Xbox.com in order for you to perform
the linkage. Once your Gamertag and Passport Network account have been linked, this linking may
also be shared with other Microsoft and 3rd party game sites in order for those
sites to provide you with a personalized experience when you sign in. For details
about what information is collected by the Xbox Live service and how that
information is used, please see the Xbox Live Privacy Statement at &nbsp;<a href="http://www.xbox.com/LIVE/Legal/legal-ps.htm">http://www.xbox.com/LIVE/Legal/legal-ps.htm</a></p>
&nbsp;

<p>Bungie.net may collect information about your visit, including the pages you
view, the links you click and other actions taken within the site. We also
collect certain standard information that your browser sends to every website
you visit, such as your IP address, browser type and language, access times and
referring Web site addresses.</p>
&nbsp;

<p><b>Use of your Personal Information</b></p>
&nbsp;
<p>Microsoft uses the personal information it
collects on Bungie.net to operate the site and deliver the services you have
requested. For example, when you subscribe to a Bungie.net newsletter, we use
your e-mail address to send you the newsletter(s) you have requested. If you
choose to enter your name and postal address, we will use that information for
future mailings from Microsoft about Bungie news and promotions. We use
geographical location to determine what localized information Bungie should
provide customers. When you choose to enter a sweepstakes, we use your contact
information in order to be able to contact you in the event you are a winner of
the sweepstakes.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our 
behalf, such as sending newsletters, answering customer questions, fulfillment 
requests and performing statistical analysis of our services. We will only 
provide those companies the information they need to deliver the service, and 
they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.</p> 
&nbsp;
<p>Microsoft will disclose your personal
information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good
faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the
law or comply with legal process served on Microsoft or the site; (b) protect
and defend the rights or property of Microsoft; and, (c) act in urgent
circumstances to protect the personal safety of Microsoft employees or agents, users
of Microsoft products or services, or members of the public.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Personal information that you provide on Bungie.net
may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country
in which Microsoft or its affiliates, subsidiaries, or agents maintain
facilities. By using Bungie.net, you consent to any such transfer of
information outside of your country. Microsoft abides by the safe harbor framework as set forth by the U.S.
Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of data
from the European Union.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Bungie keeps track of the pages on this Web site that our customers visit, in 
order to determine which areas of the site are the most popular. This data is 
used to deliver customized content and advertising within Bungie to customers 
whose behavior indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area.</p> 
&nbsp;
<p><b>Control of your Personal Information</b></p>
&nbsp;
<p>You may unsubscribe to Bungie newsletters by following the instructions in 
the newsletter you receive. If your e-mail address has changed and you would 
like to continue to receive Bungie newsletters, you will need to sign-up again 
for the newsletter on this Web site with your new e-mail address.</p> 
&nbsp;
<p>Bungie.net may send out periodic e-mails informing you of technical service issues, product surveys,
new feature announcements and other news about Bungie and other related
Microsoft products and services. These e-mails are considered essential to the
provision of the service you have requested. You will not be able to choose to
unsubscribe to these mailings, as they are considered a part of the service you
have chosen</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Please be aware that this Privacy Statement and
the choices you make on this site may not apply to personal information you may
have provided to Microsoft in the context of other, separately operated,
Microsoft products or services.</p>
&nbsp;
<p><b>Security of your Personal Information</b></p>
&nbsp;
<p>Microsoft is committed to protecting the
security of your personal information. We use a variety of security
technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from
unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, we store the personal
information you provide on computer servers with limited access that are
located in controlled facilities.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>If you choose to create a profile on Bungie.net
you will be required to select a password. This password can be changed once
you have logged into the service. It is your responsibility to keep your
password confidential. Do not share this information with anyone. If you are
sharing a computer with anyone you should always choose to log out before
leaving the Bungie.net site to protect access to your information from
subsequent users.</p>
&nbsp;
<p><b>Use of Cookies</b></p>
&nbsp;
<p>Bungie.net uses cookies to help you personalize your online experience. A 
cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. 
Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. 
Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in 
the domain that issued the cookie to you.</p> 
&nbsp;
<p>One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to 
save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the web server that you have 
returned to a specific page, so that when you visit the site again, the 
experience will be personalized. You have the ability to accept or decline 
cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually 
modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to 
set your computer to accept cookies from the Bungie Web sites, you may also to 
choose to be logged into the site automatically. You may also select a country 
of your choice as your default home page. This selection is stored in a cookie. 
If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the 
interactive features of the Bungie Web sites or the other Web sites you visit.</p> 
&nbsp;
<p><b>Use of Web Beacons</b></p>
&nbsp;
<p>Bungie Web site pages may contain electronic images known as Web beacons - 
sometimes called single-pixel gifs - that allow Bungie to count users who have 
visited those pages and for other related Bungie.net statistics only - (e.g., 
determine the popularity of certain content and help Bungie to provide the 
content users want, verify system integrity, etc.). Web beacons are not used to 
access your personal information on Microsoft's web sites and services; they are 
a technique Bungie utilizes to compile aggregated statistics about usage of the 
Bungie Web sites.</p> 
&nbsp;
<p><b>Communities and Forums offered on this Web site</b></p>
&nbsp;
<p>Please keep in mind that if you directly disclose personally identifiable 
information or personally sensitive data through Bungie Communities, Forums, 
Messages or other public online forums, this information may be collected and 
used by others. We recommend you be cautious in giving out personal information 
to others in these public online forums. </p> 
&nbsp;
<p><b>Microsoft® Passport Network</b></p>
&nbsp;
<p>This Web site uses the Passport Network to provide sign-in and registration 
services. In order to sign in to this site using the Passport Network, you will be 
asked to type your e-mail address and a password. This same Passport Network sign-in 
allows you to access many other Passport Network participating sites and services. If 
you create an account with the Passport Network at this site, you are simultaneously registering with 
the Bungie Web sites and opening a Passport Network account. All of the 
registration information you provide will be stored the Bungie Web sites, and 
some or all of that information will also be stored by the Passport Network in your 
Passport Network profile. To learn more about the Passport Network service, the information 
stored in your Passport Network profile, and how the Passport Network uses and helps to protect your 
personal information, please read the Passport Network privacy statement by <a href="https://accountservices.passport.net/PPPrivacyStatement.srf?lc=1033?id=42917&amp;ru=http%3a%2f%2fwww.bungie.net%2fHelp%2fNoticePage.aspx%3fsection%3dPrivacyStatement">following this link</a>.</p> 
&nbsp;
<p><b>Changes to this Statement</b></p>
<p>This Privacy Statement applies only to the Bungie Web sites and not other 
companies or organizations to which we may provide links from this Web site. 
Microsoft will occasionally update this Privacy Statement. When we do, we will 
also revise the "last updated" date at the top of the privacy statement. For 
material changes to this Statement, Microsoft will notify you by placing 
prominent notice on the Web site. We encourage you to periodically review this 
Privacy Statement to be informed of how Microsoft is protecting your
