Buncee - A Creative Presentation Tool (iOS App)

Educators and students can create a bunceeEDU FREE account through its mobile application, Buncee - A Creative Presentation Tool. A bunceeEDU PLUS account or a bunceeEDU Schools account must be created on the web, but users can then access the Buncee - A Creative Presentation Tool app using those credentials. You must access your Buncee creation on our web version, on either [edu.buncee.com](https://www.edu.buncee.com/) or <https://www.edu.buncee.com/schools> in order to change any of your Buncee settings such as public/private, commenting on/off, copyable on/off, as well as to make a Buncee an assignment. As such, any Buncee created in a bunceeEDU Schools account will reflect the creation permissions established by the school/district. Any Buncee created on the mobile application will be stored in your account located on our cloud-based website on either [edu.buncee.com](https://www.edu.buncee.com/) or <https://www.edu.buncee.com/schools>. In addition, an account created on the mobile application can only be upgraded to a bunceeEDU PLUS account by visiting the website at [edu.buncee.com](https://www.edu.buncee.com/) and clicking to upgrade. (please see **bunceeEDU PLUS Users** for the full description of PLUS’ additional functionality) By default, any Buncee created within the mobile app is private. Any Buncee created in a bunceeEDU Schools account will reflect the creation permissions established by the school/district. Sharing functionality is dependent on the applications installed on each individual device, and is therefore tied to the iOS device being used by the teacher or student. We recommend that devices utilized in the classroom have applications installed which offer teachers and students appropriate methods to share their Buncee creations. Please Note: Students who are under 13 years of age can subscribe individually to Buncee - A Creative Presentation Tool with verifiable parental consent. Buncee has no intention of collecting personal data from those under 13 years of age with respect to such accounts.

Please read our Privacy Policy to learn more about The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (“COPPA”), its rules, and our practices for collecting, using and disclosing personal information from children under the age of 13.

For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email. Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature. If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account. Please Note: Under a bunceeEDU PLUS subscription or a bunceeEDU Schools subscription,, student sub-accounts will not receive service-related announcements from Buncee. Further, children that are under 13 years of age with subscriptions to bunceeFREE or bunceeEDU FREE student accounts will not receive promotional communications from Buncee or our agents. 

Customer Service:

Based upon the personally identifiable information you provide us, we will send you an activation and welcome email. We will also communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, and to manage your account. Please Note: Under a bunceeEDU PLUS subscription or a bunceeEDU Schools subscription,, student sub-accounts will not receive an activation or welcome email from Buncee. Further, children that are under 13 years of age with subscriptions to bunceeFREE or bunceeEDU FREE student accounts will not receive an activation or welcome email from Buncee. Should a student sub-account have a customer service related issue, they should contact the subscriber of the bunceeEDU PLUS plan or the subscriber of the bunceeEDU Schools plan . Should a child have a customer service related issue, they should contact the parent or guardian whom initiated the parental consent form. Should the child or student sub-account reach out to Buncee via live chat, email or telephone, any information collected will be for the sole purpose of resolving the customer service related issue. If we know that the child or student is under the age of 13, we will not knowingly keep personally identifiable information that is unintentionally included in the student’s inquiry, and any such information will be deleted after their inquiry/issue has been resolved.

Children Under the Age of 13:

The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 and its rules (collectively, “COPPA”) require us to inform parents and legal guardians (as used in this section, “parents”) and teachers, administrators, schools, districts and other educators (as used in this section, “educators”) about our practices for collecting, using and disclosing personal information from children under the age of 13 (“children” or “child”). It also requires us to obtain verifiable consent from a child’s parent for certain collection, use and disclosure of the child’s personal information. For more information on COPPA, please click [here](https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/rules/rulemaking-regulatory-reform-proceedings/childrens-online-privacy-protection-rule). This section notifies parents and educators of: 

  * The types of information we may collect from children.
  * Our practices for notifying parents/educators and obtaining consent when we collect personal information from children.
  * How we use the information we collect.
  * Our practices for disclosing that information.
  * How parents/educators can access and correct children’s personal information, including how a parent/educator may revoke consent.
  * All third party operators through which children may disclose personal information.



This section only applies to children under the age of 13 and supplements the other provisions of this Privacy Policy. Except as set forth in this section, personally identifiable information such as contact information, gender or birth data submitted on Buncee by anyone under 13 violates our Terms and Conditions and will not be accepted. Children may register for a bunceeFREE account on [buncee.com](https://www.buncee.com/), a bunceeFREE student account on [edu.buncee.com](https://www.edu.buncee.com/), and a Buncee Student account on our mobile application Buncee - A Creative Presentation Tool (“Child Accounts”) with verifiable parental consent.. BunceePLUS accounts on [buncee.com](https://www.buncee.com/) and bunceeEDU FREE teacher accounts on [edu.buncee.com](https://www.edu.buncee.com/) are intended only for those who are at least 13 years old, and Buncee has no intention of collecting personal data from those under 13 years of age with respect to such accounts. In addition, only educators and schools/districts are allowed to subscribe to a bunceeEDU PLUS account or a bunceeEDU Schools account, and are intended only for those who are at least 13 years old; however, educators who subscribe to a bunceeEDU PLUS account may create student sub-accounts for their students (“Student Sub-accounts”). If an educator subscribes to a bunceeEDU PLUS account and registers a student under a Student Sub-account, it is the responsibility of the subscriber to monitor the content within the bunceeEDU PLUS account and abide by Buncee’s Terms and Conditions. Only school or district administrators are allowed to subscribe to a bunceeEDU Schools account. Teacher and student accounts are created by syncing Google Classroom roster data with Buncee, or by using the SIS sync powered by Clever. It is the responsibility of the subscriber to monitor the content within the bunceeEDU Schools account and abide by Buncee’s Terms and Conditions. We understand and are committed to respecting and protecting children’s privacy online. However, we urge parents and educators to instruct their children/students to never give out their real names, addresses, phone numbers, or any other information that would allow someone to identify or contact the child. If you believe that your child/student has gained access to Buncee without your consent, or if you have any questions or concerns, please contact us at [privacy@buncee.com](mailto:privacy@buncee.com). Additionally, in our commitment to protect the privacy of children, Buncee participates in the iKeepSafe Safe Harbor program. If you have any questions or need to file a complaint related to our privacy policy and practices, please contact the iKeepSafe Safe Harbor program’s dedicated consumer complaint department at [COPPAPrivacy@ikeepsafe.org](mailto:COPPAPrivacy@ikeepsafe). 

Information We Collect from Children:

While children can access certain parts of Buncee without providing us with personal information, most content and features are available only to registered users and require us to collect certain information, including personal information, from them. In addition, we use certain technologies, such as cookies, to automatically collect information from our users (including children) when they visit or use Buncee. We only collect as much information about a child as is reasonably necessary for the child to participate in an activity, and we do not condition his or her participation on the disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably necessary. 

Information We Collect Directly:

A child must provide us with the following information to register for Child Accounts: the child’s first name, last name, date of birth, and a parent’s email address. We also require the child to create a username and password. We may request additional information from your child, but this information is optional. We specify whether information is required or optional where we request it. When an educator registers a child under a Student Sub-account, the following information will be provided about the child by the educator: the child’s first name and last name, as well as a username and password. When a district or school administrator registers for a bunceeEDU Schools account, student accounts are created by syncing Google Classroom roster data with Buncee, or by using the SIS sync powered by Clever, and automatically pull in the child’s first name, last name, username, and password. Parents must complete the registration process for their children with respect to Child Accounts, and educators must complete the registration process for their students with respect to Student Sub-accounts. When we receive a request from a child to register for a Child Account or from a district/school or an educator to register a child for a Student Sub-account, we will provide direct notice (the “COPPA Notice”) to the parent, administrator, or educator, as applicable, via email in accordance with COPPA to, among other things, notify the parent/administrator/educator (a) that, with respect to Child Accounts, we have collected the parent’s online contact information and the child’s name from the child for the purpose of getting the parent’s consent to collect, use or disclose personal information from the child; (b) that verifiable consent from the parent is required for Buncee’s collection, use or disclosure of the child’s personal information; (c) that Buncee will not collect, use or disclose personal information from the child if the parent does not provide consent; (d) what additional personal information we intend to collect from the child and how we may disclose the information to others; (e) how the parent/educator can access this Privacy Policy; (f) how the parent can give verifiable consent; and (g) that if the parent does not give consent within a reasonable time, we will delete the parent’s and child’s online contact information from our records. Before the collection, use or disclosure of personal information from children, we will request verifiable consent from parents. To provide us with verifiable consent, the parent must, among other requirements, (a) click on the registration verification link contained in the COPPA Notice; (b) provide or confirm information, including limited, basic, personal information about themselves and their children, as prompted by our registration processes; (c) agree to abide by our Terms and Conditions and to ensure that any use of Buncee by their children does not violate our Terms and Conditions; (d) review and edit their child’s username to ensure that no personally identifiable information is present in the child’s username; (e) review and consent to Buncee’s practices with respect to collecting and using personal information from children under 13 as specified in the COPPA Notice and this Privacy Policy; and (f) print and sign our consent form and return it to us by (1) mailing the signed consent form to Buncee LLC, SBU Calverton Business Incubator, 4603 Middle Country Road, Calverton, NY 11933, (2) faxing the signed consent form to 631-591-1389, or (3) scanning and emailing the signed consent form to [privacy@buncee.com](mailto:privacy@buncee.com). Children may not use Buncee until we receive and process this verifiable consent. If we determine that a user is under 13 and we have not received a signed consent form from this child’s parent, we will take steps to delete all or virtually all content posted by the user and take reasonable technical measures to delete all or virtually all stored user information about the user from our records, in compliance with applicable laws. Please Note: Where a district/school administrator or an educator registers its students for Student Sub-accounts, we will not obtain verifiable consent directly from parents, and will presume that the district/school administrator’s or educator’s registration for such accounts and authorization for the collection, use and disclosure of students’ personal information is based upon the district/school administrator or educator having obtained the parents’ consent. In this regard, the district/school administrator or educator will act as the parent’s agent and consent to the collection, use and disclosure of children’s personal information on the parent’s behalf. Further, before sharing, publishing, or allowing a student to share information such as personal photos, videos, or audio of the class, individuals, or groups of students, the district/school administrator or educator represents and warrants that the school has acquired parental consent to use his/her child’s images/voice. In addition, it is the responsibility of the district/school administrator or educator to comply with its obligations under COPPA, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (“FERPA”) and the Protection of Pupil Rights Amendment (“PPRA”), as well as all relevant state laws, with respect to its collection, use and disclosure of personal information from children. For more information on COPPA, please click [here](https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/rules/rulemaking-regulatory-reform-proceedings/childrens-online-privacy-protection-rule), and for more information on FERPA and PPRA, please click [here](http://ptac.ed.gov/). 

Automatic Information Collection and Tracking:

We use technology to automatically collect information from our users, including children, when they access and navigate through Buncee and use certain of its features. The information we collect through these technologies may include: 

  * One or more persistent identifiers that can be used to recognize a user over time and across different websites and online services (including your internet user information, like your IP address, the URLs of sites from which you arrive or leave [buncee.com](https://www.buncee.com/), [edu.buncee.com](https://www.edu.buncee.com/), your type of browser, your operating system, your mobile provider, your mobile device, and your ISP through tools like Google Analytics).
  * Information that identifies a device’s location (geolocation information).



We also may combine non-personal information we collect through these technologies with personal information about you or your child that we collect online. For information about our automatic information collection practices, including how you can opt out of certain information collection, see the “Personal Information Collected” and “Your Information Choices” sections of this Privacy Policy. 

How We Use Your Child’s Information:

  * Enable the child to share his or her information and communicate with other users on [buncee.com](https://www.buncee.com/), [edu.buncee.com](https://www.edu.buncee.com/), [edu.buncee.com/schools](https://www.edu.buncee.com/schools), or our mobile applications Buncee Bits, Buncee for Edu, Buncee Pro, and Buncee - A Creative Presentation Tool,;

Please Note: For Children under the age of 13, as well as children with accounts under a bunceeEDU PLUS subscription or a bunceeEDU Schools subscription, student sub-accounts will not receive promotional communications from Buncee or our agents.



We use the information we collect automatically through technology (see the “Automatic Information Collection and Tracking” section of this Privacy Policy) and other non-personal information we collect to improve Buncee and to deliver a better and more personalized experience by enabling us to estimate our audience size and usage patterns; store information about the child’s preferences, allowing us to customize the content according to individual interests; and speed up searches on Buncee. 

Our Practices for Disclosing Children’s Information:

We do not share, sell, rent or transfer children’s personal information other than as described in this section. We may disclose aggregated information about our users, and information that does not identify any individual or device. In addition, we may disclose children’s personal information: 

  * To third parties we use to support the internal operations of Buncee and who are bound by contractual or other obligations to use the information only for such purpose and to keep the information confidential.
  * If we are required to do so by law or legal process, such as to comply with any court order or subpoena or to respond to any government or regulatory request.
  * If we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to protect the rights, property or safety of Buncee LLC, our customers or others, including to protect the safety of a child; protect the safety and security of Buncee; or enable us to take precautions against liability.
  * To law enforcement agencies or for an investigation related to public safety.



We enable registered users to communicate with others on or through Buncee via email, social media, posting to public areas of Buncee, and links to Third-Party Sites, Products and Services (“Social Features”). The nature of these Social Features allows children to disclose personal information about themselves. Children will not be able to use Social Features until we have obtained verifiable consent as described above under the “Information We Collect From Children” section of this Privacy Policy. We do not monitor, review or control the types of information your child can send or post via Social Features, and we do not control the actions of third parties with whom your child shares his or her information. We encourage parents to educate their children about safe internet use and to carefully monitor their children’s use of Social Features. Please Note: With respect to Student Sub-accounts, students may communicate with others on or through Buncee only via email or by sharing a link or embed code but cannot otherwise upload their digital canvas to social media directly through the Buncee platform. Student accounts maintained within a bunceeEDU Schools account are private by default and are able to email or share a link or embed code but cannot otherwise upload their digital canvas to social media directly through the Buncee platform. The district or school administrator can enable social sharing options for the district, school(s), user type(s), and/or user(s) at their discretion. Buncee may contain links to or allow children to interact with and make use of Third-Party Sites, Products and Services. Access to Third-Party Sites, Products and Services is provided solely as a convenience to our users. Such Third-Party Sites, Products and Services are not under Buncee LLC’s control and Buncee LLC does not necessarily endorse the content, advertising, products, services or other materials on or available from such Third-Party Sites, Products and Services. A child’s use of any Third-Party Sites, Products and Services may be subject to the third-party provider’s terms and conditions and privacy policy and may involve the disclosure or transfer of information from or about the child to the third-party provider. You will need to make your own independent judgment regarding your child’s use of and interaction with any Third-Party Sites, Products and Services. You acknowledge and agree that Buncee LLC is not responsible for the availability of any Third-Party Sites, Products and Services and that Buncee LLC shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with your child’s use of or interaction with any Third-Party Sites, Products and Services. In addition, if Buncee LLC goes through a business transition, such as a merger, consolidation, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, users’ personally identifiable information will likely be among the assets transferred. Users will be notified via a prominent notice on our Web site for 30 days of any such change in ownership or control of personal information. We also provide users with the means to control whether or not his or her profile is viewable to other Buncee users. Student Sub-accounts created by a bunceeEDU PLUS subscriber or a bunceeEDU Schools subscriber are private by default and will only be visible to the subscriber, not to other users. Please Note: With respect to Student Sub-accounts, we do not use or share personal information from children for commercial purposes not related to the provision of the services requested by the educator. 

Accessing and Correcting Your Child’s Personal Information:

At any time, parents and educators may review the child’s personal information maintained by us, require us to correct or delete the personal information and/or refuse to permit us from further collecting or using the child’s information.
