# Bungie.net : Privacy Statement

The Bungie Web sites consisting of Bungie.com, Bungie.net, "7th Column" and BungieStore.com (the “Bungie Web Sites”) are operated by Bungie Inc. (“Bungie,” “we” or “us”) or its suppliers. We also provide applications for your mobile devices (“Bungie Mobile Apps”) through which we offer various services (the “Bungie Mobile Services”). Additionally, we make various online services available through our games (“Bungie Game Services”). Together, we will refer to the Bungie Mobile Services, Bungie Game Services and Bungie Web Sites as the “Bungie Services” in this Privacy Statement. This Privacy Statement applies to the Bungie Services and describes what information we collect on them, as well as how we use and disclose such information. By using the Bungie Services, you consent to the data practices described in this Privacy Statement. 

#### Collection of Information You Provide

The Bungie Services offer you the opportunity to register for an account, which permits you to use additional features offered on the Bungie Services, including Bungie Communities, Forums and the Bungie Store. Should you choose to register for an account you will be asked for personal information such as your name and e-mail address. You may also be asked for additional personal information should you choose to subscribe to newsletters, enter sweepstakes, or engage in other activities on the Bungie Services. If you use our Bungie Mobile Services, we may collect and store your phone number and location information. 

Bungie.net uses Windows Live™ ID to provide sign-in services. To create an account at Bungie.net, you must use your Windows Live ID. If you do not have a Windows Live ID, you will need to create one. To learn more about Windows Live ID, and how it uses and helps protect your personal information, please see the [Windows Live ID home page, and read the posted privacy statement there](http://www.passport.net/). 

If you are a subscriber of the Xbox Live service, your Gamertag, nicknames and statistics such as high scores may be displayed on Bungie.net and your online presence will be visible to those on your Xbox Live friends list. You will also have the opportunity to link your Xbox Live Gamertag to your Windows Live ID so that your experience can be personalized and so that you will have access to additional features. If you have already linked your Xbox Live Gamertag and your Windows Live ID on the Xbox.com Web site, Bungie.net will have access to that linkage and you will not be required to do it again. Otherwise, Bungie.net will automatically redirect and sign you in to Xbox.com in order for you to perform the linkage. Once your Gamertag and Windows Live ID have been linked, this linking may also be shared with Microsoft Corporation and other 3rd party game sites in order for those sites to provide you with a personalized experience when you sign in. For details about what information is collected by Microsoft’s Xbox Live service and how that information is used, please see the Microsoft/Xbox Live Privacy Statement at [ http://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/default.aspx](http://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/default.aspx) . 

You may connect your Bungie account with your Facebook account. To do so, you will need to give us access to the information on your Facebook account through Facebook Connect. By doing so, you authorize us to use and disclose all information exposed to us through Facebook Connect pursuant to this Privacy Statement, including your status updates, photos, videos, name, email address, information regarding your friends on Facebook, and any additional information that Facebook may make available through Facebook Connect. You should check your Facebook settings to manage the information sent to us and third parties through Facebook Connect. 

We may receive personal information and other information from third parties about you, and may combine this information with other personal information we maintain about you. If we do so, this policy also governs the combined information.

If you are sharing a computer with anyone you should always choose to log out before leaving the Bungie Service to protect access to your personal information from subsequent users. 

Please be aware that despite our security measures, no data transmissions over the Internet can be guaranteed to be completely secure. We cannot, therefore, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Bungie, and you do so at your own risk. Additionally, although we use reasonable security measures to keep your information secure, this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. 

If we learn of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. By using the Bungie Services or providing personal information to us you agree that we can communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy and administrative issues relating to your use of the Bungie Services. Bungie may post a notice on the Bungie Services if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing.

A primary purpose of cookies is to provide convenience and save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the web server that you have returned to a specific page, so that when you visit the site again, the experience will be personalized.
