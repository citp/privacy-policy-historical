Safeguarding this information is Bundle's utmost priority, a non-negotiable promise from us to you. This disclosure is intended to explain how your personally identifiable information may be collected, handled and disclosed.

**What information do we collect and track?**

We may request personal information, such as e-mail address, when you sign up for services on our website, upload information, post content, register for a product or service, enter a contest or game, download information, answer a survey, correspond with us, correspond with others or engage in certain other activities on or through our Website. The types of information we collect may vary depending on the nature of the activity in which you are engaged. The information you store with us relating to your financial accounts, including the account numbers, balances, types of transactions, average balances and reward status, are your private and personal information. You make the decision whether to proceed with any activity that requests personal information. If you do not wish to provide the requested information, however, you may not be able to complete the transaction or activity.

The only other information we automatically collect is information related to the use of our Websites, such as:
