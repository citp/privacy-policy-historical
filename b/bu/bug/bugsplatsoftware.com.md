# Privacy Policy | BugSplat Software

## Privacy Policy

BugSplat takes your privacy seriously. Our customers store valuable personal and commercial information on our site, and we protect the confidentiality of that information. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy.

### What This Privacy Policy Covers

This policy covers how BugSplat treats information that it collects and receives. This includes personal information as well as commercial information related to your company’s products.

### Information Collection and Use

  * BugSplat collects information when you register with BugSplat, when you use BugSplat products or services, or when you visit BugSplat pages.
  * When you register we ask for information such as your name, email address, company, and product information. Once you register with BugSplat and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us.
  * BugSplat saves additional product specific information when you register a product with our service. This information may include product executable files and symbol files.
  * BugSplat automatically receives and records information on our server from you and from your products that are registered with our service.
  * BugSplat uses information collected for the following general purposes: to contact you, to provide a service that allows you to better understand what issues your customers face while using your software, to improve our services, and to provide anonymous aggregate reporting of defect trends found by our clients. Your information is safe with us. We will not ever release this information to others except as required by law and desribed below. BugSplat will never use the information you provide to attempt to duplicate or reverse engineer your product.
  * BugSplat may collect personal, confidential information from your customers when defect reports are generated. There is the potential for any information that your program processes to be received at BugSplat as the result of a crash report. It is important that you understand this and put appropriate privacy policies in place at your company. In particular, you should keep the BugSplat login and password confidential, except to trusted employees.



### Information Sharing and Disclosure

BugSplat does not rent, sell, or share information about you or your products with other people or companies except to provide products or services you’ve requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:

  * We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.
  * We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of BugSplat’s terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.
  * We transfer information about you if BugSplat is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, BugSplat will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.



### Your Ability to Edit and Delete Your Account Information and Preferences

### General

  * You can edit your BugSplat account information at any time.
  * We reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to the BugSplat service, such as service announcements and administrative messages that are considered part of your BugSplat account, without offering you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving them.
  * You can delete your BugSplat account by visiting our Account Deletion page. If your free BugSplat account hasn’t had activity for a significant period of time, it may be automatically deleted. Accounts that have paid a subscription fee will not be automatically deleted as long as the subscription is up-to-date.



### Confidentiality and Security

We limit access to your account information to employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs.

### Changes to this Privacy Policy

BugSplat may update this policy. We will notify you about significant changes in the way we treat confidential information by sending a notice to the email address specified in your BugSplat account or by placing a prominent notice on our site.
