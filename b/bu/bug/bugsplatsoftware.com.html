                BugSplat collects information when you register with 
                BugSplat, when you use BugSplat products or services, 
                or when you visit BugSplat pages.

                When you register we ask for information such as your

                Once you register with BugSplat and sign in to our

            <li>
                BugSplat saves additional product specific information 
                when you register a product with our service. This 
                information may include product executable files and 
                symbol files.
            </li>
            <li>
                BugSplat automatically receives and records information 
                on our server from you and from your products that

                BugSplat uses information collected for the following 
                general purposes: to contact you, to provide a service 
                that allows you to better understand what issues your 
                customers face while using your software, to improve 
                our services, and to provide anonymous aggregate reporting 
                of defect trends found by our clients. Your information 
                is safe with us. We will not ever release this information 
                to others except as required by law and desribed below. 
                BugSplat will never use the information you provide 
                to attempt to duplicate or reverse engineer your product.

            <li>
                BugSplat may collect personal, confidential information 
                from your customers when defect reports are generated. 
                There is the potential for any information that your 
                program processes to be received at BugSplat as the 
                result of a crash report. It is important that you 
                understand this and put appropriate privacy policies 
                in place at your company. In particular, you should 
                keep the BugSplat login and password confidential, 
                except to trusted employees.
