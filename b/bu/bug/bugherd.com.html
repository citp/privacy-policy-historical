You agree to your data being transferred to other countries when you share your data with us. If you later wish to withdraw your consent, you can delete your account as described in the ‘Changing or Deleting your Information’ section.<br><br>The European Commission has the power to determine, on the basis of the GDPR, whether a country outside the European Union offers an adequate level of data protection by making an ‘adequacy decision’. To date, the European Commission has not adopted an adequacy decision in respect of Australia. Instead, we rely on other legal bases to lawfully transfer personal data around the world (including transfers to countries like Australia where an adequacy decision has not been adopted). These bases include your consent and the European Commission-approved model contractual clauses, which require certain privacy and security protections. You may obtain a copy of the model contractual clauses by contacting us in accordance with the ‘Contact us’ section.<br><br><span class="text-span-5"><strong>Voluntary disclosure of personal information:</strong><br></span><br>We may make available on our site, or link to, certain opportunities for our customers and other users to share information online (e.g., on message boards, in chat areas, in file uploads, through events, etc.).<br><br>Please be aware that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online, that information becomes public and can be collected and used by others.

To enable DPS to provide secure payment facilities it will typically acquire information which may include the Cardholder’s name, credit card number (with the expiry date) and billing address. DPS uses the information to obtain authorization of the transaction from the Issuing bank of the credit card and DPS’s own or Macropod Software Pty Ltd’s bank and to process the payment. Some details from the transaction (such as name, email and delivery address) may be made available to Macropod Software Pty Ltd or Acquirer through Payline - DPS web based transactions management system, which allows Merchants to track transactions and process refunds.
