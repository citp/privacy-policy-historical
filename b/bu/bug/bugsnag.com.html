          <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> May 24, 2018</p>

<h2 id="1-purpose">1. Purpose</h2>

<p>This Privacy Policy is incorporated by reference into the <a href="https://docs.bugsnag.com/legal/terms-of-service/">Bugsnag Terms of Service</a> (the “Terms”). The terms “Bugsnag,” “we,” and “us” include Bugsnag, Inc. and our affiliates and subsidiaries. This Privacy Policy explains our online and offline information practices, the kinds of information we may collect, how we intend to use and share that information, and how you can opt-out of a use or correct or change such information. All other terms not defined herein will have the meanings set forth in the Terms.</p>

<h2 id="2-scope">2. Scope</h2>

<p>This Privacy Policy applies to Personal Information that is Processed by Bugsnag in the course of our software as a service business, including on bugsnag.com, docs.bugsnag,com, and other Bugsnag websites (each a “Site” or “Sites”), forums, blogs, and other online or offline offerings (together with any and all future mobile, online, and offline offerings operated by or on behalf of Bugsnag, the “Services”). This Privacy Policy does not apply to Bugsnag’s on-premise product which is controlled by the customer such that Bugsnag does not collect, receive, store, or otherwise interact with the customers’ data.  All individuals whose responsibilities include the Processing of Personal Information on behalf of Bugsnag are expected to protect that data by adherence to this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is intended to meet requirements globally, including those in North America, Europe, APAC, and other jurisdictions.</p>

<p>Bugsnag complies with the requirements of the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework (“Privacy Shield”), as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), regarding the collection, use, and retention of Personal Information transferred from the European Economic Area to the United States. Bugsnag has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view Bugsnag’s certification, please visit https:// www.privacyshield.gov. Additionally, Bugsnag may protect information through other legally valid methods, including international data transfer agreements.</p>

<p>This Policy applies to all Bugsnag’s operating divisions, subsidiaries, affiliates, and branches, including its U.S. affiliates certified under the Privacy Shield, and any additional subsidiary, affiliate, or branch of Bugsnag that we may subsequently form.</p>

<h2 id="3-transparency-notice-types-of-personal-information-we-collect-and-how-we-use-it">3. Transparency/Notice - Types Of Personal Information We Collect And How We Use It</h2>

<p>The types of Personal Information we may collect (directly from you or from Third-Party sources) and our privacy practices depend on the nature of the relationship you have with Bugsnag and the requirements of applicable law. Some of the ways that Bugsnag may collect Personal Information include:</p>

<ul>
<li>You may provide Personal Information directly to Bugsnag through interacting with the Services, participating in surveys, during events such as sweepstakes, and requesting Services, or information.</li>
<li>As you navigate the Services, certain passive information may also be collected about your visit, including through cookies and similar technologies as described below.
We endeavor to collect only that information which is relevant for the purposes of Processing. Below are the ways we collect Personal Information and how we use it.</li>
</ul>

<p>We endeavor to collect only that information which is relevant for the purposes of Processing. Below are the ways we collect Personal Information and how we use it.</p>

<h3 id="3-1-types-of-personal-information-we-collect">3.1 Types Of Personal Information We Collect</h3>

<p>Bugsnag collects Personal Information regarding its current, prospective, and former clients, customers, users, visitors, and guests (collectively “Individuals”).</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Information You Provide Directly to Us.</strong> When you use the Services or engage in certain activities, such as registering for an account with Bugsnag, purchasing a Plan from Bugsnag, requesting Services or information, or contacting us directly through the “Contact Us” feature or by some other method, we may ask you to provide some or all of the following types of information:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Communications with Us.</strong>  We may collect Personal Information from you such as name, email address, phone number, company or organization name, location, or mailing address when you use the “Contact Us” feature, register for Bugsnag, choose to request information about our Services, request to receive customer or technical support, or otherwise communicate with us.  We may also receive a confirmation when you open an email from us, which helps us make our communications with you more interesting and improve our Services.</li>
<li><strong>Surveys.</strong>  From time to time, we may contact you to participate in online surveys. If you do decide to participate, you may be asked to provide certain information which may include Personal Information. All information collected from your participation in our surveys is provided by you voluntarily. We may use such information to improve our products, Sites and/or Services and in any manner consistent with the policies provided herein.</li>
<li><strong>Purchase of a Plan.</strong>  When you purchase a Plan on the Site you must provide your email address, first and last name, credit card number, card expiration date and card CVC code. The credit card information is encrypted and transmitted to a Third Party payment processor for processing and storage to a high security vault according to strict industry standards. Once the data reaches the vault it is “tokenized”. No credit card information is received or retained in Bugsnag’s own systems. Your credit card information is not exposed anywhere in our own systems. Please do not send your credit card information to our team directly, for example by emailing this information to <a href="mailto:privacy@bugsnag.com">privacy@bugsnag.com</a>. Please use our secure, online system to enter your credit card information.</li>
<li><strong>Offline Information.</strong>  As you might expect, we usually collect or receive information through our Site. But we also may collect information offline and it’s important to us that we preserve the privacy of your Personal Information both online and off. For example, if we speak with you by phone as part of our sales process, we may ask for your location. There are other ways we could learn of Personal Information offline, but this Privacy Notice doesn’t try to predict all those methods. We just want you to know that we try to treat offline information collection, uses and disclosures consistently with our online privacy practices.</li>
<li><strong>Automatic Data Collection.</strong> We may collect certain information automatically through our Services or other methods of web analysis, such as your Internet protocol (IP) address, cookie identifiers, mobile carrier, mobile advertising identifiers, MAC address, IMEI, and other browser or device identifiers that are automatically assigned to your computer or device when you access the Internet, browser type and language, geolocation information, hardware type, operating system, Internet service provider, pages that you visit before and after using the Services, the date and time of your visit, the amount of time you spend on each page, information about the links you click and pages you view within the Services, and other actions taken through use of the Services such as preferences.  If you click on a link to a Third-Party website or service, a Third-Party may also transmit cookies to you. This Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any Third-Parties and we are not responsible for their privacy policies and practices.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Information Submitted Via Services.</strong> You agree that Bugsnag is free to use the content of any communications submitted by you via the Services, including any ideas, inventions, concepts, techniques, or know-how disclosed therein, for any purpose including developing, manufacturing, and/or marketing goods or Services. Bugsnag will not release your name or otherwise publicize the fact that you submitted materials or other information to us unless: (a) you grant us permission to do so; (b) we first send notice to you that the materials or other information you submit to a particular part of a Service will be published or otherwise used with your name on it; or © we are required to do so by law.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Information from Other Sources.</strong> We may receive information about you from other sources, including through Third-Party services and organizations to supplement information provided by you (for example, lead or data enrichment services). . This supplemental information allows us to verify information that you have provided to Bugsnag and to enhance our ability to provide you with information about our business, products, and Services.  Through cookies we place on your browser or device, we may also collect information about your online activity after you leave our Site. We use this information to improve the Site and customize your online experience.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Event Data Information.</strong>  The Bugsnag Services monitor errors in web, mobile and server applications and programs under the direction of its Customers, to provide session, error and crash Event Data. Each Bugsnag Customer provides Bugsnag with session, error and crash Event Data from the Customer’s applications and programs. Event Data may contain personal information of the Customer’s end user. This means that if you are an end user of a service provided by a Bugsnag Customer, then Bugsnag may receive Personal Information about you from the Bugsnag Customer. Not all Customers provide Personal Information about their end users to Bugsnag. Customers use the Services dashboard to control or block the use of end user Personal Information by the Services. Bugsnag itself does not collect this end user Personal Information and Bugsnag has no direct relationship with these individuals. For example, a Customer may direct Bugsnag to log certain software application’s end user information associated with Event Data, such as the end user’s device ID, email and name. Bugsnag is a data processor and follows the instructions of the Customer in these cases. To find out more about how our Customers issue these instructions to us and handle this Personal Information you will need to review the privacy policies of each Customer. An individual who wants to correct, amend or delete inaccurate data should direct his or her request to Bugsnag’s Customer (the data controller). Separately, if our Customer requests that we remove Event Data from the Services then we will respond promptly to this request.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No Sensitive Data or Sensitive Personal Information.</strong>  Bugsnag does not collect Sensitive Data as defined under the laws of the European Union.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="3-2-personal-information-collected-and-controlled-by-customers">3.2 Personal Information Collected And Controlled By Customers</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Bugsnag monitors web, mobile and server applications and programs under the direction of its Customers, to provide error Event Data about the Customer’s applications and programs to the Customer. Event Data may contain Personal Information of the individuals who use the Customer’s applications. Bugsnag itself does not collect this end user Personal Information and Bugsnag has no direct relationship with these individuals. For example, a Customer may direct Bugsnag to log certain software application’s end user information associated with Event Data, such as the end user’s device ID, email and name. Bugsnag is a data processor and follows the instructions of the Customer in these cases.</p></li>
<li><p>To find out more about how our Customers issue these instructions to us and handle this Personal Information you will need to review the privacy policies of each Customer. An individual who wants to correct, amend or delete inaccurate data should direct his or her request to Bugsnag’s Customer (the data controller). Separately, if our Customer requests that we remove Event Data from the Services then we will respond promptly to this request.</p></li>
<li><p>If you are a Customer then you are responsible for obtaining permission from your end users to share any data that may contain the end users’ Personal Information with the Bugsnag Platform. Customers use the Services dashboard to control or block the use of end user Personal Information by the Services. From time to time Bugsnag creates statistics about the way Customers generally use our Services. These statistics are derived from large sets of anonymized, aggregated Event Data. We refer to this information as “Aggregated Information.” Aggregated Information contains no Personal Information and no information that can be associated with any specific Customer. Bugsnag shares Aggregated Information with its Customers to educate them about the usefulness of the Services and to help them understand industry trends.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Research and Development.</strong> Bugsnag may use Personal Information to create non-identifiable information that we may use alone or in the aggregate with information obtained from other sources, in order to help us to optimally deliver our existing products and Services or develop new products and Services. From time to time, Bugsnag may perform research (online and offline) via surveys. We may engage Third-Party service providers to conduct such surveys on our behalf. All survey responses are voluntary, and the information collected will be used for research and reporting purposes to help us better serve Individuals by learning more about their needs and the quality of the products and Services we provide. The survey responses may be utilized to determine the effectiveness of our Services, various types of communications, advertising campaigns, and/or promotional activities. If an Individual participates in a survey, the information given will be used along with that of other study participants. We may share anonymous Individual and aggregate data for research and analysis purposes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Direct Mail, Email and Outbound Telemarketing.</strong> Individuals who provide us with Personal Information, or whose Personal Information we obtain from Third-Parties, may receive periodic emails, newsletters, mailings, or phone calls from us with information on Bugsnag’s or our business partners’ products and services or upcoming special offers/events we believe may be of interest. We offer the option to decline these communications at no cost to the Individual by following the instructions in Section 5 below.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Services via Mobile Devices.</strong> From time to time, Bugsnag may provide Services that are specifically designed to be compatible and used on mobile devices. Bugsnag will collect certain information that your mobile device sends when you use such Services, like a device identifier, user settings, location information, mobile carrier, and the operating system of your device. Mobile versions of Bugsnag’s Services may require that users log in with an account. In such cases, information about use of mobile versions of the Services may be associated with accounts. In addition, Bugsnag may enable Individuals to download an application, widget, or other tool that can be used on mobile or other computing devices. Some of these tools may store information on mobile or other devices. These tools may transmit Personal Information to Bugsnag to enable Individuals to access accounts and to enable Bugsnag to track use of these tools. Some of these tools may enable users to email reports and other information from the tool. Bugsnag may use personal or non-identifiable information transmitted to Bugsnag to enhance these tools, to develop new tools, for quality improvement and as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy or in other notices Bugsnag provides. This paragraph relates to Personal Information that Bugsnag may collect in connection with a mobile application version of its Services, but is separate from, and does not relate to, Bugsnag’s collection of “Event Data” as set forth above.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Anonymous and Aggregated Information Use.</strong> Bugsnag may use Personal Information and other information about you to create anonymized and aggregated information, such as de-identified demographic information, de-identified location information, information about the computer or device from which you access Bugsnag’s Services, or other analyses we create. Anonymized and aggregated information is used for a variety of functions, including the measurement of visitors’ interest in and use of various portions or features of the Services. Anonymized or aggregated information is not Personal Information, and Bugsnag may use such information in a number of ways, including research, internal analysis, analytics, and any other legally permissible purposes. We may share this information within Bugsnag and with Third-Parties for our or their purposes in an anonymized or aggregated form that is designed to prevent anyone from identifying you.</p></li>

<h3 id="3-4-cookies-pixel-tags-web-beacons-analytics-information-and-interest-based-advertising">3.4 Cookies, Pixel Tags/Web Beacons, Analytics Information, And Interest-Based Advertising</h3>

<p>We, as well as Third-Parties that provide content, advertising, or other functionality on our Services, may use cookies, pixel tags, local storage, and other technologies (“Technologies”) to automatically collect information through the Services. We use Technologies that are essentially small data files placed on your computer, tablet, mobile phone, or other devices (referred to collectively as a “device”) that allow us to record certain pieces of information whenever you visit or interact with our Sites, Services, applications, messaging, and tools, and to recognize you across devices.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Cookies.</strong> Cookies are small text files placed in visitors’ computer browsers to store their preferences. Most browsers allow you to block and delete cookies. However, if you do that, the Site may not work properly.</li>
<li><strong>Pixel Tags/Web Beacons.</strong> A pixel tag (also known as a web beacon) is a piece of code embedded on the Site that collects information about users’ engagement on that web page. The use of a pixel allows us to record, for example, that a user has visited a particular web page or clicked on a particular advertisement.</li>
<li><strong>Analytics.</strong> We may also use certain analytics tools to collect information regarding visitor behavior and visitor demographics on some of our Services, and to develop Site content. This analytics data is not tied to any Personal Information.</li>
</ul>

<p>Our uses of such Technologies fall into the following general categories:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Operationally Necessary.</strong> We may use cookies, web beacons, or other similar technologies that are necessary to the operation of our Sites, Services, applications, and tools. This includes technologies that allow you access to our Sites, Services, applications, and tools; that are required to identify irregular Site behavior, prevent fraudulent activity and improve security; or that allow you to make use of our functions such as shopping-carts, saved search, or similar functions;</li>
<li><strong>Performance Related.</strong> We may use cookies, web beacons, or other similar technologies to assess the performance of our Sites, applications, Services, and tools, including as part of our analytic practices to help us understand how our visitors use our Sites, determine if you have interacted with our messaging, determine whether you have viewed an item or link, or to improve our Site content, applications, Services, or tools;</li>
<li><strong>Functionality Related.</strong> We may use cookies, web beacons, or other similar technologies that allow us to offer you enhanced functionality when accessing or using our Sites, Services, applications, or tools. This may include identifying you when you sign into our Sites or keeping track of your specified preferences, interests, or past items viewed so that we may enhance the presentation of content on our Sites;</li>
<li><strong>Advertising or Targeting Related.</strong> We may use first-party or Third-Party cookies and web beacons to deliver content, including ads relevant to your interests, on our Sites or on Third-Party sites. This includes using technologies to understand the usefulness to you of the advertisements and content that has been delivered to you, such as whether you have clicked on an advertisement.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you would like to opt-out of the Technologies we employ on our Sites, Services, applications, or tools, you may do so by blocking, deleting, or disabling them as your browser or device permits.</p>

<p>The Site may contain links to other websites and other websites may reference or link to our Site or other Services. These other domains and websites are not controlled by us, and Bugsnag does not endorse or make any representations about Third-Party websites or social media platforms. We encourage our users to read the privacy policies of each and every website and application with which they interact. We do not endorse, screen or approve, and are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of such other websites or applications. Visiting these other websites or applications is at your own risk.
Bugsnag’s Services may include publicly accessible blogs, community forums, or private messaging features. The Site and our other Services may also contain links and interactive features with various social media platforms (e.g., widgets). If you already use these platforms, their cookies may be set on your device when using our Site or other Services. You should be aware that Personal Information which you voluntarily include and transmit online in a publicly accessible blog, chat room, social media platform or otherwise online, or that you share in an open forum may be viewed and used by others without any restrictions.

<h3 id="3-6-third-party-payment-processing">3.6 Third-Party Payment Processing</h3>

<p>When you purchase a subscription for the Services, we process your payments through a Third-Party payment processor.

<p>We may share your information as described in this Privacy Policy (e.g., with our Third-Party service providers; to comply with legal obligations; to protect and defend our rights and property) or with your permission.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>We Use Vendors and Service Providers.</strong> We may share any information we receive with vendors and service providers. The types of service providers to whom we entrust Personal Information include service providers for: (i) provision of IT and related services; (ii) provision of information and services you have requested; (iii) payment processing; (iv) customer service activities; and (v) in connection with the provision of the Site. Bugsnag has executed appropriate contracts with the service providers that prohibit them from using or sharing Personal Information except as necessary to perform the contracted services on our behalf or to comply with applicable legal requirements.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Business Partners.</strong> Bugsnag may share Personal Information with our business partners, and affiliates for our and our affiliates’ internal business purposes or to provide you with a product or Service that you have requested. Bugsnag may also provide Personal Information to business partners with whom we may jointly offer products or services, or whose products or services we believe may be of interest to you. In such cases, our business partner’s name will appear, along with Bugsnag.

<li><p><strong>Privacy Shield.</strong> With respect to onward transfers to Agents under Privacy Shield, Privacy Shield requires that Bugsnag remain liable should its Agents Process Personal Information in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Marketing – Interest-Based Advertising and Third Party Marketing.</strong> Through our Services, Bugsnag may allow Third-Party advertising partners to set tracking tools (e.g., cookies) to collect information regarding your activities (e.g., your IP address, page(s) visited, time of day). We may also share such de-identified information as well as selected Personal Information (such as demographic information and past purchase history) we have collected with Third-Party advertising partners. These advertising partners may use this information (and similar information collected from other websites) for purposes of delivering targeted advertisements to you when you visit non-Bugsnag related websites within their networks. This practice is commonly referred to as “interest-based advertising” or “online behavioral advertising. We may allow access to other data collected by the Site to facilitate transmittal of information that may be useful, relevant, valuable or otherwise of interest to you.

<h3 id="5-5-cookies-and-interest-based-advertising">5.5 Cookies And Interest-Based Advertising</h3>

<p>As noted above, you may stop or restrict the placement of cookies on your computer or remove them from your browser by adjusting your web browser preferences. Please note that cookie-based opt-outs are not effective on mobile applications. However, on many mobile devices, application users may opt-out of certain mobile ads via their device settings.</p>

<p>The online advertising industry also provides websites from which you may opt-out of receiving targeted ads from our data partners and our other advertising partners that participate in self-regulatory programs. You can access these, and also learn more about targeted advertising and consumer choice and privacy, at www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp, or http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/ and www.aboutads.info/choices/.</p>

<p>To be clear, whether you are using our opt-out or an online industry opt-out, these cookie-based opt-outs must be performed on each device and browser that you wish to have opted-out. For example, if you have opted-out on your computer browser, that opt-out will not be effective on your mobile device. You must separately opt-out on each device. Advertisements on Third-Party websites that contain the AdChoices link and that link to this Privacy Policy may have been directed to you based on anonymous, non-Personal Information collected by advertising partners over time and across websites. These advertisements provide a mechanism to opt-out of the advertising partners’ use of this information for interest-based advertising purposes.</p>
