  <strong>5. Cookies</strong> <br><br>
  We use "cookies" to  store specific information about you and track your visits to our Site. It is  not uncommon for web sites to use cookies to enhance identification of their  users. A "cookie" is a small amount of data that is sent to your  browser and stored on your computer's hard drive. <br><br>
  A cookie can be sent to your  computer's hard drive only if you access our Site using the computer. <br><br>
  If you do not de-activate or  erase the cookie, each time you use the same computer to access our Site, our  web servers will be notified of your visit to our Site and in turn we have  knowledge of your visit and the pattern of your usage. <br><br>

  This privacy statement covers the  use of cookies by B2BFreezone.com at http://www.B2BFreezone.com only and does  not cover the use of cookies by any third parties.<br><br>
  Generally, we use cookies to  identify you and enable us to access your Registration Information, Publishing  Information or Payment Information so you do not have to re-enter it; gather  statistical information about usage by Users; research visiting patters and  help target advertisements based on User interests; assist our partners to  track User visits to the Site and process orders; and track progress and  participation in promotions. <br><br>

  The Site and its contents are not  intended to be targeted to minors under applicable law and we do not intend to  sell any of our products or services to minors. <br><br>

  Remember to sign out of your  Account and close your browser window when you have finished your session. <br><br>
  7.3 No data transmission over the  Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be perfectly secured. <br><br>
