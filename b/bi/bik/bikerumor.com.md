# Privacy Policy - Bikerumor

We take your privacy seriously. This policy describes what personal information we collect and how we use it. This privacy policy is applicable to www.bikerumor.com, triathlonrumor.com, bikerumortechshop.com and any other website owned or operated by BikeBoardMedia, Inc. (hereafter BBM).

**Routine Information Collection & Storage**

All web servers track basic information about their visitors. This information includes, but is not limited to, IP addresses, browser details, timestamps and referring pages. None of this information can personally identify specific visitors to this site. The information is tracked for routine administration and maintenance purposes, and lets me know what pages and information are useful and helpful to visitors.

This site collects a name, email address and IP address for each comment left on any post. This information is stored on our servers, and we make reasonable efforts at securing our and your information. Viewing and use of any BBM-owned website is at your own risk. BBM is not responsible for disclosure of your personal information due to accident, theft, acts of God or other mischievous or illegal behavior. We may make any or all personal information available to appropriate authorities as required by law. We also suggest you review our [Comments Policy](http://www.bikerumor.com/comments-policy).

**The Type of Information the Service Collects**

The following Privacy Policy summarizes the various ways we treat personally identifiable and other information about you and your computer, mobile or other device when you access, visit and/or use the Service. This Privacy Policy does not cover information collected elsewhere, including without limitation offline and on sites, applications, destinations, or services linked to from the Service.

The Service generally collects personally identifiable information with your specific knowledge and consent. For instance, when you enter a sweepstakes or contest, complete a survey, make a purchase, subscribe to our publication(s), register for certain services, or register and/or set up an account/profile to access, visit and/or use certain portions of the Service, or the Service as a whole, you may be provided, or required to choose, a password and/or User ID, and you may provide a credit, debit, or charge card number, or other payment information, as well as your name, telephone number(s), email and/or street address, and other personally identifiable information. Other information such as your age, gender, an avatar, and the number for your mobile or other device may also be requested. In addition, you may be asked to send us similar information via messaging (e.g., email, SMS, MMS, or other technologies). All such information shall be referred to in this Privacy Policy as your “Registration Information”.

Our servers may also automatically collect information about you, your online behavior and your computer, mobile or other device. The information collected may include, without limitation, the make, model, settings, specifications (e.g., CPU speed, connection speed, browser type, operating system, device identifier) and geographic location of you and/or your computer, mobile or other device, as well as date/time stamp, IP address, pages visited, time of visits, content viewed, ads viewed, the site(s), application(s), destination(s), and/or service(s) you arrived from, and other clickstream data.

If you choose to access, visit and/or use any third party social networking service(s) that may be integrated with the Service, we may receive personally identifiable information and other information about you and your computer, mobile or other device that you have made available to those services, including information about your contacts on those services. For example, some social networking services allow you to push content from our Service to your contacts or to pull information about your contacts so you can connect with them on or through our Service. Some social networking services also will facilitate your registration for our Service or enhance or personalize your experience on our Service. Your decision to use a social networking service in connection with our Service is voluntary. However, you should make sure you are comfortable with the information your third party social networking services may make available to our Service by visiting those services’ privacy policies and/or modifying your privacy settings directly with those services. We reserve the right to use, transfer, assign, sell, share, and provide access to all personally identifiable information and other information about you and your computer, mobile or other device that we receive through third-party social networking services in the same ways described in this Agreement as all of your other information.

**How We Use Information Provided**

We mainly rely on three separate bases to lawfully process your information. First, we need to process your information in certain ways to provide our Services to you. This processing of your information for the purposes of personalized content and ads is a necessary part of the Services we provide. Second, where you have given us consent to use your information in certain ways, we will rely on your consent. Third, as described in more detail below, in certain cases, we may process your information where necessary to further our legitimate interests, where those legitimate interests are not overridden by your rights or interests. Occasionally, we may rely on other legal bases to process your information such as to protect a user’s vital interests (such as where there is a risk of imminent harm) or to comply with a legal obligation. 

In order to deliver, personalize and improve our Services, we combine and use the information that we have about you (including information we receive on and off our Services) to understand how you use and interact with our Services and the people or things that you’re connected to and interested in. We may also use the information we have about you in the following ways and for the following purposes:

To provide, maintain, improve and develop relevant features, content and Services. 

To analyze your content and other information (including incoming and outgoing emails, instant messages, posts photos, attachments and other communications) in order to keep our Services safe and secure.This analysis also assists us in making the content, Services and ads we provide to you more personalized. You can review and control certain types of information tied to your account by contacting us.

To fulfill your requests and when authorized by you. 

To help advertisers and publishers connect to offer relevant advertising in their apps and websites.

To match and serve targeted advertising (across devices and both on and off our Services) and provide targeted advertising based on your device activity, inferred interests and location information.

To contact you with information about your account or with marketing messages, which you can also control. 

To associate your activity across our Services and your different devices as well as associate any accounts you may use across our Services together. We may associate activity and accounts under a single user ID.

To carry out or support promotions.

To conduct research and support innovation. 

To create analytics and reports for external parties, including partners, publishers, advertisers, apps, third parties and the public regarding the use of and trends within our Services and ads, including showing trends to partners regarding general preferences, the effectiveness of ads and information on user experiences. These analytics and reports may include aggregate or pseudonymised information, but do not include any information relating to an identified or identifiable user.

To provide location-based Services, advertising, search results and other content consistent with your location settings.

To combine information that we have about you with information that we obtain from business partners or other companies, such as your activities on other sites and apps in order to ensure that the ads, Services and content we provide to you are more suited to your interests.

To detect and defend against fraudulent, abusive or unlawful activity and to keep our Services safe and secure.

We provide you with controls to manage your experience with us. For example, you can review or edit your account information, manage your marketing preferences or opt out of targeted ads. While personalized ads are necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interests and are a necessary part of our agreement with you, we offer you the ability to object to certain personalized ads through your choices to opt out of certain targeted ads. If you object through this opt-out, you will continue to see ads, but they may not be as relevant or useful to you. 

**How We Share Information Provided**

BBM shares information within its affiliated brands and companies. We also share information we have about you in accordance with this Privacy Policy, including to provide Services that you have requested (including when you connect to third-party apps and widgets). We do not sell, license or share information that individually identifies our customers with companies, organizations or individuals outside of BBM unless one of the following circumstances applies:

With your consent. We will share information with companies, organisations or individuals outside of Oath when we have your consent.

For example, we may tell an advertiser how its ads performed or report how many people installed an app after seeing a promotion. We do not share information that personally identifies you (personally identifiable information includes your name or email address) with these partners, such as publishers, advertisers, measurement analytics, apps or other companies.

We allow other companies that show advertisements on our web pages or apps to collect information from your browsers or devices. Other companies’ use of cookies and other data collection technologies are subject to their own privacy policies, not this one. Like many companies, we may allow cookie matching with selected partners. However, these parties are not authorized to access BBM cookies.

**Specific Products and Services**

Information security and data retention – Oath has technical, administrative and physical safeguards in place to help protect against unauthorized access, use or disclosure of customer information that we collect or store. BBM will retain your information only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you with the Services. If you no longer want BBM to use your information to provide you with the Services, you can close your account and BBM will delete the information it holds about you unless BBM needs to retain and use your information to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes or to enforce our agreements. 

**Legitimate Interests**

BBM may use your information to provide, improve and customize our Services and the ads and content that we serve to you. This may include the sharing of your information for such purposes as is necessary to pursue our legitimate interests and your legitimate interests in receiving personalized content and services. Using and sharing your information for such purposes is also necessary to enable us to pursue our legitimate interests of understanding how our Services are being used and of developing ways to change our Services so they are more exciting and interesting for you and other users. Using your information for the reasons described in this Privacy Policy is also necessary to allow us to pursue our legitimate interests of improving our Services, obtaining insights into usage patterns of our Services, efficiency and interest of our Services for users. 

BBM may also use your information for safety and security purposes, including the sharing of your information for such purposes as is necessary to pursue our and your legitimate interests of ensuring the security of our Services, including enhancing users’ protection against harassment, IP infringement, spam, and crime and security risks of all types.

You have the right to object to any of this processing and, if you want to object, please contact us.

**Protecting Children’s Privacy**

Our Services are for a general audience. We do not knowingly collect, use or share information that could reasonably be used to identify children under the age of 16 without prior parental consent or consistent with applicable law. With parental permission, a child under the age of 16 might have a BBM family account.

**Data Processing and Transfers**

When you use or interact with any of our Services, you consent to the data processing, sharing, transferring and uses of your information as outlined in this Privacy Policy. Regardless of the country where you reside, you authorize us to transfer, process, store and use your information in countries other than your own in accordance with this Privacy Policy and to provide you with Services. Some of these countries may not have the same data protection safeguards as the country where you reside. 

BBM may process information related to individuals in the EU/EEA and may transfer that information from the EU/EEA through various compliance mechanisms, including data processing agreements based on the EU/EEA Standard Contractual Clauses. By using our Services, you consent to us transferring information about you to these countries.

BBM is part of a global service and so shares information with affiliates and other companies based outside the European Economic Area (‘EEA’) for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. 

The United States and other non-EEA countries have different laws on data protection and rules in relation to government access to information. If you are based in the EEA, when your data is moved from your home country to a third country outside the EEA, some of these countries may not have the same data protection safeguards as your home country. 

To the extent that BBM is deemed to transfer information about you outside the EEA, Oath relies separately, alternatively and independently on the following legal bases to transfer your information: 

Standard contractual clauses. The European Commission has adopted standard contractual clauses that provide safeguards for personal data that is transferred outside the EEA. We use these clauses when transferring personal data outside the EEA including to our affiliates. 

Contractual necessity. You can choose whether or not you want to use our Services. However, if you want to use our Services, you need to agree to our Terms of Service, which set out the terms of the contract between us and you. As we operate in countries worldwide (including in the United States) and use technical infrastructure in these countries, to be able to deliver our Services to you in accordance with the contract between us, we may need to transfer your information to other jurisdictions where necessary. We can’t provide you with our Services without moving your data around the world. 

Privacy Shield. Some companies to which we may transfer your information in the United States may be certified to receive your information under the Privacy Shield program.

**Additional Important Information**

This Privacy Policy applies only to BBM. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that BBM does not own or control, or to people that BBM does not employ or manage. In addition, some affiliated products may have different privacy policies and practices that are not subject to this Privacy Policy. 

**Edits**

We may amend or update this Privacy Policy from time to time, so you should check it periodically. If we make edits of a material nature, we will provide you with appropriate notice before such changes take effect. 

**Cookies and Web Beacons**

Where necessary, this site uses cookies to store information about a visitor’s preferences and history in order to better serve the visitor and/or present the visitor with customized content.

Advertising partners and other third parties may also use cookies, scripts and/or web beacons to track visitors to our site in order to display advertisements and other useful information. Such tracking is done directly by the third parties through their own servers and is subject to their own privacy policies.
