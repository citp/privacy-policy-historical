# Privacy and Security

## Privacy Policy

We at BikeExchange Pty Ltd (an Australian company, ACN 114 947 116) (also referred to as “we” or “our” or “us” or “BikeExchange” know that our users (“you,” “your,” “yourself” or “Marketplace Operator” care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. We have adopted, are bound by and will protect your personal information in accordance with the Australian Privacy Principles contained within Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (“Privacy Act”). These principles govern how we can collect, use, hold and disclose your personal information, as well as ensuring the quality and security of your personal information. A copy of the Australian Privacy Principles may be obtained from the website of The Office of the Federal Privacy Commissioner at www.privacy.gov.au. 

Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy. By visiting or using the www.bikeexchange.com.au website and domain name, features, content, mobile applications, and any other services we offer from time to time in connection with any of the foregoing (collectively, the “Site”), you agree to the practices and policies set forth in this Privacy Policy, and you acknowledge and consent to our collection, use, and sharing of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. Any external links to other websites are clearly identifiable as such, and we are not responsible for the content or the privacy policies of these other websites. Capitalised terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given to them in our Terms and Conditions. 

### I. WHAT DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVER?

This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) that we gather when you are accessing or using our Site. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to individuals that we do not employ or manage, even if you have accessed the websites or services of those companies through our Site. 

We do not knowingly collect or solicit Personal Information from anyone under the age of 18 or knowingly allow such persons to register for any service we offer. If you are under 18, please do not attempt to register any of the services we offer or send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address. No one under the age of 18 is permitted to provide any Personal Information to us including by way of any services we offer. If we learn that we have collected Personal Information from a child under the age of 18 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 18, please contact us at info@BikeExchange.com.au 

### II. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?

We gather various types of Personal Information from our users, as explained more fully below. We may use this Personal Information to, among other things, personalise and improve our services, allow our users to set up a user account and profile, contact users, fulfil your requests for certain products and services, analyse how users utilise the Site, or as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy. We may share certain types of Personal Information with third parties (as described in this Section and in Section III below). We collect the following types of information:

**A. INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE TO US**

We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us about yourself or about someone else. For example, we collect Personal Information such as your name, username, phone number, credit card and other billing information, email address and shipping address. We may also collect information you supply to us regarding your personal preferences and interests. We may anonymise your Personal Information so that you cannot be individually identified and provide that anonymised information to our partners. For example, we allow advertisers to choose the demographic information of users who will see their advertisements and you agree that we may use any of the information we have collected from you in non-personally identifiable form to allow our advertisers to select the appropriate audience for those advertisements. We might use the fact you have purchased or inquired about a certain brand of apparel, for instance, to show you advertisements for the company that sells that brand, but we will not disclose to that company your identity. If you provide information about someone else, you must ensure that you are authorised to disclose that information. You must also take reasonable steps to ensure that person consents to their information being collected and stored in accordance with this Privacy Policy. 

**B. INFORMATION COLLECTED AUTOMATICALLY**

Whenever you interact with our Site, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, “cookie” information, and the page you requested. “Cookies” are identifiers we transfer to your computer or device that allow us to recognise your browser or device and tell us how and when pages in our Site are visited and by how many people. You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or device to prevent or limit the acceptance of cookies, but doing so may prevent you from taking advantage of our Site’s best features. Our advertising partners may transmit cookies to your computer or device when you click on ads that appear on our Site. This Privacy Policy does not cover cookies delivered to you by any of our advertisers. 

When we collect usage information (such as the number and frequency of visitors to the Site and to which pages within the Site), we only use such data in aggregate form and in a manner that assures your anonymity. We may provide this aggregated usage information to our partners; our partners may use such information to understand how often and in what ways people use our Site, so that our partners, too, can endeavour to provide you with an optimal online experience. For example, we may place a cookie on your device that records what products you have viewed on our Site, and then provide that information, in a way that does not identify you, to a third party website to allow such website to show you ads for similar products that are available from us or from third parties. 

We may also deliver a file to you through the Site (known as a “web beacon”) from an advertising network with which we have contracted. Web beacons allow advertising networks to provide anonymised and aggregated auditing, research and reporting for us and for advertisers. Web beacons also enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit other websites. These beacons may, for example, log that you have viewed a certain product on our Site, and then show you an ad for similar products when you browse to another website. Because your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad network’s servers, these companies can view, edit, or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site. Many ad networks participate in the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”), a cooperative of online marketing and analytics companies committed to building consumer awareness and establishing responsible business and data management practices and standards, and such NAI members may allow you to opt-out of cookies or beacons they deliver. Again, we do not control the policies of any third parties, including advertising networks. 

We do not honour “do-not-track” signals from Internet browsers or other consumer choice mechanisms regarding the collection of behavioural tracking data. 

**C. E-MAIL AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS**

We may contact you by email or other means. For example, we may send you promotional offers on behalf of other businesses, or communicate with you about your use of the Site. Also, we may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. If you do not want to receive email or other mail from us, please indicate your preference by changing your account settings accordingly. 

### III. WE ONLY RELEASE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION IN LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES

We neither rent nor sell your Personal Information in personally identifiable form to anyone. We may de-identify your Personal Information for use and disclosure of the anonymous data. We only share your Personal Information in personally identifiable form with third parties as described below: 

**A. AFFILIATED BUSINESSES AND THIRD PARTY WEBSITES WE DO NOT CONTROL**

In certain situations, businesses or third party websites we are affiliated with may sell items or provide services to you through the Site (either alone or jointly with us). You can recognise when an affiliated business is associated with such a transaction or service, and we will share your Personal Information with that affiliated business only to the extent that we deem it related to such transaction or service. We have no control over the policies and practices of third party websites or businesses as to privacy or anything else, so if you choose to take part in any transaction or service relating to an affiliated website or business, please review the policies of all such businesses or websites. 

**B. AGENTS**

We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you. Unless we inform you otherwise, our agents do not have any right to use the Personal Information we share with them beyond what we deem necessary to assist us in performing such tasks. 

**C. OTHER USER’S PERSONAL INFORMATION**

As part of the buying and selling process, we will facilitate the sharing of Personal Information between the Seller and the Buyer involved in the transaction. As part of the buying or selling process, you may obtain another user’s email address, shipping address, payment information, and/or other information. As described in our Terms & Conditions, you have a limited licence to use this information only for transaction-related communications. We have not granted you a licence to use the information for unsolicited commercial messages or unauthorised transactions. Without express consent from that user, you must not add any user details to your email or physical mailing list or store or misuse any payment information. 

**D. USER PROFILES AND CONTENT**

Certain user profile information, including without limitation, a user’s username and the image content that such user has uploaded to the Site may be displayed to other users to facilitate user interaction within the Site or address your request for our services. Any content you upload to your public user profile, along with any Personal Information or content that you voluntarily disclose online in a manner other users can view (on discussion boards, in messages and chat areas, etc.) may become publicly available, and can be collected and used by others. Your username may also be displayed to other users if and when you post comments or upload images through the Site and other users can contact you through such comments. 

**E. BUSINESS TRANSFERS**

We may choose to transfer all or part of our business. In these types of transactions, information (which may include your Personal Information) is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Also, if all of our assets (or substantially all of our assets) are acquired, or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, Personal Information may be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party. 

**F. PROTECTING OURSELVES AND OTHERS**

We may release Personal Information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with laws; notify the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner about a data breach or report a matter for investigation; enforce or apply our conditions of use and/or other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of us, our employees, our users, or others. We may exchange information with other companies and organisations (including governmental authorities) for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

**G. WITH YOUR CONSENT**

Except as set out in this Privacy Policy, you will be notified when your Personal Information may be shared with third parties, and will be able to prevent the sharing of this information. 

### IV. IS PERSONAL INFORMATION ABOUT ME SECURE?

Your account is protected by a password for your privacy and security. You need to prevent unauthorised access to your account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password (or other sign-on protections) appropriately and limiting access to your computer or device by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.  
We endeavour to protect the privacy of your account and other Personal Information we hold in our records, but we cannot guarantee complete security. Unauthorised entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of user information at any time.  
The Site may contain links to other sites. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices on other sites. When following a link to another site you should read that site’s privacy policy. 

**A. WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION CAN I ACCESS?**

Through your account settings, you may access, and, in some cases, edit or delete the following information you’ve provided to us:  
• name and password  
• email address  
• billing information  
• user profile information and User Content, including images you have uploaded to the Site. 

The information you can view and update may change as the Site changes. If you have any questions about viewing or updating information we have on file about you, please contact us at info@BikeExchange.com.au 

### V. WHAT DATA DO WE RETAIN?

We will retain your information only for as long as is necessary or your account is active or as needed in order to provide you with services. We will also retain and use your information for as long as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.  
You may inform us of any changes or requests with regard to your personal data, and in accordance with our obligations under local data protection law, we may update or delete your personal data. 

### VI. WHAT CHOICES DO I HAVE?

You can always choose not to disclose information to us. However, please keep in mind that we may need some information to allow you to register with us or to take advantage of some or all of our features, and if you choose not to provide that information, your ability to use our Site and services may be limited.  
You may be able to add, update, or delete information. When you update information, however, we may maintain a copy of the unrevised information in our records. You may request deletion of your account by visiting your account settings. Please note that some information may remain in our private records after your deletion of such information from your account. We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your Personal Information even if you update or delete it, but we will not use that information in a manner that would identify you personally.  
If you do not wish to receive email or other mail from us, please change your account settings accordingly. Please note that if you do not want to receive legal notices from us, such as this Privacy Policy, those legal notices will still govern your use of the Site, and you are responsible for reviewing such legal notices for changes. 

### VII. CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY

We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used. If we make changes in the way we use Personal Information, we will notify you by posting an announcement on our Site or contacting you directly via email or other means. You are bound by any changes to the Privacy Policy when you use the Site after such changes have been first posted. The current Privacy Policy supersedes all prior Privacy Policies. 

### VIII. QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS

If you have any questions or concerns regarding our privacy policies, please send us a detailed message to info@BikeExchange.com.au . We will make every effort to resolve your concerns.
