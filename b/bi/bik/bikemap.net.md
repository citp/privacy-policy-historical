##### Cookies and right to object against direct mails

"Cookies" are small files that are stored on users' computers, different information can be stored within the cookies, and a cookie is primarily used to store information about a user (or the device on which the cookie is stored) or even after their visit to an online offer. Temporary cookies, or "session cookies" or "transient cookies", are cookies that are deleted after a user leaves an online service and closes his browser. For example, the content of a shopping cart in an online shop or a login status can be stored in a cookie. "Persistent" means cookies that remain stored even after the browser has been closed, e.g. the login status can be saved. If the users visits the online offering again after several days, the interests of the users can also be stored in such a cookie, which is then used for e.g. reach measurement or marketing purposes. A "third-party cookie" refers to cookies that are offered by providers other than the person who manages the online offering (otherwise, if it is only their cookies, this is called "first-party cookies").

We can use temporary and permanent cookies and clarify this in the context of our privacy policy.

If users do not want cookies stored on their computer, they will be asked to disable the option in their browser's system settings. Saved cookies can be deleted in the system settings of the browser. The exclusion of cookies can lead to functional restrictions of the online offering of Bikemap GmbH.

A general guide to object to the use of cookies for online marketing purposes can be found in a variety of services, especially in the case of tracking, as explained on the US website <http://optout.aboutads.info/> or the EU site <https://www.youronlinechoices.com/>. Furthermore, the storage of cookies can be suspended by switching them off in the settings of the browser.

Please note that it may not be possible to use all functions of the online offering by Bikemap GmbH, if cookies are turned off partially or completely. 

##### Deletion of data

The data processed by us is deleted or limited in their processing in accordance with Articles 17 and 18 GDPR. Unless explicitly stated in this privacy policy, the data stored by us is deleted as soon as it is no longer required for its respective purpose and the deletion does not conflict with any statutory storage requirements.

If the data must not be deleted out of other and legitimate purposes and / or legal requirements, processing of the data will be restricted as much as possible, i.e. the data will be locked and will not be processed for other purposes. This applies, for example, for data that must be kept for reasons regarding commercial or tax law.

According to legal regulations in Austria the storage duration is 7 years according to § 132 exp. 1 BAO (accounting documents, vouchers / bills, accounts, documents, business papers, statement of income and expenses, etc.), for 22 years in connection with real estate and for 10 years in the case of documents relating to electronically supplied services, telecommunications, broadcasting and television services provided to non-entrepreneurs in EU Member States and for which the Mini-One-Stop-Shop (MOSS) is used. 

##### Business-related processing

In addition we process

  * Contract data (e.g. subject, term, customer category),
  * Payment data (e.g. payment history),



from our customers, prospects and business partners for the purpose of providing contractual services, service and customer care, marketing, advertising and market research.

##### External payment service Stripe

As part of the fulfillment of contracts, we set the payment service provider on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b. DSGVO. Incidentally, we set the external payment service provider on the basis of our legitimate interests according to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b. DSGVO in order to offer our users effective and secure payment options.

Amongst the data processed by the payment service provider are inventory data, e.g. the name and the address, bank data, such as account numbers or credit card numbers, passwords, TANs and checksums, as well as contract, summary and recipient-related information. The information is required to complete the transactions. However, the data entered will only be processed and stored by the payment service provider. That means we do not receive any account or credit card information, but only information with regards to payment success. The data may be transmitted by the payment service provider to credit reporting agencies. This transmission serves purposes of identification of credit worthiness. For this we refer to the terms and conditions and privacy policy of the payment service provider.

For the payment transactions, the terms and conditions and the privacy notices of the payment services, which are available within the respective website or transaction application apply. We also refer to these for further information and assertion of rights of withdrawal, information and other data subjects.

As part of the use of our online services, we store the IP address and the time of each user action. The storage is based on our legitimate interests, as well as the user's protection against misuse and other unauthorized use. A transfer of this data to third parties does not take place, unless it is necessary for the prosecution of our claims or there is a legal obligation in accordance with. Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c DSGVO.

We process usage data (e.g. the visited web pages of our online offering, interest in our products) and content data (e.g. entries in the contact form or user profile) for advertising purposes in a user profile to inform the user - e.g. displaying product instructions based on their previously used services.

The deletion of the data takes place after expiration of legal warranty and comparable obligations, all while the necessity of the storage of the data is checked every three years; in the case of legal archiving obligations, the deletion takes place after its expiration.

The processing affects customers, prospects, business partners and website visitors. The purpose and interest in processing lies in administration, financial accounting, office organization, data archiving.

##### Newsletter

With the following information we inform you about the contents of our newsletter as well as the registration, dispatch and statistical evaluation procedures and clarify your rights of objection.  
By subscribing to our newsletter, you agree to the receipt and the procedures described.  
Content of the newsletter: We send you newsletters, emails and other electronic notifications with advertising information (hereinafter "newsletter") only with the consent of the recipient or a legal permission. Where in the context of a newsletter registration where the contents that are described concretely apply, in general our newsletter contains information on our online offering and the Bikemap GmbH in general.

Double opt-in and logging: Registration for our newsletter is done in a so-called double-opt-in procedure. That after registration, you will receive an email asking you to confirm your registration. This confirmation is necessary so that nobody can register with external e-mail addresses. The registration for the newsletter will be logged in order to prove the registration process according to the legal requirements. This includes the storage of the login and the confirmation time, as well as the IP address. Likewise, changes to your data stored with the shipping service provider will be logged.

Credentials: To subscribe to the newsletter, it is sufficient to provide your email address.

The dispatch of the newsletter and the related performance measurement is based on the consent of the recipient according to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a, Art. 7 DSGVO i.V.m. § 107 Abs. 2 TKG or on the basis of the legal permission acc. Section 107 (2) and the like 3 TKG.

The logging of the registration process is based on our legitimate interests in accordance with. Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO.

The processing of this data is limited to the purpose of a possible defense against claims. An individual request for cancellation is possible at any time, provided that at the same time the former existence of a consent is confirmed. 

##### Newsletter - Mailjet

The newsletter is sent by Mailjet SAS, 13-13 bis, rue de l'Aubrac, 75012 Paris, France. The privacy policy of the shipping service provider can be viewed here: https://www.mailjet.de/privacy-policy/. The shipping service provider is based on our legitimate interests acc. Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO and a contract processing agreement acc. Art. 28 (3) sentence 1 DSGVO.

The shipping service provider may use the data of the recipients in pseudonymous form, i.e. without reference to a user, to optimize or improve their own services, e.g. for the technical optimization of shipping and the presentation of newsletters or for statistical purposes. However, the shipping service provider does not use the data of our newsletter recipients to address them themselves or to pass the data on to third parties.

##### Newsletter - Success Measurement

The newsletters contain a so-called "web-beacon", i.e. a pixel-sized file that is retrieved from the server when the newsletter is opened by our server or, if we use a shipping service provider, in the course of this retrieval information about the browser and your system, as well as your IP address and time of retrieval.

This information is used to improve the technical performance of services based on their specifications or audience and their reading habits, based on their locations (which can be determined using the IP address) or access times. Statistical surveys also include determining if the newsletters will be opened, when they will be opened and which links will be clicked. For technical reasons, this information can be assigned to the individual newsletter recipients. However, it is neither our goal nor, if used, that of the shipping service provider to observe individual users. The evaluations serve us much more to recognize the reading habits of our users and to adapt our content to them or to send different content according to the interests of our users. 

##### Google Analytics

Based on our legitimate interests (i.e. interest in the analysis, optimization and economic operation of our online offer within the meaning of Art. 6 (1) lit. DSGVO), we use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google LLC ("Google"). Google uses cookies. The information generated by the cookie about users' use of the online offer is usually transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States.

Google is certified under the Privacy Shield Agreement, which provides a guarantee to comply with European privacy legislation ([https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&status=Active](https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&status=Active)).

Google will use this information on our behalf to evaluate the use of our online offering by users, to compile reports on the activities within this online offer and to provide us with further services related to the use of this online offer and the internet usage. In this case, pseudonymous usage profiles of the users can be created from the processed data.

We only use Google Analytics with activated IP anonymization. This means that the IP address of the users will be shortened by Google within member states of the European Union or in other contracting states of the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be sent to a Google server in the US and shortened there.

The IP address submitted by the user's browser will not be merged with other data provided by Google. Users can prevent the storage of cookies by setting their browser software accordingly. Users may also prevent Google‘s collection of the data generated by the cookie itself and data generated related to the use of the online offering and the processing of such data by Google by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available at the following link: <http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en>.

For more information about Google's data usage, settings and disparaging options, please read Google's Privacy Policy (<https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads>) and Google's Ads Settings (<https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated>). 

##### Integration of services and contents of third parties

Based on our legitimate interests (i.e. interest in the analysis, optimization and economic operation of our online offering within the meaning of Art. 6 (1) lit. DSGVO), we make use of content or services offered by third-party providers in order to provide their content and services, such as including videos or fonts (collectively referred to as "content").

This always presupposes that the third-party providers of this content perceive the IP address of the users, since they could not send the content to their browser without the IP address. The IP address is therefore required for the presentation of this content. We endeavor to use only content whose respective providers use the IP address solely for the delivery of the content. Third parties may also use so-called pixel tags (invisible graphics, also referred to as "web beacons") for statistical or marketing purposes. The "pixel tags" can be used to evaluate information such as visitor traffic on the pages of this website. The pseudonymous information may also be stored in cookies on the user's device and may include, but is not limited to, technical information about the browser and operating system, referring web pages, visit time, and other information regarding the use of our online offering. 

##### Google ReCaptcha

We use the function to detect bots, e.g. when entering into online forms ("ReCaptcha") of the provider Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA. Privacy Policy: <https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/>  


##### Maptoolkit

We include the maps of the service "Maptoolkit" of Toursprung GmbH ([https://www.toursprung.com](https://www.toursprung.com/)). To the best of our knowledge, Maptoolkit's data is used solely for the purpose of displaying the map features and caching the selected settings. This data may include, but is not limited to, users' IP addresses and location data, but they are not collected without their consent (usually as part of their mobile device settings). The data can be processed in the USA. For more information, see the Maptoolkit Privacy Policy: <https://www.toursprung.com/privacy>.

##### Updates to the Privacy Policy

Users of the online offering of Bikemap GmbH are required to regularly inform themselves about the content of the privacy policy. As soon as the changes in the data processing carried out as part of the online offering make it necessary, the privacy policy will be adjusted accordingly.
