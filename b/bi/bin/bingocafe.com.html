                            agents and suppliers in order to provide the Service 
                            and provide you with promotional offers and with information 
                            regarding the Company and the Service. From time-to-time, 
                            we may request information from you via surveys or 
                            contests. Participation in these surveys or contests 
                            is voluntary, and, therefore, you have the choice 
                            of whether or not to disclose such information. Information 
                            requested may include contact information (such as 
                            name, correspondence address and telephone number), 
                            and demographic information (such as zip or postal 
                            code or age). If you choose to participate in a survey 
                            or contest and win, then by accepting any contest 
                            prize or winnings from us, you consent to use of your 
                            name and likeness for advertising and promotional 
                            purposes without additional compensation, except where 
                            prohibited by law. Unless you have elected not to 
                            receive promotional information, we may also use your 
                            Personal Information (including your email address 
                            and phone number) to provide you with information 
                            regarding any similar products, services and promotions. 
                            We will not sell, lease or share your Personal Information 
                            except as set forth in this Privacy Policy. </p>

                            to do so by law, or if we believe in good faith that 
                            such action is necessary to: (1) comply with any legal 
                            process served on us, the Website or the Service; 
                            (2) protect and defend our rights or property; or 
                            (3) act to protect the personal safety of users of 
                            the Service or the public. If, in our sole determination, 
                            you are found to have cheated or attempted to defraud 
                            the Company or any other user of the Service in any

                            any other fraudulent activity (including any chargeback

                            (including money laundering), we reserve the right 
                            to share this information (together with your identity)
