<p>Bin Weevils Limited ("Bin Weevils") - is the place in cyberspace where kids can play games, enter competitions, win prizes,  watch favourite cartoons and chat to friends through moderated and filtered chat. Upgrade to a Bin Tycoon membership and gain access to even more features; players can open up their own business, including photo studios and party rooms, and write their very own magazine! Players can also plant and care for a garden and adopt a Bin Pet.<br>
  <br>

Bin Weevils believes in the power of kids and we encourage both them and their parents to use and enjoy our site. Whilst we embrace the interactive nature of online media, we strive to educate parents and kids about how to appropriately safeguard their privacy when travelling on the web. Our information collection practices are described below. We urge kids to check with their parents before entering any information on any website and we urge parents to discuss with their kids restrictions regarding the online release of personal information to anyone they don't know. This privacy policy covers the site BinWeevils.com.<br>
<br>
If you have questions or complaints regarding our privacy policy or practices, please contact us at <strong><a href="mailto:privacy@binweevils.com">privacy@binweevils.com</a></strong>.


<br><br>
<strong>What Information Is Collected?</strong><br>
At Bin Weevils Limited, it is our policy to create website content which requires minimum collection of information from our visitors. Generally, Bin Weevils limits collection of information to what is known as non-personally identifiable information (e.g. first name, age, gender, city or town). This information is collected so kids can participate in activities without giving out unnecessary personal information. Where we need extra information, e.g. kids'/parents' email addresses/telephone numbers (as explained below) to run competitions, allow the use of the 'Invite A Friend' feature, or to offer extra on-line activities, we let parents know the reason why we are collecting the information and what we will do with it. </p>
<p>We will not sell personally identifiable information about you or your child to third parties.We will only share yours or your child's personally identifiable information with third parties for reasons disclosed within this privacy policy.<br>
  <br>
  The data controller for the purposes of UK data protection legislation is Bin Weevils Limited ("we" or "us" or "our"). The ways we collect users' ("you" or "your" or "user") personal information and how we use it on the site are as follows:<br>
  <br>

  <strong>1. Registration</strong><br>
  The main way we collect personally identifiable information is through   our registration process. Here we ask kids to submit their username and   password only.  If the player wishes to receive further information such as newsletters then the Bin Weevils account needs to be activated. The activation process collects a parental email address, child's gender and age. An activation email is sent to the parental email address provided. If the parent activates the Bin Weevils account, only then will the information be used for newsletter purposes. Registered kids' parents can unsubscribe from the newsletter service at any time. To unsubscribe, please contact us using the  <a href="http://www.binweevils.com/contact_us.php"><strong>Contact Us form</strong></a> on the website or by clicking on the unsubscribe link located at the bottom of each communication.<br>
  <br>
  All such personal information collected during the registration process is used only for the purpose of providing kids with access to our registered member activities. It is not currently our policy to use such information for general marketing purposes or to share such information with third parties (except in relation to competitions as set out below or where we are required to do so by law or in the context of a business transfer). Should our policy on this change, we will let you know and give you the choice to be included. <br>
  <br>
We do not obtain or require disclosure of sensitive personal data (such as ethnic origin or religion) but if you choose to provide us with such sensitive personal data, we may assume such sensitive personal data is provided with your express consent for processing by us for the purposes for which such personal data was provided by you unless otherwise notified by you to us in writing using the contact us  form on this website.</p>
<p><br>
  If you use the Contact Us form to inquire about an issue, we will collect your Bin Weevils username, an email address, your message and age. If you are under age 13 we collect the email address for the sole purpose of responding directly on a one-time basis to a specific inquiry. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>2. Orders</strong><br>
  If you purchase a product or service from Bin Weevils online, we request certain personally identifiable information from you on your order form. You must provide contact information (such as name, email address, and billing address) and financial information (such as credit card information and expiration date). If you are not the card holder   please ask permission from the card holder before making a purchase. <br>
  <br>
  
  <strong>3. Agents and Service Providers</strong><br>
  We use other third parties such as a shipping company to fulfill orders, and a credit card processing company to bill you for goods and services. We use email and the telephone customer service to assist you if you have questions while using our site or regarding your order. These third parties are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for promotional purposes.<br>
  <br>
  
  <strong>4. Competitions</strong><br>
  We offer the opportunity for all kids to enter competitions online. In order to run competitions and send out prizes, it is necessary to collect some personally identifiable information from kids. This can include name and their parent's email address. If your child wins the competition we will email the parent and ask for the address and phone number where the parent and child may be reached. As a matter of policy, we keep such information only for the purposes of administering the competition and do not disclose such information to third parties except where necessary to fulfil the prizes (e.g. it may be shared with fulfilment houses for processing purposes). We may from time to time offer competitions sponsored by third party businesses and may share entrant information with such businesses in order to fulfil the competition only. We will provide potential entrants with the opportunity to opt-in to such third party sponsored competitions. Once a competition is finished, we will delete any personal information collected via online entry forms from our systems and it is not kept for any longer than is necessary. <br>
  <br>

  <strong>5. Surveys</strong><br>
  We may offer kids the opportunity to complete surveys, on behalf of suitable third parties. No additional personally identifiable information will be requested and no personally identifiable information will be disclosed to third parties. Survey responses will be aggregated before use and individual responses will not be stored for any longer than is necessary. <br>
  <br>
  
  <strong>6. Electronic Cards and Invite A Friend Feature</strong><br>
  We may give kids the option to send "electronic card" to their friends. We do not collect our visitors' full names, but we do collect email addresses during this process in order to inform the user that their e-card has been read. We also ask users to submit their friends' email addresses so we can send them these e-cards. This information will only be used to send your friend this one-time email and will not be stored or shared with any third parties for their own marketing purposes.<br>
  <br>
  In order to use our Invite A Friend feature, you must provide us with your friend's email address and your first name.  We use this information to send your friend a one-time invitation to visit the site.  We store the information to keep track of the success of our referral program.  If your friend wishes to have us remove their information from our database, they may contact us at <strong><a href="mailto:privacy@binweevils.com">privacy@binweevils.com</a></strong> to do so.<br>
  <br>
  
  <strong>7. Feedback</strong><br>
  We provide kids with the opportunity to email us with their opinions and comments. In these circumstances, we ask for a Bin Weevils username, email address and age. This information is used solely by us in order to give requested feedback. If you are under age 13 your email address is collected for the sole purpose of responding directly on a one-time basis to a specific inquiry. This means that once the inquiry has been resolved we will not contact you again on the email address that was provided. 
<br>All email correspondence is retained for customer service records. If you wish to have your child's email address and email correspondence records removed then please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@binweevils.com">privacy@binweevils.com</a>. For more information please refer to point 15. Access to Information. <br>
  <br>
  
  <strong>8. Cookies, Log Data and Web Beacons</strong><br>
  Cookies are information files that your web browser places on the hard drive of your computer when you visit certain websites. We are able to access only the cookies that our site places on your computer and we are only able to determine the type of computer operating system and browser that you are using. Cookies cannot damage user files, nor can they read information from a user's hard drive. Cookies allow websites to "remember" users' activities on a website as well as users' visits to a website. At BinWeevils.com, cookies are used to determine the number of unique visitors to our site over a given period. We do not store any personal information in the cookies nor do we link or combine information collected through cookies to any personal information submitted by users when participating in our activities. We collect this information in order to improve access to our content based on our visitors' browsers and operating system types to make our content available to as many kids as possible. You can, of course, disable cookies on your computer by indicating this in the preferences or options menus in your browser.<br>
  <br>
Log data collected on web servers within our control also supplies us with non-personally identifiable information about the number of visits to different pages on our site. We use this information only for improving our site. We do not link the "log data" collected to personally identifiable information submitted by users when participating in our activities. The information collected through cookies and log data may be passed to our Research Department or to third party advertisers or business partners.<br>
<br>
We employ or our third party advertising partner employs  a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective.  Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information. <br>
  <br>
  
  <strong>9. Transfer of Personal Data</strong><br>
  We may also transfer your personal data collected to any country, including countries outside the European Economic Area, for any of the purposes described above. Your provision of personal data to us through use of this site is understood by us to constitute consent to such transfer unless you inform us of your wish not to transfer your personal data in this manner by contacting us using the form in the Contact Us section of this website.<br>
  <br>
  
  <strong>10. Monitoring of Communications</strong><br>
  We may record or monitor your telephone conversations and email correspondence with our staff for security, compliance with the law, training purposes and to maintain and improve the quality of our services.<br>
  <br>
  
  <strong>11. Security</strong><br>
  We have taken steps to ensure that all personally identifiable information that we collect is secure, including limiting the number of people who have physical access to our database servers as well as electronic security systems and password protections, which guard against unauthorised access. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). <br>
  <br>
  
  <strong>12. Agents/ Legal Disclaimer</strong><br>
  The personally identifiable information provided to BinWeevils.com may be transferred, disclosed or shared with third parties who may be engaged by us as data processors to specifically  handle and deliver certain activities (e.g. message boards, competitions, e-cards, newsletters, advisory board, communities) and perform other technical and processing functions, such as sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from registration lists, programming, providing services to our users, or otherwise operating our site. They have access to personal information needed to perform their processing functions, but may not use it for other purposes.<br>
  <br>
  We may also disclose your personal information as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.<br>
  <br>
  
  <strong>13. Third Party Websites</strong><br>
  We provide a "bumper page" when linking from our website to an advertiser's site, which lets kids know they are going to an advertiser's site and reminds them not to give out information online without getting permission from their parents. Kids and their parents should be aware that other sites have different policies on collection of information to us, so it is important to check their Privacy Policies before submitting any personally identifiable information. <br>
  <br>
  
  <strong>14. Business Transfers</strong><br>
  In the event that all or substantially all of our assets are transferred or sold to another business, you agree that we may transfer any of your personally identifiable information to the acquiring business.<br>
  <br>
</p>
<p><strong>15. Access to Information</strong><br>
If yours/your child's personal information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct, update,  delete inaccuracies, amend, remove or deactivate your account by emailing us at <strong><a href="mailto:privacy@binweevils.com">privacy@binweevils.com</a></strong>. The deletion of data may lead to a termination of the Bin Weevils account and/or membership.<br>
<br>
Parents have a right to have their child's personally identifiable information deleted or refuse further collection and use of that personally identifiable information collected from their child by contacting us at the email address listed above.
  We will retain yours/your child's information for as long as yours/your child's account is active or as needed to provide services. If you wish to cancel yours/your child's account or request that we no longer use the information to provide you services, contact us at the email address listed above.
