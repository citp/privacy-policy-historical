("<strong>Bitstrips</strong>", "we", "us" and/or "our"). This Site is operated by Bitstrips and has been created to provide information about our company and our platform for building and sharing avatars, comic strips and other graphics, and our related mobile applications and services (together with the Site, the "<strong>Services</strong>") to our Services visitors ("you", "your"). This Privacy Policy sets forth Bitstrips’ policy with respect to information including personally identifiable data ("<strong>Personal Data</strong>") and other information that is collected from visitors to the Site and Services.</p><p><strong><u>Information We Collect:</u></strong><br>When you interact with us through the Services, we may collect Personal Data and other information from you, as further described below:</p><p class="indent"><strong>Personal Data That You Provide Through the Services:</strong> We collect Personal Data from you when you voluntarily provide such information, such as when you contact us with inquiries, respond to one of our surveys, register for access to the Services or use certain Services. Wherever Bitstrips collects Personal Data we make an effort to provide a link to this Privacy Policy.</p><p><strong>By voluntarily providing us with Personal Data, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data to the Services, you acknowledge and agree that such Personal Data may be transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of Bitstrips and the authorized third parties referred to herein located in the United States and Canada.</strong></p><p class="indent"><strong>Other Information:</strong></p><p class="indent alt"><strong>Non-Identifiable Data:</strong> When you interact with Bitstrips through the Services, we receive and store certain personally non-identifiable information. Such information, which is collected passively using various technologies, cannot presently be used to specifically identify you. Bitstrips may store such information itself or such information may be included in databases owned and maintained by Bitstrips affiliates, agents or service providers. The Services may use such information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, and the domain names of our visitors’ Internet service providers. It is important to note that no Personal Data is available or used in this process.</p><p class="indent">In operating the Services, we may use a technology called "cookies." A cookie is a piece of information that the computer that hosts our Services gives to your browser when you access the Services. Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the Services and help us analyze Services usage more accurately. For instance, our Site may set a cookie on your browser that allows you to access the Services without needing to remember and then enter a password more than once during a visit to the Site. In all cases in which we use cookies, we will not collect Personal Data except with your permission. On most web browsers, you will find a "help" section on the toolbar. Please refer to this section for information on how to receive notification when you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off. We recommend that you leave cookies turned on because they allow you to take advantage of some of the Services’ features. While, as described above, you may have the opportunity to control the use of cookies through your web browser, we do not currently respond to web browser "Do Not Track" signals or other similar mechanisms. If we do so in the future, we will describe how we do so in this Privacy Policy. For more information about Do Not Track, please visit <a href="http://www.allaboutdnt.org">www.allaboutdnt.org</a>.</p><p class="indent alt"><strong>Aggregated Personal Data:</strong> In an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of the Services, Bitstrips often conducts research on its customer demographics, interests and behavior based on the Personal Data and other information provided to us. This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis, and Bitstrips may share this aggregate data with its affiliates, agents and business partners. This aggregate information does not identify you personally. Bitstrips may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.</p><p class="indent3"><strong>Third-Party Analytics Providers:</strong> Bitstrips uses third party analytics providers ("TPAPs"), such as Google Analytics, to enhance the user experience when you use the Services. No Personal Data will be passed along to TPAPs through your use of the Services; however, you acknowledge that some of the data we collect through TPAPs could be connected to other user data you provide in a way that would make the combination of that data Personal Data. Any Personal Data resulting from data gathered through TPAPs will be treated as such, in accordance with this Privacy Policy. By using the Services, you acknowledge and consent to the collection of data (including data that could be combined with other data available through the Services to result in Personal Data) through TPAPs, as used in providing you the Services.</p><p>We have implemented Google Analytics features based on Display Advertising (including Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting). You can opt out of tracking by Google Analytics by using Google’s Ads Settings or going to <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/</a>.</p><p><strong><u>Our Use of Your Personal Data and Other Information:</u></strong><br>Bitstrips uses the Personal Data you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data for a certain reason, we may use the Personal Data in connection with the reason for which it was provided. Also, if you provide Personal Data in order to obtain access to the Services, we will use your Personal Data to provide you with access to such services and to monitor your use of such services. Bitstrips and its subsidiaries and affiliates (the "Related Companies") may also use your Personal Data and other personally non-identifiable information collected through the Services to help us improve the content and functionality of the Services, to better understand our users and to improve the Services. Bitstrips and its affiliates may use this information to contact you in the future to tell you about services we believe will be of interest to you. If we do so, each marketing communication we send you will contain instructions permitting you to "opt-out" of receiving future marketing communications. In addition, if at any time you wish not to receive any future marketing communications or you wish to have your name deleted from our mailing lists, please contact us as indicated below.</p><p>If Bitstrips intends on using any Personal Data in any manner that is not consistent with this Privacy Policy, you will be informed of such anticipated use prior to or at the time at which the Personal Data is collected.</p><p><strong><u>Our Disclosure of Your Personal Data and Other Information:</u></strong><br>Bitstrips is not in the business of selling your information.

When we employ another entity to perform a function of this nature, we only provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific function.</p><p class="indent"><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> Bitstrips may disclose your Personal Data if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation, (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of Bitstrips, (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Services or the public, or (iv) protect against legal liability.</p><p><strong><u>Your Choices:</u></strong><br>You can visit the Site without providing any Personal Data.

We suggest contacting those sites directly for information on their privacy policies.</p><p><strong><u>Integrating Third-Party Services:</u></strong><br>One of the special features of the Services is that they allow you to enable or log in to the Services via various third-party services, such as social networking services like Facebook or Twitter ("Third Party Service(s)"). By directly integrating these services, we make your online experiences richer and more personalized. To take advantage of this feature, we will ask you to log into or grant us permission via the relevant Third Party Service. When you add a Third Party Services account to the Services or log into the Services using your Third Party Services account, we will collect relevant information necessary to enable the Services to access that Third Party Service and your data contained within that Third Party Service. As part of such integration, the Third Party Service will provide us with access to certain information that you have provided to the Third Party Service, and we will use, store and disclose such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. However, please remember that the manner in which Third Party Services use, store and disclose your information is governed by the policies of such third parties, and Bitstrips shall have no liability or responsibility for the privacy practices or other actions of any Third Party Services that may be enabled within the Services.</p><p>You may also have the option of posting your Services activities to Third Party Services when you access content through the Services (for example, you may post to Facebook that you performed an activity on the Service); you acknowledge that if you choose to use this feature, your friends, followers and subscribers on any Third Party Services you have enabled will be able to view such activity.</p><p><strong><u>Security:</u></strong><br>Bitstrips takes reasonable steps to protect the Personal Data provided via the Services from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.
