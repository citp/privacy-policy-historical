This policy describes the ways BitPay, Inc. and its subsidiaries (hereinafter, “BitPay”, “we”, “our” or “us”) collect, store, use and protect Personal Data. The purpose of this policy is to ensure that BitPay complies with applicable United States (US) federal and state regulations, and European Union (hereinafter, “EU”) data protection laws such as the General Data Protection Regulation (hereinafter, “GDPR”). BitPay’s Services include merchant processing services, products, or any other features, technologies or functionalities (hereinafter: “Services”) offered by BitPay, Inc. Users accept this Policy by visiting our website and/or by using our Services.

There are six types of data subjects whose personal data we may process:

  1. Visitors of our websites (bitpay.com, bitcore.io, copay.io);
  2. Merchants that sign up for our Services;
  3. Shoppers who indirectly interface with BitPay when paying a merchant’s invoice that is forwarded by BitPay to merchants during checkout (refer to Section III.3 for more details);

## What is “personally identifiable information?”

“Personally Identifiable Information” (hereinafter: “Personal Data”) is any information that can be directly associated with a specific person and can be used to identify that person. A prime example of identifiable information is a person’s name.

## What kind of personal data do we collect?

The Personal Data we collect depends on the type of user:

  1.  **Visitors** : We may collect the following Personal Data for visitors of our websites (https://www.bitpay.com, https://www.bitcore.io, https://www.copay.io):
    * IP address
    * Email address (e.g. when you subscribe to our blog or opt in to receive other marketing materials)
    * Phone number (e.g. when you contact our sales team or media team or opt in to our media list)
    * Name (e.g. when you submit a support request)

We may collect information about a visitor’s computer or other access devices for fraud prevention purposes.

  2.  **Merchants** : When opening an account, we may collect the following types of Personal Data of the beneficial owner or any user that is added to the account:
    * Name
    * Email address
    * Date of birth
    * Identification documents (such as a passport or driver’s license)

We may use this Personal Data for risk-management purposes (i.e. to verify merchant’s identity or address). We may also obtain information about our merchants from third parties such as credit bureaus and identity verification services. We ensure that such third parties adhere to the same data protection principles as BitPay.

  3.  **Shoppers of merchants** : When a shopper is paying a BitPay invoice, the following Personal Data is captured:
    * Email address
    * IP addresses used to view the BitPay invoice

The email address is either automatically provided by the merchant or manually entered by the shopper. This enables our system to send an email to Shoppers directly to obtain a cryptocurrency refund address in case of a payment exception (e.g. overpayments, underpayments, etc.). This creates a more seamless payment experience for both the merchant and the shopper.

Additionally, only upon the merchant’s explicit request, we will collect and store Personal Data for the merchant’s benefit only and as a service through our invoicing service. Personal Data that merchants may request from the shoppers are:

    * Name
    * Address
    * Phone number

Additionally, for donations that are made through BitPay’s processing platform, the merchant might opt for BitPay to collect the following Personal Data as required by the US Federal Election Commission (FEC) or other applicable local regulations:

    * Donor’s name
    * Donor’s email address
    * Donor’s address
    * Donor’s phone number
    * Donor’s employer
    * Donor’s job title
    * Donor’s city of employment

In all cases mentioned above, Shoppers’ or Donors' information is processed and stored according to the same principles as we process / store our merchant’s Personal Data.

  4.  **Cardholders** : When a user signs up for a BitPay Visa® Prepaid Card, the following information is collected as part of the onboarding program:
    * Name
    * Address
    * Date of birth
    * IP address
    * Phone number
    * Email address

  5.  **Wallet holders** : For wallet holders, BitPay collects the following Personal Data:
    * Email address

The email address collection is optional in case the user would like to receive email notifications and (if selected) BitPay news and product updates and can be removed at any point in time.

  6.  **Shoppers that use BitPay’s cryptocurrency withdrawal service** : The following Personal Data is collected for shoppers that would like to process more than 3000 USD per day:
    * Name

    * Identification documents (such as a passport or a driver’s license)
