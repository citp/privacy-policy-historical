# Privacy Policy | BitPay

## Scope and Consent

This policy describes the ways BitPay, Inc. and its subsidiaries (hereinafter, “BitPay”, “we”, “our” or “us”) collect, store, use and protect personal information. The purpose of this policy is to ensure that BitPay complies with applicable United States (US) federal and state regulations, and European Union (EU) data protection laws, and ensures that users are provided privacy protection. BitPay’s Services include merchant processing services, products, or any other features, technologies or functionalities (hereinafter: “Services”) offered by BitPay, Inc.

There are three types of users whose personal information we may process:

  1. Visitors of our website;
  2. Merchants that sign up for our Services;
  3. Shoppers who indirectly interface with BitPay when paying a merchant’s invoice that is forwarded by BitPay to merchants during checkout (refer to Section III.3 for more details).



Users accept this Policy by visiting our website and/or by using our Services.

## What is “personally identifiable information?”

“Personally identifiable information” (hereinafter: “personal information”) is any information that can be directly associated with a specific person and can be used to identify that person. A prime example of identifiable information is a person’s name. 

## What kind of information do we collect?

The information we collect depends on the type of user:

  1.  **Visitors** : we may collect standard web log information, such as:
    * IP address
    * Browser type 
    * Pages accessed on our website
    * Date and time the website was accessed

We may collect information about a visitor’s computer or other access devices for fraud prevention purposes.

  2.  **Merchants** : when opening an account, we may collect the following types of personal information, depending on how you use our Services:
    * Name
    * Address
    * Phone
    * E-mail address
    * Bank account number
    * VAT/EIN-number
    * Identification documents (which could contain photo, social security number and/or date of birth).

We may use this information for risk-management purposes (i.e. to verify merchant’s identity or address). We may also obtain information about our merchants from third parties such as credit bureaus and identity verification services. We ensure that such third parties adhere to the same data protection principles as BitPay.

  3.  **Shoppers of merchants** : when a Shopper wants to pay an invoice created by a BitPay merchant, the Shopper will be requested to fill in the following:
    * Email address

This information is requested since it will enable our system to send an email to Shoppers directly to obtain a bitcoin refund address in case of a payment exception (e.g. overpayments, underpayments, etc.). This creates a more seamless payment experience for both our Merchants and their Shoppers. 

Additionally, only upon the merchant’s explicit request, we will collect and store personal information for the merchant’s benefit only and as a service through our invoicing service. Information that merchants may request from the shoppers may include: 

    * Name
    * Address
    * Phone
    * Email address

In both cases mentioned above, Shoppers’ information is processed and stored according to the same principles we store our merchant’s personal information.




BitPay does not process any sensitive personal information, such as religion, race, ethnicity and/or political views. 

## Why we collect personal information

Our primary purpose for collecting personal information is to provide you with a secure, smooth, efficient, and customized experience. We may use your personal information to:

  * provide the BitPay Services and customer support you request;
  * process transactions and send notices about your transactions;
  * resolve disputes, collect fees, and troubleshoot problems;
  * prevent potentially prohibited or illegal activities, and enforce our Terms of Use;
  * customize, measure, and improve the BitPay Services and the content and layout of our website and applications; 
  * deliver targeted marketing, service update notices, and promotional offers based on your communication preferences;
  * compare information for accuracy and verify it with third parties.



## How we protect and store personal information

We store and process your personal information on our computers in the United States and elsewhere in the world where BitPay facilities are located, and we protect it by maintaining physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in compliance with applicable US federal and state regulations, and EU data protection laws. 

We use computer safeguards such as firewalls and data encryption, we enforce physical access controls to our buildings and files, and we authorize access to personal information only for those employees who require it to fulfill their job responsibilities.

## How we share personal information with third parties

We may share your personal information with:

  * other BitPay entities, in order to help detect and prevent potentially illegal acts and violations of our policies, and to guide decisions about our products, services and communications;
  * service providers under contract who help with our business operations by verifying merchant information;
  * law enforcement, government officials, or other third parties pursuant to a subpoena, court order, or other legal process or requirement applicable to BitPay; or when we believe, in our sole discretion, that the disclosure of personal information is necessary to report suspected illegal activity or to investigate violations of our Terms of Use.



Please note that these third parties may be in other countries where the laws on processing personal information may be less stringent than in your country.

## How can merchants access or change their personal information?

Merchants can review and edit their name, phone number, and email address at any time by logging in to their account and reviewing their personal information in the Settings area of their Dashboard.

## How we use cookies

### What are cookies?

A cookie is a small piece of data that a website asks your browser to store on your computer or mobile device. The cookie allows the website to “remember” your actions or preferences over time. Most browsers support cookies, but you can set your browser to decline them and delete them whenever you like.

### What type of cookies do we use?

When you access our website, we, or companies we hire to track how our website is used, may place small data files called “cookies” on your computer. We and our service providers also use cookies to customize the BitPay Services, content, and advertising; measure promotional effectiveness, and promote trust and safety.

We send a “session cookie” to your computer when you log in to your account or otherwise use the BitPay Services. This type of cookie helps us to recognize you if you visit multiple pages on our site during the same session, so that we do not need to ask you for your password on each page.

We also use longer-lasting cookies for other purposes such as to display your e-mail address on our login page, so that you don't need to retype the e-mail address each time you log in to your account.

We encode our cookies so that only we can interpret the information stored in them. You are free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, but doing so may interfere with your use of our website. We may also collect information about your computer or other access device to mitigate risk and for fraud prevention purposes.

You may encounter cookies from third parties when using the BitPay Services on websites that we do not control (for example, if you view a web page created by a third party or use an application developed by a third party, there may be a cookie placed by that web page or application.)

### Managing your cookie settings

You can manage cookies through the settings of your Internet browser. You can have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, delete individual cookies or delete all cookies. Please note that, if you choose to delete BitPay cookies, your access to some functionality and areas of our website may be degraded or restricted.
