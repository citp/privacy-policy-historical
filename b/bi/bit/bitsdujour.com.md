# Privacy Policy - Bits du Jour: Discounted software and programs

  


#### Your Email Address

Bits du Jour will **NOT** sell, trade, give away, or be careless with your email address. We're every bit as tired of spam as we bet you are.

We will send you our newsletter only if you explicitly [request it](https://web.archive.org/web/20060325194406id_/http%3A//www.bitsdujour.com/news.php). If you contact us using any of our forms, you will **not** be added to the Newsletter list unless you also request to be.

#### Cookies

Cookies are small information files stored by your browser on your hard drive. They're commonly used to allow websites to provide features like site personalization and shopping carts. Bitsdujour.com may set a cookie only if you buy one of our Featured Items using a link on bitsdujour.com. We use the cookie in this case to track the **total number of sales** made from our links. We do **not** use it for tracking any individual sale information. The cookie is set by the item vendor, not by bitsdujour.com. In most cases, these cookies are erased as soon as you complete your purchase. You can buy our Featured Items even if you have cookies disabled. 

#### Phishing and Identity Theft

Bits du Jour will **never** send you emails asking you to send personal, financial, or credit card information. We will **never** send you emails asking you to log in to what looks like a legitimate URL and confirm that kind of information. 

If you get an email that looks like it's from us and asks for that kind of info, **do NOT respond** to it or click on any of its links, no matter how official or convincing it looks. If you get anything except one of our newsletters that claims to be sent from bitsdujour.com, please [send it to us](https://web.archive.org/web/20060325194406id_/http%3A//www.bitsdujour.com/contact.php).

Emails like that - from any site - are almost always fraudulent attempts to get your information ("phishing"). We strongly recommend **never** filling in any information on a web page you've gotten to by clicking an email link, and being very careful in general about clicking email links. If you'd like to learn more about phishing and how to protect yourself, [the Anti-Phishing Working Group](http://www.antiphishing.org/consumer_recs.html) has some useful information.
