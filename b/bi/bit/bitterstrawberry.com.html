        <p>When you visit our Fan Pages on social networks and comment on and / or rate posts, or send us personal messages through these networks, we process the personal information provided in that context as your name to respond to your comments and messages. Of course, you can also visit our fan pages without providing us with personal data.</p>
        <h2>2.2. Data that we process for the performance of a contract, Art. 6 (1b) DS-GVO</h2>
        <h3>2.2.1 Contact</h3>
        <p>If you contact us (for example by email), we will process and store your personal information such as name, e-mail address and, if applicable, customer number in order to process your request.</p>
        <p>Providing contact and (if you are a BITTERSTRAWBERRY customer) contract information such as your customer number is required to answer your request. Otherwise we cannot not process your request or not satisfactorily.</p>
        <h3>2.2.2 Contract with BITTERSTRAWBERRY / Login as a customer</h3>
        <p>If you conclude a contract with BITTERSTRAWBERRY via our website <a href="https://www.bitterstrawberry.com">www.bitterstrawberry.com</a>, we process and store the contractual data specified in this framework (e.g. purchased object/subscription, name, postal address, e-mail address, payment method) for the purpose of contract execution. As a customer, you can also log into the customer area of the website using your email address and your password.</p>
        <p>The provision of the above mentioned personal information is required to comply with the subscription agreement concluded with you. If you do not provide us with this information, we may not be able to complete the subscription agreement or perform it properly.</p>
        <p>We also use phone verification for account verifications on our platform using technology from Nexmo Inc., 217 Second Street, 4th Floor, San Francisco, CA 94105, USA, (<a href="https://www.nexmo.com">https://www.nexmo.com</a>), (<a href="https://www.nexmo.com/privacy-policy">https://www.nexmo.com/privacy-policy</a>). Opt-out instructions are sent with the respective messages.</p>
        <h3>2.2.3 Payment details and Bank / Creditcard Data</h3>
        <p>If you choose a direct payment gateway to complete your purchase, the payment provider stores your credit card information. It is encrypted by the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI) DSS. Your purchase transaction data will only be stored for as long as necessary to complete your purchase transaction.</p>
        <p>All direct payment gateways comply with PCI-DSS standards, which are managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, a joint initiative of brands such as Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and Discover.</p>
        <p>PCI DSS requirements help to ensure the secure handling of credit card information by our store and its service providers.</p>
        <p>For more information, please read the Terms of Use and / or Payment Provider's Privacy Policy under the links below.</p>
        <p>All personal data is collected only within the framework of a legal permit or if you have given us your consent.</p>
        <h3>2.2.4 Participation in sweepstakes / contests</h3>
        <p>Occasionally, competitions are offered on the website. We process and store your personal data, which you have specified when participating, for the performance of the respective sweepstakes / contests. In this case, the respective conditions of participation and privacy policy of the sweepstakes / contests apply, to which you will be separately referred in the context of the respective sweepstakes / contests. If you provide us with the necessary data, e.g. contact details for the prize notification, not provide, we cannot not perform the sweepstakes / contests properly.</p>
        <h2>2.3 Data that we process for the protection of legitimate interests of BITTERSTRAWBERRY, Art. 6 (1f) DS-GVO</h2>
        <h3>2.3.1 Abuse prevention and recognition at conclusion of contract as well as address verification</h3>
        <p>At the conclusion of the contract, with the help of a visitor ID, which may contain anonymous control data of your used device (e.g. screen resolution, browser version or your operating system version) and with which your terminal is likely to be recognized on further visits, as well as with your specified contract data automatically checked for evidence of misuse of our offers. If there is suspicion of abuse, an employee reviews the rating and the underlying clues. If a contract is rejected, we will inform you. Objections to the rejection of a contract can be made at <a href="mailto:fraud@bitterstrawberry.com">fraud@bitterstrawberry.com</a>, whereupon the decision is again reviewed by an employee.</p>
        <p>By processing the above mentioned personal data it´s aimed to be prevented on the one hand, that users specify wrong data or data from third parties upon conclusion of the contract (abuse prevention and recognition). On the other hand, it should be avoided that BITTERSTRAWBERRY incurs financial default risks in connection with the subscription agreement (credit check). The result of the credit check may possibly lead to restrictions on the method of payment or the rejection of a contract.</p>
        <h3>2.3.2 Direct Mailing</h3>
        <p>We want to offer the best deal to our customers and therefore use the address information we received from you in connection with the subscription contract to provide you with information about our BITTERSTRAWBERRY products (direct mail). You may object to the use of your data for the purpose of direct mail at any time at <a href="mailto:privacy@bitterstrawberry.com">privacy@bitterstrawberry.com</a> without incurring other than the transmission costs according to the basic rates.</p>

        <h2>5. What webtracking tools (cookies and other technologies) we use and how you can object to their use</h2>
        <p>When visiting our website, cookies can be set to make our website offerings more user-friendly for you. Cookies are small text files that are stored on the hard disk of your computer and that allow recognition, but do not allow personal identification of yourself. There are two types of cookies, so-called "session cookies", which remain on your device until you close the browser, and so-called "persistent cookies", which remain stored on your device for a certain period of time, even after you have closed the browser.</p>
        <p>Web beacons (or so-called counting pixels) are also used with the same destination. Web beacons are small graphics that allow log file recording and log file analysis and are used for statistical analysis.</p>
        <p>Below you will find an overview of the web tracking tools we use, as well as information on the purpose for which we use the web tracking tools and how to deactivate them if you do not want the necessary data processing ("opt-out"). For general information on how to prevent or manage the storage of cookies, please refer to para. 5.2.</p>

        <h2>5.2 How to object to the use of webtracking tools</h2>
        <h3>5.2.1 Opposition to the display of personalized advertising</h3>
        <p>We offer you the possibility to prevent the display of personalized advertising by a single cookie. By clicking on the button below, a cookie is placed on your device that prevents the exploitation of usage-based online advertising on the BITTERSTRAWBERRY website as well as on websites of third parties, if this is based on the setting of third-party cookies on the BITTERSTRAWBERRY website. The cookie does not prevent the display of advertising in general, but prevents the exploitation of advertising tailored to your person. If you use several browsers, you must set this OptOut cookie in every browser.</p>

        <h2>5.1 Webtracking-tools we use</h2>
        <h3>5.2.2	Contradiction over browser settings</h3>
        <p>In addition to the individual possibilities of objection mentioned in section 4.1, you can generally prevent the storage of cookies by means of the settings of the browser you are using or you must agree that you must agree to the setting of cookies. You can also delete once set cookies at any time. If you use multiple browsers, you must make these settings in each of your browsers. Please note the instructions of your respective browser manufacturer. If you decline cookies altogether, this website may be impaired.</p>
        <p>Please note that the contradiction of cookies is technically usually solved by setting a contradiction cookie. Thus, another cookie is stored on your device that prevents relevant information from being transmitted to the website operator. So if you delete the cookies stored on your device, you also delete these contradictory cookies. Later, a cookie - e.g. for website optimization - set, so again information is transmitted to the website operator.</p>
        <h3>5.3 Which social media plugins we use</h3>
        <p>We use so-called "social plugins" of various social networks on our website. When going to a BITTERSTRAWBERRY website that has such a plugin integrated, clicking the plugin will establish a connection between your browser and the social network servers. The information is then automatically transmitted to you about which BITTERSTRAWBERRY websites you have visited. If you are logged into the social network while visiting a BITTERSTRAWBERRY website with an integrated plugin, this information will be assigned to your social network account. If you are logged into a social network account with your browser and click on the plugin, the corresponding content will be shared on your social network account and linked to the account of the social network concerned. The purpose and scope of the data collection and the further processing and use of the data by the social networks, as well as your rights in this regard and setting options for the protection of your privacy, are based on the privacy policy of the respective social network:</p>
