Information We Collect Using Cookies and Other Web Technologies

We use "cookies" and other web technologies to collect information and support certain features of this site. For example, we use these technologies to collect information about the ways visitors use our site (e.g., which pages they visit, which links they use, and how long they stay on each page). Cookies and other web technologies are also used to support the features and functionality of our site (e.g., to track the contents of your shopping cart as you move from page to page, etc.). These technologies also permit us to keep a record of your previous choices and preferences so that we can personalize your shopping experience and save you the trouble of reentering information already in our database. Generally, the information we collect using these web technologies does not identify you personally. It may, however, be linked to information that does identify you personally, such as the information you provide when you make a purchase or register to use a special feature of this site. If you do not wish to receive cookies, you may set your browser to reject cookies or to alert you when a cookie is placed on your computer. You may also delete our cookies as soon as you leave Bitesquad.com.

We may also use this additional information to further personalize our site and improve your shopping experience.

Use of Cookies and Similar Technologies by Our Advertising Agents

A “Web Beacon” is an object that is embedded in a web page that is usually invisible to the user and allows website operators to check whether a user has viewed a particular web page or an email. Bite Squad may use Web Beacons on the Website and in emails to count users who have visited particular pages, viewed emails, and to deliver co-branded services. Web Beacons are not used to access users’ Personally-Identifying Information; they are a technique Bite Squad may use to compile aggregated statistics about Website usage. Web Beacons collect only a limited set of information including a Web Cookie number, time and date of a page or email view, and a description of the page or email on which the Web Beacon resides. You may not decline Web Beacons, however, they can be rendered ineffective by declining all Web Cookies or modifying your browser setting to notify you each time a Web Cookie is tendered and permit you to accept or decline Web Cookies on an individual basis.
