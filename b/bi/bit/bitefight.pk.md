**_Privacy Policy_**

Gameforge Productions GmbH and Gameforge 4D GmbH, both domiciled in Albert-Nestler-Straße 8, 76131 Karlsruhe, and the other companies of the Gameforge Group ("Gameforge"), take the protection of your personal data very seriously. The following Privacy Policy will provide you information about the personal data that is collected and how it is processed and used.

 **Subject matter of this Privacy Policy**  
This Privacy Policy applies to all services which are offered on Gameforge Internet pages, in particular the Gameforge portal and the individual online gaming sites. Unless stated otherwise, this Privacy Policy exclusively regulates how Gameforge treats your personal data. In case you make use of services provided by third parties, the privacy policies of these third parties apply exclusively. Gameforge does not revise privacy policies of third parties.

 **Data controller**  
The data controller according to the Federal Data Protection Act is Gameforge Productions GmbH, Albert-Nestler-Strasse 8, 76131 Karlsruhe.  
In case you have any questions concerning privacy policy issues, please contact datenschutz@gameforge.com. At this address, you can inquire about privacy issues and review, change or delete your personal data stored by Gameforge. Alternatively, you can also contact us using the above postal address. Please - if possible – indicate the online game that you have played, the server and your player name. This will cause you no other costs than the transmission costs stated in the base rates (i.e. the costs of your Internet, e-mail, mobile phone or telephone connection).

 **General information**  
We collect, process and use personal data – unless already permitted by statutes – only with your consent. If the consent is declared electronically within the scope of our Internet presence, we will comply with the statutory obligations to inform you about it.

 **Collection of data to implement the contract**  
Generally, you can access our Internet presence without disclosing any personal data to us. It is always your choice whether or not to provide us with your personal data. We collect your data to be able to fulfil the user contract concluded with you. In addition to monitoring compliance with the terms of use and the rules of the game, this includes in particular the proper handling of your payment orders. If you would like to register on our Internet sites, participate in sweepstakes or subscribe to our newsletter, it is necessary to provide personal data. This data includes, for example, your name, address, e-mail address and other personal data which Gameforge may query in individual cases. In addition, the automatic collection of further data of registered customers, e.g. the IP address, is required for the technical implementation of our services as well as the monitoring of the use of our services in compliance with the law and the contract. The proper implementation of the user contract involves in particular the monitoring of compliance with the terms of use and the rules of the game. Insofar as we provide you clients for download to participate in our games, a programme to avoid altering or fraudulent interventions in the game may be installed in the game along with these clients to prevent unlawful use of the game and manipulation of data. 

Such programmes are started together with the respective game and exclusively serve to protect the data of the respective game stored on the clients and the servers. During the participation in the respective game, an analysis of the client software, the technical communication between the client and our servers as well as known unlawful technical manipulations and aids (in particular hacks and cheats) may be conducted. Further analysis of your computer and data will not be conducted; in particular neither your communication within the game nor your other data stored on your computer outside the game will be evaluated. If no alterations of the client or the communication between the client and the server are detected on your computer, personal data will not be collected and in particular not transmitted to the respective game server or Gameforge. In case abusive use, in particular technical manipulation and violation of the terms of use and the rules of the game, is detected, the data required to eliminate the abuse will be transmitted to Gameforge. In the event that such a programme is installed along with a game, you will be informed of this by separate notice. You may abort or cancel the installation at any time by aborting the installation of the client or uninstalling the client.
