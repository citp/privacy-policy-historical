#### 5\. COOKIES

We use a browser feature known as a “cookie”, which assigns a unique identification to your computer. Cookies are typically stored on your computer’s hard drive. Information collected from cookies is used by us to evaluate the effectiveness of the Site and/or the Service.

#### 6\. SECURITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

We are committed to ensuring that your information is secure. To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure of information we have physical, electronic and managerial procedures in place to keep your personal information safe. Once logged into your Account, all internet communication is secured using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology with high security 128bit encryption.

However, this high level of protection can only be effective if you follow certain security practices yourself. You must never share your Account login details with anyone. If you are concerned that any of your login details have been compromised, you can change them any time once you are logged on but you should always also immediately contact us and tell us why you think your login details have been compromised. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure.
