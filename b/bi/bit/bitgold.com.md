# BitGold | Privacy & Security

## PRIVACY POLICY

1.1 We always want our policies to be clear and easy to understand — so this Privacy Policy offers a simple breakdown of how we handle your personal information in connection with the BitGold Site and the BitGold Services, as those terms are defined in our Customer Agreement. Our Privacy Policy is incorporated into our Customer Agreement, so if you see a capitalized term here such as "BitGold Account", it takes the meaning described in the Customer Agreement. By using the BitGold Site, by applying for a BitGold Account, or by using a BitGold Account, you are consenting to this Privacy Policy.

1.2 This Privacy Policy went into effect on **February 6, 2015**. If you have any questions or comments about how we treat your personal information, please let us know by contacting Support at support@bitgold.com

4.2 As we discuss below in Section 5, this information may be shared with our Service Providers to fulfil the above purposes, and also may be shared with carefully selected business partners.

## HOW WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

5.1 From time to time we engage unaffiliated third parties and their affiliates, agents and subcontractors ("Service Providers") to perform certain technological or administrative services in connection with the BitGold Services. For example, a Service Provider may be asked to serve as a Vault Operator, operate a Verification Network, process transactions, provide credit reports or assessments, verify customer identities, detect suspicious transactions, perform security services, and manage or audit our operations. In some cases, as described in Section 3, a Service Provider will be collecting your personal information from other sources on our behalf to fulfill the purposes set out in Section 4. We also may use a Service Provider to host and administer one or more of our BitGold Sites, process and store data, and fulfill similar technology-related functions on our behalf. In these circumstances, the personal information that the Service Provider receives is limited to the personal information needed to render their service to us.

5.2 In certain cases, we may also share some of the personal information we collect with carefully selected business partners, who are first required to sign an agreement that obligates them to keep the information confidential and secure and prohibits them from using it for unauthorized purposes.

5.3 We may disclose personal information without notice to you if a law, regulation, search warrant, subpoena, court order, or regulatory notice permits or requires us to do so. We may also disclose personal information without notice to you to prevent fraud or abuse, or to protect the rights, property or personal safety of BitGold, its customers, employees, service providers, or the public.

## HOW WE COMMUNICATE WITH YOU

6.1 Communications between you and BitGold may be conducted by mail or by telephone, fax, online, text message, or by other electronic means. Any instructions that you give to us in any such manner will have the same legal effect as if you gave them to us in original written form. You agree that all telephone calls and electronic communications may be recorded and kept by us as a record of your instructions. You also agree that we may contact you electronically in response to a request, inquiry, or complaint, as otherwise solicited by you, or as permitted or required by law.

6.2 We may also communicate with you from time to time electronically about news, promotions, special offers and other information from BitGold, regarding either BitGold or its selected partners. You may unsubscribe from these kinds of messages at any time by visiting bitgold.com/settings. We are not responsible for any additional information you provide directly to these partners, and we encourage you to become familiar with their privacy and security practices and policies before disclosing information to them.

## COOKIES AND OTHER WEB-BASED IDENTIFICATION OR TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES

7.1 Cookies are small pieces of information which are placed in your computer’s memory when you visit a website. BitGold uses cookies to recognize you as a repeat visitor, to identify your browser type, to keep track of online patterns and preferences in order to better understand you as a customer, and to improve the quality of the BitGold Site and BitGold Services. When you enter our BitGold Site, our servers (or those of our Service Providers) will recognize your computer but not who is using it. However, by associating the identification numbers in the cookies with other customer information when, for example, you log in to the BitGold Services, we know that the cookie information relates to you.

7.2 It is always open to you to modify your web browser settings to prevent the placing of cookies or to notify you each time a cookie is set. The website www.allaboutcookies.org contains additional useful information on how to block or control cookies using different browsers. However, by blocking or deleting cookies used on the BitGold Services, you may not be able to take full advantage of the BitGold Services.

7.3 The BitGold Site and the BitGold Services may allow you to interact with plugins from social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn or Instagram. In such cases, there may be a flow of your personal information between BitGold and such social media sites. Your use of these plugins will be governed by each social media site's privacy policy and not this privacy policy. We encourage you to become familiar with each social media site's privacy and security practices and policies before enabling such plugins.

## STORAGE AND RETENTION

8.1 Information that you submit through the BitGold Services may be transferred to Brinks, Iron Mountain, Amazon Web Services (aws.amazon/service-terms/), credit bureau partners, Verification Network providers, any marketing or data mining partners.

8.2 We also have engaged Service Providers to provide us with cloud computing services. Cloud computing allows businesses to store information on remote servers operated by third parties. Examples of these services include online file storage, disaster recovery backups, e-mail and business applications. Our cloud computing Service Providers have policies and processes in place to ensure that information in their care is safeguarded at all times. Additionally, we encrypt this cloud-based information to prevent it from misuse by unauthorized access. As of the date of this policy, our cloud computing Service Provider processes and stores information in the United States, Canada and other countries as deemed necessary for regular operations.

8.3 We retain appropriate records in accordance with legal requirements, necessary business purposes and limitations periods applicable in the jurisdictions in which we operate.

8.4 You acknowledge that as our Service Providers are located in the foreign jurisdictions named above, it is possible that the governments, courts or law enforcement or regulatory agencies of these jurisdictions may be able to obtain disclosure of your personal information through a lawful order, possibly without notice to you.

## ACCESSING OR CORRECTING YOUR PROFILE

9.1 To access, modify or delete the personal information you have provided to us, please contact us at [support@bitgold.com](mailto:support@bitgold.com). As stated in Section 8 above, even after you have asked us to delete your profile, it may be necessary for us to retain certain information in accordance with legal requirements and limitations periods in the jurisdictions in which we operate.

9.2 On request, we will give you a copy of all the personal information about you that we hold. The making of the copy may be subject to a fee if permitted by law.

## CHANGES TO THIS POLICY

10.1 It may become necessary to change the terms of this Privacy Policy from time to time. We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy as necessary to comply with law or for legitimate business purposes. By continuing to use the BitGold Services, you agree to be bound by the updates to this Privacy Policy. Please check back frequently: you will be able to see if changes have been made by looking at the top and bottom of the Privacy Policy for the date it was last updated.
