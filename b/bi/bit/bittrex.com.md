Our Site may include links to third-party websites, plug-ins and applications. Clicking on those links or enabling those connections may allow third parties to collect or share data about you.

We encourage you to read the privacy Policy of every website you visit.

## 2\. KEY DEFINITIONS

Set out below are key definitions of certain data protection terms which appear in this Privacy Policy.

“ **Consent Form** ” refers to separate documents which we might from time to time provide you where we ask for your explicit consent for any processing which is not for purposes set out in this Privacy Policy.

“ **Data subjects** ” means living individuals (i.e. **natural persons** ) about whom we collect and process personal data. 

“ **Data controller** ” or “ **controller** ” means any entity or individual who determines the purposes for which, and the manner in which, any personal data is processed.

“ **Data processor** ” or “ **processor** ” means any entity or individual that processes data on our behalf and on our instructions (we being the data controller).

“ **Personal data** ” means data relating to a living individual (i.e. **natural person** ) who can be identified from the data (information) we hold or possess. This includes, but is not limited to, your name and surname (including maiden name where applicable), address, date of birth, nationality, gender, civil status, tax status, identity card number & passport number, contact details (including mobile and home phone number and personal email address), photographic image, bank account details, emergency contact information as well as online identifiers. The term “ **personal information** ”, where and when used in this Privacy Policy, shall be taken have the same meaning as personal data.

“ **Processing** ” means any activity that involves use of personal data. It includes obtaining, recording or holding the data, or carrying out any operation or set of operations on the data including, organizing, amending, retrieving, using, disclosing, erasing or destroying it. Processing also includes transferring personal data to third parties.

“ **Sensitive personal data** ”, “ **sensitive data** ” or “ **special categories of personal data** ” includes information about a person's racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or similar beliefs, trade union membership, physical or mental health or condition or sexual life, or about the commission of, or proceedings for, any offence committed or alleged to have been committed by that person, the disposal of such proceedings or the sentence of any court in such proceedings. This type of sensitive data can only be processed under strict conditions.

**Note that personal data does not include information relating to a legal person (for example, a company or other legal entity). In that regard, information such as a company name, its company number, registered address and VAT number does not amount to personal data in terms of both the Act and the GDPR. Therefore, the collection and use of information strictly pertaining to a legal person does not give rise to data controller obligations at law.** **Naturally, we will still treat any and all such information in a confidential and secure manner.**

## 3\. THE PERSONAL DATA WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU

Personal data, or personal information, means any information about an individual from which that person can be identified (as stated above). It does not include data where the identity has been removed ( **anonymous data** ). In the course of your relationship with us (including during the account opening stage), we may collect, use, store and transfer different kinds of personal data about you which we have grouped together.

We collect information you provide directly to us. For example, we collect information when you create an account, participate in any interactive feature of the Services, fill out a form, participate in a community or forum discussion, complete an exchange transaction, apply for a job, request customer support or otherwise communicate with us. The types of information we may collect include your name, social security number or other government ID number, date of birth, email address, postal address, phone number, certain virtual financial asset information, and any other information you choose to provide.

For avoidance of doubt, categories marked in blue are applicable to customers (i.e. individuals who hold a registered customer account with us). We shall request this information in order to be able to register you on our Platform.

  * **Identity Data** includes your first name, maiden name (where applicable), last name, address, username or similar identifier, marital status, title, nationality, date of birth, gender, photograph, identity card and/or passport number. This will form part of your account information on the Platform.
  * **Contact Data** includes your billing address, email address and contact number (telephone and/or mobile).
  * **Financial Data** includes your bank account and payment details.
  * **AML / KYC Data** includes the following due diligence / KYC information and documentation about you: (i) copy of I.D. card or passport, (ii) proof of residence (e.g. utility bill), (iii) KYC database checks, (iv) fraud database checks and (v) any documentation or information which we may, from time to time: 
    * be required to collect to ensure compliance with any applicable legislation (including applicable foreign laws) and global AML/KYC practices; and/or
    * otherwise be mandated to collect by any competent authority or law enforcement agency (local or overseas).
  * **Marketing and Communications Data** includes your preferences in receiving marketing from us and our third parties and your communication preferences.



The categories of personal data marked in green below are applicable to customers holding a registered account with us who start trading over the Platform and otherwise make use of our Services.

  * **Transaction Data** includes details about: 
    * the type of virtual financial assets involved, the order volume, price, value and, where applicable, the proceeds derived;
    * your trading and transactional history on the Platform, including withdrawals and order activity; and
    * the payments which we receive, or otherwise, charge you (e.g. our fees for your use of the Platform).
  * **Portfolio Data** includes details about the virtual financial assets and amounts credited to your Account and your Account balances.
  * **Enhanced KYC Data  ** applies in respect of instances mandated by our AML-KYC Policy, which would include, amongst other scenarios, situations where a higher risk of money laundering and funding of terrorism has been identified.



In all cases, we collect the following information upon access to our Site:

  * **Technical/LOG Data** includes the IP address, your login data to the Platform (username and password), device type, browser type and version, time zone setting and location, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system and other technology on the devices you use to access the Site and Platform. This also includes information about your use of the Services, including the type of browser you use, access times, pages viewed, your IP address, and the page you visited before navigating to our Services.
  * **Device Data** includes information about the computer or mobile device you use to access our Services, including the hardware model, operating system and version, unique device identifiers, and mobile network information.
  * **Usage Data** includes information about how you use the Platform.



We also collect, use and share **Aggregated Data** such as statistical or demographic data for any purpose. Aggregated Data may be derived from your personal data but is not considered personal data in law as this data does not directly or indirectly reveal your identity. For example, we may aggregate your Usage Data to calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific feature of the Site and/or the Platform. However, if we combine or connect Aggregated Data with your personal data so that it can directly or indirectly identify you, we treat the combined data as personal data which will be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

### If you Fail to provide Personal Data

Where we need to collect personal data about you: 

  * by law; or
  * under the terms of, or in connection with, the contract that we have with you (as discussed in Section 1 above); or
  * as part of our legitimate (business) interests to verify the identity of our applicants and clients, mitigate against risks (such as potential or suspected fraud) and in particular, to assess and take a decision on whether we will or should enter into a relationship with you (as subject to our client acceptance criteria and policies);



and you either fail to provide that data when requested, or else provide incomplete or insufficient data, we may not be able to perform or conclude the contract which we have or are otherwise trying to enter into with you (namely regarding your account opening on the Platform and provision of our related services).

In certain instances, particularly where this relates to AML / KYC Data, we may even need to exercise our prerogative to terminate our contract with you, and thus withdraw the availability of our services to you, or else, if still at application stage, we may have to decline to enter into a relationship with you. We will however notify you if this is the case at that point in time.

### Sensitive Personal Data 

We do not knowingly **collect Special Categories of Personal Data** (or Sensitive Personal Data) about you. Should we receive sensitive personal data about you, we will only process that data where there is a legitimate reason to do so and, in all circumstances, in accordance with our obligations at law and under the appropriate safeguards.

**As set out below in Section 5, we collect and process AML / KYC Data in order to be able to** (i)  comply with legal and regulatory obligations, as applicable (ii) conduct our AML and KYC checks, and other due diligence checks, on you, (iii) verify your identity or claimed identity and identify and/or verify your source of funds and source of wealth, as appropriate (iv) take an informed decision on whether we want to enter into a customer relationship with you, and, if positive, to conduct initial and ongoing screening and monitoring and (iv) to comply with any legal or regulatory obligation that we may have and/or any Court, regulatory or enforcement order that may be issued upon us.

We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law (including applicable data protection and privacy law). We do not allow our third party business partners or service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our documented instructions. Furthermore, these third parties access and process your data on the basis of strict confidentiality and subject to the appropriate security measures and safeguards.

We may also disclose your data:

You consent to the transfer of data to entities outside the European Economic Area (“ **EEA** ”), and acknowledge such transfers, which will only take place for the purposes set forth in Section 5, are necessary for the performance of a contract between the data subject and the controller or the implementation of pre-contractual measures taken at the data subject's request. Such transfers may take place to countries for which the there is no adequacy decision pursuant to Article 45 of the GDPR and may lack EU-type privacy protections.

## 8\. DATA SECURITY

While no online or electronic system is guaranteed to be secure, we take reasonable measures to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.

We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorized way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.

We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.

## 9. DATA RETENTION

### How long will you use my personal data for? ** **

**Please note that we consider our relationship with you to be an ongoing and continuous customer relationship, until terminated.**

We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for (i.e. the ongoing service provision) and, **_thereafter_** , for the purpose of satisfying any legal, accounting, tax and reporting requirements or obligations to which we may be subject and/or to the extent that we may also need to retain your personal data to be able to assert, exercise or defend possible future legal claims against or otherwise involving you.

By and large, our retention of your personal data shall not exceed the period of **_seven (7) years_** from the date of the termination of your relationship with us (which would typically arise from the closure/de-registration of your account on the Platform). This period of retention enables us to use the data in question for the possible filing, exercise or defense of legal claims (taking into account the timeframe of applicable statutes of limitation and prescriptive periods). In certain cases though, we may need to retain your data for a period of up to **_ten (10) years_** in order to comply with applicable accounting and tax laws (this will primarily consist of your Transaction Data).

In the event that Bittrex’s activities are held by competent legislators and regulators to amount to a ‘relevant activity’ at law, we will retain your AML and KYC Data for the duration of your business relationship with us and for a further period of five years following its termination and, in certain instances, for a maximum period of ten (10) years post-termination if mandated by the FIAU or other applicable competent authority. We may need to revise this AML retention period in the event of applicable legal or regulatory developments, but we will notify you if this is the case at the time.

In some circumstances, you can ask us to delete your data. See below for further information.

**Kindly contact our DPCP for further details about the retention periods that we apply.**

### Data Minimization

Whenever and to the extent possible, we anonymize the data which we hold about you when it is no longer necessary to identify you from the data which we hold about you ( **anonymous data** ).

In some circumstances, we may even anonymize your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice.

## 10\. YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS

Under certain circumstances, you have rights under certain data protection laws in relation to your personal data.

  * _Request access to your personal data._
  * _Request correction of your personal data._
  * _Request erasure of your personal data._
  * _Object to processing of your personal data._
  * _Request restriction of processing your personal data._
  * _Request transfer of your personal data_.
  * _Right to withdraw consent_.



If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us at [privacy@bittrex.com](mailto:privacy@bittrex.com). These rights are explained below.

### No Fee usually required

You will not normally have to pay a fee to exercise your data subject rights.

However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in the above circumstances.

### What we may need from you

We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other data subject rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.

### Time limit to Respond

We try to respond to all legitimate requests within the period of one month from receipt of the request.

Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.

### Your Legal Rights

You have the right to:

  1. **Request access** to your personal data (commonly known as a “ _data subject access request_ ”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it. You may send an email to  _[privacy@bittrex.com](mailto:privacy@bittrex.com)_ requesting information as the personal data which we process.
  2. **Right to information** when collecting and processing personal data about you from publicly accessible or third party sources. When this takes place, we will inform you, within a reasonable and practicable timeframe, about the third party or publicly accessible source from which we have collected your personal data.
  3. **Request correction or rectification** of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected and/or updated, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us. As mentioned, it is in your interest to keep us informed of any changes or updates to your personal data which occur during the course of your relationship with us.
  4. **Request erasure** of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where:  

    * there is no good reason for us continuing to process it;
    * you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below);
    * we may have processed your information unlawfully; or
    * we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law.
Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request. These may include instances where continued processing is necessary in order to be able to: 
    * comply with a legal or regulatory obligation to which we are subject; or
    * establish, exercise or defence of legal claims. 
  5. **Object to processing** of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes (see **Marketing** in Section 5 above).

In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.

  6. **Request restriction of processing** of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: 
    * if you want us to establish the data's accuracy;
    * where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it;
    * where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or
    * you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
  7. **Request the transfer (data portability)** of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
  8. **Withdraw consent at any time** where we are relying on consent to process your personal data (which will not generally be the case). This will not however affect the lawfulness of any processing which we carried out before you withdrew your consent. Any processing activities that are not based on your consent will remain unaffected.



**Kindly note that none of these data subject rights are absolute and must generally be weighed against our own legal obligations and legitimate interests. If a decision is taken to override your data subject request, you will be informed of this by our data protection team along with the reasons for our decision.**
