### OBTAINING PERSONAL INFORMATION

    1. We shall not collect any Personal Information about you without your knowledge. We may however automatically collect certain data and receive personal information about you where you would have provided such information through the use of our services and through your interactions with us. 

We may also receive certain Personal Information from online vendors and service providers, as well as from customer lists lawfully acquired from third-party vendors. In addition, we retain the right to engage the services of third-party service providers to provide technical support, so as to process your online transactions and to maintain your Member Account. 

Please understand that we may be granted access to any information you may provide to such vendors, service providers and third-party e-commerce services. Rest assured that we will use and safeguard any Personal Information so obtained, as set out in this Policy. Any information that you provide will only be disclosed to third parties outside the Company in accordance with this Privacy Policy and we shall take necessary steps to ensure that our agreements with third-party service providers and online vendors always protect your private information. 

### SHARING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

    1. We may pass information that you have given us to other entities within our group of companies and to our business partners. These companies may include our parent companies, their parent companies and all of the subsidiaries of these respective companies, as well as other companies with whom we carry out business and hold necessary agreements. Data processing of your information may be undertaken by Direx N.V. or by another company in the group of companies, which may use a third party to fulfill such data processing needs. 

Given that the Internet is a global environment, using the Internet to collect and process personal data necessarily involves transmission of data. We may therefore also disclose information that you have given us to our business partners, suppliers and sub-contractors for the performance of any contract obligations we may have entered into with them or you. Details of any third party to whom your financial information may be passed on to for the fulfillment of your use of our services, shall be made available to you. 

You should also note that in order to provide you with an efficient service, we and/or our service providers might require transferring your personal data from one country to another in the European Union (EU) and European Free Trade Association (EFTA) regions and also to some data processors that may be based outside of the European Economic Area (EEA). Therefore, by browsing the Website and communicating electronically with us, you acknowledge and agree to our (or our suppliers or sub-contractors) processing of your personal data in these countries. We shall always take all reasonable steps to ensure that your information and data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. 

Nevertheless, your Personal Information will always be safeguarded in accordance with legal requirements, for this reason it shall not be passed on to third parties, unless such disclosure is deemed suitable for your participation in our business and in the business carried out in collaboration with any of our business partners. This shall include the processing of your requests in relation to your use of our Brand/Website and/or the Games/Products or our business associates or unless the law expressly requires it. Relevant authorities, regulators, employees of the Company, more specifically those forming part of Customer Support Team and the Payments & Anti-Fraud teams as well as other selected employees, shall also have access to your Personal Information for the purpose of executing their duties and providing you with assistance. You hereby consent to such disclosures. 

### SELLING AND RELEASING OF DATA

    1. We do not sell personal data about our customers to third parties. However, we may release personal data if we acquire any new businesses. Should the Company undergo any changes to its structure such as a merger, acquisition by another company or a partial acquisition, it is most likely that our customers’ personal data will be included within the sale or transfer. We will, as part of our policy, inform our customers by email prior to affecting such transfer of personal data. 

We further reserve the right to release personal data when we believe that release is appropriate in order to comply with the law, or to enforce our Terms and Conditions, or to protect our rights, property, or safety, and also for the protection of any other companies within our group of companies. 

### LAWS AND REGULATIONS

    1. We hereby acknowledge that in collecting and processing your Personal Information for the purposes of managing your Member Account, we are bound by strict legal provisions on the protection of personal data. Consequently, we endeavour to protect your personal information and respect your privacy in accordance with best business practices and applicable regulations. In addition and for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Privacy Policy shall prevent us from retaining your Personal Information where we are required to do so by law. 

### RETENTION OF PERSONAL DATA

    1. As stated under our Terms and Conditions both, you and the Casino can decide to have your Member Account closed at any time. Following closure of your account, we will retain your personal data on record for as long as required by law.
