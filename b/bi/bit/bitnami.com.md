For this reason, we have entered into guarantees to ensure appropriate safeguards. If we transfer information from the European Union to third parties outside the European Union and to countries not subject to schemes which are considered as providing an adequate data protection standard, we will enter into contracts which are based on the EU Standard Contractual Clauses with these parties. 

If you wish to inquire further about the safeguards we use, please contact us using the details set out at the end of this Privacy Policy. We will take reasonable steps to ensure that your personal information is treated securely and in accordance with applicable law and this Privacy Policy.

Without these cookies, you would not be able to use these services whilst authenticated. 
    * **Analytics Cookies:** These cookies collect information about how people are using our websites, for example which pages are visited most often, how people are moving from one link to another and if a particular user experiences error messages on certain pages. All information these cookies collect is grouped together with information from other people's use of our websites. Overall, these cookies provide us with analytical information about how our websites are performing and how we can improve them. Although Analytics Cookies may be used by third parties for advertising purposes, they are not per se advertising cookies.

We do not control these cookies and you should check the social media service provider's website for further details about how they use cookies. 
  * **How long will cookies stay on your browsing device?** The length of time a cookie will stay on your browsing device depends on whether it is a "persistent" or "session" cookie.

Third parties setting cookies from our websites will be providing a service to us or a function of the website, but we do not always control how third-party cookies are used. Some third parties may use cookies to help gather information about your browsing activity so that they can deliver website advertising to you that is relevant to your interests.

    * **Google Analytics:** We use Google Analytics to recognize you and link the devices you use when you visit our websites or use our Service on your browser or mobile device. Google Analytics facilitates the assignment of data, sessions and interactions across several devices to a pseudonymous user ID and thus the analysis of activities across devices. We share a unique identifier, like a user ID or hashed email address, with Google to facilitate the service. The generated information is usually transferred to a Google server in the USA and stored there. As IP anonymization is activated on this website, Google will reduce your IP address within the Member States of the European Union or in other states party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area beforehand. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transmitted to a Google server in the USA and shortened there. The IP address transmitted by your browser in the context of Google Analytics is not merged with other Google data. Google will use the collected data on our behalf to evaluate the use of the websites, to compile reports on website activity and to provide the website operator with other services related to website and Internet use.

    * **Hotjar:** Hotjar is a technology service that helps us better understand our users' experience (e.g. how much time they spend on which pages, which links they choose to click, what users do and don't like, etc.) and this enables us to maintain and improve our service according to the use of our websites. Hotjar uses cookies and other technologies to collect data on our users' behavior and their devices (in particular device's IP address (captured and stored only in anonymized form), device screen size, device type (unique device identifiers), browser information, geographic location (country only), preferred language used to display our website).

Neither Hotjar nor we will ever use this information to identify individual users or to match it with further data on an individual user.
