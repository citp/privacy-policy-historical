Several unrivaled products fuel our Bitfinex's market dominance:<br/><br/> <strong>Exchange Trading</strong><br/>At its heart, Bitfinex is a central limit order book for various cryptocurrencies. Users can exchange bitcoin (BTC), litecoin (LTC), ether (ETH) and ether classic (ETC) for US Dollars (USD) or BTC with the following trading pairs: BTC/USD, LTC/USD, ETH/USD, ETC/USD, LTC/BTC, ETH/BTC, and ETC/BTC. Bitfinex also provides a suite of order types to help our customer optimize their trading strategy.<br/><br/><strong>Financed Trading</strong><br/>Bitfinex allows for users to trade with up to 3.3x leverage by receiving financing from our peer-to-peer financing platform. Users can enter an order to receive the desired amount of financing at the rate and duration of their choice, or they can open a position at Bitfinex and Bitfinex will link them with peer-to-peer funding at the prevailing rate at that time.<br/><br/><strong>Peer-to-Peer Financing</strong><br/>The financing market provides users with a way to earn interest on USD, BTC, LTC, and ETH by providing funding to users wanting to trade with financing. Users can offer financing at the rate and duration of their choice, or they can lend at an automatically adjusting rate that we refer to as the Flash Return Rate (FRR). Also, users can use Bitfinex\u2019s Auto-Renew feature to renew their lending offers automatically upon expiry."},"margin_funding":{"title":"Margin Funding","auto_renew":"What is the margin funding \"auto-renew\" feature?","auto_renew_explain":"When \"Auto-renew\" is activated, all the balance available in your Deposit wallet is automatically offered at your set parameters. This is especially useful if you want to re-invest your daily return payments.","calculation":"How is the return on offered funding calculated?","calculation_explain":"The return is calculated hourly. Funding providers set their own return rates. When you open a position the system chooses the best offers to leverage your trade.","daily_term":"What is the difference between offering funding on a \"daily\" or \"term\" basis?","flash":"What is the \"Flash Return Rate\"?","flash_explain":"The \"Flash Return Rate\" is a special kind of rate: it is based not on an agreed fixed rate, but on the average of all fixed-rate positions, of all terms, weighted by their amount, as displayed %{link:here}. The Flash Return Rate (FRR) updates once per hour. The advantage is that return rates tend to follow Bitcoin price: when the price goes up, return rates for USD tend to go up, and similarly for BTC return rates when price goes down. Funding providers can then safely provide funding knowing that they will not miss opportunities if the market return rate goes up. Traders will find it even more interesting, because if the return rate they pay goes up, that usually mean their position is profitable.","min_offer":"What is the minimum amount for offering funding?","min_offer_explain":"The minimum amount for one offer is $50 USD or the equivalent in other currencies. For margin funding providers who have a very small amount you can use auto-renew and the minimum amount would then be $10 USD for an offer to be posted.","return_payment":"When do I receive my return payment?","return_payment_explain":"The return is credited to your deposit wallet balance every day around 00:00 GMT, even for funds returned earlier in the day.","revoke_funding":"Can I take back my funding that I have offered before the period I specified expires?","revoke_funding_explain":"Once funding has been accepted it can only be closed by the funding taker or by the system upon expiration; those offering funding cannot take back their funding early.","risks":"What are the risks associated with offering funding?","risks_explain":"The risks are low. We have taken the following steps to prevent funding providers from losing money:","risks_explain2":"If a trader's position is at a loss he will cover the loss with funds in his trading wallet. The funds in the trading wallet serve as collateral only.","risks_explain3":"A trader's position is force liquidated when the net value of his account falls below the maintenance margin.","what":"What is Margin Funding?","what_explain":"Our margin funding feature goes hand in hand with our margin trading. If you are not a trader and prefer safer investments, this feature is for you. Bitfinex allows you, using your deposit wallets, to provide funding in the form of bitcoins, litecoins, ethers, and/or dollars to traders. You can enter offers with your own chosen terms (return rate, duration, and amount). When an offer is taken by a trader, the money in your wallet will be used to buy or sell Bitcoins. When the position expires (the trader closes his position), Bitcoins are bought or sold back and the money is returned to your wallet.","withdraw":"Can traders withdraw the funds they are using?","withdraw_explain":"No, the funding a trader takes serves only to open margin positions. The actual funding always stay in either the funding provider's account or on the exchange as part of a position."},"moving_funds":{"title":"Moving Funds","tethers":"What are Tethers?","tethers_explain":"Tethers are a new type of digital currency, built on the ","tethers_explain2":"Omni Layer","tethers_explain3":" on Bitcoin. Every tether is backed 1-to-1 by traditional currency held in Tether Limited\u2019s reserves. So 1 USD\u20ae is always equivalent to 1 USD.  Bitfinex lets you receive USD\u20ae from a Bitcoin blockchain address and treat them as a USD deposit. Similarly, you can withdraw funds to a Bitcoin blockchain address as USD\u20ae. Learn more about the benefits of using tethers ","tethers_explain4":"here","tethers_explain5":".","withdrawal_duration":"How long does it take for a cryptocurrency withdrawal to be processed?","withdrawal_duration_explain":"When you enable two-factor authentication your withdrawal will be approved instantly, unless you have logged with a new IP address in the previous  24 hours.","withdrawal_duration_explain2_html":"A complex rule-set is used to determine if your withdrawal can be immediately processed or if there needs to be a manual approval process on our side. For example, enabling two-factor authentication you will satisfy some rules requires for the automatic processing of your withdrawal.<br/></br/>For more information about automatic withdrawal processing, log in and visit <a href='https://www.bitfinex.com/withdraw/greenline'>https://www.bitfinex.com/withdraw/greenline</a>. Most automatically processed cryptocurrency withdrawals will be processed within 2 minutes, but processing can sometimes take longer if an approval is required or if our \"hot wallet\" (special wallet used to process withdrawals) is empty and needs to be refilled. The funds kept in our hot wallet are kept to a minimum as a security measure, and are refilled periodically as needed.","withdrawal_duration_usd":"How long does it take for a wire withdrawal to be processed?","withdrawal_duration_usd_explain":"A USD wire withdrawal by wire is sent within 3 to 7 business days, unless the option \"Express\" is chosen (for a fee), in which case the wire is sent within 24 hours during business days."},"security":{"title":"Security","logged_in":"How long do I stay logged in to Bitfinex?","logged_in_explain":"If you have an active Bitfinex session, your browser will keep your session alive via a 10-minute ping to our platform, allowing you to monitor trading without having to worry about session timeout. When the session becomes inactive, it will time out in 30 minutes and you will be logged out.","secure":"How secure is Bitfinex?","secure_explain":"Security of funds and user information is our top priority. We are adding additional security layers, auditing processes, and reducing the \"attack surface\" of our infrastructure. It may be that a 100% robust system is never possible, but it is a goal well worth pursuing. Reducing our reliance on certain third parties has already brought us closer to this goal, along with implementing a new series of best practices to both minimize the probability of attacks and minimize exposure of funds in such an event.","secure_explain2":"See our security practices here","cold":"How secure is your cryptocurrency storage?","cold_explain":"The majority of cryptocurrencies are stored in offline, cold wallets. We only keep approximately 0.5% of crypto assets in hot wallets. To further isolate the hot wallets from potential attack, the hot wallets are not accessible from the platform or the platform servers. They require special, manual intervention of our staff to access.","servers":"Where are your servers located?","servers_explain":"Our servers are cloud-based and globally distributed."},"trading":{"title":"Trading","claim":"What does it mean to \"claim\" my position?","claim_explain":"The claim feature allows you to use the funds you have in your trading wallet to settle a leveraged position as an exchange buy or sale.","claim_explain2":"So when you claim the position, you will be credited the sale size in USD (for a BTCUSD short), i.e. charged the base price multiplied by the size of the position (sale size of the position), or the buy size in BTC (for a BTCUSD buy), with a fee based on the amount credited.","claim_explain3":"For example, let\u2019s say you have $100 USD in your wallet with 0.1 BTCUSD active long position. Claiming your position would use your available USD to reimburse the margin funding used to fund the underlying 0.1 btc at the opening price value and deduct it from your trading balance. So, at $250 base price, you will end up with ~$75 USD and 0.1 btc.","claim_explain4":"You will be charged the pending margin funding returns and the position amount in BTC, LTC, ETH, or ETC will be charged to your balance directly.","claim_explain5":"Claiming your position does not involve trading. If you don't have enough balance to claim the position when you click on \"Claim\", the system will tell you \"You need to sell approximately XX Bitcoins at the current price to claim the position\", but it's up to you to sell those Bitcoins with the type of orders you want.","interest_rates":"What interest rate is charged on margin positions?","interest_rates_explain":"It's the rate in effect for the funding involved in each position you take. See \"How do I open a Margin position?\" above.","margin_call":"What's your Margin Call Policy? What is the minimum maintenance margin required?","margin_call_explain":"You will receive a margin call (website and email notification) when the net value of your account reaches the maintenance margin limit. When the net value falls below the maintenance margin the position will be force liquidated. When you have a margin position, you will see an estimated liquidation price (the price at which you would be liquidated).","margin_position":"How do I open a Margin position?","margin_position_explain":"You can open a margin position by going to the ","margin_position_explain2":"Margin Trade","margin_position_explain3":" tab and placing your desired order. If you have not already reserved funding the system will automatically acquire funding for you at the best current available rate. Alternatively, you can reserve funding at any time and then use it when you decide to open a margin position.  Open the ","margin_position_explain4":"Margin Funding","margin_position_explain5":" tab for more information.","no_funds":"What happens to my margin position when the underlying funds are no longer available?","no_funds_explain":"The system will automatically aquire the necessary funding for you at the best current rate available. The position will be unaffected.","no_reserve":"I have money in my wallet but the system won't let me open a position, it says \"NO RESERVE\"?","no_reserve_explain":"When you trade on margin you need to receive funding from funding providers. If there is no funding provider available, your order will be cancelled with a status \"no reserve\" which means that no funding was available when the order should have been executed.","order_error":"Why do I receive this error when trying to place an order: \"Can not place additional order at the moment\"?","order_error_explain":"This error can happen in two cases:","order_error_explain2":"You hit our \"antispam\" limit, which prevents you to place more than 256 orders within a 2 minutes timeframe.","order_error_explain3":"You hit our throttle dynamic limit, that will prevent you to place a new order when the trading engine lag increases. It is very rare, generally does not last more than a few seconds, and is designed to mitigate attacks by spam orders, regulate lag during spike in activity and avoid flash crashes.","order_types":{"title":"What types of orders does Bitfinex offer?","explain":"Bitfinex offers six order types to be used for different strategies and scenarios:","fill_kill":"Fill or Kill","fill_kill_explain":"This type of order is a limit order that must be filled in its entirety or cancelled (killed). The purpose of a fill or kill order is to ensure that a position is entered at a desired price.","hidden_order":"Hidden Order","hidden_order_explain":"A hidden order is an order which does not appear in the orderbook, and thus doesn't influence other market participants. See the fees page for minimum size and fee applicable.","limit":"Limit","limit_explain":"An order to buy/sell at a specified price or better.","limit_explain2":"Ex: Current market price is $250/btc, I want to buy at $249 so I will place a limit order for $249. If the market reaches $249 my order will be executed.","market":"Market","market_explain":"An order in which a buy or sell order to be executed immediately at current market prices. As long as there are willing sellers and buyers, market orders are filled. Market orders are therefore used when certainty of execution is a priority over price of execution.","oco":"One Cancels Other (OCO)","oco_explain2":"Ex: The current price is $250, I want a stop loss at $245, in addition I want a limit order at $260. If the market reaches $245 your stop order will execute thus canceling your order at $260. If the market reaches $260 before $245 your limit order will execute thus canceling out your order at $245.","oco_explain3":"Note: If you manually cancel one of the OCO orders pair, you have to manually cancel the other one. An OCO order is only automatically cancelled if the other order is partially or fully executed.","post_only":"Post-only limit order","post_only_explain":"Post only limit orders are orders that ensure your order will be added to the order book and not match with a pre-existing order. If your order would cause a match with a pre-existing order, your post-only limit order will be canceled. This ensures that you will pay the maker fee and not the taker.","stop":"Stop","stop_explain":"An order to sell or close your position once the market reaches a certain price.","stop_explain2":"Ex: Current market price is $250/btc, if the price reaches $245 I want to sell my Bitcoin and stop my loss. If the market reaches $245 my order will be executed.","stop_explain3":"If shorting, you would set your stop at a price above the current price.","stop_explain4":"Ex: Current market price is $250/btc, if the price reaches $255, I want to close my short and stop my loss. If the market reaches $255 my order will be executed.","trailing_stop":"Trailing Stop","trailing_stop_explain":"A stop order that can be set to execute once the market goes against you by a defined price, called the price difference. Trailing\u2013stop sell orders are used to maximize and protect profit as a stock's price rises and limit losses when its price falls.","trailing_stop_explain2":"Ex: Current market price is $250 after a quick rise from $225, I can set a trailing stop with a $5 price difference. If the market reaches $245 my order will be executed.","trailing_stop_explain3":"However, if the price continues to rise to $275, for example, instead of reversing to $245, the order would then be executed at $270. The stop price trails behind the market price by the amount specified as price difference."},"settlement":"What is a settlement?","settlement_explain":"In your transaction history, you may see the word 'settlement'. Settlement is the process of correcting a negative balance. For example: let's say Bitfinex charges a trading fee of 0.1 BTC to user Bob. But user Bob only has dollars in his wallet, and no BTC. Bitfinex will then charge the BTC, and make a settlement, converting some  of user Bob\u2019s dollars balance to BTC. To make this conversion, the rate used is the last ask price (if we settle a negative BTC balance) or bid price (if we settle a negative USD balance). You will then see a debit in your settled balance, and a credit to the other balance.","sell_price":"Sell Price","buy_price":"Buy Price"}}},"errors":{"format":"%{attribute}

The right to use the Site and the Services is a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable, limited licence, and it is subject to the limitations and obligations in these Terms of Service. Nothing in these Terms of Service gives you any licence (other than as set out in this paragraph), right, title, or ownership of, in, or to the Site or any of the Services.","item3a":"Trading & Other Activities: The Site is a trading environment for the spot purchase and sale of Digital Tokens. The Site permits both unfinanced and financed transactions. Unfinanced purchases are fully funded by trading participants through funds deposited by you. For example, if you deposit $100.00 into your account on the Site, you may then purchase $100.00 worth of bitcoins in an unfinanced transaction. Purchases and sales of bitcoins on the Site, whether in an unfinanced transaction or a financed transaction, are settled by actual delivery of the full amount of the bitcoins or other Digital Tokens by the seller to the purchaser\u2019s account against payment in full by the purchaser to the seller\u2019s account.","item3a_b":"Important: Financing is not allowed where prohibited by applicable law. U.S. Persons may not engage in financing transactions on the Site.","item3b":"Financed transactions in Digital Tokens are permitted through the Site\u2019s platform-enabled, peer-to-peer financing functionality. Financing Providers may offer financing from and on their own account if they so choose. Financing Recipients may accept financing from Financing Providers for up to 70% of the value of a Digital Token purchase. For example, if you deposit $30.00 to the Site, you may then obtain financing in an amount not exceeding $70.00 in order to buy $100.00 worth of bitcoins in a financed transaction. In other words, you may accept financing equal to a maximum total bitcoins-to-equity ratio of 3 1/3 to 1.","item3c":"Shorting is another type of financed transaction permitted on the Site\u2019s platform. In a typical \u2018long sale\u2019 of bitcoin, the seller enters into a regular spot trade of bitcoin and settles the transaction by delivering bitcoin that the seller owns outright. In a \u2018short sale\u2019 of bitcoin, the seller also enters into a regular spot sale of bitcoin, except that the transaction is settled by delivering bitcoin that the seller has borrowed.","item3d":"Digital Tokens can be borrowed for purposes of short sales through the platform\u2019s peer-to-peer financing functionality. The bitcoin borrower may seek offers or make a bid to borrow Digital Tokens on the Financing Order Book. Bitcoin borrowers are not permitted to borrow more than 70% of the bitcoins sold in a short sale. The fiat proceeds of any short sale serve as collateral for the borrowing of the bitcoins until those bitcoins are repaid.","item3e":"Trading markets are volatile and shift quickly in terms of liquidity, market depth, and trading dynamics. You are solely responsible and liable: for any and all trading and non-trading activity on the Site and for your account on the Site; and, for knowing the true status of any position or contract with any other party on the Site, even if presented incorrectly by the Site at any time. You acknowledge and agree: to be fully responsible and liable for your trading and non-trading actions and inactions on the Site and all gains and losses sustained from your use of the Site and any of the Services; to be responsible for any negative balance in your account(s) on the Site; to be fully responsible and liable for all of your obligations with respect to any financing activities on the Site; and, to be fully responsible for safeguarding access to, and any information provided through, the Site and any of the Services, including, but not limited to, private keys, user names, passwords, and bank account details.","item3f":"There is no guarantee against losses on the Site. You may lose more than is in your various wallets on the Site if you engage in financing on the Site or if there is a force majeure event. When financing is used for trading, the margin loan carries risk if, among other things, the value of your bitcoins drops. If the value of your bitcoins drops below a certain level, you are responsible for responding to this market circumstance with cash or additional Digital Tokens satisfactory to Bitfinex. Failure to respond can result in the forced-liquidation of Digital Tokens in your account. Bitfinex cannot guarantee to stop losses even with the ability to force-liquidate any of your positions (due to, for example, market volatility and liquidity). Bitfinex will not be and is not responsible for any Financing Provider losing funds or Digital Tokens to any Financing Recipient on the Site or for any losses incurred by a Financing Recipient or any other party on the Site.","item3g_html":"Bitfinex allows trading participants to use third party peer-to-peer financing from other participants on the platform to trade Digital Tokens. Financing Recipients may obtain financing in one of two general ways: they may place bids for financing on the Site\u2019s separate, peer-to-peer financing order book (the <strong>\"Financing Order Book\"</strong>); or, they may elect to be automatically matched through the Site\u2019s order matching engine with one or more Financing Providers on the Financing Order Book at the best prevailing price on the Financing Order Book. Although Bitfinex is not a party to these financing contracts, Bitfinex enforces the contracts established between Financing Providers and Financing Recipients on the Financing Order Book.","item3h_html":"The Financing Order Book operates independent of the spot contract trading order book (the <strong>\"Trading Order Book\"</strong>). Once the desired financing is secured by a Financing Recipient, both financed and unfinanced transactions on the Trading Order Book are indistinguishable from each other to the trade matching engine.","item3j":"The amount of the financing, the terms of the financing, and the interest rate are all commercial terms negotiated through the Financing Order Book between Financing Providers and Financing Recipients. For instance, assume that A has $30.00 (in dollars) in her account on the Site. A obtains $70.00 in financing at X interest rate for Y term on the Financing Order Book (thereby becoming a Financing Recipient) from B, a Financing Provider. With that aggregate amount of $100.00, A may purchase $100.00 in bitcoins on the Trading Order Book from C, or from one or more other sellers. A has the right to repay the financing (including any accrued interest) at any time without pre-payment or other penalty. Obtaining financing does not create any obligation to purchase bitcoins on the Trading Order Book. A may also replace financing from B at any time with more favorable financing.","item3k":"In the above example, the bitcoins purchased by A (for $100.00) are subject to a Lien in favor of B up to the total amount of financing secured from B ($70.00 plus any interest component). A may remove any amount of bitcoins from the Site that is not subject to the Lien. If the Financing Recipient\u2019s equity falls to or below 15%\u2014calculated as the quotient (expressed as a percentage) obtained by dividing (a) the excess of (i) the market value of the purchased bitcoins over (ii) the total principal amount (plus accrued and unpaid interest) relating to all financing outstanding by (b) the market value used in (a)(i), above\u2014Bitfinex will force the liquidation of the bitcoins in A\u2019s account without notice to A, return financing to the Financing Provider, with accrued interest, and return the balance to the Financing Recipient. Bitfinex does not make margin calls. For example, if the purchased bitcoins\u2019 value falls from $100.00 to $82.35, the difference between that value and the financing obtained by A would be $82.35 \u2013 $70.00, or $12.35. Taken as a percentage of the bitcoins\u2019 value, $12.35 \u2215 $82.35 equals 15%. In other words, if the value of the bitcoins fell to $82.35 in aggregate, A\u2019s bitcoins would be liquidated by Bitfinex on the Trading Order Book, B would be repaid, and any remaining difference ($12.35, exclusive of interest) would be A\u2019s to retain.","item3l":"By contrast, if the market value of bitcoins rises, A may sell her bitcoins and repay the loan. For example, assume the value of A\u2019s bitcoins rises to $115.00. Now the difference between the bitcoins\u2019 value and the financing is $115.00 \u2013 $70.00, or $45.00. Taken as a percentage of the value of the bitcoins, $45.00 \u2215 $115.00 equals approximately 39%. Accordingly, A could remove part of her equity, but may not fall below her initial equity requirement. A could also sell the bitcoins on the Trading Order Book, repay the financing to B (plus any interest), and retain the balance on the transaction.","item3m":"Alternatively, A could satisfy the Lien and unencumber the bitcoins by repaying the financing used to purchase the bitcoins. Unencumbering the bitcoins simply refers to the process of using some combination of unrealized gain or additionally deposited funds, or both, for the purposes of paying off the financing and removing the Lien. In the above example, A could deploy the unrealized gain of $15.00 to partially unencumber the bitcoins owned by her, thereby reducing the financed amount outstanding to B.","item3n":"You can use the trading features of the Trading Order Book through your \u2018Exchange Wallet.\u2019 You may access the Funding Order Book through your \u2018Trading Wallet.\u2019 Finally, you may deposit funds to Bitfinex using your \u2018Deposit Wallet.\u2019","item4_html":"Agency: Bitfinex does not act as principal, counterparty, or market-maker in the transactions effected through trading on Bitfinex or in providing financing for financed trading on Bitfinex. However, Bitfinex administers and enforces contracts among parties engaged in financing activities on the Site.

This risk disclosure statement cannot and does not disclose all risks and other aspects involved in holding, trading, or engaging in financing or financed transactions in Digital Tokens. Risks include, but are not limited to, the following:","item1":"Market Risk: The market for Digital Tokens is still new and uncertain. No-one should have funds invested in Digital Tokens or speculate in Digital Tokens that she is not prepared to lose entirely. Whether the market for one or more Digital Tokens will move up or down, or whether a particular Ditigal Token will lose all or substantially all of its value, is unknown. This applies both to traders that are going long and to traders that are shorting the market. Participants should be cautious about holding Digital Tokens.","item2":"Liquidity Risk: Markets for Digital Tokens have varying degrees of liquidity. Some are quite liquid while others may be thinner. Thin markets can amplify volatility. There is never a guarantee that there will be an active market for one to sell, buy, or trade Digital Tokens or products derived from or ancillary to them.","item3":"Legal Risk: The legal status of certain Digital Tokens may be uncertain. This can mean that the legality of holding or trading them is not always clear. Whether and how one or more Digital Tokens constitute property, or assets, or rights of any kind may also seem unclear. Participants are responsible for knowing and understanding how Digital Tokens will be addressed, regulated, and taxed under applicable law.","item4":"Exchange Risk (Counterparty Risk): Having Digital Tokens on deposit or with any third party in a custodial relationship has attendant risks. These risks include security breaches, risk of contractual breach, and risk of loss. Participants should be wary of allowing third parties to hold their property for any reason.","item5":"Trading Risk: In addition to liquidity risks, values in any digital token marketplace are volatile and can shift quickly. Participants in any Digital Tokens market are warned that they should pay close attention to their position and holdings, and how they may be impacted by sudden and adverse shifts in trading and other market activities.","item6":"Risks Associated with Financing Activities: When you finance a purchase or sale of Digital Tokens on a peer-to-peer basis, you run the risk of losing your provided financing. Similarly, when you accept financing to enter a trading agreement, you accept the risk of not being able to repay that financing (e.g., if the market price of the Digital Token you purchased with the financing falls). Participants should know all of the terms of any contracts they enter and how their trading strategies and other market and risk factors can affect their financing obligations."},"antispam":{"title":"Anti-Spam Policy","notice1":"Your approval is needed","notice2":"Please take a look at our anti-spam policy and consent to receive email from Bitfinex if you agree.","item1":"International anti-spam legislation and best practices in the industry require informed, opt-in consent to receiving commercial electronic messages; a meaningful unsubscribe option for recipients; and, proper identification of message senders.","item2":"Bitfinex needs your consent to communicate with you electronically to establish and maintain a responsible commercial relationship with you; to understand your needs and your eligibility for products and services; to recommend particular products, services, and opportunities to you; to inform you about trading and financing features; to provide information to you about developments and new products, including changes and enhancements to the Site; to develop, enhance, and market products and services, and provide products and services to you; to process billing and collection of any fees; to conduct surveys and get feedback from you; to deliver products and services to you; to provide you with news and other matters of general interest to you as a customer; and, to meet Bitfinex\u2019s legal and regulatory requirements.","item3":"To allow Bitfinex to freely communicate with you and to provide you with relevant information and the best customer service, please provide Bitfinex with your consent by clicking through the form below.","item4":"If you want to receive electronic messages, including commercial electronic messages, from iFinex Inc. and from BFXNA Inc., as may be, please select Yes, I consent below and click Submit.

The Site permits both unfinanced and financed transactions. Unfinanced purchases are fully funded by trading participants through funds deposited by the participants on the Site. For example, if a trader deposits $100.00 into her account on the Site, she may then purchase $100.00 worth of bitcoins in an unfinanced transaction. Purchases and sales of bitcoins on the Site, whether in an unfinanced transaction or a financed transaction, are settled by actual delivery of the full amount of the bitcoins or other Digital Tokens by the seller to the purchaser\u2019s account against payment in full by the purchaser to the seller\u2019s account.","p2":"Financed transactions in Digital Tokens are permitted through the Site\u2019s platform-enabled, peer-to-peer financing functionality. Financing Providers may offer financing from and on their own account if they so choose. Financing Recipients may accept financing from Financing Providers for up to 70% of the value of a Digital Token purchase. For example, if a trader deposits $30.00 to the Site, she may then obtain financing in an amount not exceeding $70.00 in order to buy $100.00 worth of bitcoins in a financed transaction. In other words, she may accept financing equal to a maximum total bitcoins-to-equity ratio of 3 1/3 to 1.","p3":"Shorting is another type of financed transaction permitted on the Site\u2019s platform. In a typical \u201clong sale\u201d of bitcoin, the seller enters into a regular spot trade of bitcoin and settles the transaction by delivering bitcoin that she owns outright. In a \u201cshort sale\u201d of bitcoin, the seller also enters into a regular spot sale of bitcoin except that the transaction is settled by delivering bitcoin that she has borrowed.","p4":"Digital Tokens can be borrowed for purposes of short sales through the platform\u2019s peer-to-peer financing functionality. The bitcoin borrower may seek offers or make a bid to borrow Digital Tokens on the Financing Order Book. Bitcoin borrowers are not permitted to borrow more than 70% of the bitcoins sold in a short sale. The fiat proceeds of any short sale serve as collateral for the borrowing of the bitcoins until those bitcoins are repaid.","h2":"Peer-to-Peer Financing","p5":"Bitfinex allows trading participants to use third party peer-to-peer financing from other participants on the platform to trade Digital Tokens. Financing Recipients may obtain financing in one of two general ways: they may place bids for financing on the Financing Order Book; or, they may elect to be automatically matched through the Site\u2019s order matching engine with one or more Financing Providers on the Financing Order Book at the best prevailing price on the Financing Order Book. Although Bitfinex is not a party to these financing contracts, Bitfinex enforces the contracts established between Financing Providers and Financing Recipients on the Financing Order Book.","p6":"The Financing Order Book operates independent of the Trading Order Book. Once the desired financing is secured by a Financing Recipient, both financed and unfinanced transactions on the Trading Order Book are indistinguishable from each other to the trade matching engine.","p7":"The amount of the financing, the term of the financing, and the interest rate are all commercial terms negotiated through the Financing Order Book between Financing Providers and Financing Recipients. For instance, assume that A has $30.00 (in dollars) in her account on the Site. A obtains $70.00 in financing at X interest rate for Y term on the Financing Order Book (thereby becoming a Financing Recipient) from B, a Financing Provider. With that aggregate amount of $100.00, A may purchase $100.00 in bitcoins on the Trading Order Book from C, or from one or more other sellers. A has the right to repay the financing (including any accrued interest) at any time without pre-payment or other penalty. Obtaining financing does not create any obligation to purchase bitcoins on the Trading Order Book. A may also replace financing from B at any time with more favorable financing.","p8":"In the above example, the bitcoins purchased by A ($100.00) are subject to a Lien in favor of B up to the total amount of financing secured from B ($70.00 plus any interest component). A may remove any amount of bitcoins from the Site that is not subject to the Lien. If the Financing Recipient\u2019s equity falls to or below 15%\u2014calculated as the quotient (expressed as a percentage) obtained by dividing (a) the excess of (i) the market value of the purchased bitcoins over (ii) the total principal amount (plus accrued and unpaid interest) relating to all financing outstanding by (b) the market value used in (a)(i), above\u2014Bitfinex will force the liquidation of the bitcoins in A\u2019s account without notice to A, return financing to the Financing Provider, with accrued interest, and return the balance to the Financing Recipient. Bitfinex does not make margin calls. For example, if the purchased bitcoins\u2019 value falls from $100.00 to $82.35, the difference between that value and the financing obtained by A would be $82.35 \u2013 $70.00, or $12.35. Taken as a percentage of the bitcoins\u2019 value, $12.35 \u2215 $82.35 equals 15%. In other words, if the value of the bitcoins fell to $82.35 in aggregate, A\u2019s bitcoins would be liquidated by Bitfinex on the Trading Order Book, B would be repaid, and any remaining difference ($12.35, exclusive of interest) would be A\u2019s to retain.","p9":"As set out in the %{link:Terms of Service}, you grant Bitfinex agency to implement, levy, monitor, and maintain any and all Liens in favor of Financing Providers and to force-liquidate any Digital Tokens in your name or control on the Site if necessary to ensure that any Financing Provider on the Site from whom you have obtained financing is repaid in full. As set out in the Terms of Service, trading markets in digital tokens can shift quickly. Price movements can be unexpected. There is no guarantee against losses on the Site. You may lose more than is in your various wallets on the Site if you engage in financing on the Site. You are responsible for any trading and non-trading activity on your Bitfinex account, but Bitfinex must at all times retain the ability to protect Financing Providers by force-liquidating your account, as and when necessary. Bitfinex cannot guarantee to stop losses even with the ability to force-liquidate any of your positions (due to, for example, market volatility and liquidity). Bitfinex will not be and is not responsible for any Financing Provider losing funds or Digital Tokens to any Financing Recipient on Bitfinex.","p10":"If the market value of bitcoins rises, A may sell her bitcoins and repay the loan. For example, assume the value of A\u2019s bitcoins rises to $115.00. Now the difference between the bitcoins\u2019 value and the financing is $115.00 \u2013 $70.00, or $45.00. Taken as a percentage of the value of the bitcoins, $45.00 \u2215 $115.00 equals approximately 39%. Accordingly, A could remove part of her equity, but may not fall below her initial equity requirement. A could also sell the bitcoins on the Trading Order Book, repay the financing to B (plus any interest), and retain the balance on the transaction.","p11":"Alternatively, A could satisfy the Lien and unencumber the bitcoins by repaying the financing used to purchase the bitcoins. Unencumbering the bitcoins simply refers to the process of using some combination of unrealized gain or additionally deposited funds, or both, for the purposes of paying off the financing and removing the Lien. In the above example, A could deploy the unrealized gain of $15.00 to partially unencumber the bitcoins owned by her, thereby reducing the financed amount outstanding to B.","p12":"You can use the trading features of the Trading Order Book through your \"Trading Wallet.\" You may access the Funding Order Book through your \"Deposit Wallet.\""},"privacy":{"title":"Bitfinex Privacy Policy","explain":"The objective of this Privacy Policy is to set out in an accountable and transparent way the manner in which Bitfinex collects and uses your Personal Information.","item1_html":"Collecting Personal Information: If you wish to transact on and use the Site, Bitfinex will collect information about you, including Personal Information.

      <li><span class="label">2.</span>Consent: Consent is required for the collection of Personal Information and the subsequent use or disclosure of Personal Information. The form of consent may vary, depending upon the circumstances and the type of Personal Information obtained. In the case of Bitfinex, your agreement with the Terms of Service constitutes your consent to the collection and use of Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy.

      <li>
        <span class="label">3.</span>
        Using Personal Information: Bitfinex is committed to protecting your privacy.

Under those circumstances, the governments, courts, law enforcement, or regulatory agencies of that country or those countries may be able to obtain access to your Personal Information through foreign laws.
