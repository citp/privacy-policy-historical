This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing UK clothing store ads to someone in the UK, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing investing ads to someone who frequents investment sites).

This cookie is used to serve ads specific to you and your interests ("interest based targeting"). The ads served will be targeted based on your previous browsing history (For example, if you have been viewing sites about visiting New York, you may see New York hotel advertisements when viewing a non-related site, such as on a site about Tennis).

It does NOT track personal information about you, such as your name, email address, physical address, telephone number, social security numbers, bank account numbers or credit card numbers.

This could include the inability to login to services or programs, such as logging into forums or accounts.

Deleting cookies does not mean you are permanently opted out of any advertising program. Unless you have settings that disallows cookies, the next time you visit a site running the advertisements, a new cookie will be added.
