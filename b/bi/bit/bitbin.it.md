# BitBin

This Privacy Policy governs the manner in which BitBin collects, uses, maintains and discloses information collected from users (each, a "User") of the [http://www.bitbin.it](http://www.bitbin.it/) website ("Site"). This privacy policy applies to the Site and all products and services offered by BitBin.

**Collected information**

BitBin collects and processes various types of information in order to operate the site. The information includes:

**IP address**. An anonymized version of your IP address is saved when viewing pages and posting information on BitBin. This is done to count paste hits accurately, and to help detect fraudulent activity such as automated traffic or spam.   
**Username and password**. If you register to this site, your username and a cryptographic hash of your password will be stored to securely identify and authenticate you.   
**Paste text**. Any paste text you upload will be stored until the paste is deleted. Paste text is stored and displayed in clear text by default: you can use BitBin's client-side encryption to encrypt your paste if you wish to. In this case, BitBin only stores and serves an encrypted copy of the paste text.   
**User data**. If you have registered as an user, BitBin stores other data such as records of cryptocurrency transactions, whether your favorites are public, and other data you have changed or created during your activities on the site. This information is preserved until the deletion of your user account, at which point they may be deleted or stripped of personally identifying data.   
**Cookies**. BitBin uses web cookies to allow you to login and use the features available to logged in users.   
**Browser information**. Non-identifying browser information, such as the web browser name and version. If BitBin fails to fulfill a request due to a technical issue, BitBin will collect such data related to the request in order to help discover and fix the issue.

Data stored by BitBin is NOT shared with third-parties. Copies of data hosted outside BitBin's server(s) are transferred and stored in an encrypted format, with only BitBin having access to the unencrypted, original data.

**How we protect your information**

We adopt appropriate data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure or destruction of your personal information, username, password, transaction information and data stored on our Site.

**Sharing your personal information**

We do not sell, trade, or rent Users personal identification information to others. We may share generic aggregated demographic information not linked to any personal identification information regarding visitors and users with our business partners, trusted affiliates and advertisers for the purposes outlined above.

**Third party websites**

Users may find advertising or other content on our Site that link to the sites and services of our partners, suppliers, advertisers, sponsors, licensors and other third parties. We do not control the content or links that appear on these sites and are not responsible for the practices employed by websites linked to or from our Site. In addition, these sites or services, including their content and links, may be constantly changing. These sites and services may have their own privacy policies and customer service policies. Browsing and interaction on any other website, including websites which have a link to our Site, is subject to that website's own terms and policies.

**Changes to this privacy policy**

BitBin has the discretion to update this privacy policy at any time. When we do, we will revise the updated date at the bottom of this page. We encourage Users to frequently check this page for any changes to stay informed about how we are helping to protect the personal information we collect.
