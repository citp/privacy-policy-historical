This Privacy Policy applies to your use of the Bitcoin website (the “Site”) owned by the Bitcoin Foundation, Inc., a non-profit corporation (the “Foundation,” “we,” or “us”).

The Foundation is committed to maintaining the confidentiality and security of your personal information, and has enacted this Privacy Policy to inform you of the steps we take to ensure the security of your data. This policy describes the types of information we collect when you use the Site, how we use and protect that information, how long we retain it, and with whom we share it. It also explains what your rights and options are as they pertain to privacy. By using the Site, you consent to our collection and use of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.

1\. Information We Collect. When you register on the Site, we collect the following types of information:

You voluntarily provide this information to us when you when you complete a form on our Site or become a member. We ask you to provide us with the following elements of Personal Information: (i) Name; and (ii) Email address. If you become a member, we may ask you for your Bitcoin address or other information required for payment of membership dues. We will also record your computer IP address, and may tie it to your specific account. Under ordinary circumstances, an IP address recorded in isolation is not Personal Information under the standard definition of the term. However, it may become Personal Information when it is combined with other information, as in this case. We may also collect any personal information you elect to provide when submitting posts or other content to our forum or message boards.

(i) Why do we collect Personal Information? We use the Personal Information we collect from and about you to contact you and provide you with the information you have requested. We also use Personal Information to send you informational and promotional email messages. You may stop receiving promotional emails from us by clicking the unsubscribe link at the bottom of the email.

(c) In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these business transfers, customer information, including Personal Information, is typically one of the business assets that are transferred. In addition, if all of our business assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that we go out of business or enter into bankruptcy, customer information (including your Personal Information), would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party.
