<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="maintext">
<sup>Updated August 22, 2004</sup><br><br>
Bitberry Software is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy statement explains data 
collection and use practices of the BitZipper website. By accessing www.bitberry.com or 
www.bitzipper.com (the "Sites"), you are consenting to the information collection and use 
practices described in this privacy statement.
</p>
<br>


<h3>Collection of personal information</h3>
<p class="maintext">We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you, e.g.  
when subscribing to our e-mail newsletter, or when purchasing, downloading and/or registering Bitberry 
Software products. The personal information we collect may include your name, company or organization 
name, e-mail, phone, work or home address, and credit card information.</p>

<p class="maintext">The Sites may collect certain information about your visit, such as the IP address 
through which you access the Internet; the date and time you access the Sites; the pages that you 
access while at the Sites and the IP address of the web site from which you linked directly to our 
site. This information is used to help improve the Sites, analyze trends, and administer the Sites.</p>
<br>


<h3>Collection of non-personal information</h3>
<p class="maintext">The Sites track user traffic patterns from standard web server log files. We store 
statistics about domain names, browser types and IP addresses. We also track search terms that are entered 
into search engines, but this information is not associated with individual users or IP addresses.</p>

<p class="maintext">If you click a link inside BitZipper or the BitZipper help file, e.g. "Check for updates" 
or "Buy Now", you will be taken to the bitzipper.com web site. Information about the language used in 
BitZipper, the current day of your trial and information about which button you clicked will be sent 
to our web server. No personal information is sent, and the information is only used for statistical
purposes and to help improve our marketing screens within BitZipper.
</p>
<br>

<h3>Use of personal information</h3>
<p class="maintext">The personal information collected on the Sites will be used to operate the Sites 
and to provide the service(s) or carry out the transaction(s) you have requested or authorized.</p>

<p class="maintext">We may use your personal information to provide you with important information about 
the product(s) that you are using, including critical updates and notifications.</p>

<p class="maintext">When you sign up for our newsletter, we may use customized links or similar 
technologies to track e-mail links that you click. We may associate that information with your personal 
information in order to provide you more focused e-mail communications or purchase information. </p>

<p class="maintext">If Bitberry Software is acquired, our user information will be included among the 
assets transferred to the buyer in the sale. There also may be occasions on which Bitberry Software is 
required to provide information by order of a court or when the law requires that user information be 
treated as a transferable asset, as in bankruptcy.</p> 
<br>


<h3>Control of personal information</h3>
<p class="maintext">Except as otherwise described in this statement, personal information you provide on 
the Sites will not be shared outside of Bitberry Software and affiliates without your permission.</p>
<br>


<h3>Security of personal information</h3>
<p class="maintext">Bitberry Software is committed to protecting the security of your personal 
information. However, we cannot guarantee that the information you provide to us is completely safe, 
although we are careful to try to prevent problems. There may be technical problems beyond our control 
that may make it accessible to unauthorized persons.</p>

<p class="maintext">When sensitive personal information such as a credit card number is transmitted
over the Internet, we protect it through the use of encryption via the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) 
protocol. Credit card numbers are NOT stored on our servers, but are only transferred to the payment 
processor using a secure connection during the actual purchase. After your purchase we do NOT have your 
credit card number anymore.</p>
<br>


<h3>Use of Cookies</h3>
<p class="maintext">Cookies are small text files that most web sites, including ours, place on your computer. 
Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely 
assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
</p>

<p class="maintext">
We use cookies on the Sites to store information about the site you visited us through and when you visited
our Sites. This information is e.g. used to ensure that our affiliates are paid a commission for each sale that 
originates from their sites. For example, if you click a link to BitZipper.com at www.somesite.com, 
we may record that you visited us through that site. If you decide to order BitZipper later, we can use 
the cookie on your computer to recall the name of the site you visited us through.</p>
<br>


<h3>Enforcement of this Privacy Statement</h3>
<p class="maintext">If you have questions regarding this statement, you should contact us at 
support@bitberry.com</p>
