					<p><b>Our Commitment To Privacy</b> <br>
					Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy
					we provide this notice explaining our online information practices
					and the choices you can make about the way your information is
					collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make
					it available on our homepage and at every point where personally
					identifiable information may be requested.</p>
					<p><b>The Information We Collect:</b> <br>
					This notice applies to all information collected or submitted
					on the BicycleLINK website. On some pages, you can order products,
					make requests, and register to receive materials. The types of
					personal information collected at these pages are: </p>
					<p>Name: <br>
					Addresses: <br>
					Email address: <br>
					Phone numbers: <br>
					Product Information (i.e. Bike Information):<br>
					Credit/Debit Card Information: </p>
					<p><b>The Way We Use Information:</b> <br>
					We use the information you provide about yourself when placing
					an order only to complete that order. We do not share this information
					with outside parties except with Authorities at Police Department
					when a Bicycle gets recovered by that specific Police Department
					so that the Bicycle can be return to its owner.</p>
					<p>We use the information you provide about someone else when placing
					an order only to ship the product and to confirm delivery. We
					do not share this information with outside parties except to the
					extent necessary to complete that order. </p>
					<p>We offer gift-cards by which you can personalize a product you
					order for another person. Information you provide to us to create
					a gift-card is only used for that purpose, and it is only disclosed
					to the person receiving the gift. </p>
					<p>We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive.
					Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not
					shared with outside parties. </p>
					<p>You can register with our website if you would like to receive
					our catalog as well as updates on our new products and services.
					Information you submit on our website will not be used for this
					purpose unless you fill out the registration form.</p>
					<p>We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design
					our website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may
					tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain
					area on our website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women
					filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose anything
					that could be used to identify those individuals. </p>
					<p>Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information
					provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described
					above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or
					otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses. </p>
					<p><b>Our Commitment To Data Security</b> <br>
					To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure
					the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate
					physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and
					secure the information we collect online. </p>
					<p><b>Our Commitment To Children's Privacy:</b> <br>
					Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important.
					For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our
					website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part
					of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13. </p>
					<p><b>How You Can Access Or Correct Your Information</b> <br>
					You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable
					information by e-mail by sending us a request that credibly shows
					error. To protect your privacy and security, we will also take
					reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access
					or making corrections. </p>
					<p><b>How To Contact Us</b> <br>
					Should you have other questions or concerns about these privacy
					policies, please call us toll free at 1-800-848-BIKE or send us
					an email at <a href="mailto:info@bicyclelink.com">info@bicyclelink.com</a>.</p></td>
