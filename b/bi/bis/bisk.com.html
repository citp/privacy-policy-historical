<h2>YOUR PRIVACY</h2>
<p>We are committed to protecting your privacy.

<h2>What information do we collect and when do we collect it?</h2>
<p>When you visit our site, we may directly and through third-party service providers automatically log certain information about your visit including: the pages you visit while on our site; the address of a referring website, if any; the type of browser, device or hardware you are using; your IP address and general geographic information; and the date and time you accessed our site. Through use of third-party tools, we may also collection certain demographic information and information about interests from a portion of the visitors to our site.</p>
<p>Also, in certain areas of our website — such as when you place an order, request more information, download demo products, fill out a survey or enter a contest — you are required to enter personal contact information (name, mailing address, email address, phone number) that allows us to contact you and also financial information (credit card information) that allows us to process your order or contact you for future promotions. Should you abandon a form on our website, your information may still be collected and utilized for notices or communications pertaining to the site, products or services. If you choose not to provide personal information, you can still browse most of our website (the areas that do not require registration) anonymously. If you place a call to us, whether by landline or mobile device, we may also capture your phone number and any other information you provide during the call. This information may also be used to communicate with you about the site, products or services.</p>
<h2>Why do we collect the information?</h2>
<p>We collect information to process and fulfill your order, to notify you of your order status, to alert you to product upgrades, special offers, updated information and new services, and to help us understand our customers in order to create content and a web environment that is most relevant to you. We also use information, including information that is automatically collected, to understand more about our site visitors, to determine how users navigate our site, to improve site performance, to protect the security and integrity of our site and business, to identify and protect our systems from fraudulent activity and access, to provide advertising that may be of interest to our visitors, and to monitor legal compliance.</p>

Part 310) and the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (47 U.S.C. § 227 and 64 C.F.R. § 64.1200), by entering data you are providing your prior express written consent to be contacted at the number you provided (whether it is a landline or wireless number) by telephone, including by predictive dialer, manual dialing and/or by the use of prerecorded messages, with commercial offers from Bisk Education, University Alliance or the subsidiary, division or entity specified on the lead form.</p>
<h2>What about “cookies”?</h2>
<p>To provide better service and a more effective website, we sometimes use first-party and third-party “cookies” as part of our interaction with your browser. A “cookie” is a small text file placed on your computer’s hard drive by our web page server. “Cookies” are commonly used on websites and do not harm your system. By configuring your preferences or options in your browser, you determine if and how a “cookie” will be accepted. We use “cookies” to determine if you have previously visited our website and for a number of administrative purposes. These “cookies” do not collect personally identifiable information, and we do not combine information collected through “cookies” with other personal information to determine who you are or your email address.</p>
<p>We may use third party advertising companies to serve ads on our site. These companies may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs or web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness. Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and action tags is completely anonymous.</p>
<h2>How does Bisk Education protect customer information?</h2>
<p>We use industry-standard technologies when transferring and receiving consumer data to help ensure its security. Our sites have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Our servers are backed up regularly and protected by security systems.</p>
<p>Financial transactions are carried out using a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) that encrypts the data you provide to ensure privacy. We will notify you when you are using a page that is protected with SSL technology.</p>
<p>While we use industry-standard technologies and measures to protect any data you provide to us, nothing can completely guarantee the security of transmission of data or information over the Internet. Therefore, we cannot guarantee against the loss, misuse or alteration of data or personal information that you provide to us, and we are not responsible and disclaim any liability for any damages or injuries which arise from such loss, misuse or alteration. You provide data and information to us at your own risk.</p>
<h2>Will Bisk Education disclose the information it collects to outside parties?</h2>
<p>The contact information we collect, including through our websites, email communications with you or when you place a call to us, is used to improve the content of our website and to contact customers for marketing purposes. For example, based on the information you provide or that we collect, we may decide to inform you of existing Bisk products and services, including any of the programs that participate in the University Alliance Online, that we feel may be of interest to you. We may also use the collected information to help develop new products and services that we think customers may find helpful in the future. With the goal of bringing you greater convenience and more choices, we make portions of your contact information (never financial information) available to affiliated companies that offer products and services that you also may enjoy and/or benefit from using. We share information only for legitimate business purposes. For example, Bisk may share your personal information with companies who provide services such as information processing, extending credit, fulfilling customer orders, delivering products to you, managing and enhancing customer data, providing customer service, assessing your interest in our products and services, and conducting customer research or satisfaction surveys. In each case, we carefully review the company and the products and services offered to make sure that they provide value. If you do not wish to receive any or all such offers, please let us know by emailing us at any time at <a href="mailto:privacy@bisk.com">privacy@bisk.com</a>. If you don’t want to receive printed materials, please also provide us with your exact name and address and we will be sure your name is removed from the data we share with our business partners.</p>
<p>In order to comply with the Federal anti-spam laws effective January 1, 2004, we now provide a suppression list of the e-mail addresses of those who ask to be removed from our distribution database to third party advertisers who provide e-mail marketing services to our company. We require all third party marketers to sign an agreement prohibiting them from using this data for any purpose other than sending out our marketing materials. It may be necessary − by law, legal process, litigation, and/or requests from public and governmental authorities within or outside your country of residence − for Bisk to disclose your personal information. We may also disclose information about you if we determine that for purposes of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary or appropriate. We may also disclose information about you if we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our terms and conditions or protect our operations, employees or users.</p>
<h2>Keeping customer information up-to-date</h2>
<p>Keeping your account information accurate and up-to-date is very important. If you ever find that our records are incomplete, inaccurate or not current, please email at <a href="mailto:privacy@bisk.com">privacy@bisk.com</a> and we will correct the information as soon as possible.</p>

If you do not want to receive e-mail, telephone messages or direct mail from Bisk, contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@bisk.com">privacy@bisk.com</a> and we will remove your name from our in-house list and add you to our marketing suppression list. You will also have an opportunity to add your phone number to our internal "Do Not Call" list during each telemarketing call answered.

We will immediately investigate the matter, confirm that you have been removed, and provide a written response to you detailing our efforts.
