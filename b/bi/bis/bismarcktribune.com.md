The Bismarck Tribune collects information from its website users for in-house use. 

In many cases, this information is used for verification purposes -- for example, ensuring that a letter to the editor or other e-mail correspondence comes from a legitimate sender. 

In other cases, the information is used to validate form data sent in by users -- for example, wedding and engagement announcements. 

This information is also helpful when problems occur with incoming e-mail messages or online forms and the sender needs to be contacted to correct or recover lost data. 

We value and respect your privacy -- we do not lend or sell information collected from our website to third-party services.
