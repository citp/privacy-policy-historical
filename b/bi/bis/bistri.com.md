#### What this Privacy Policy covers

This Privacy Policy applies to all of the websites and services offered by Bistri. By visiting or using Bistri, you agree to this Privacy Policy.

This Privacy Policy does not apply to any websites, products or services that are not owned or operated by Bistri or to actions taken by Bistri users. For example, this Privacy Policy does not apply to third-party applications that are available through Bistri, or to any social networks or IM service providers that you associate with your Bistri account, all of which are governed by their own privacy policies.

#### Information that Bistri collects

_Personally identifiable information_

Personally identifiable information is information that can be used to determine your personal identity, such as your name or email address. When you create an account we ask for your name and email address. If you link your third-party instant messaging (IM) accounts to your Bistri account, we may also collect your user name for that account, which is also considered personally identifiable information.

_Optional profile data_

Bistri gives you the opportunity to update your public profile with information about yourself such as your photo, your hometown, your website and a short biography. This information is public as described under "What is public and what is private?"

_Information from the accounts you link to Bistri_

If you connect your Bistri account to your third-party IM accounts or your social network accounts (e.g., Facebook and Twitter), they may send us information about you, including your name, username at those services, Unique User ID ("UUID") for those services, friends list, status, profile information, age and gender.

Bistri may receive this information from you or from outside sources, such as websites where the Bistri Bar is present, ad networks and other providers, or we may make assumptions based on the other information that we collect.

_Log data_

When you use Bistri, we automatically collect information about you and your activity known as "log data", including your Internet Protocol (IP) address, your browser or device type, your interactions with other users. Bistri stores and uses this log data based on an anonymous identifier.

#### Bistri's communication platforms

Bistri offers users the ability to communicate with each other through IM, Voice and Video. Don't share personal information unless it's someone you know well in the real world.

When you create a Bistri account, your preferences are set to enable all Bistri users to send you an IM, but only people who you authorize can see if you are online. You can change those authorizations when you want.

Your preferences are also automatically set to store your IM history on Bistri's servers. You can view or delete your IM history by clicking on the IM history icon in your chat window. You can turn off the IM history feature in your Bistri Messenger account under "Preferences."

Keep in mind that even if you elect not to store your IM history, the person that you'recommunicating with may be storing your conversation, either on Bistri, on their IM network's servers or on their own computers. By using Bistri, you consent to the storage of your IM history on Bistri as the default option and to the storing of your IM history by other users with whom you are chatting or by the Third Party IM Service that you or your friend is using.

We use these cookies to provide you with a better Bistri experience, such as by recognizing you when you come to Bistri, by remembering if you are already signed-in and by remembering information about you, like your preferences. We also use cookies to generate aggregate and anonymous data so that we can better understand and analyze how users use Bistri.

Information that was already publicly shared, such as your comments or pages that you shared, and messages that you previously sent will still be visible in the various places that information is displayed.

Deleting your Bistri account does not currently automatically remove your personally identifiable information from the Bistri servers. However, if you delete your account, we will use your personally identifiable information only to investigate abuse and comply with legal requests as described under "Information usage and sharing".
