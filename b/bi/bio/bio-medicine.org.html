This would be practically quite difficult, and quite an unnecessary task to accomplish anyway. The only thing that Bio-Medicine is interested in is the overall statistics of its readership. Cumulative figures that provide a picture of visitor traffic to our site are vital in our efforts to attract advertisers--upon whose support the site depends--and to monitor how well our web server is keeping up with our ever-increasing readership. </p> <p>So what information does Bio-Medicine collect about its visitors? Each time someone visits the site, our web server logs a number of details--if they are available--including the IP address of the visitor's computer and/or Internet service provider, the domain name and country of origin of that computer, its operating system, and the type of web browser being used.</p> <p>In addition to the statistics that our own web server collects, the third-party advertising agencies that we work with may also collect certain information through the use of banner ads. </p> <p><strong>Third Party Advertising</strong></p> <p>We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site.

Such services typically hide all information about particular users from web sites, which log visits from the anonymizing service instead of the users' own computers. </p> <p>If you have any questions about our privacy policy, please contact the editor of Bio-Medicine, at <a href="mailto:info@bio-medicine.org">info@bio-medicine.org</a>.</p></div></div><div id="rightColumn"><div id="dixsw1"><div id="zaa10" class="y">(Date:6/27/2013)...
