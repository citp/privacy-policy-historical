## Cookies 

A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site. 

CompareNetworks, Inc. uses cookies to deliver a better and more personalized service. This cookie is set when you register. The cookie stores an encrypted key that allows the site to access information such as e-mail address, name, and address. Since it is encrypted the cookie itself stores no personal information. 

The use of cookies by our tracking utility company is not covered by our privacy policy. We do not have access to or control over these cookies. Our tracking utility company uses session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. 

Our third party tracking utility company employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that helps us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information. 

## IP Addresses 

CompareNetworks, Inc. collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, to report aggregate information to our advertisers and to audit the use of our site. When guests request pages from CompareNetworks, Inc. sites, our servers log the guests' IP addresses. We do not normally link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that a user's session will be logged, but the user remains anonymous to us. 

## Co-Branded Sites

Some pages may have the look and feel of being on one of the CompareNetworks sites, however the information collected on these pages may not be covered under our privacy policy. All information collected on these co-branded pages is owned and controlled by that company's privacy policy. 

At times we may enter into co-branded relationships. When we enter into these types of relationships we will share your name and e-mail address in order for our co-branded partner to fulfill the service you have requested.
