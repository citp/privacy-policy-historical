## Cookies

A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site. 

CompareNetworks uses cookies to deliver a better and more personalized service. The cookie stores an encrypted key that allows the site to access information such as e-mail address, name, and address. Since it is encrypted the cookie itself stores no personal information. 

The use of cookies by our tracking utility company is not covered by our privacy policy. We do not have access to or control over these cookies. Our tracking utility company uses session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. 

Our third party tracking utility company employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that helps us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. 

## IP Addresses

CompareNetworks collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, to report aggregate information to our advertisers and to audit the use of our site. When guests request pages from CompareNetworks sites, our servers and third party tracking utilities log guests' IP addresses. 

## Co-Branded Sites

Some pages may have the look and feel of being on one of the CompareNetworks sites, however the information collected on these pages may not be covered under our privacy policy. All information collected on these co-branded pages is owned and controlled by that company's privacy policy. 

At times we may enter into co-branded relationships. When we enter into these types of relationships we will share your name and e-mail address in order for our co-branded partner to fulfill the service you have requested. Our privacy policy does not apply to the information collected on these co-branded sites. You should read the privacy policy of our co-branded partner. 

## E-newsletters

CompareNetworks offers free electronic newsletters to users. CompareNetworks gathers the e-mail addresses of users who voluntarily subscribe. Users may remove themselves from this mailing list by clicking the unsubscribe link at the bottom of the email. Users can also subscribe to newsletters at the time of registration. CompareNetworks delivers newsletters, marketing and product offerings via e-mail to only registered recipients. The e-mail tracking system recognizes the URL that was clicked, and records some information about you and your computer, such as the e-mail address that you provided to us, the browser, operating system and IP address. 

## Blog/Forums

If you use a blog or forum on some of our sites, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these blogs and forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these blogs or forums. 

To request removal of your personal information from our blog, contact us at privacy@comparenetworks.com. 

In order to leave comments on some of our pages you can log in to our commenting system by using sign-in services such as Facebook and Twitter Connect. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information with us such as your name and e-mail address to pre-populate our sign up form. Services like Facebook Connect give you the option to post information about your activities on this Web site to your profile page to share with others within your network. You also have the option to share your transactions with your friends. If you wish to stop sharing your transactions, you may do so by logging into your account center on these sites and updating your profile. Any information shared on those sites is governed by the privacy policies of those sites, and not this CompareNetworks Privacy Policy. 

## User Reviews/Comments/Testimonials

We do obtain the customer's consent via e-mail prior to posting the comment or testimonial to post their name along with their comment or testimonial. If you wish to update or delete your testimonial, you can contact us at privacy@comparenetworks.com. 

## Tell-A-Friend

We will automatically send your friend a one-time e-mail inviting him or her to visit the page you recommended. CompareNetworks stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time e-mail and tracking the success of our referral program. 

Your friend may contact us at privacy@comparenetworks.com to request that we remove this information from our database. 

## Protecting Your Personal Information

Your personal information can be password protected. Users should take appropriate measures to protect the secrecy of their password. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personally identifiable information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

## Sharing with Third Parties

CompareNetworks may disclose user information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or if CompareNetworks believes that disclosure is necessary to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, the law or with legal process served on CompareNetworks Web site or protect and defend the rights or property of CompareNetworks or to act in an emergency to protect someone's safety. We use other third parties such as a web-hosting platform who hosts the article comment sections of our sites. When you sign up for our site we will share your name, e-mail address and name as necessary for the third party to provide that service. 

CompareNetworks may share aggregate data about our users with business partners, advertisers or sponsors. Our motivation in doing so is to deliver better content and services to our users. CompareNetworks may carefully select third parties to send users information regarding their products or services unless the user has opted-out as described above. 

## Contests and Sweepstakes

CompareNetworks offers contests and sweepstakes in which we request certain personal information. At a minimum, the required information includes name and e-mail address; in some cases, the user must answer mandatory survey questions about a range of other personal data. The information gathered in this manner is used to verify the entrant's identity, to send the entrant an e-mail notification that their entry has been received, and to contact winners and/or prize recipients. CompareNetworks may divulge this information to a third party, provided the user gives express consent. Conditions which CompareNetworks will disclose this information are when a user may expressly choose to receive additional information from the contest sponsor, in which case the user's personally identifiable information is divulged to the advertiser. All information about each contest is clearly posted during the event. All contests and sweepstakes are conducted in full accordance with laws of the United States of America.
