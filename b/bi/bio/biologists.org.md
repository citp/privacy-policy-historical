We will only use your personal information for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we may legitimately use it for a related reason which is compatible with the original purpose.

### 3\. Sharing your information

We may disclose your personal data in the manner and to the recipients described above. We may share your personal information with your consent or as necessary with selected third party service providers that support us in the performance of our activities, including those set out above, or where we have another legitimate interest in doing so that is not overridden by your interests and fundamental rights. For example, to investigate a complaint, to protect our customers or to operate and maintain the security of our computer systems.  
We may also need to share your personal information with a regulator or otherwise to comply with the law.  
We require all our third party service providers to take appropriate security measures to protect your personal information in line with our policies. We do not allow our third party service providers to use your personal information for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal information for specified purposes in accordance with our instructions.

### 4\. Length of storage for your information

We will only retain your personal information for as long as is necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting or reporting obligations. For example, we may need to retain some of your personal information for legal reasons, for a period of 7 years after you have made a purchase from us. Longer retention periods may apply to archives of published scientific papers or in relation to intellectual property rights where a transfer or permission could continue to be valid for many years.  
We may also store your personal information for as long as necessary to complete any purchase or transaction enquiry with you. Where a transaction is aborted, we will normally store relevant information for at least one year following the last recorded interaction between the parties involved (unless a longer retention period applies in line with our document retention practices).  
In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal information so that it can no longer be associated with you, in which case we may use such information without further obligation to you.
