## Assembly Bill 21 Disclosure

The California State Legislature passed Assembly Bill 21 last year which requires all colleges and universities to communicate information about immigration enforcement policies to all faculty, staff, and students, every semester, as well as have this information available online for all faculty, staff, and students. In light of this bill, there are disclosures Biola University is required to communicate to our community every semester pertaining to the protection of personal information and the University’s approach to responding to immigration authorities. The points are provided below to help you better understand the legal protections and the protocols Biola will be following. 

  1. Our university will NOT be disclosing personal information concerning our students, our faculty or staff to immigration officials, without the consent of the person identified, or, if the person is under 18 years of age, without the explicit consent of the parent or guardian of the person identified; except: (a) as may legally be disclosed under state and federal privacy laws; (b) for the programmatic purpose for which the information was obtained; (c) as part of a directory that does not include residence addresses or individual persons’ course schedules and that the person has not elected to opt out of; or (d) in response to a judicial warrant, court order, or subpoena.
  2. If there is reason to believe that a student, faculty, or staff member has been taken into custody as a result of an immigration enforcement action, as soon as possible following verification that this has, in fact, occurred, the university will notify the person’s emergency contact. 
  3. If a member of our Biola community is advised that an immigration officer is expected to enter, or has entered our campus to carry out a federal immigration order, Campus Safety should be notified immediately.
  4. Biola University will comply with a request from an immigration officer for access to nonpublic areas such as residence halls, classrooms and offices not open to the public, of the campus only upon presentation of a judicial warrant. This compliance shall not apply to an immigration officer’s request for access or information related to the operation of international student, staff, or faculty programs, employment verification efforts, or other nonenforcement activities. 
  5. If you are responding to or having contact with an immigration officer executing a federal immigration order, please refer the individual to Campus Safety [campus.safety@biola.edu](mailto:campus.safety@biola.edu),(562) 903-4877 for purposes of verifying the legality of any warrant, court order or subpoena. 
  6. For any questions or concerns that relate to an immigration order or inquiry being enforced on our campus, please email [internal.communications@biola.edu](mailto:internal.communications@biola.edu). Unless the disclosure is permitted by state and federal education privacy law, faculty and staff persons shall be prohibited from discussing the personal information, including immigration status information, of any student, faculty, or staff person with anyone, or revealing that personal information to anyone. Privacy laws are very strict so disclosing any personal information of any students or employees is prohibited and violates the law. 
  7. Biola University maintains a list of legal service providers who can provide legal immigration representation for students, provided free of charge upon request. [View the legal directory](http://www.immigrationadvocates.org/nonprofit/legaldirectory/).
  8. All students, faculty and staff have a number of legal rights pertaining to immigration, afforded to them, which can be found here. [View your legal rights](https://oag.ca.gov/immigrant)
  9. In the event that an undocumented student is detained, deported, or is unable to attend to his or her academic requirements due to the actions of an immigration officer in relation to a federal immigration order, Biola University will make all reasonable efforts to assist the student in retaining any eligibility for financial aid, fellowship stipends, exemption from nonresident tuition fees, funding for research or other educational projects, housing stipends or services, or other benefits he or she has been awarded or received, and permit the student to be re-enrolled if and when the student is able to return to Biola. 
  10. Biola University’s Pastoral Care team through Student Development is available to assist undocumented students, and other students, faculty, and staff who may be subject to a federal immigration order or inquiry, or who may face similar issues, and whose education or employment is at risk because of federal immigration actions.



If you have any concerns regarding California State Assembly Bill 21, or the university’s policy, please send all questions, comments and inquiries to [internal.communications@biola.edu](mailto:internal.communications@biola.edu).
