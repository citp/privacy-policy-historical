# Privacy Policy

Most web sites collect some sort of information about their visitors in order to gather statistics about how many visitors they get each month, what are the most and least popular pages on the web site, where there may be problems in serving certain pages to visitors, etc. In an effort to answer questions such as these, Bio-Medicine also collects certain basic information about its visitors. 

Please note, however, that Bio-Medicine has no interest in personally identifying its users. This would be practically quite difficult, and quite an unnecessary task to accomplish anyway. The only thing that Bio-Medicine is interested in is the overall statistics of its readership. Cumulative figures that provide a picture of visitor traffic to our site are vital in our efforts to attract advertisers--upon whose support the site depends--and to monitor how well our web server is keeping up with our ever-increasing readership. 

So what information does Bio-Medicine collect about its visitors? Each time someone visits the site, our web server logs a number of details--if they are available--including the IP address of the visitor's computer and/or Internet service provider, the domain name and country of origin of that computer, its operating system, and the type of web browser being used.

In addition to the statistics that our own web server collects, the third-party advertising agencies that we work with may also collect certain information through the use of banner ads. 

**Third Party Advertising**

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you. 

**Third Party Cookies**

In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique "cookie" on your browser.

If you wish not to have Bio-Medicine keep any records of your visit to our site, even though it is our policy not to personally identify individual users but only to gather overall cumulative information about our visitors, then we suggest that you use an anonymous web browsing service such as Anonymizer.com. Such services typically hide all information about particular users from web sites, which log visits from the anonymizing service instead of the users' own computers. 

If you have any questions about our privacy policy, please contact the editor of Bio-Medicine, at [info@bio-medicine.org](mailto:info@bio-medicine.org).
