# BioWare: Privacy Policy

Privacy Policy

### BioWare Corp.

BioWare Corp. ("BioWare") considers issues relating to your privacy to be a serious matter. As such, BioWare has created and implemented this Privacy Policy so that you understand what BioWare may and may not do with certain personal information. BioWare encourages you to review this Privacy Policy.

This Privacy Policy will apply to all websites of BioWare that link to this Privacy Policy.

### Introduction

BioWare will only use personally identifiable information about you in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Personally identifiable information is information about you that can be attributed to you. In this Privacy Policy, personally identifiable information will be referred to as "personal information".

### Collection of Information

In order to use some of the features and services provided at BioWare’s websites, BioWare may require that you provide some personal information. BioWare may issue to you a unique "user id" which you will be required to provide each time you use certain features and services.

In addition, BioWare uses "cookies" on its websites. Cookies are a unique identifier that are sent to your Internet browser. The Internet browser may then store the cookie on your harddrive. Cookies can be used to track a visitor to a website as the visitor navigates the website and to store information. BioWare uses cookies for two reasons. Firstly, cookies enable a visitor to have a more unique and enriching experience while visiting BioWare’s websites. For example, if a visitor requests that the webpages be delivered to the visitor in a specific language a cookie will be used to record this information so that the visitor does not need to specify his or her language preference for each webpage that is delivered to the visitor’s browser. Secondly, BioWare uses cookies to track a visitor’s navigation through its websites. This helps BioWare understand how its websites are being used.

Most browsers will allow a user to refuse cookies. Check your browser’s options for this feature. However, if you set your browser to refuse cookies, you may not be able to use all of the features of BioWare’s websites.

If you have a user id, then BioWare may collect information about your use of the features and services of its websites (whether or not you provide your user id on each visit) and BioWare may associate this information with your personal information. If a visitor does not have a user id but does permit cookies, then BioWare only has the means to track use of its websites by that visitor but BioWare has no means to determine who that visitor is. Regardless of the information that BioWare collects from the use of its websites, BioWare will only use this information for the limited purposes set out in this Privacy Policy.

### Uses of Information

BioWare will only make one or more of the following uses of your personal information:

  1. analyse personal information and other data in order to enhance BioWare’s websites, software, games and services;
  2. use personal information for the purpose for which it was provided and certain other activities which are reasonably ancillary to such purpose. For example, if you send us an e-mail with a question or comment, BioWare will use your e-mail address to respond to you. Further, BioWare may store your e-mail and e-mail address and a copy of our response for future reference;
  3. use email addresses provided to BioWare to provide to you information about future BioWare games and other products and services notwithstanding that the email address may have been provided for a different purpose; and
  4. BioWare may also use and disclose personal information that is relevant to a legal proceeding or as permitted or required by law.



In the event BioWare sells or transfers ownership or control of any or all of its business, operations or services, BioWare reserves the right to transfer and disclose your personal information to that party. However, BioWare will require that party to agree that they will be similarly bound by the provisions of this Privacy Policy and that they will only use your personal information as BioWare is similarly entitled under this Privacy Policy.

BioWare has engaged certain service providers to assist BioWare in its activities. For that purpose, it may be necessary for BioWare to disclose your personal information to these service providers. However, BioWare will require that these service providers agree that they will only use your personal information solely for the purpose of assisting BioWare in its activities and that they will adhere to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

Except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy, BioWare will not sell, rent, loan, trade, lease or otherwise transfer any personal information, including e-mail addresses, to any third party and BioWare will treat any personal information you provide as confidential information.

### How Long is the Information Kept?

BioWare will only keep the personal information for so long as it is useful. At the conclusion of such time, BioWare will delete this information.

### Security

BioWare’s websites have security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of the personal information under BioWare’s control. However, BioWare cannot guarantee that these security measures will not be breached.

### Changes to the BioWare' Privacy Policy

BioWare reserves the right to modify or amend this Privacy Policy at any time and for any reason.

BioWare will notify visitors of changes to this Privacy Policy by providing notice of the change for at least 30 days on BioWare’s homepage at [www.bioware.com](http://www.bioware.com/).

### General

Nothing contained in this Privacy Policy is intended to create a contract or agreement between BioWare and any user visiting its websites or providing personal information in any form.

### Questions
