# Privacy policy

Biogen is committed to respecting your privacy and we understand how important it is to protect an individual’s personal information and apply the highest ethical and regulatory standards. An individual’s health, health interests and healthcare are private and sensitive and we know that you may have concerns about sharing information with us.

We urge you to read this Privacy Policy to learn more about the policies and practices that **Biogen MA Inc. (“Biogen”)** has developed to safeguard personal information, to manage our relationships with the third parties who may have access to personal information and to comply with all applicable data-protection laws. You will also find information about how to contact us to update personal information or express your preferences about how we process your personal information.

**INFORMATION WE COLLECT**  
As part of our day-to-day business operations, and from our interactions with you, Biogen may collect personal information about you. The personal information we collect is limited to information related to and needed for the conduct of our legitimate business purposes and/or fulfill commitments to you and fulfill our legal obligations. Biogen may be able to provide individuals with the option of not identifying themselves, or using a pseudonym when entering transactions when it is lawful and practicable to do so. However, we will not always be able to do this and in such cases, if you do not provide personal information, Biogen may not be able to provide services or information to you, or enter commercial engagements with you. We may have access to the following categories of personal information about you and only some of this information is personally identifiable information that could identify you directly, but each category may offer some information about your interests and activities that could be used to make inferences about you.

**INFORMATION THAT YOU VOLUNTARILY PROVIDE OR IS LEGALLY REQUIRED:**

  * Biographic or commercial profile. As part of our interaction with you, we may be required to collect personal information about you in order to provide you with services or information you request, or in order to facilitate commercial engagements with you. This personal information may be collected directly from you through your interactions with our company, through services and content, including online, that we make available to you, or as result of services or other input you provide to Biogen. Such information may include name, age, contact details, employment history, education history including qualifications, occupation or business details including areas of specialization.
  * Sensitive personal information. Biogen avoids collecting sensitive personal information. However, in rare instances such as facilitating access to patient support offerings, Biogen may need to collect sensitive personal information including medical health, lifestyle and medical treatment requirements including current medications. In the event it is necessary to collect any sensitive personal information about you, we will gather your consent to do so.

When you visit this Site, we have access to the following types of information about you:

We may use third parties to provide services and information and we may provide some co-branded services in partnership with others. We also may use third parties to analyze data collected in the course of our normal business operations, including on this Site. We will not disclose your personally identifying information to anyone other than our employees and those third parties with whom we have a business relationship.

If we allow a third party to have access to your personal information, they will only be permitted access for purposes that are consistent with this privacy policy and specifically, we do not disclose an individual’s personal data to third parties, except when one or more of the following conditions is true:

  * We have the individual’s permission to make the disclosure

  * The disclosure is reasonably necessary for the establishment of legal claims
  * The disclosure is to another Biogen entity or to persons or entities providing services on our or the individual’s behalf (each a “transferee”), consistent with the purpose for which the information was obtained, if the transferee, with respect to the information in question:
    * is subject to law providing an adequate level of privacy protection; or
    * has contractually agreed to provide an adequate level of privacy protection



**OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THIRD PARTIES:**

  * Co-branded products or services. Biogen may partner with other companies to provide you with content or services on a joint or “co-branded” basis. At a co-branded site, you will see both the Biogen logo and the logo of the co-branded partner displayed on your screen. To access the services available on a co-branded site you may have to complete an online registration form, and this registration information may be shared with our co-branded partners. You should read the individual privacy policies of the co-branded sites, as these may differ in some respects from ours. Reading these policies will help you to make an informed decision about whether to provide your information to a given site. Remember, you may always opt-out of sharing your information with a partner site by choosing not to use the service or content provided by the co-branded site.
  * Links to other sites. Biogen websites may also feature links to websites that we believe you might find useful and informative. Please be aware, however, that, other than the websites controlled by the Biogen group of companies, we do not endorse or recommend these sites’ content or services, and we are not responsible for the privacy practices of these other sites. We encourage you to be aware of and read the privacy policy of each site you visit. Remember, the statements in this privacy policy apply solely to information collected by Biogen.
  * Advertisers. We do not permit advertisers to display their advertisements at the Site.



**PERSONAL INFORMATION TRANSFERS**  
Permitted transfers of personal data to third parties or within Biogen include the transfer of data from one jurisdiction to another and may include transfers to a jurisdiction where the laws provide different protection than the jurisdiction in which the data originated. In such cases, we will take appropriate measures to protect personal data in accordance with this privacy statement and all applicable data-protection law.

**OUR CHILDREN’S POLICY**  
The Site content and services are intended for users over the age of 18. The Site is not designed to attract child users. If we learn that an under 18 user has volunteered personally identifying and/or health-related personal information on the Site, or that a provider has volunteered information about a patient who is identified as younger than 18, we will delete such information from our active databases in accordance with our deletion policy, which is described in the section on privacy choices.

Please be aware that we may not comply with a consumer’s request to amend or remove information that was provided to Biogen by a healthcare professional or a consumer regarding an adverse drug event.



**OUR SECURITY MEASURES**  
We want your personal information to remain as secure as reasonably possible.

  * Data security. We employ various physical, electronic and procedural measures, including education and training of our personnel, designed to provide personal information with the highest reasonable protection possible from loss, misuse or unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction. The security measures we use to protect all personal information are designed to meet or exceed industry standards to prevent intruders from gaining access. Although we will make adequate and reasonable efforts to protect personally identifying information from loss, misuse or alteration by third parties, you should be aware that there is always some risk that an unauthorized third party could intercept an Internet transmission, or that thieves will find a way to thwart our security systems.
  * Data encryption. We use encryption practices to help ensure the integrity and privacy of some of the personal information you provide to us. Personal information that is collected or displayed through any Biogen-controlled website is protected in transit by encryption processes that meet or exceed applicable regulatory standards.
