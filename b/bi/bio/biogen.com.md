Version date:  September 1, 2018

**THIS PRIVACY POLICY APPLIES TO YOUR ACCESS AND USE OF Biogen Inc., its subsidiaries, affiliates and Agents, (collectively “Biogen”, or “we”, “US” or “OUR”) WEBSITEs (“Websites”).  BY USING THE WEBSITES, YOU CONFIRM THAT YOU HAVE READ AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS PRIVACY POLICY.  IF YOU DISAGREE WITH ANY PART OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY, THEN PLEASE DO NOT USE THE WEBSITES.**

This Privacy Policy explains the policies and practices that we have developed to safeguard personal information and to comply with applicable data protection laws.  Please read this notice carefully to understand what information we collect, how we collect it, how we use it, who we may disclose it to, and how you can manage your personal information.

We control and operate the Websites from within the United States of America.  Our online privacy practices are governed by the laws of the United States and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, which may differ from privacy laws in your state or home country.  By submitting your personal information to us through the Websites, you consent to the transfer of your personal information to any country and its use and disclosure in accordance with applicable U.S. Federal and State laws and with this Privacy Policy.

We may change our Privacy Policy, so please check this page periodically, as your continued use of the Websites, after we publish our changes, indicates your acceptance of any changed terms.

**INFORMATION WE COLLECT**

We provide Websites to share information about the services and products we offer.  Regardless of the device you use to interact with our Websites, Biogen may collect some information that identifies you or that can be used to contact or distinguish you as an individual (“Personal Information”).  We may need to collect Personal Information about you to provide you with services or information you request, or to facilitate commercial engagements with you. If you do not provide Personal Information, we may not be able to provide services or information to you, or enter commercial engagements with you.

We will only collect Personal Information about you that is necessary for one or more of our legitimate business purposes, or is required by law. 

When you visit our Websites, we collect the following types of Personal Information:

**(a)         Personal Information that we collect directly from you:**

We collect Personal Information directly from you when you register with the Websites, subscribe to online services, or otherwise provide information directly to us. The following are examples of Personal Information that we may collect directly from you:

  * Name;
  * Contact details (e-mail address, telephone number, mailing address etc.);
  * Username and password;
  * Age/Date of birth;
  * Government identification numbers;
  * Communication preferences;



·       Business information, including employment history, education history, qualifications, occupation and areas of specialization; and

**(b)         Other Information that we collect when you visit our Websites:**

We use a variety of common, automated data collection technologies, such as internet tags or cookies (“Data Collection Technologies”), to assess how our Websites are used, to personalize your experience, and to deliver content tailored to your interests. In doing this, we collect information about you when you visit our Websites. When you request pages on our Websites, for example, our servers automatically log your internet protocol (IP) address.  The IP address is a unique number assigned to your computer to identify it whenever you are surfing the Web.  We use the IP address to understand the web pages you visit. The IP address does not identify you personally, but it allows us to maintain communications with you as you move about the Website. Generally, these types of data elements (“Other Information”) do not reveal your identity or do not relate directly to you or any other individual.

The following are some examples of Other Information:

  * device ID, including IP address;
  * browser and device information, including operating system;



·       aggregated information such as “click stream” information such as entry and exit points for the Websites (including referring URLs or domains), certain Websites traffic statistics, page views, and impressions;

  * geolocation (if using a mobile application and you consent to providing it); and



·       other information collected through cookies, pixel tags and other technologies described in more detail later in this Privacy Policy.

**(c)         Sensitive Personal Information**

We generally avoid collecting sensitive personal information, such as health data (“Sensitive Personal Information”), through our Websites.  In some cases, however, we may need to collect such Sensitive Personal Information to facilitate providing services to you, such as certain patient support service offerings.  Where required to comply with all applicable data protection and privacy laws, we will obtain your explicit consent to collect Sensitive Personal Information about you through our Websites.

**(d)         Data enhancement**

In addition, we may collect information about you from publicly-available sources, third parties, and directly from you through your interactions with us.

  * to improve the content or personalize our communications;
  * to create a profile about you to match you with education/awareness programs, collaboration opportunities or obtain services from you;

**Data Collection Technologies, Interest-Based Advertising and “Do Not Track”  **

**Data Collection Technologies.**   In addition to collecting your IP address as described above, we may also use certain Data Collection Technologies on our Websites such as: 

**Cookies.** Cookies are small text files placed in your computer browser or other web-accessing device directories to store your information about your use of the Websites and your activities online (collectively, “Cookies”).  A Cookie will typically contain the name of the domain (internet location) from which the Cookie has come, the “lifetime” of the Cookie (i.e. when does it expire), and a value, usually a randomly generated unique number.  To find out more about Cookies, including how to see what Cookies have been set on your device and how to manage and delete them, visit [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/).

We use first-party, session, and persistent cookies. These cookies allow us to distinguish you from other users of our Websites, and to enhance this Website and your experience when you browse this Website.

If you do not wish to receive Cookies or wish to manage when you accept Cookies in general, you may set your browser to reject Cookies or to alert you when a Cookie is placed on your computer.  Although you are not required to accept our Cookies, if you set your browser to reject Cookies, you may not be able to use all the features and functionality of the Website.  ****

**Internet tags.** Occasionally, we may use Internet tags (also known as Web beacons, action tags, single-pixel GIFs, clear GIFs, invisible GIFs and 1-by-1 GIFs) on our websites.

Cookies and Internet tags are placed on different pages throughout our Websites. We also use them to measure responses to our Websites. We may deploy Cookies and Internet tags through our analytical service partners.

**Social Plugins.** The Website may also use social plugins (e.g., the Facebook “Like” button) to enable you to easily share information with others. When you visit our Website, the operator of the social plugin may be able to place a Cookie on your computer, enabling that operator to recognize individuals who have previously visited our Website.  For further details about the information shared via a social media plugin, you should refer to that social media website’s privacy statement.

For more information on Data Collection Technologies, please refer to Exhibit A:  FOCUS ON DATA COLLECTION TECHNOLOGIES.

**Online Advertising.**  

We also use Data Collection Technologies to manage our online advertising program. These technologies are provided by our ad management partners and other third parties.  We, and our ad management partners, may use these to track the actions of users of the Websites, to measure statistics of our marketing efforts, and to deliver advertisements on third party websites.

We support the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising of the Digital Advertising Alliance (“Principles”).  This means that we allow you to exercise choice regarding the collection of information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites for online interest based advertising purposes.  More information about these Principles can be found at www.aboutads.info/. 

If you want to “opt out” of receiving online interest-based advertisements, please follow the instructions at [www.aboutads.info/choices](http://www.aboutads.info/choices), or  <http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/>.  An “opt-out” Cookie will be placed on your device indicating that you do not want to receive interest-based advertisements.  If you delete Cookies on your device generally, you will need to opt-out again. 

Please note that when you “opt-out” of receiving interest-based advertisements, this does not mean you will no longer see advertisements from us.  It means that the online ads that you do see will not be based on your interests. When you “opt-out” of receiving interest-based advertisements through one of the links above, these Data Collection Technologies may still collect information about your use of the Websites, including for analytics.

**Advertisers.** We do not permit advertisers to display their advertisements on our Website. ****

**Do not track (DNT).** We do not respond to DNT signals offered by some browsers.

**OUR SECURITY MEASURES**

We have implemented reasonable safeguards designed to prevent loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure or modification of Personal Information provided or collected through the Websites.  Unfortunately, no system or online transmission of data can be guaranteed to be 100% secure and you should always take appropriate security measures to protect your Personal Information, including ensuring that you have up-to-date antivirus software.  
****

**STORAGE & RETENTION**

We provide products and services around the world. Accordingly, we store and process Personal Information on Biogen’s servers, and the servers of third parties we hire to provide our services, worldwide. These servers may be located outside the country from which you interacted with Biogen.

We retain your Personal Information for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it has been collected. ****

**LINKS TO OTHER SITES**

Our Websites may feature links to third-party websites that we believe you might find useful and informative. We do not endorse or recommend these websites’ content or services, and we are not responsible for the privacy practices of the operators of these other websites.  We encourage you to be aware of and read the privacy notice of each website you visit.  When you link these third-party websites, please remember that you are bound by the privacy policy of the third-party.  We may also partner with other companies to provide you with content or services on a joint or “co-branded” basis using a co-branded website with both the Biogen logo and the logo of the co-branded partner displayed. You should read the individual privacy policies of the co-branded websites, as these policies may differ in some respects from this privacy notice.

Our Websites, their content and our services are intended for users over the age of eighteen (18).

**Internet tags.** Occasionally, we may use Internet tags (also known as web beacons, action tags, single-pixel GIFs, clear GIFs, invisible GIFs and 1-by-1 GIFs) on certain web pages or in emails we send to you.  We use this technology to measure the registered user’s responses to our Websites, including how many times a page is opened and which information is consulted, as well as to measure the use of this page.

When you visit our Website, the operator of the social plugin may be able to place a cookie on your computer, enabling that operator to recognize individuals who have previously visited our Website. If you have previously logged into the associated social media website (e.g., Facebook) before browsing on our Website, the social plugin allows that social media website to receive information about your visit to certain pages on our Website.

**Google Analytics**

This Website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (" **Google** "). Google Analytics uses Cookies. The information generated by the Cookie about your use of this Website is generally transferred to a Google server in the United States and stored there. Because we have activated “internet protocol anonymization” on this Website, Google shortens your IP address at a point within the European Economic Area before transfer to the United States. This means that the full IP address will only be transferred to Google in the United States only in exceptional circumstances for shortening there.

Google will use the received information to evaluate your use of this Website for Biogen, to compile reports on website activity, and to provide other services related to website usage and internet usage. The IP address provided by your browser as part of Google Analytics will not be merged with any other Google data.
