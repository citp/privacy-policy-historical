<h2>Biola University Online Privacy Policy Statement </h2>
<p><em>[Updated: January 24, 2012]</em></p>
<p>Biola University, Inc. (Biola) is committed to the responsible use of personal information collected from and about you while you are using the <a href="http://www.biola.edu/">www.biola.edu</a> website or any website or online service under the <a href="http://biola.edu">biola.edu</a> domain name. Consistent with the California Online Privacy Protection Act of 2003, this privacy statement provides information about how this personal information may be used. Individual web pages under the <a href="http://biola.edu">biola.edu</a> domain name may post additional privacy statements addressing more specific information collected on those pages.</p>
<h3>Information We Collect</h3>
<ol>
  <li><em>Non-personally identifiable information</em>
<p>As users access the website, Biola collects non-personally identifiable information such as IP address, browser type, and site usage. This information is <u>not</u> linked to any personal information and remains anonymous.</p>
<p>To collect this information, the university uses session “cookies” -- that is, small text files that are placed on your computer’s hard drive. The session cookies used by the university do <u>not</u> give us access to your computer and do <u>not</u> provide us with personally identifiable information. Session cookies are deleted when you close your browser. You may modify your browser settings to disallow cookies, but this may prevent you from taking full advantage of our website.</p></li>
  <li><em>Personally identifiable information</em>
<p>Certain areas of our website collect voluntary information that is personally identifiable, such as name, zip code, and e-mail address. This is typically done through request and registration forms provided in order to learn of your interest in Biola and provide you with information and services. </p>
<p>Personally identifiable information may be collected as part of an online purchase, payment, or donation. In this case, Biola uses one of the following PCI-compliant third-party services to process your transaction. Prior to using these services, we encourage you to read the privacy policies listed below.</p>

<p>The university does <strong><em>not</em></strong> knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children (defined herein as minors younger than thirteen years of age) without obtaining parental consent. Implied parental consent includes, but is not limited to: use of parent login, use of parent-supplied credit card and inclusion of parent personal information on registration forms. Some Biola departments provide services to children. As a part of the online registration process for such services, we may request information such as a child’s name, address, cell phone, email, gender, grade level, birth date, school attended, clothing size, church and ethnicity. This information is never sold or otherwise provided to third parties, although some information may be provided to other Biola departments in order to provide the child with information about Biola. Before registering online for a service, Biola requests that all children have their parents read this Privacy Policy as well as any additional Privacy Policy associated with the service for which they are registering, and that parents continue their involvement throughout the registration process. </p></li>
</ol>
<h3>Use of Information We Collect</h3>
<ol>
  <li><em>Use of non-personally identifiable information</em>
<p>We use non-personally identifiable information while you are browsing the site to improve your individual experience and provide you with more individualized responses. We also aggregate non-personally identifiable information from many users into statistical reports in order to better administer our website, diagnose server problems that may occur from time to time, and improve our website. </p></li>
  <li><em>Use of personally identifiable information</em>
<p>By providing personally identifiable information, you imply consent to the collection and use of the information for the purposes for which it was provided. Your information is used to provide relevant materials, products and services you request, and to facilitate relationships with the University, such as the admissions process and fund raising programs. You may opt out of receiving information from Biola University by contacting the department from which the information came. </p>
<p>Only those Biola University employees who need personally identifiable information to perform a specific job are given access to the information. Unless required by law, personally identifiable information is only shared with third parties as necessary to provide the materials, products, and services you request. When third parties are given access to personally identifiable information, they are, by contract, not permitted to use or re-disclose any of the information for unauthorized purposes. Personally identifiable information is never sold to third parties. </p></li>
</ol>
<h3>Security</h3>
<p>In order to protect the loss, misuse, or alteration of information gathered on our site, all information is stored within a controlled database environment accessible only to authorized University staff. However, as effective as any security measures implemented by the University may be, no security system is impenetrable. Biola University cannot guarantee the security of its database environment, nor can it guarantee that the information you provide will not be intercepted while being transmitted over the Internet.</p>
<h3>Public Self-Disclosure</h3>
<p>Biola University does not control the actions of its site visitors nor the use site visitors may make of publicly disclosed information. Please be aware that disclosing personally identifiable information on the site’s bulletin boards, guest books, chat rooms or other such public forums may allow visitors to gather information and send unsolicited email.
