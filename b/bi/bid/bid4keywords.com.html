      <p>If  you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of  this site or your dealings with this site, email  copyright@Bid4Keywords.com. </p>
      <p id="1" name="1"><a name="1" id="1"></a><strong>What information does Bid4Keywords.com collect? </strong></p>
      <p>At  different times, Bid4Keywords.com may collect several types of  information about you. Except as otherwise stated in this privacy  policy, we do not provide this information to third parties, except in  aggregate form. </p>
      <p>First, we or our partners or  advertisers may use a feature of your browser called a cookie to assign  identification to your computer. The unique user ID contained within  your cookie automatically identifies your computer — but not you — to  our servers every time you visit our site. Cookies by themselves cannot  be used to find out the identity of any user. You can turn the cookies  feature off by using your browser's preference options, but you may not  be able to utilize some services properly. </p>
      <p>Second, we  keep track of your IP address to help diagnose problems with our  servers and to administer our site. Your IP address is a number that  identifies a computer which accesses the Internet. This address is used  to gather broad demographic information about you, such as your  Internet service provider and the geographic location of your IP  address. Bid4Keywords.com may also collect aggregate information on how  our users are utilizing the site. This might include information  regarding traffic patterns through the site and search queries. </p>
      <p>Third,  we log browser types, access times, URLs from which visitors came to  our site and URLs viewed by visitors while on our site. Again,  Bid4Keywords.com uses this information on an aggregate basis, in this  case making sure we can support overall visitor traffic and service  performance. </p>
      <p>Fourth, at specific times we may ask you  to provide us with personal information in order for you to register  for a service or to enter a sweepstakes. Also, you may also provide  personal information if you write us feedback email. This information  may include but is not limited to your name and email address. You may  always choose not to provide us with this information; however, this  may limit our ability to provide you with a specific service, offer you  personalized content, or respond to your feedback. </p>
      <p>Fifth,  we contract with 24/7 Real Media, a service partner, to provide us with  a data collection and reporting service to better understand overall  use of our site. 24/7 Real Media may store certain legacy data that we  received from visitors to our site prior to our relationship with them,  so that we may access this information via their reporting service.  24/7 Real Media may collect information on our behalf about our users'  visiting behaviors in several ways, including through the use of  cookies or pixel tags. We use 24/7 Real Media to understand what's  popular and useful for visitors. </p>

These companies may use cookies, pixel tags, or  otherwise independently collect information (not including your name,  address email address or telephone number) from you and use this  information about your visits to this and other sites in order to  provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. We  do not control their collection and use of information. Please note  that if an advertiser or advertising network asks us to show an  advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men ages 18-34) or  audience segment (for example, men ages 13-24 who have viewed sports  content) and you respond to that ad, the advertiser or advertising  network may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they  are trying to reach. </p>
