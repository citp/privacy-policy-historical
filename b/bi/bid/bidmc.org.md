### Understanding Your Health Record/Information

Each time you visit a hospital, physician, or other healthcare provider, a record of your visit is made. This record typically contains your symptoms, medical history, examination, test results, diagnoses, treatment, and a plan for future care or treatment. This information, often referred to as your health or medical record, serves as a:

  * basis for planning your care and treatment 
  * means of communication among the many health professionals who contribute to your care 
  * legal document describing the care you received 
  * means by which you or a third-party payer can verify that services billed were actually provided 
  * a tool in educating health professionals 
  * a source of data for medical research 
  * a source of information for public health officials charged with improving the health of the nation 
  * a source of data for facility planning and marketing 
  * a tool with which we can assess and continually work to improve the care we render and the outcomes we achieve 



Understanding what is in your record and how your health information is used helps you to:

  * ensure its accuracy 
  * better understand who, what, when, where, and why others may access your health information 
  * make more informed decisions when authorizing disclosure to others 



### HOW WE MAY USE AND DISCLOSE MEDICAL INFORMATION ABOUT YOU.

The following describes different ways that we are permitted to use and disclose medical information. For each category of uses or disclosures we will explain what we mean and try to give some examples. Not every use or disclosure in a category will be listed. However, all of the ways we are permitted to use and disclose information will fall within one of the categories.

  
**For Treatment.** We may use your medical information to provide you with medical treatment or services. We may disclose medical information about you to doctors, nurses, technicians, medical students, or other hospital personnel who are involved in caring for you at the hospital or outside the hospital. Different departments of the hospital also may share medical information about you in order to coordinate the different services/treatments you need, such as prescriptions, laboratory work, and x-rays. We may also disclose medical information about you to people who may be involved in maintaining your health or well being during your hospital stay and after discharge, such as family members, friends, home health services, support agencies, clergy, or others who provide services that are necessary for your well being.

  
**For Payment.** We may use and disclose your medical information so that the treatment and services you receive at the hospital may be billed and payment may be collected from you, an insurance company, or a third party. We may tell your health plan about a treatment you are going to receive in order to obtain prior approval or to determine whether your plan will cover the treatment. We may also give information to someone who helps pay for your care.

  
**For Health Care Operations.** We may use and disclose your medical information for hospital operations. Hospital operations are activities that are necessary to run the hospital and to make sure that all of our patients receive quality care. We may combine medical information about many hospital patients for purposes of making decisions about what additional services the hospital should offer, what services are not needed, and whether certain new treatments are effective. We may also disclose information to doctors, nurses, technicians, medical students, and other hospital personnel for review and learning purposes. When we do this, information that identifies you may be removed from this set of medical information so others may use it to study health care and health care delivery without learning who the specific patients are. If ownership of the hospital changes as a result of sale, transfer, merger or consolidation, your medical information would be disclosed to the new entity, if that entity was  
to follow the same privacy policies.

### Other Examples of Health Care Operations

**Appointment Reminders.** We may use and disclose medical information to contact you as a reminder that you have an appointment for treatment or medical care at the hospital.

  
**Treatment Alternatives.** We may use and disclose medical information to tell you about or recommend possible treatment options or health related benefits that may be of interest to you.

  
**Fundraising Activities.** We may use your demographic information to contact you in an effort to raise money for the hospital and its operations. We would release only contact information, such as your name, address and phone number, and the dates you received treatment or services at the hospital. If you do not want the hospital to contact you as part of its fundraising efforts, you must send a written notice to Office of Development, 330 Brookline Avenue, Boston, MA 02215.

  
**Hospital Directory.** We may include certain limited information about you in the hospital directory while you are an inpatient at the hospital. This information may include your name, location in the hospital, your general condition (e.g., good, fair, etc.) and your religious affiliation. The directory information, except for your religious affiliation, may also be released to people who ask for you by name. Your name may be given to a member of the clergy, even if they do not ask for you by name. If you do not want to be listed in the hospital directory please contact your nurse.  
In disaster situations, those involving multiple casualties, we may release general information, such as: the hospital is treating four individuals from the accident.

  
**Research.** We may disclose information to researchers when an institutional review board that has reviewed the research proposal and established protocols to ensure the privacy of your health information has approved the research.

  
**As Required By Law.** We will disclose your medical information when required to do so by federal, state or local law.

  
**To Avert a Serious Threat to Health or Safety.** We may use and disclose your medical information when necessary to prevent a serious threat to your health and safety or the health and safety of the public or another person. Any disclosure, however, would be only to someone able to help prevent the threatened harm.

  
**Special Situations.** We may disclose medical information about you to an entity assisting in a disaster relief effort so that your family can be notified about your condition, status and location.

  
**Organ and Tissue Donation.** If you are a potential organ donor, we may release medical information to organ procurement organizations or eye or tissue banks, as necessary, to facilitate organ or tissue donation and transplantation.

  
**Military and Veterans.** If you are a member of the armed forces, we may release your medical information as required by law. We may also release medical information about foreign military personnel to the appropriate foreign military authority as required by law.

  
**Workers' Compensation.** We may release your medical information for workers' compensation or similar programs. These programs provide benefits for work-related injuries or illness.

  * to prevent or control disease, injury or disability; 
  * to report births and deaths; 
  * to report abuse and/or neglect of a child, elder or disabled person; 
  * to report reactions to medications or problems with products; 
  * to notify people of recalls of products they may be using; 
  * to notify a person who may have been exposed to a disease or may be at risk for contracting or spreading a disease or condition; 



**Health Oversight Activities.** We may, when requested, disclose your medical information to a health oversight agency for activities authorized by law. These oversight activities include, audits, certifications, investigations, inspections, and licensure. These activities are necessary for the government to monitor the health care system, government programs, and compliance with civil rights laws.

  
**Lawsuits and Disputes.** If you are involved in a lawsuit or a dispute, we may disclose your medical information in response to a court order. Under certain circumstances, we may also disclose your medical information in response to a subpoena or other lawful process, but we will do so only if efforts have been made to tell you about the request or to obtain an order protecting the information requested or if you or a court have provided written authorization.

  * About criminal conduct at the hospital; and 
  * In emergency circumstances: to report a crime; the location of the crime or victims; or the identity, description or location of the person who committed the crime. 



**Coroners, Medical Examiners and Funeral Directors.** We may release medical information to a coroner or medical examiner.

**Inmates.** If you are an inmate of a correctional institution or under the custody of a law enforcement official, we may release medical information about you to the correctional institution or law enforcement official, under certain circumstances if permitted by law. This release would be necessary (1) for the institution to provide you with health care; (2) to protect your health and safety or the health and safety of others; or (3) for the safety and security of the correctional institution.

### YOUR RIGHTS REGARDING MEDICAL INFORMATION ABOUT YOU.

You have the following rights regarding medical information we maintain about you:  
 **Right to Inspect and Obtain a Copy.** You have the right to inspect and obtain a copy of your medical information that may be used to make decisions about your care. This request usually includes medical and billing records but does not include psychotherapy notes.

We may deny your request for an amendment if it is not in writing or does not include a reason to support the request. We may also deny your request if you ask us to amend information that:

  * Was not created by us, or the person or entity that created the information is no longer available to make the amendment; 
  * Is not part of the medical information kept by or for the hospital; 
  * Is not part of the information which you would be permitted to inspect and copy; or 
  * Is accurate and complete.
