# Privacy Policy - BidandClick

BidandClick privacy policy statement. BidandClick is committed to protecting your privacy.

To use the website services you need to register specifying your nickname, password, age and place of residence. We also need to receive information on how to contact members, so during this procedure you will also be asked to supply information such as your e-mail address. This will allow us to guarantee improved support. Additional information is requested in order to offer you a more efficient service. 

  


## Member IP address

Like most e-commerce websites, each time you visit BidandClick we collect your IP address and web address of the site you came from. This data shall only be used for geographic and demographic statistics. 

  


## E-mail address and further information about the user

BidandClick is the sole owner of the user’s personal information and will not sell this information to third parties. The term information includes, but is not limited to, e-mail addresses, housing addresses and any other information provided on the registration form, unless BidandClick and/or BeWebCom Corp receive express authorisation and consent by the user him/herself should he/she consent to take part in special offers that may be offered to registered users from time to time. We will only use the user’s e-mail address to send him/her news about our site’s activities, to inform him/her about eventual events that we organise and for any other correspondence between the user and BidandClick.  
Our e-mail correspondence may contain sales information such as special offers that partner sites/sponsors or we are organising. We may also use "action tags", also known as "single-pixel gif", in order to better understand your visit to our website. Users may change their e-mail preferences in any given moment. We provide our users with the possibility to change within their e-mail preferences ("opt-out").

  


## Publishing your name on our website

To protect your privacy BidandClick shall never publish, without your written consent, your personal details, including but not limited to, your name and surname on the website or any other place. For this reason if you are the Awarded Bidder of an Auction, BidandClick will only publish your nickname and town of residence. If you win one or more products, you may choose whether to send us your comment and the authorisation to publish it on our website with your name and photo. After having received your comment and consent to publish it, BidandClick shall have the right to decide at its discretion, without any obligation, whether to publish your comment on the site, and whether or not to publish your name and/or your photo. 

  


## Opt-out

If you are a registered member and you no longer wish to receive promotions and/or newsletters and/or any other information concerning BidandClick services and/or wish to change your e-mail settings you can do this by accessing BidandClick with your nickname and password and going to the “my profile” section. From this section you can opt-out of the service and/or register for e-mail services offered by BidandClick including, but not limited to, promotional services and BidandClick newsletters. The link to opt-out and/or modify the settings for the e-mails you wish to receive can be found in the footer of every e-mail sent by BidandClick to registered members. The opt out link does not expire as long as the member is registered to our website. 

  


## Cookies

Like most other websites, BidandClick uses cookies to track and target the interests of our members. We also use cookies to help you save time while you browse our website, for example you can save your password and, if you wish, other information. 

  


## How we use your personal information

The user's e-mail address will be used so that he/she can use our services better. The user’s financial information, such as credit card information, is handled directly by the Merchants and not by BidandClick and therefore we recommend that our users refer to their Privacy Policy. Occasionally a registering user or a previously registered user may be offered promotions from advertisers that involve the communication of some of the information provided during registration to the advertiser or indeed other information may be requested. The registering/registered user is not obliged to accept these promotions and therefore no personal information will be given to the advertiser unless the user has expressly accepted the promotion and therefore provided consent for information to be given. When accepting this type of promotion the user effectively gives consent for his/her personal information to be given to sponsor sites or for receiving commercial promotions from them. When a registering/registered user confirms and gives consent to receive the promotion, he/she declares that he/she accepts the promotion proposed and at the same time authorises BidandClick and/or BeWebCom Corp to provide the advertiser with information requested. At the same time, when accepting an advertiser’s promotion, the Advertiser or BidandClick on behalf of the advertiser may send one or two promotional e-mails.  
Our company nevertheless is obliged to provide User data following a writ issued by a Court who asks for relative information to be divulged. In addition to a Court request, the only other people authorised to see User data or billing information are employees and/or authorised workers at BidandClick and/or BeWebCom Corp, who will only carry out their duties to guarantee Service.

  


## Children and Minors

BidandClick recognises the importance of protecting the privacy of minors. For this reason we never collect or store information from visitors unless we are sure they are aged 18 or over as required by law. If you are not aged 18 or over you should not access our website. If we learn that a person under 18 years of age is using our website we block that person from accessing. 

  


## Breach of Terms and Conditions of Use

In case of breach of the Terms and Conditions of Use we have the right to share the member's personal data with our lawyers and legal officials. 

  


## Business transfers

The privacy of member personal data is of utmost importance in our business and does not foresee the sale of data or communication of information to third parties. However, as the company's business is continuously developing we may sell or acquire business assets. During said transactions member data is usually part of the business assets to be transferred. If all BidandClick assets are acquired by another company, member data will be part of the business assets to be transferred. We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time.
