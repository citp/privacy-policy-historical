            <h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
            <p>

                We are concerned about privacy issues and want you to be familiar with how we collect,
                use and share information we receive about our clients and users and the options available to you.
                If you have any questions, you may contact us.
            </p>
            <p>
                BidGear offers marketing automation for publishers via a selling platform, which enables publishers
                to optimize their digital assets while protecting their brands. We are a publisher-focused company,
                but at the same time we maintain client relationships with media buyers. As a user you may
                encounter an ad from one of our media buyer clients by viewing the content on a website or
                application owned or operated by one of our publisher clients.
            </p>

            <h4>SCOPE OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h4>
            <p>
                This Privacy Policy covers the information that we may collect or receive across
                the Internet and other digital formats:
            </p>

            <ol class="list-item">
                <li>
                    <p>
                        from users who (i) visit www.BidGear.com and other websites operated by us,
                        including BidGear’s client interfaces (the "Websites"), (ii) use our software applications
                        (the "Apps"), (iii) use our social media pages (collectively, our "Social Media Pages"),
                        and (iv) receive email messages that we send to you (collectively, the Websites,
                        Apps and Social Media Pages, the "BidGear Pages"); and

                        parties that we use to gather and process information on their behalf (collectively,
                        including the Websites, the Apps and our Social Media Pages, the "Services").
                        In this second context, we act as processors for the clients who serve as the data
                        controllers for the information that we obtain from them.
                    </p>
                </li>

            <p>
                "Other Information" is any information that is linked or reasonably linkable to a particular computer or
                device, but does not reveal your specific identity or directly identify an individual, such as: browser
                and device information; time spent on the Services, pages visited, language preferences, date and time

                identifier, including mobile device identifier or statistical identifier; demographic information,
                including physical information; information provided by you; and aggregated information.
            </p>
            <p>
                We and our third party service providers may collect Other Information in a variety of ways, including
                through: your browser or device; your mobile device identifier; the use of statistical identifiers
                (which collect and use certain characteristics of your device to help us identify it over time); your
                use of the Apps; the use of pixel tags and other similar technologies; your IP address; the aggregation

            <p>
                Our publisher clients may also collect information about you that they choose to pass to us either
                directly through our Services or through application programming interfaces or APIs, when our services
                connect to their systems. APIs are a particular set of rules and specifications that allow one software
                program to access and make use of another software program. The information our publisher clients may
                share includes network type of a user's device, year of birth, ethnicity (where permitted by law),
                gender, and precise geo-location (where permitted by law). Some publisher clients may provide precise
                geo-location information collected on certain platforms. We will not use precise geo-location

                server logs for our mobile ad server business for up to 9 months. We use precise geo-location for the
