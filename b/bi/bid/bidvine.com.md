We use Master ID Data that identify natural persons from third-party web-services, including [clearbit](https://clearbit.com/), company websites and social media identities to enhance Profile Content on the Site.

Profile Content will be enhanced as follows:

  * Improved individual description
  * Addition of social media and website URLs not entered upon registration 
  * Addition of media not uploaded, but available on websites/social media identities 



 **Unregistered Professionals’ Profile Content Publishing**

We may use publicly available non-proprietary data from which natural persons can be identified to create a directory, and associated profiles, of professional service providers that have yet to register on the Site. The unregistered professionals associated with the profiles we create can choose to claim their profile and make any modifications to the profile content we publish as they deem necessary. Similarly, unregistered professionals can request the deletion of their profile by emailing support@bidvine.com. Unregistered professionals will be required to verify their association with the professional listing.

 **How we use your personal information**

We use your personal information as follows:

  * Master ID Data - _send you information we think you may find useful or which you have requested from us, including information about our products and services [or those of carefully selected third parties], provided you have indicated that you do not object to being contacted for these purposes; and allow, with your consent, carefully selected third parties to send you information directly which you may find useful regarding their products and services. Master ID Data is also used to help verify your identity and to facilitate users interacting with one another (i.e. submitting requests, sending bids, exchanging messages, etc.)_
  * Usage Data - _audit the downloading of data from the Site; improve the layout and/or content of the pages of the Site and Application and customise them for users; identify visitors to the Site; and carry out research on our users' demographics and tracking of sales data; we may disclose anonymised aggregate statistics about visitors to and users of the Site in order to describe our services to prospective partners and other reputable third parties and for other lawful purposes._

  * Medical/Health Data - _enables us to provide service professionals with relevant information specific to some customer service requests (i.e. a personal trainer will need to be informed of pre-existing inquiries or heart conditions)._



 **Use of Customer information by Professionals**

If you are a Customer, Professionals may use a Customer Management Tool provided by Bidvine to help them organise information regarding bids involving you and other customers. Where a Professional uses this tool to organise information about you, we act on their behalf as a ‘data processor’ of that additional information. The Professional, not us, is the ‘data controller’ of this additional information.

If you have any questions regarding how any Professional uses your data, you should contact the Professional. If you wish to exercise any of the rights in the ‘Your Rights’ section of this Policy (below), we will respond to you in our capacity as data controller - that is, in respect of our operation of Bidvine generally. If you wish to exercise your rights in respect of any Professional’s use of your data - in their use of the Customer Management Tool or otherwise - you should contact the Professional.

 **Who we share your personal information with**

We routinely share Master ID Data; Usage Data; Medical/Health Data and Transactional Data with our employees, agents or affiliates to operate our services for you, including: parties that provide products or services to us or on our behalf and parties that collaborate with us in the provision of products or services to you.

As a result, your personal information may be accessed in Canada, India and in the Philippines, and in some cases, other countries. We require that employees, agents or affiliates enter into the requisite contractual agreements which require that they comply with this Privacy Policy and the requisite European Data Protection Laws.

We will share personal information with law enforcement or other authorities if required by applicable law. We will not share your personal information with any other third party.

We will inform you at the point of collecting information from you, whether you are required to provide the information to us. We may check your Personal Data against any particulars on any database (public or otherwise) or through any third party identity verification service. If the information you have provided us does not allow us to verify your identity then you may not be able to register an account with us. 

 **How long your personal information will be kept**

We will hold a copy of your Master ID Data; Usage Data; Medical/Health Data and Transactional Data for the contract law statutory limitation period to help prevent fraud and to comply with statutory law for retaining information such as UK tax law (currently 6 years). Your data will be removed from our systems six years from the termination of the account or request for erasure or following a one-year period of inactivity.
