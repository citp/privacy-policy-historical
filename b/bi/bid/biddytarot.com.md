****2\. C** **ookies**  **

Information is automatically collected through your use of the Site, Affiliates’ websites and Apps, through cookies. Cookies are tiny text files that websites or apps may place on your computer or device.

**What cookies do we use?**

When you visit our Site, the following types of cookies may be downloaded to your device:

**Analytical and Performance Cookies**

We may use analytics service providers for website traffic analysis and reporting. Analytics service providers generate statistical and other information about the use of the Site by using cookies. They allow us to recognise and count the number of visitors and to see how often visitors return to the Site, how long they stay and how they move around the Site when they are using it. This helps us to improve the way our Site works, for example, by ensuring that users are finding what they are looking for easily. The information generated relating to the Site may be used to create reports about the use of the Site and the analytics service provider will also store this information.

**Advertising and Targeting Cookies**

These cookies record your visit to the Site, the pages you have visited and the links you have followed to other Sites. We will use this information to try and make the Site more relevant to your interests.

We work with technology partners to support the Site and to provide you with relevant information about the products and services on affiliated sites or sites within the advertising networks we work with. We may use cookies on our Site to help us to place relevant Biddy Tarot advertising on others’ sites when you visit such sites. We do this because we value your visit to our Site and hope that you will be interested in other Biddy Tarot offerings when you visit other sites. If you are not happy with this, please see the section of this policy titled “How do I turn cookies off below”.

**Functionality Cookies**

We may use functional cookies that allow us to remember choices you have made in relation to the Site so as to provide a more personalised experience and enhanced user experience by delivering content specific to your interests.

**Strictly Necessary Cookies**

These are cookies that are required for the administration and operation of our Site. Some cookies that we use are necessary for our Site to function properly and to enable you to move around the Site and use its features.

**Third Party Cookies**

We know you love to share the great content we have on the Site so we try to make it as easy as possible to do so. We add buttons to allow people to easily share on networks like Facebook and Twitter. We also use Facebook to power the commenting functionality on the Site.

Please note that when we include such social ‘plugins’, it gives those social networking site the flexibility to use cookies. They can’t read any cookies we set from the Site, and we can’t read any cookies they set, but it lets them do the same kind of traffic measuring that we do on the rest of the Site, and it also lets them know whether you’re logged in. For example, if you’re logged in to Facebook, read one of our blog posts and want to make a comment, you can do that straight away without having to log in to the Site again – we never know whether you’re logged in or not, as you communicate directly with Facebook, through their plugins on our site.

We don’t control the setting of these third-party cookies, so we suggest you check the third-party websites for more information about their cookies and how to manage them.

Other sites and services (including, for example, advertising networks, providers of external services like web traffic analysis services and content recommendation engines) may also use cookies, over which we have no control. These cookies are likely to be analytical/performance cookies or targeting cookies.

Our internet service providers may also use other standard web-based technologies to analyze your movements while accessing our Site. The technologies include analytic solutions, web “beacons,” “pixel tags,” and “clear gifs.” These technologies help us ascertain the effectiveness of our product and service campaigns and marketing programs, allow us to customize the services offered on or through our Site, and help determine the best use for Site content, and product and service offerings. Some of this information, including the IP address, may be stored on our internet service provider’s server logs, and may be available for extended periods of time.

**How do I turn cookies off?**

If you do not wish us to install cookies or you don’t agree with how we use cookies in any way, you can change the settings on your internet browser to delete or do not accept cookies. Please be aware that if you delete or do not accept our cookies, some areas of our Site that you access may take more time to work, or may not function properly.

**3\. Why we collect personal information**

_Main purposes_

The main purposes for which we collect, hold, use and disclose personal information are:

(a) processing transactions online;

(b) promoting us and our products and services, including through direct marketing, events and competitions, public relations and social media;

(c) performing research and statistical analysis, including for customer satisfaction and product and service improvement purposes. This may include matching information we collect against other information held by third parties. (We may also use and disclose de-identified data for these purposes);

(d) helping us tailor existing or develop new products, services or offers, and to help us selectively target promotional offers and opportunities;

(e) developing or seeking to deliver new ranges of products or services;

(f) protecting the security of our customers, suppliers and merchandise (including theft and fraud prevention);

(g) answering queries, resolving complaints and responding to social media; and

(h) general planning and administration.

We may also collect, hold, use and disclose personal information for other purposes explained at the time of collection or which are required or authorised by or under law, and for which you have provided consent.

_Direct marketing and opting out_ _ _

By providing your address, email address and telephone numbers to us you consent to us contacting you for the purposes set out above. We may send this information in a variety of ways, including by mail, email, social media, SMS, MMS, telephone.

If at any point you no longer wish us to hold your personal information or you do not wish to receive information from us then there are a number of ways you can unsubscribe:

(b) advising us if you receive a marketing call that you no longer wish to receive these calls; or

(c) using the unsubscribe link that we include in our electronic messages (eg email, SMS or MMS) to opt out of receiving those messages. Each “unsubscribe” link only relates to that specific type of communication (e.g. marketing communications or survey communications). This means that unsubscribing from marketing communications will not automatically unsubscribe you from our survey communications (or vice versa). Please also note that you may continue to receive communications which are already en route to you for a short period of time while your relevant unsubscribe request is being processed.

(b) our contracted service providers or partners, including: information technology service providers; venues and event organisers; marketing and communications agencies; research and statistical analysis providers; external business advisers (such as recruitment advisors, auditors and lawyers); and regulatory, investigative or government bodies to comply with laws.

We may ask one of these third parties to contact you directly for a specific purpose, and provide us with information collected from you in the course of providing the relevant products or services.

**5\. Data quality and security**
