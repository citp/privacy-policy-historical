<h1>Privacy policy</h1>
<p><strong>Effective Date: 01/01/2015</strong></p>

<p>This privacy policy applies to www.bidderplace.com owned and operated by Bidderplace GmbH. 
BidderPlace (“we”, “us”) is committed to protecting the privacy of your personally identifiable information. We provide this privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) in order to explain our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is used by us. You must agree to this Privacy Policy, in its entirety, including our use of cookies in order to: register an account (“Account”) with the BidderPlace marketplace (“Marketplace”) and log-into your Account as member of the Marketplace. Your acceptance of both this Privacy Policy and our use of cookies on the Site shall
be deemed a blanket acceptance of such Privacy Policy and cookie usage for
all future attempts to log in and access your Account. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy in its entirety, you are not authorized to register for an Account on the Marketplace.</p>

<p>Privacy Policies Used in Connection with Your Subscription.
When you register for an Account on the Marketplace, we use a password-protected third party portal to store your personal information, and we may share your personal information with such third party (“Third Party Agent”) as is necessary for the performance of your Account and the Marketplace.</p>

<p><strong>Personally Identifiable Information</strong></p>

<p>We collect personally identifiable information when you register for an Account or otherwise choose to provide personally identifiable information to us. Personally identifiable information is any information that can be used to identify or locate a particular person or entity. This may include, but is not limited to: business entity name and/or your title with the applicable business entity, as well as your personal and/or business entity related e-mail address, mailing address, daytime and/or cellular telephone numbers, fax number, account information (or other information that we require in order to pay any amounts due to you under the Marketplace) and/or any other information requested on the applicable Subscriber registration form. For purposes of this Privacy Policy, your account information shall be considered “Sensitive Information.”</p>

<p><strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</strong></p>

<p>We may collect certain non-personally identifiable information about you when you visit certain pages of this Site and/or register for an Account on the Marketplace, such as the type of browser you are using (e.g., Firefox, Internet Explorer, etc.), the type of operating system you are using, (e.g., Windows 8 or Mac OS) and the domain name of your Internet service provider (e.g., America Online, Earthlink), and share such information with our Third Party Agent. We use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect to
improve the design and content of the Site and to enable us to personalize your Internet experience. We also may use this information in the aggregate to analyze Site usage. We do link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information.</p>

<p><strong>Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</strong></p>

<p>To enhance your experience with the Site, we use “cookies.” You cannot register to the Subscription or log-in to the Marketplace without agreeing to accept the cookies that we use with the Site. For more specific information on the cookies we use, please see Exhibit A, below. Cookies are small packets of data stored on your computer. Cookies are used by your computer’s browser to store your preferences. Cookies, by themselves, do not
tell us your email address or other personally identifiable information. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. We use session cookies to understand Site usage and to improve the content and offerings on the Site. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. [We set a persistent cookie to store your passwords, so you don’t have to enter it more than once if you so choose]. You may set your browser to warn you that cookies are in use, or to block the use of cookies. Most browsers are set to
accept cookies. If your browser is not set to accept cookies, certain uses of the Site may require you to go to your browser user preferences to enable cookies. Each browser is different, so check the “Help” menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences. If you change computers, operating systems or browsers, or use multiple computers or browsers, you will need to repeat this process for each computer and each browser. To find out more about cookies, please visit www.cookiecentral.com.<br>
We may additionally collect information using Web beacons, which are commonly referred to in the industry as web bugs, pixel tags or Clear GIFs. Web beacons are electronic images that may be used on the Site, in your Account, or in our emails to deliver cookies, count visits and determine if an email has been opened and acted upon. We tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information.</p>

<p>We do not collect personally identifiable information about your end users. However, we do use cookies and other cookie-less tracking methods to track anonymous traffic data about your end users. When end users who visit member affiliate sites click on the advertisement(s) they have chosen to display through their Accounts on the Marketplace, we will utilize cookies and/or postbacks to track such end users activities at our advertiser site(s).</p>

<p><strong>Use of Information</strong></p>

<p>We use your personally identifiable information: (a) to send you information regarding your Account and the Marketplace; (b) to track your compliance with the Terms and Conditions (“Terms and Conditions”); and/or (c) for validation, suppression, content improvement and feedback purposes. You agree that we, or our Third Party Agent, may contact you at any time with updates and/or any other information that we may deem appropriate for you to receive in connection with your Account on the Marketplace.</p>

<p><strong>Information Sharing</strong></p>

<p>As a general rule, and other than in connection with the limited exceptions set forth below, we will not sell, share or rent your personally identifiable information to or with others. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may, from time to time, provide such information to certain third-party administrative vendors for efficiency purposes in providing administrative or program management services in connection with your Account. Any third-party vendor so used has agreed to protect the confidentiality of information provided by us and to use your personally identifiable information only as necessary to provide these services to us. Further, we reserve the right to share your
personally identifiable information: (a) where required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process or requested by a court of competent jurisdiction; (b) in the event of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets or stock, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Site of any change in ownership or uses of your personally identifiable information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your
personally identifiable information; (c) where you are in violation of this Privacy Policy, the Terms and Conditions and/or Services Agreement; (d) in the case of a dispute; or (e) where we determine, in our sole discretion, that such disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or a third party, or necessary to protect us from liability of any kind, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request. The aforementioned includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection.</p>

<p><strong>International Transfer of Data</strong></p>

<p>As part of your membership in the Marketplace, we may transfer information that we collect about you and your end users, including personally identifiable information, to affiliated entities, or to other third parties across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world. If you or your end users are located in the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that you are transferring information and permitting the transfer of information, including personally identifiable information, to a
country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction.

<p><strong>Security</strong></p>

<p>We endeavor to safeguard and protect our Account holders’ information.
When Account holders submit personally identifiable information to the
Marketplace, their personally identifiable information is protected both online and offline. When our registration process asks registrants to submit Sensitive Information (such as bank account information and/or credit card information), and when we transmit such Sensitive Information, that Sensitive Information is encrypted and protected with SSL encryption software. While we use SSL encryption to protect Sensitive Information online, we protect all other user information online and offline. The Third Party Agent servers that
we utilize to store personally identifiable information in are kept in a secure physical environment. The Third Party Agent has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of personally identifiable information stored on its servers. Please be advised that, although we take every reasonable precaution available to protect your data, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot warrant that your information will be absolutely secure. Any transmission of data at or through our Site is at your own risk. However, access to your personally identifiable information is strictly limited, and not accessible to the public. Only employees, and third party agents, that need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our employees are dedicated to ensuring the security and privacy of all user information. Employees not adhering to our written firm policies are subject to disciplinary action. In compliance with applicable federal and state laws, we shall notify you and any applicable regulatory agencies in the event that we learn of an information security breach with respect to your personally identifiable information. You will be notified via email in the event of such a breach. Please be advised that notice may be delayed in order to address the needs of law enforcement, determine the scope of network damage, and to engage in remedial measures. You acknowledge that you provide your personally identifiable information to us with knowledgeable consent and at your own risk.</p>

To protect your privacy and security, we will take reasonable steps to help verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.</p>
