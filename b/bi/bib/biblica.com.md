The type of information we collect is only the information necessary to facilitate our response to your specific request such as your name and contact information. If you request to have a resource sent to you, Biblica will collect the information necessary to complete this transaction that may include your contact information, credit card number, and other transaction information.

**What do we consider personal data for citizens of the European Union?**

Biblica operates in compliance of the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) as it pertains to how we handle and define data we collect from citizens of countries within the EU. For people under EU and GDPR jurisdiction, personal data is defined as:

 “any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person”.

**Use of Information**

Biblica retains all rights to use the information provided by you to:

  * Respond to your correspondence, questions, comments, suggestions, thoughts, opinions, prayers, concerns, or ideas to fulfill a resource request.
  * Process your request for resources from our online resource services.
  * Continually update, develop, design, and customize the content of our website to meet the needs, interests, and requests of our audience.

  * Whether or not your browsing session is tied to a Facebook account, Google account, or other non-account based online advertising networks that we utilize (We do this through tracking pixels which are automatically loaded when you open our website. These pixels allow us to track your behavior on our website. Depending on your activity, we may choose to target relevant advertising to you on Facebook, Google, or other platforms. You can opt out of our use of pixels to track your behavior by submitting our [contact us form](https://www.biblica.com/about/contact-us/), or contacting our GDPR Owner.)

Legal Processes. We may share all types of information with others as required by, or permitted by, law. This may include sharing information with governmental entities, or third parties in response to subpoenas, court orders, other legal process, or as we believe is necessary to exercise our legal rights, to defend against legal claims that have been brought against us, or to defend against possible legal claims that we determine in our sole discretion might be brought against us.

**How Do We Safeguard Personal Data of EU Citizens With Certain Rights Under GDPR**

When personal data being handled involves an individual who is a citizen of any country within the EU specifically, we take certain steps to ensure your personal data is protected under GDPR. These steps include, but are not limited to:

  * We ensure that your personal data does not get sent to third-party vendors who do not have specific business reasons to possess it. (i.e. We will send your data to companies that help us analyze your data on our behalf for our own business purposes. We will also send your data to third-party companies when we are obligated to do so due to contractual reasons.)
  * When we no longer require your data to fulfill any service for which it was initially retained, we will dispose of the data in line with Biblica’s data retention procedures. As a general rule, personal data is not manually saved for periods longer than necessary, but may exist on certain systems and platforms of ours indefinitely in backups and other forms of automated retention as needed, particularly when there are legal reasons for retention such as for income tax and audit purposes.
  * How long certain kinds of personal data should be kept may also be governed by specific business-sector requirements and agreed practices. Personal data may be held in addition to these periods depending on individual business needs.



**Specific Third-Party Companies and Organizations With Whom We May Share Information**

As generally stated above, we may share your information with many different third-parties. While this is not an exhaustive list, in general, here are some of the third-party companies, organizations, and platforms with which we work.

**How to Exercise Your GDPR Rights or Request Personal Data Under GDPR**

If you qualify for GDPR rights and are requesting information regarding the personal data we hold on you specifically, or if you wish to exercise any rights granted to you under GDPR, we require you to provide proof of your identity. This requires some work on your part, but also helps us insure that your data is protected from third-parties who may be requesting it on your behalf without your permission. GDPR related requests can be submitted via the following channels:

  * Our [Contact Us form](https://www.biblica.com/about/contact-us/)
  * By sending physical mail to offices at 1820 Jet Stream Drive, Colorado Springs, CO 80921

  * By emailing our Data Protection Officer (DPO)/GDPR Owner at [legal@biblica.com](mailto:legal@biblica.com)



To provide proof of your identity, please make a copy of at least one of the following documents: your passport, driver’s license, or birth certificate. Please also attach a copy of a bank or credit card statement or utility bill from within the last three months that clearly shows your current address. If you have changed your name, please provide valid evidence of your legal name change as it pertains to your identity documentation.

If you are unable to provide the above documentation, or if we have reason to believe an unauthorized third party may have compromised your identity and is requesting your information on your behalf, we reserve the right to request that the above evidence be witnessed and notarized by a Notary Public, or in extreme cases, submitted through official channels including your legal representation or counsel.  We also reserve the right to consider alternate forms of identification should you be unable to comply with the above standards. Finally, we reserve the right to refuse to act on your request if we have exhausted all reasonable means of verifying your identity and remain unable to verify that you are who you claim to be.

Additionally, if you are requesting the personal data of somebody else or are requesting that we act upon certain GDPR rights of somebody else, you are required to submit proof of your own identity and proof of your legal authority to make requests on behalf of the data subject (the individual whose data we possess), including one of the following items:

  * Written consent signed by the data subject (in certain circumstances at our discretion, we reserve the right to require this letter to be notarized)
  * A certified Power of Attorney document
  * Proof that you have parental rights over the data subject if they are legally considered a child



If any part of your request is unclear or requires further clarification of any sort, we will contact you before processing your request. If we are unable to process your request for any reason, we will contact you with an explanation. If the data you request would compromise the personal data or rights of another individual or individuals, we will first contact the applicable parties to secure permission to include their data in your request. We will also contact you if another individual’s request would compromise your own personal data or personal rights.

Certain laws may allow or require us to deny processing of your information or provision of your personal information. Additionally, if we have destroyed or have made your personal data anonymous (as GDPR allows) as part of our data security and integrity practices, we will be unable to provide it to you. In this case, your personally identifiable data either no longer exists or can no longer be used to identify you both in our internal and external systems.
