Your personal information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of persons who have special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential.</p><p class="privacy__text">We implement a variety of security measures when a user enters, submits, or accesses their information to maintain the safety of your personal information.</p><h2 class="privacy__subtitle">Do we use 'cookies'?</h2><p class="privacy__text">Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the site's or service provider's systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information. They are also used to help us understand your preferences based on previous or current site activity, which enables us to provide you with improved services. We also use cookies to help us compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future. This helps us understand and save users’ preferences for future visits. It also allows us to compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interactions in order to offer better site experiences and tools in the future. We may also use trusted third-party services that track this information such as site behavior on our behalf.</p><p class="privacy__text">We honor Do Not Track signals and don’t plant cookies or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.</p><p class="privacy__text">You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser settings. Since each browser is a little different, look at your browser's Help Menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies.</p><p class="privacy__text">If you turn cookies off, some of the features that make our site experience more efficient may not function properly.</p><h2 class="privacy__subtitle">Third-party disclosure</h2><p class="privacy__text">We do not sell to outside parties your Personally Identifiable Information unless an action is performed in partnership with other companies (such as entering a sweepstakes). This does not include website hosting partners and other parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or serving our users, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release information when its release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others' rights, property or safety.</p><p class="privacy__text">However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.</p><h2 class="privacy__subtitle">Third-party links</h2><p class="privacy__text">Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third-party products or services on our website or via email. These third-party sites have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our brand and welcome any feedback about these sites.</p><h2 class="privacy__subtitle">Ad Integrations</h2><p class="privacy__text">We use Google AdSense Advertising, Taboola, Liveintent, PowerInbox, and other ad networks on our website and within our emails. All third-party vendors use cookies to serve ads on our site. This enables them to serve ads to our users based on previous visits to our site and other sites on the Internet.</p><p class="privacy__text">We, along with third-party vendors such as Google, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookies) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) or other third-party identifiers together to compile data regarding user interactions with ad impressions and other ad service functions as they relate to our website.</p><h2 class="privacy__subtitle">California Online Privacy Protection Act</h2><p class="privacy__text">CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. - See more at: <a class="privacy__link privacy__link--sleeper" href="http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf" target="_blank">http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf</a></p><p class="privacy__text">According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:</p><ul class="privacy__list"><li class="privacy__item">Users can visit our site anonymously.</li><li class="privacy__item">Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page.</li><li class="privacy__item">Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy' and can easily be found on the page specified above.</li><li class="privacy__item">You will be notified of any Privacy Policy changes on our Privacy Policy Page.</li><li class="privacy__item">You can change your personal information by emailing us.</li></ul><h2 class="privacy__subtitle">COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h2><p class="privacy__text">When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States' consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online. We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.</p><h2 class="privacy__subtitle">GDPR</h2><p class="privacy__text">GDPR was implemented in the European Union in order to better protect user’s privacy and ensure that company’s use of data is both tangible and legitimate. Bible Trivia upholds this law by not sharing your data with unauthorized parties (such as credit agencies), and not requiring you to provide personal information to us.</p><p class="privacy__text">Bible Trivia allows subscribers to unsubscribe at any time and be removed from our database. If you decide that you would like to stop receiving emails, simply click the Unsubscribe button on the bottom of the email and we will not contact you again.</p><h2 class="privacy__subtitle">Fair Information Practices</h2><p class="privacy__text">The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information. In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices, we will notify you via email within 7 business days should a data breach occur.</p><h2 class="privacy__subtitle">CAN SPAM Act</h2><p class="privacy__text">The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.</p><p class="privacy__text">We collect your email address in order to:</p><ul class="privacy__list"><li class="privacy__item">Send trivia questions, information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions.</li><li class="privacy__item">Market with relevant deals and offers.</li></ul><p class="privacy__text">To be in accordance with CANSPAM, we agree to the following:</p><ul class="privacy__list"><li class="privacy__item">Not use false or misleading subjects or email addresses.</li><li class="privacy__item">Identify the message as an advertisement in some reasonable way.</li><li class="privacy__item">Include the physical address of our business or site headquarters.</li><li class="privacy__item">Monitor third-party email marketing services for compliance, if one is used.</li><li class="privacy__item">Honor opt-out/unsubscribe requests quickly.</li><li class="privacy__item">Allow users to unsubscribe by using the link at the bottom of each email.</li></ul><p class="privacy__text">If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, you can click the Unsubscribe link at the bottom of any email and we will promptly remove you from ALL correspondence.</p><h2 class="privacy__subtitle">Contacting Us</h2><p class="privacy__text">If there are any questions regarding this privacy policy, you may contact us using the information below.</p><p class="privacy__text">Bible Trivia<br>10428 Bluegrass Parkway, Suite 539<br>Louisville, KY 40299<br><a href="mailto:hello@bibletrivia.com" class="privacy__link">hello@bibletrivia.com</a><br></p></section></main></div></div></div><div class="banner"><div class="banner__container"><div class="banner__logo"><a href="/"><img class="banner__logo-image" src="/images/logo-footer.png" alt="Bible Trivia Logo"></a></div><div class="banner__username">Menu</div><div class="menu"><div class="linework linework__menu linework__mobile"><div class="linework linework__middle"></div></div><div class="menu__window-container" aria-hidden="true"><div class="menu__window"><div class="menu__header"><div class="menu__header-content"><div class="menu__header-username">Bible Trivia</div><div class="linework linework__menu menu__header-linework"><div class="linework linework__middle"></div></div></div></div><ul class="menu__nav-primary"><a class="menu__nav-primary-item" href="/">Home</a><a class="menu__nav-primary-item" href="/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a></ul></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><script async="" src="/builds/privacyPolicy.js"></script></body></html>
