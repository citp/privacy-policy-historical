    * We use several third party tracking services such as Facebook and Google Analytics to provide a better, more customized experience for our users and identify the content that is most relevant to them. These platforms track information that allows them to associate demographics that you may have shared with them such as age, gender, occupation, location, etc. This information can be used to identify you, and we use it to share promotional messages and targeted ads with you on these platforms.
    * We provide your information to partners for the purpose of sending you relevant information regarding content they create. This only happens in rare circumstances, and you must specifically opt-in to receive partner content or information.
    * We take all reasonable measures to ensure that your personally identifiable information remains private. However, in the event that we are required to disclose personally identifiable information by a court, the police or other law enforcement bodies for lawful reasons, we will make such a disclosure without being in violation of this Policy.
