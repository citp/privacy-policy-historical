<h2><a name="Art3" id="Art3"></a>ARTICLE 3</h2>
<h3>How Bibleinfo.com Handles Privacy Internally</h3>
<p>Bibleinfo.com wants your personal information to remain as secure as reasonably
	possible. That is why we have a two-tier system at Bibleinfo.com that combines
	leading technical safeguards and a code of conduct for those employees that
	are permitted to access our customers' personal information. On the technical
	side, Bibleinfo.com uses all means available to help ensure the integrity and
	privacy of the Personal Information you provide to us via the Internet. As an
	additional security measure, your Personal Information is also kept physically
	separate on a separate server. On the employee side, only authorized Bibleinfo.com
	employees are permitted to access your personal information. All Bibleinfo.com
	employees must abide by our Privacy Policy and those who violate our Privacy
	Policy are subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination. </p>

<h3>Your Privacy Choices</h3>
<p>You may opt out of submitting your Personal Information at the time you provide
	the information necessary to facilitate your request.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade">

<h2><a name="Art5" id="Art5"></a>ARTICLE 5</h2>
<h3>Updating Your Personal Information and Contacting Bibleinfo.com</h3>
<p>We will always strive to make the changing of your personal options as easy
	as possible. </p>
<p>You can always contact us in order to (i) delete your Personal Information

<h2><a name="Art6" id="Art6"></a>ARTICLE 6</h2>
<h3>Protection of Credit Card information</h3>
<h4>How do you protect my personal information?</h4>
<p>We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by
	using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input.
	When you make donations, you do so using our secure server. This makes donating
	to Bibleinfo.com over the Internet as secure as donating by telephone.</p>
<p>You can tell if you are on our secure server in two ways: a key or closed
	lock will be visible in the lower portion of your browser, or "https" will
	appear in either the address portion of your browser or in the URL of a selected
	hyperlink. For greater protection of your data, we recommend that you use a
	web-browser that supports 128-bit encryption.</p>
<h4>Do you guarantee against fraudulent use of my credit card?</h4>
<p>Your credit card is protected whenever you make a donation on Bibleinfo.com.
	If any unauthorized charges appear on your credit card statement within three
	months of your last Bibleinfo.com transaction, report this fraud to your
	credit card provider and contact us immediately using our phone number: 1-509-838-2761.</p>
<p>Most credit card companies cover all charges resulting from credit card fraud
	or may limit your responsibility to $50, the maximum allowed under the Fair
	Credit Billing Act. If your credit card provider charges you for unauthorized
	transactions resulting from a donation on Bibleinfo.com, we will cover this
	liability, up to $50, so long as certain terms and conditions are met. Bibleinfo.com
	is committed to making sure you're covered.</p>
<p>For more information, read our <a href="/donate/ccfaq.html">Credit Card
		Guarantee FAQ</a>.
	There you can learn how to report an unauthorized charge and how soon you
	can expect your claim to be resolved.</p>
