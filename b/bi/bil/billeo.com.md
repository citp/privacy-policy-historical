  | **How do we protect visitor information?** |   |    
  |   |   |    
  | We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information. Your personal information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of persons who have special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. When you place orders or access your personal information, we offer the use of a secure server. All sensitive/credit information you supply is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our databases to be only accessed as stated above. |   |    
  |   |   |    
  | **Do we use "cookies"?** |   |    
  |   |   |    
  | Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the site's or service provider's systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information. For instance, we use cookies to help us remember and process the items in your shopping cart. They are also used to help us understand your preferences based on previous or current site activity, which enables us to provide you with improved services. We also use cookies to help us compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.  |   |    
  |   |   |    
  | We may contract with third-party service providers to assist us in better understanding our site visitors. These service providers are not permitted to use the information collected on our behalf except to help us conduct and improve our business.  |   |    
  |   |   |    
  | You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser (like Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer) settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies. If you turn cookies off, you won't have access to many features that make your site experience more efficient and some of our services will not function properly. However, you can still place orders over the telephone by contacting customer service.   
|   |    
  |   |   |    
  | **Do we disclose the information we collect to outside parties?** |   |    
  |   |   |    
  | We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information unless we provide you with advance notice, except as described below. The term "outside parties" does not include Billeo, Inc. It also does not include website hosting partners and other parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others' rights, property, or safety. |   |    
  |   |   |    
  | However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.  |   |    
  |   |   |    
  | **Idle-Time Protection** |   |    
  |   |   |    
  | The default setting is to automatically sign you into the service anytime you open a browser. You can turn this feature off, and optionally set an inactivity timer to suit your convenience. After the chosen minutes of inactivity on your browser, you will be automatically logged out of Billeo. This helps protect you, if you forget to logout. |   |    
  |   |   |    
  | **How can you opt-out, remove or modify information you have provided to us?** |   |    
  |   |   |    
  | To modify your e-mail subscriptions, please let us know by modifying your preferences in the "Preferences" section. Please note that due to e-mail production schedules you may receive any e-mails already in production. 

To delete all of your online account information from our database, sign into the "Preferences" section of our site and remove your shipping addresses, billing addresses & payment information. Please note that we may maintain information about an individual sales transaction in order to service that transaction and for record keeping. 

If your personally identifiable information changes you may correct, update, or delete it by making the change on our member profile page or by e-mailing us at support@billeo.com. 

If you no longer desire our service, you may uninstall the Billeo Toolbar and cancel your account at any time using the Uninstall menu option in the Billeo Toolbar or by using the Add/Remove programs function on your PC. Doing so removes the Billeo Toolbar and all of its associated files except for the Vault files that contain your private information (i.e. your encrypted password, contact and payment information which you stored using the Billeo service). We leave the Vault files on your system after uninstall because this data is yours. So, if you need to access this information again you'll need these files. If you wish to remove these files from your system please follow the steps defined in the [FAQ](https://web.archive.org/faqs/faq92.jsp).
