We may post additional information if more details are needed to explain our privacy practices.

We also collect information on the purchases you have made, such as product details, confirmation numbers, and payment instrument used.

For more information about how we secure your stored information, see the section entitled “How we protect the information we collect.”

**Information from Open Authorization Sources**

If you register using an Open Authorization source, such as Facebook, we will gather available payment and address information (as described above) from that source directly.  That information will be treated as if you had given us the information directly.  For example, if you register using Facebook, we will gather your e-mail address from Facebook and will treat that information as if you had given it to us directly.

**Cookies**

We do not use or place cookies.

**Automatic Information**  
To help us understand and enhance our interactions with users of our Services, we may collect information on our service using automated tools. These tools will only collect data for analysis purposes on aggregate, not individual, information.

Sometimes we may be required to share personal information in response to a regulation, court order or subpoena. We may also share information when we believe it’s necessary to comply with the law. We may also share information to respond to a government request or when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to protect the rights, property or safety of Billeo, our customers, or others; to prevent harm or loss; or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual unlawful activity.

We may also share personal information in the event of a corporate sale, merger, acquisition, dissolution or similar event.

## HOW WE PROTECT THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT

We are PCI level 1 compliant, which means that we use security measures to protect the confidentiality of personal information under our control and appropriately limit access to it. Billeo, Inc. cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk.

We use a variety of information security measures to protect your online transactions with us.
