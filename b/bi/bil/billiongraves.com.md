As a general policy, BillionGraves does not provide refunds for purchased services, such as Banner Advertising or BillionGraves Plus accounts. Refunds may be allowed if a customer's service is not working for reasons within the control of BillionGraves, or if an error has been made by BillionGraves on charges to the customers.

If a customer requests a refund, it must be requested within 30 days of a charge, and the customer must also supply a reason for the refund request. If BillionGraves determines a refund is appropriate, the money for the requested transaction is refunded back to the customer. If the refund is for a recurring billing product, then the return policy allows for the most recent payment to be returned. A refund on a recurring billing product will also result in a cancellation of future service.

If customers request a cancellation for their recurring billing product no future charges will be charged to their account. Keep in mind, a cancellation will not generate a refund - it will only stop any future charges.
