When you become a subscriber of birth.com.au, you will be provided with a unique user ID or passcode.  You can change this passcode by going to your 'account' page once logged on. You will be required to provide your name and email address. If you live outside Australia, your residential address is also required if you are not paying Australian GST .  You may also be asked to provide additional information such as your gender and age group.  Information of this type is optional and need only be provided if you wish to do so.
<br>
<br>To subscribe to birth.com.au, you may click on the NAB symbol displayed on the payment page of the website.  This will link you to the National Australia Bank, which will record your credit card and payment details.  The NAB will then email us with confirmation of payment and email you with the receipt.  We will not see any credit card details unless you elect to pay our subscription fees by fax, telephone or mail.  If you do provide us with credit card details, we will hold them in the strictest confidence. 
<br>
<br>Birthnet does not use "cookies" (text files containing information about your website preferences which is stored by your browser on your hard disk).  However, it is the requirement of the National Bank's Secure Internet Payment Service (N-SIPS) that all subscribers paying by credit card via the internet have their Web browser option 'on' to accept cookies to facilitate their one-off payment. Cookies are used to participate as a user in the 'birthtalks' forums to hold your username, password and viewing options to allow you to login. IP addresses can be viewed by Birthnet administrators in the birthtalks discussion forums, but are not used for tracking to retrieve personal information from your computer.
<br>
<br>The only way Birthnet can know who each member is, is if the member logs on using their user name and password.  When the member does this, it allows us to:
<br>
<br>a) Provide access to each member's account information and the services available to them as members of birth.com.au; and
<br>
<br>b) Track each member's progress through the site and the time they spend so that we can better understand how the site is used and make improvements to its functionality.
<br>
<br>Birthnet may also ask members for personal information at other times, including (but not limited to) member surveys, contests or promotions sponsored by birth.com.au or when a member reports a problem with our site or services.  If a member submits feedback about our site's features and content, we will keep a record of that correspondence.  Wherever birth.com.au collects personal information we will include a link to our Privacy Policy on this page.
