Our main party site, BirthdayPartyIdeas.com does collect personal data that is voluntarily submitted by our readers when submitting a party idea. Most reader submissions are limited to an e-mail address, first name and general location (usually city, state & country). Readers who have won awards submit additional information so that the award can be delivered to the reader. Reader ideas that are included in the BirthdayPartyIdeas.com site are accompanied with the reader's first name and general location (usually city, state & country).  We currently do not publish a newsletter or distribute e-mail advertisements. Readers who have submitted ideas do not receive follow-up correspondence unless they win an award, ask a question of our team, or our team has a question for the reader, etc. 

We reserve the right to change this policy at any time.
