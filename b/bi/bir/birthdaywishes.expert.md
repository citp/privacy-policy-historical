### **1\. Introduction**

Thanks for visiting Birthday Wishes Expert. This website was designed to provide wishes, quotes and inspiration for everyday human activities.

This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the www.birthdaywishes.expert website.

BY ACCESSING AND USING THIS WEBSITE OR BY DOWNLOADING ANY MATERIAL (FILES, IMAGES, SOUNDS, etc,), YOU ACCEPT THE PRACTICES OUTLINED IN AND AGREE TO GIVE YOUR CONSENT TO THE FOLLOWING PRIVACY POLICY. IF ANY OF THE TERMS IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY IS SOMETHING YOU DISAGREE WITH, PLEASE EXERCISE YOUR RIGHT AS A FREE INTERNET USER BY LEAVING THIS WEBSITE.

### **2\. Our Commitment to Privacy**

Here at Birthday Wishes Expert your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this Privacy Policy notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.

In order to make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our home page and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested.

### **3\. Personal Information We Collect:**

If you are a registered user of the Birthday Wishes Expert website, you have been asked to provide your name, e-mail address, username, and password.

On some pages of Birthday Wishes Expert, you can submit ideas, make comments and requests, and register to receive materials. The types of personal information collected on these pages are your name and e-mail address.

Any ideas you may submit, including text, photo and video become the property of Birthday Wishes Expert. Please read carefully the Terms and Conditions prior to submitting your ideas.

As a user of our website, you may request that we export and send you all the data we keep about you or that we delete all your data on our server. (see 11)

Certain information we collect is non-personal (see 4) and may not by itself lead to an identifiable person, but could become personal information when combined with other information. Examples of that non-personal information include your IP address and your GPS location.

We have no access to the missing information that would lead to an identifiable person. However, we might be legally obliged to disclose non-personal information to government authorities or confidentially to legal counsels of our website, in cases like the enforcement of the law by electronic crime services or through court orders, the exercise of our legal rights, the protection of our website from an attack or the protection of our users, partners or collaborators as regards to any legal action.

### **4\. Anonymous/Non-Personal Information We Collect:**

When you visit the www.birthdaywishes.expert website, we automatically collect basic non-personal information (that doesn’t lead to an identifiable person) including the address of your internet service provider (IP address), the web page that directed you to our site (referring URL), your web browser software, your operating system, your screen resolution and other non-personal data about your computer, mobile device and internet connection, and the pages you visited while on the www.birthdaywishes.expert website, as well as the time you spent at our website.

### **5\. Why Collect Information Anyway?**

Collecting information on our website has clearly no intention of targeting anyone – quite the contrary. Ideally, we, as website owners and operators, would like to do the absolute best for you without having to keep data about you (unless you’d really like us to 😉 ).

However, this is impossible. Anonymous data help us create the best content for our users, and even more. They help us make conclusions through the process of statistical data in order for you to get what you came for in the first place.

Data analysis is important to the improvement of our website’s content, find potential weaknesses and prevent fraud. It helps keep the site in operation and provide customer service and support.

Your preferences and subscription data help us communicate with you and they show us what you like so that we generate more of that.

### **6\. Cookies and Web Beacons**

www.birthdaywishes.expert does use cookies to store information about visitors’ preferences, record user-specific information on which pages the users access or visit, customize web page content based on visitors’ browser type or other information that the visitor sends via their browser.

To read more information about browser cookies, visit [http://www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/).

### **7\. Log Files**

Like many other websites, www.birthdaywishes.expert makes use of log files. The information inside the log files includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, type of browser, Internet Service Provider (ISP), date/time stamp, referring/exit pages, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track users’ movement around the site, and gather demographic information. IP addresses and other such information are not linked to any information that is personally identifiable.

In order for our website to operate normally, the non-personal information we keep in log files is by default shared with our web hosting provider whose server we use.

### **8\. The Way We Use Information**

We use non-identifying and aggregate information (non-personal) to better design our website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell a service or an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals.

We only use return e-mail addresses to answer the e-mail we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.

We never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.

Finally, we never disclose or share personal information, but there are cases where we might be legally obliged to disclose non-personal information when it comes to law enforcement (see 3).

### **9\. Third Party Advertising**
