The type of PII we collect will vary by App, but may include both precise and non-precise geolocation information for purposes such as to provide you with access to local service, offers and promotions relevant to the App (e.g., coupons for local stores).

**Notice to California Customers – Your California Privacy Rights**

California’s “Shine the Light” law, Civil Code section 1798.83, requires certain businesses to respond to requests from California customers asking about the businesses’ practices related to disclosing personal information to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. Alternately, such businesses may have in place a policy not to disclose personal information of customers to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes if the customer has exercised an option to opt-out of such information-sharing. We have such a policy in place. As discussed above, if you wish to opt-out of our sharing of your information with third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes, or to find out more about your opt-out rights and how we comply with this law, please contact us at the email address or postal address described above.

Any California residents under the age of eighteen (18) who have registered to use the Service, and who posted content or information on the Service, can request removal by contacting us at the email address or postal address described above.  We will then make reasonable good faith efforts to remove the post from prospective public view or anonymize it so the minor cannot be individually identified to the extent required by applicable law. This removal process cannot ensure complete or comprehensive removal. For instance, third-parties may have republished or archived content by search engines and others that Company does not control.

**Third Party Advertising and Analytics**

We may also use third parties to serve ads on the Service. Certain third parties may automatically collect information about your visits to this and other websites, your IP address, your ISP, the browser you use to visit the Service (but not your name, address, email address or telephone number). They do this by using cookies, clear gifs or other Tracking Technologies (defined below). Information collected may be used, among other things, to deliver advertising targeted to your interests and to better understand the usage and visitation of the Service and the other sites and services tracked by these third parties (“Interest-based Advertising”). We are not responsible for Tracking Technologies in or related to third party ads, and we encourage you to check the privacy policies of advertisers and/or ad services to learn about their use of cookies and other technology.

You may choose whether to receive some Interest-based Advertising by submitting opt-outs. One of the third party ad servers that delivers Interest-based Advertising to you is Doubleclick. For Doubleclick’s Privacy Policy, [click here](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/). Some of the other advertisers and service providers that perform advertising-related services for us and third parties may participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance’s (“DAA”) Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. To learn more about how you can exercise certain choices regarding Interest-based Advertising, visit <http://www.aboutads.info/choices/>, and <http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices> for information on the DAA’s opt-out program for mobile apps.  Some of these companies may also be members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”). To learn more about the NAI and your opt-out options for their members, see <http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/>. Please be aware that, even if you are able to opt out of certain kinds of Interest-based Advertising, you may continue to receive other types of ads.  Opting out only means that those selected members should no longer deliver certain Interest-based Advertising to you, but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads ( _e.g._ , from other ad networks). Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit these opt-out webpages, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different device or web browsers or use a non-browser-based method of access ( _e.g._ , mobile app), your NAI / DAA browser-based opt-out may not, or may no longer, be effective.  We support the ad industry’s **2009 Self-regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising**  (<http://www.iab.net/media/file/ven-principles-07-01-09.pdf> _)_  and expect that ad networks Company directly engages to serve you Interest-based Advertising will do so as well, though we cannot guaranty their compliance.  We are not responsible for effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-parties’ opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs.

Company may use Google Analytics, Adobe Analytics or other service providers for analytics services.  These analytics services may use cookies and other Tracking Technologies to help us analyze Service users and how they use the Service.  Information generated by these services ( _e.g._ , your IP address and other usage information) may be transmitted to and stored by these service providers on servers in the U.S. (or elsewhere) and these service providers may use this information for purposes such as evaluating your use of the Service, compiling statistic reports on the Service’s activity, and providing other services relating to Service activity and other Internet usage. You may exercise choices regarding the use of cookies from Google Analytics by going to <https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout> or downloading the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on. You may exercise choices regarding the use of cookies from Adobe Analytics by going to <http://www.adobe.com/privacy/opt-out.html> under the section labeled “Tell our customers not to measure your use of their websites or tailor their online ads for you.”

We may use information collected using Tracking Technologies on and in our emails to deliver Company advertising displayed to you on third party sites. We also may use Tracking Technologies information to know when you return to the Service after visiting these third party sites or when you go to a third party site or service after visiting the Service.  We may use this information and other information about you, for purposes such as to try to understand your interests and show you relevant Company advertising about products and services you may need.

**Cookies, Web Beacons and Server Logs**

Company, and third parties such as related Web hosting providers, and advertisers and ad serving and tracking companies, sometimes utilize “cookie” technology and other tracking technologies now and hereafter developed (“Tracking Technologies”) on or in connection with the Service. Cookies are bits of data stored on your hard drive that contain no personally identifying information (but may associate a unique identifier with your device). Not all Web browsers accept cookies, and those that do usually provide a preference or setting that allows you to refuse and remove most types of browser cookies. If your browser does not accept cookies, you may still enjoy the Service but not all features and functionality may work.

We may also use local shared objects, also known as Flash cookies, to store your preferences such as volume control for videos, or display content based upon what you view on the Service to personalize your visit. Third party partners provide certain features on the Service and may display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity, using Flash cookies to help track and store information about you. Flash cookies are different from browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored. Cookie management tools provided by your browser usually will not remove Flash cookies. To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for certain Flash cookies [click here](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html#117118).

We may collect information using Web beacons. Web beacons are electronic images that may be used on the Service or in our emails. We may use Web beacons to deliver cookies, count visits, understand usage and campaign effectiveness and to tell if an email has been opened and acted upon.

Server logs capture certain non-personally identifying data (but do track device identifiers), such as the time and date of a Web visit, the browser and operating system being used, and the Web URL a user linked from. This information for various purposes, such as use in aggregate form to help us plan system enhancements when necessary and to provide content that is compatible with our visitors’ Web-browsing systems. We also collect information about keyword searches performed by visitors on the Service. We do not collect your name or email address as a result of using a search feature. We may keep logs of all words searched to help us learn what kinds of information Service visitors are seeking, and to improve our Service.

Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to online services you visit. Note, however, there is no consensus among industry participants as to what “Do Not Track” means in this context.  Like many online services, we currently do not alter our practices when the Service receives a “Do Not Track” signal from a visitor’s browser.  To find out more about “Do Not Track,” you can visit [http://www.allaboutdnt.com](http://www.allaboutdnt.com/), but we are not responsible for the completeness or accuracy of this third party information. Some third parties, however, may offer you choices regarding their Tracking Technologies, such as is described above regarding analytics and Interest-based Advertising. One way to potentially identify cookies on our Service is to add the free Ghostery plug-in to your browser ([ **www.ghostery.com**](http://www.ghostery.com/)), which according to Ghostery will display for you traditional, browser-based cookies associated with the websites (but not mobile apps) you visit and privacy and opt-out policies and options of the parties operating those cookies.

**Privacy and Security Precaution Warning**

Please note that no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. As a result, we cannot guarantee the security of the information that you transmit via the Service.

If you are accessing the Service from outside of the U.S., please be aware that information collected through the Service may be transferred to, processed, stored, and used in the U.S. Data protection laws in the U.S. may be different from those of your country of residence.
