Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy. By visiting the Big Think's website at http://www.bigthink.com ("bigthink.com"), or using any of our services, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy. 

###  What Does This Privacy Policy Cover? 

This Privacy Policy covers Big Think's treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") that Big Think gathers when you are accessing bigthink.com and when you use our services. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Big Think does not own or control, or to individuals that Big Think does not employ or manage. 

###  What Personal Information Does Big Think display or Collect? 

The information we gather from users enables us to personalize and improve our services, and to allow our users to set up a user account and profile that can be used to interact with other users through bigthink.com. In connection with bigthink.com, we request and display some personal information to other users and visitors of bigthink.com, which allows users to identify each other. 

We collect the following types of information from our users. 

  1. _Personal Information You Provide to Us:_ We receive and store any information you enter on bigthink.com or provide to us in any other way. The types of Personal Information collected include or may include in the future your name, age, gender, e-mail address, income, and hometown. You may choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features. The Personal Information you provide is used for such purposes as responding to your requests for certain information, products and services, customizing the advertising and content you see, and communicating with you about specials and new features. You may modify or remove any of your personal information at any time by logging into your account and accessing features to edit your profile and account information. 

  2. _Personal Information Collected Automatically:_ We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with bigthink.com or obtain services from us. Big Think automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, Big Think cookie information, and the page you requested. We also record the details of your transactions on bigthink.com. 

Generally, our service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our site and its components, similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show. Big Think only uses this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often users use parts of bigthink.com or services so that we can make bigthink.com appealing to as many users as possible, and improve those services. As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our users, collectively, use our site. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use their services and bigthink.com, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal online experience. Again, Big Think never discloses aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally. 

  3. _E-mail Communications:_ We often receive a confirmation when you open an e-mail from Big Think if your computer supports this type of program. Big Think uses this confirmation to help us make e-mails more interesting and helpful. We also compare our user list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our users.
