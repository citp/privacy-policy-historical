# BIGLIST Privacy Policy

Befitting our philosophy of strictly opt-in participation, we at BIGLIST Inc. are committed to protecting your privacy. 

We collect information about visitors to BIGLIST.com, BIGLIST clients, and BIGLIST clients' list subscribers in several different ways, and we use the information to provide service and support and to evaluate the effectiveness of our web site. 

We do not sell, rent, or share this information with anyone outside BIGLIST. Confidential information will not be disclosed unless legally required. 

### Information Collected by BIGLIST and How This Information is Used

We collect the following types of information under the following circumstances for the following reasons. 

#### Personally-identifiable information

  * If you choose to fill out the ["Contact Form"](http://biglist.com/2BigList/contact/) on our website, we record the following information (as provided): your name, email address, company, and phone number. We request this information so that we can answer your pre-sales questions and inform you of important company and service news. 
  * If you are a subscriber on a BIGLIST client's mailing list and you choose to log into your individual subscriber account, we record your email address and your mailing list preferences. We request this information so that we can honor your preferences regarding your participation on current and future mailing lists. 
  * If you are a BIGLIST client, we record: 
    * information you provide to us through the ["Order Form"](http://biglist.com/2BigList/order) so that we may fulfill your orders and provide ongoing customer support; 
    * your confidential billing information for billing purposes only; and 
    * your policies regarding no spam or voluntary (i.e., opt-in) subscriber requirements. 
  * If you designate yourself as a List Owner or Moderator for a BIGLIST mailing list, i.e., an email list hosted by BIGLIST, we record your email address and subscribe you to the BIGLIST Listowner's list for information and updates about our service. You can request not to be subscribed to this list by writing to us at  [ info@biglist.com](mailto:info@biglist.com), and instructions for unsubscribing are included in the trailer at the bottom of each message for List Owners. 



We store this personally-identifiable information on our own restricted-access servers, and we retain it for our permanent company records. If you need to update your contact information, please email [sales@BIGLIST.com](mailto:sales@BIGLIST.com). 

#### Non-personally-identifiable information

We also collect non-personally-identifiable information, including web logs and mail logs. Our web logs include information, which is typical of many web logs: browser and processor type, IP address, and the web site visited before arriving at our site. Our mail logs include information regarding message deliveries, which we use to evaluate system performance. 

We may also track the pages visited within our site. We may use this information to better understand our visitors, and to evaluate the appeal or effectiveness of various sections of our site. We store this information on our own restricted-access servers. 

#### Cookies

BIGLIST uses cookies to maintain the log-in state of clients or subscribers interacting with the BIGLIST system through a BIGLIST administrative interface or individual subscriber account. 

#### How We Protect Your Information

We record the personally-identifiable and non-personally-identifiable information described above on our own restricted-access servers and databases. We do not sell, rent, or share this information with anyone outside BIGLIST, and access to it is restricted to employees and contractors of BIGLIST who have a specific, job-related need for it. 

Prospective customers occasionally ask us for references by existing clients, and we may contact you for permission to provide your name as a reference. We will not divulge your contact information without your explicit permission. 

#### Your Quotes and Company Name

To promote our company, we post certain quotes by our clients on BIGLIST.com , including the name of the individual or source of the quote, and a link to the client's home page, if applicable. We may ask your permission to include a quote by you on the appropriate web site, but will only do so upon being granted explicit permission. 

In addition, we may choose to post a list of selected clients on BIGLIST.com , and we may include your company's name in this list unless you let us know that you do not want to be included in this list. This listing will also include a link to your company's home page, if applicable. 

#### Information For All BIGLIST Clients

By signing up for our service, you are entrusting us with your list information, including list subscribers and message content. As part of our service, we provide you with a list administration interface, and we also have access to this interface in order to provide continuing customer support and to upgrade our service from time to time. 

#### Information Provided to List Subscribers

We are contacted occasionally by people who are subscribed to our clients' mailing lists. These people typically have a question or request regarding the list to which they are subscribed, but have not been able to contact the List Owner directly. 

We may contact these people and provide them with the appropriate List Owner's email address so that they may resolve any issues, or we may provide them with our policies or the client's policies regarding their voluntary subscriber requirement. We will not, however, divulge any other, confidential contact information in our records. If necessary, we may contact the List Owner ourselves and pass on the list subscriber's request. 

#### Links On Our Site

BIGLIST.com contains links to other web sites that we believe may be of interest to our visitors. Please be aware that BIGLIST Inc. is not responsible for the privacy policies of those other sites.
