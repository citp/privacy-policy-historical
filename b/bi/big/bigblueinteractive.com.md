Please be aware that whenever you post personal information online, through bulletin boards or e-mail, that this information can be collected and used by others.

It is _always_ assumed that users who e-mail _BigBlueInteractive.com_ at [info@bigblueinteractive.com](mailto:info@bigblueinteractive.com), and who do not _clearly_ label their e-mail as a _PRIVATE MESSAGE_ , wish to have their e-mail posted in [Letters to the Editor](http://www.bigblueinteractive.com/opinions/letters-to-the-editor/). _BBI_ specifically disclaims any liability with regard to e-mail not clearly labeled as unsuitable to _Letters to the Editor_ by the user or e-mail intended for _Letters to the Editor_ and any actions resulting from your participation in _Letters to the Editor_.

In addition, users should be aware that when they voluntarily disclose personally identifiable information (i.e., user name, e-mail address) in _The Corner Forum_ or _Letters to the Editor_ that information, along with any substantive information disclosed in the user’s communication, can be collected, correlated, and used by third parties and may result in unsolicited messages from other posters or third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of _BigBlueInteractive.com_.
