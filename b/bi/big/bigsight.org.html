  top concerns. As we've developed this application over the past six 
  months, we have continually updated and upgraded our Privacy Policy 
  and how it interacts with various iterations of the product.  
  The final Privacy Policy below details the measures taken by the Company 
  to protect your privacy in connection with your use of </font><a href="http://www.bigsight.org" target="_blank"><font size="2" face="Arial"><u>http://www.bigsight.org</u></font></a><font size="2" face="Arial"> and other sites owned and operated by the Company 
  (henceforth Company Sites).  Our Company Sites are built and distributed 
  publicly on the web as public directories of people-specific information.  
  The information included in public profiles is either input by the individual 
  profiled (User Content), by an editor employed by the Company, or by 
  a third party.  </font></font></p><font size="2" face="Arial">

  directories and not user-managed networks like many currently found 
  on the public Internet.  This difference is critical to how we approach 
  and deal with privacy and personally identifiable information.  There 
  are four key differences between the two:</font></p>
