This Privacy Policy (“Policy”), effective 8/01/2015, tells you about Big Ideas Learning, LLC’s privacy practices governing personal information we may collect when you visit our bigideasmath.com website, and how we may use and share that information.

From time to time, we may use your information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our Policy. If our information practices do change materially, we will post the changes to our website and revise our Policy accordingly. In addition, if we have collected personally-identifying information from you, we will notify you and secure your consent before using your personal information in new ways.

## What Information Do We Collect?

### Personal Information:

If you are under 13 years old, this consent fulfills our obligation under the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act. Our collection of personal information to set up your account is in furtherance of our performance of services otherwise performed by school employees, is under the direct control of the school with respect to the use and maintenance of educational records, and complies with use and redisclosure requirements regarding personal information from education records, all in compliance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act.

  * First and last name
  * School name and school address

Schools may opt to share additional student information with Clever, such as gender or date of birth.
