# THE NICKELODEON GROUP PRIVACY POLICY AND YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS | Nick

## Nickelodeon Privacy Policy for Kids and Families

**Last Updated: January 1, 2020**  


Welcome! This Privacy Policy describes the privacy practices of the Nickelodeon family of brands, including Nick Jr. and Noggin, which is a programming service under Viacom International Inc. (such programming services collectively "Nickelodeon", "we", "us", or "our"). It applies when you or your child visit a Nickelodeon website or any other website, mobile application, online service, or portion of a site or service operated by Nickelodeon where this policy is posted. This Privacy Policy collectively refers to these touchpoints as the "Services.”  


For a list of Nickelodeon Services that are directed to children to which this policy applies, please visit www.nick.com/nick-assets/copy/nickelodeon-sites.html.  


This Privacy Policy describes what information we collect about you or your child when using or visiting the Services, how such information is used and stored, when such information may be disclosed to third parties, how users, or parents and guardians can control the use and disclosure of information collected from themselves or their children. Younger visitors should always check with their parents or guardians before entering information on any website or mobile application, and we encourage families to discuss their household guidelines regarding the online sharing of personal information.  


This policy is in accordance with the U.S. Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (also known as "COPPA"), among other applicable privacy laws, and outlines our practices in the United States regarding children's information collected from users of the Services. To learn about our practices regarding personal information collected from children on these Services, please see the Children's Privacy section.  


We will change this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we make changes, we will revise the date at the top of the policy and, in some cases, will notify you through the Services, such as via the Nickelodeon website, email, or other communication.  


If you or your child are a California resident, in order to learn more about your California Privacy Rights, please see the California Privacy Notice.

**Advertising and Analytics Provided by Others**  


**Cookies and Similar Technologies**  


We and our advertising and analytics service providers use cookies, which are small text files that help store user preferences and activity, similar technologies such as web beacons, pixels, ad tags, and SDKs, which are blocks of code provided by our partners that may be installed in our mobile and online applications, to recognize you when you visit our Services, and to collect information such as the number of visits, which features, pages, or content are popular, and to measure your browsing activities. These technologies allow us to optimize the operation of our Services, including by allowing us to help ensure our Services are functioning properly, improve the Services, and to provide and measure contextual advertisements.  


On any of our Services or portion of the Services that is directed to children, we do not use, or allow our partners to use, automatically collected information, such as IP addresses, cookie identifiers, and other device identifiers, other than for purposes of supporting our internal operations, such as to provide children with access to features and activities on the Services, to customize content and improve our Services, and to serve contextual advertising and limit the number of times you or your child see a particular advertisement. We do not allow online behavioral advertising, sometimes called personalized advertising or tailored advertising to children or teens under 16. For the portions of our Services that are directed to audiences older than 16, we may share identifiers such as cookies and the advertising identifier associated with your mobile device with our advertising partners, and those partners may use and share those identifiers to show ads that are targeted to your interests.

The Services may include links to other websites or services, such as to purchase online subscriptions, tickets to a Nickelodeon Experience, or purchase of a consumer or virtual good or service. Personal information collected on other sites and services is subject to the privacy policy and practices of the third party providing such website or service and not this Privacy Policy.  


Similarly, on the Services or portions of the Services that are not directed to children, we may give you the option to share with others on social media platforms, such as Instagram, Facebook or Twitter. When you share in this manner, the privacy practices of the social media platform control who has access to your information and how it is treated by the social media platform.  


Please consult the privacy policies of any social media services or other third parties with which you share information in this manner to learn about the social media platform's data practices.
