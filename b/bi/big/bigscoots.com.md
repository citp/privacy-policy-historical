These consist of online data entry forms for ordering products and services, communicating with the BigScoots staff, as well as other instances where users can volunteer their own private information.

The data we gather is undeniably personal and can be used to identify you, which is exactly why we take privacy so seriously and also why it is a necessary evil. Personal information plays a commanding role when conducting business online in a secure manner.

Some of the data gathered can consist but is not limited to: Complete address and location Personal and company web addresses Given name and surname E-mail addresses Telephone numbers Credit card information Other billing information

Although rare, on occasion BigScoots may gather data about how our clients access our services using tracking identifiers which are specific to each client through the use of cookies or other similar means.

### 3\. What Exactly Are Cookies

A cookie can be fundamentally defined as a piece of data that is stored on a clients computer which identifies information about that specific client. BigScoots on occasion can make use of both session identifier cookies as well as persistent cookies.

A persistent cookie on the other hand is a minor text file that is stored on your hard drive for a prolonged period of time.

By using our services you are agreeing to the overall acceptance of this privacy policy and therefore our use of cookies. At any time feel free to review your browsers help file to gather the instructions necessary to remove these persistent cookies, however please keep in mind they are only being used in the first place to stream line our interaction with you and better our service.

### 4\. Log Files

Similar to most websites out there, BigScoots uses log files for both security and to streamline our services. This is a form of data gathering which may include information such as internet protocol addresses, internet service providers, browser type and versions, referring and exit pages, platforms, date and time stamps, number of clicks for trend analysing as well as gathering very broad demographic information. Similar to the cookie scenario none of the information stored in these log files contain individually distinguishable data.

### 5\. How Does BigScoots Use This Information?

BigScoots may also use any of the gathered data for analysis on the success of our services and advertising efforts. Under no condition other than legal action or our client specifically authorizing such disclosures will BigScoots ever share this information with a third party.

### 6\. Disclosure of Data

Although unlikely and not in the foreseeable future, BigScoots does reserve the right to disclose completely anonymous data to investors and/or possible partners. In this case purely basic information will be disclosed and individually distinguishable data will remain completely private. In the case of BigScoots being sold, the information collected from our clients may be transferred to the new owner(s) under the condition that all individually distinguishable data will remain private.

BigScoots may on occasion interact with a third party consultant, advisor, marketing team or IT professional where it may become necessary to disclose private data. Everything disclosed under these terms will require the third party to treat all data, especially individually distinguishable data with the same concern and respect that BigScoots does. All third parties are prohibited from disclosing such data to any other person or party.

Further, individuals will always have access to their own personal data unless those same individuals have previously requested their data to be removed.

In the context of an onward transfer, BigScoots has responsibility for the processing of personal information it receives under the Privacy Shield and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. BigScoots shall remain liable under the Principles if its agent processes such personal information in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, unless BigScoots proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

### 7\. Newsletters, Special Offers And Service Updates

On occasion and on no particular schedule our clients may receive details on special offers, general newsletters as well as service updates providing they have agreed to receive this type of communication.

### 8\. Legal Disclaimer

Although BigScoots takes every precaution to maintain your confidentiality, on occasion a need may arise where we can and should disclose personally identifiable information if required by law. These disclosures will only occur if BigScoots has a good-faith belief that such action is necessary or BigScoots is required to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served to BigScoots.

On occasion our clients may also find links to other websites through the BigScoots site or through other correspondence. It is our clients responsibility to be aware that BigScoots cannot control the privacy policies of third parties. Read the privacy policies of websites that collect personally identifiable data thoroughly and be aware of how it can be distributed. This privacy policy as indicated herein is applicable only to the data collected by BigScoots.
