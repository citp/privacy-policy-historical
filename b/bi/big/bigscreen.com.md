## What Information We Collect When You Customize The BigScreen Cinema Guide

In order to provide you with a customized experience, we ask you for the following items of information:

  * Your Name
  * Your E-Mail Address
  * A Password of Your Choice
  * Your ZIP Code



## How We Collect That Information (Cookies)

We use a technology available in every current browser, called _Cookies_. When we ask for your information, we store it in our records, and assign you a unique ID. This ID is stored on your browser using a cookie, so that when you return to The BigScreen Cinema Guide, we can retrieve your settings and use them to customize your visit with us. The only information that is stored in your browser is the ID code, and that cookie is only accessible by this site. If you would like to read more about cookies, and what they can and cannot do, check out a site called [Cookie Central](http://www.cookiecentral.com/) and the [Wikipedia entry for HTTP cookies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_cookie).

If you have chosen only to provide us with your ZIP code, instead of customizing The BigScreen Cinema Guide, we do store that ZIP code in what's called a temporary cookie. This temporary cookie is deleted by your browser when you exit the program, and is not stored like the ID mentioned in the previous example. The next time you run your browser and visit this site, you will be asked for your ZIP code again.

We also utilize third party advertising solutions, which use cookies to determine which ad to display, if applicable. The ads that you are shown are not tied in any way to your custom account information.

## Why We Collect That Information and What We Do With It

We ask for your name so that we can welcome you by name when you return to the site. If you submit a Reader Review, your name is used to identify you on your review. Take a look at our Reader Reviews section for examples of how we do this.

Your E-Mail address is needed so that we can contact you if we need to. If you forget your password when logging into BigScreen from another computer, we give you the option of having your password E-Mailed to the address you gave us. If we have questions about a review you submitted, we will contact you at that address so that we can post your review as soon as possible. We will not publish your E-Mail address anywhere on the site.

To keep others from accessing your custom settings, your settings are protected with a password that you choose. You only need to login to access your custom settings once, as we store a cookie on your browser that connects your browser to your settings.

Probably the most important piece of information that we can get from you is your ZIP code. We use your ZIP code to determine which theaters are closest to your location, so that you can select nearby theaters easily.

## What We Will Not Do With Your Information

We will not willingly share your personal information with any third party. We believe that your personal information is yours to share with us, and no one else needs to have access to it. We will not willingly or knowingly sell, trade, or otherwise share the information you provide to us with anyone not directly associated with The BigScreen Cinema Guide, unless required to do so by law.
