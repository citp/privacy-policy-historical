      <p><strong>An Overview</strong></p>

      <p>BigStockPhoto.com is strongly committed to protecting the privacy of 

        consumers of its interactive products and services and of visitors to 

        its site. Throughout cyberspace, we want to contribute to providing a 

        safe and secure environment for consumers. All references in this policy 

        to "BigStockPhoto.com" include the BigStockPhoto.com site and 

        all of the other Internet-accessible BigStockPhoto.com-branded services. 

        The purpose of this BigStockPhoto.com privacy policy is to inform you, 

        as a welcome visitor to BigStockPhoto.com, (1) what kinds of information 

        we may gather about you when you visit BigStockPhoto.com; (2) how we may 

        use that information; (3) whether we disclose it to anyone; and (4) the 

        choices you have regarding our use of, and your ability to correct, the 

        information. </p>

      <p>Finally, please note that this policy applies only to BigStockPhoto.com 

        and Web sites that carry the BigStockPhoto.com brand, and not to other 

        companies' or organizations' Web sites to which we link. We have clearly 

        marked BigStockPhoto.com and these branded Web sites with our logo so 

        you know where this policy applies. BigStockPhoto.com welcomes comments 

        and questions on this policy. BigStockPhoto.com is dedicated to protecting 

        your personal information. Due to the evolving nature of the technologies 

        BigStockPhoto.com uses to communicate with you, we may occasionally update 

        this policy. Notice of any revisions will be posted to this site. Any 

        comments or questions regarding our privacy practices should be sent to 

        support@BigStockPhoto.com.com.</p>

      <p><br>

        <strong>What personal information does BigStockPhoto.com collect?</strong><br>

        BigStockPhoto.com collects personally identifying information during: 

        (i) user registration; (ii) user surveys; and (iv) registration for certain 

        interactive areas on BigStockPhoto.com and on Web sites that carry the 

        BigStockPhoto.com brand. For each visitor to our Web page, our Web server 

        automatically recognizes and we collect that visitor's domain name and 

        e-mail address (where possible). In addition, the e-mail addresses of 

        those who communicate with us via e-mail, the e-mail addresses of those 

        who make postings to our interactive areas, aggregate information about 

        which pages visitors access, user-specific information about which pages 

        visitors access and how much time is spent in particular areas, and information 

        volunteered by the visitor, such as survey information and/or information 

        provided in site registration forms, including but not limited to a visitor's 

        name, address, and phone number. We collect credit card information along 

        with a billing address from users who use our system to gain project work, 

        and who then wish to pay us by credit card. BigStockPhoto.com may retain 

        personally identifying information indefinitely. BigStockPhoto.com maintains 

        publicly available user profiles as well, which may contain personally 

        identifying information volunteered by its visitors.</p>

      <p><strong>What does BigStockPhoto.com do with the information it collects?</strong><br>

        BigStockPhoto.com may use personally identifying information of its visitors 

        to award prizes, track compliance with our Terms of Service, or for editorial 

        and feedback purposes (to the extent that is explained when visitors provide 

        the information). In addition, BigStockPhoto.com may disclose personally 

        identifying information about you, your accounts, or any content you provide 

        on your site, if BigStockPhoto.com believes in good faith that such action 

        is reasonably necessary to enforce its User Agreement or copyright policy, 

        to comply with the law, to comply with legal process, to operate its systems 

        properly, or to protect the rights or property of itself, its members, 

        its visitors, or others. </p>

      <p>Other companies which provide services on our site, or which advertise 

        on our site, may collect information about you. BigStockPhoto.com does 

        not control collection or use of this information. You should contact 

        these companies or advertisers directly if you have any questions about 

        their use of this information. With the permission of a visitor who is 

        18 years of age or over, information submitted at the time of registration 

        or submission - including but not limited to age, phone number, address, 

        and income level - may be used for marketing and promotional purposes 

        by BigStockPhoto.com. If a visitor objects to such use for any reason, 

        he/she may stop that use -- either by e-mail request sent to support@BigStockPhoto.com, 

        or by modifying his/her registration information online. If you supply 

        us with your postal address on-line you may receive periodic mailings 

        from us with information on new products and services or upcoming events. 

        If you do not wish to receive such mailings, please let us know by sending 

        an e-mail to us at the above e-mail address and providing us with your 

        exact name and address.</p>

      <p><strong>How will BigStockPhoto.com protect your personal information?</strong><br>

        BigStockPhoto.com will take appropriate steps to protect the information 

        you share with us. Whenever you give BigStockPhoto.com sensitive information 

        (credit card numbers, for instance), BigStockPhoto.com will take commercially 

        reasonable steps to establish a secure connection with your web browser. 

        Credit card numbers are used only for payment processing and are not retained 

        for marketing purposes.</p>

      <p><strong>How to unsubscribe</strong><br>

        We do not make the e-mail addresses of those who access our site available 

        to other organizations whose products or services we think you might find 

        interesting. If you do not want us to share your e-mail address with other 

        companies or organizations, please let us know by sending an e-mail to 

        us at the above address and telling us that you do not want us to share 

        your e-mail address with other companies.</p>

      <p><strong>About IP addresses</strong><br>

        BigStockPhoto.com collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration 

        and to report aggregate information to our advertisers. An IP address 

        is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're 

        surfing the Web. Web servers -- the big computers that "serve" 

        up Web pages -- automatically identify your computer by its IP address. 

        When visitors request pages from BigStockPhoto.com, our servers log their 

        IP addresses. We do not link IP addresses to any personally identifiable 

        information. This means that a user's session will be logged, but the 

        user remains anonymous to us. </p>

      <p><strong>Use of cookies</strong></p>

      <p>What are cookies? Cookies are pieces of information that a Web site transfers 

        to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies make 

        Web-surfing easier for you by saving your passwords, purchases, and preferences 

        while you're at our site. The use of cookies is an industry standard -- 

        you'll find them at most major Web sites. By showing how and when guests 

        use the site, cookies help us see which areas are popular and which are 

        not. Many improvements and updates to the site are based on such data 

        as total number of visitors and pages viewed. This information is most 

        easily tracked with cookies.<br>

        <br>

        Each browser accessing BigStockPhoto.com is given a unique cookie that 

        is then used to determine the number of unique site visitors. An additional 

        cookie lets our computers remember that you've registered, which allows 

        us to speed up your future activities at our sites.<br>

        <br>

        By using this site, you signify your assent to the BigStockPhoto.com Privacy 

        Policy. If you do not agree to this policy, please do not use the site. 

        We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove 

        portions of this policy at any time. Please check this page periodically 

        for changes. Your continued use of BigStockPhoto.com following the posting 

        of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes. For a full 

        explanation of the terms and conditions for using this site, please see 

        our BigStockPhoto.com Terms of Service Agreement. You can send e-mail 

        to us with any further questions.</p>
