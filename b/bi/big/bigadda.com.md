**What information is collected about our users and members?**

The information that we collect about you while you are using the Site falls into the following general categories:

**1\. User provided information** : We may collect and store information, personal or otherwise, that you voluntarily supply either while on the Site or in responding via email in connection with a feature provided on the Site.

In addition, third party advertisers or third party ad servers that place and present advertising on the Site also may collect information from you via cookies, web beacons, clear .gifs or similar technologies. These third party advertisers and ad servers may use the information they collect to help present their advertisements, to help measure and research the advertisements' effectiveness, or for other uses. The use and collection of your information by these third party advertisers and ad servers is governed by the relevant third party's privacy policy and is not covered by our privacy policy. Indeed, the privacy policy of these third party advertisers and ad servers may be different from our privacy policy.

**4\. Clear / transparent GIFs information** : When you use the BIGADDA Site, we may employ "clear GIFs" (a.k.a.

In addition, we may also use clear GIFs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened by recipients.
