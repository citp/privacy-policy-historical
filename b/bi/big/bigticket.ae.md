# Privacy Policy - Big Ticket

  1. A. Big Ticket Abu Dhabi and its affiliates (“Big Ticket”) respect the privacy rights of our online visitors. We have adopted this Privacy Policy (“Policy”) to govern how we collect, store, use, process and disclose the information that you choose to give us online through ae. This Policy is subject to all governing laws and regulations regarding privacy protection.


  1. B. We may revise this Policy from time to time by posting the amended terms on ae. All amended terms automatically take effect immediately upon posting. Your continued use of bigticket.ae after an updated Privacy Policy is posted signifies that you accept all its revisions.


  1. C. Bigticket.ae may contain links to third-party sites. Big Ticket does not control these third-party sites or the companies or individuals who maintain them. We are not responsible for the actions of these third parties, or for any of your personal data that you provide to them after you leave bigticket.ae.


  1. We automatically analyze trends and monitor usage statistics of ae by tracking the DFS.com pages viewed, the previous and following sites visited, the browser used and the computer’s Internet protocol address. You may browse DFS.com without telling us who you are or revealing your personal data. However, some of our services may not be available unless you choose, at your discretion, to provide us with personal data.


  1. We use “cookies” (small pieces of information sent to your computer) on certain pages of ae to help analyze our web page traffic, customize our services, measure promotional effectiveness and maintain Internet security. We use cookies to help identify you and maintain your signed-in status. We offer certain features that are available only through the use of cookies. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although doing so may interfere with your use of bigticket.ae. Big Ticket also works with advertising partners that use cookies, pixel tags and other tracking technologies to serve advertisements on behalf of their retail clients, including Big Ticket, across the Internet, including after you have visited our site. These advertising partners engage in remarketing, online behavioral advertising and ad delivery and reporting. These advertising partners may collect anonymous information about your browser as it makes visits to websites across the Internet (including our site) and your interaction with our advertising and e-mail communications. This anonymous information may also be used to tailor advertising for you and others elsewhere on the Internet. Big Ticket will have access to the information collected by these advertising partners and can then use it in combination with personally identifiable information provided by you to Big Ticket to enhance your experience on our sites.
