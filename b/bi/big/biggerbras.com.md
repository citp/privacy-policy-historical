# Biggerbras.com, Customer, Privacy Policy

BGB strives to provide a quality shopping experience for all of our visitors. We regard our customers' privacy with respect and in accordance with acceptable internet practice we have a published privacy policy, which is outlined below.

Customer Information  
BGB does not release or sell email addresses obtained through our website or other activities. All personal information is held as "strictly confidential" by BGB.

BGB does not release or sell the names and addresses of its customers obtained through its website or other activities. All personal information is held as "strictly confidential" by BGB.

Credit Cards and Security  
BGB uses the secure server software (SSL) of [Plug 'n Pay Technologies, Inc.](http://www.plugnpay.com/) for secure commerce transactions so that the personal information you provide to complete your purchase remains confidential and secure. Your personal information is used only to process your order, is protected under our agreement with Plug-n-Pay, and is not shared with any other entity.

SSL technology encrypts all of your personal information including credit card number, name, and address, so that it cannot be read as the information travels over the Internet.

If you are using Internet Explorer as your browser, you can verify that you are on a secure page when you see the closed-lock icon at the bottom right of your browser. Other browsers should also display some sort of icon to you indicating that the page is secure. You can also click on this icon to see the issuing authority for the secure certificate that makes the SSL possible.

When You Click the Checkout Button  
You are directed to the secure checkout page at our transaction processor (Plug-n-Pay). All secure transactions are handled on the Plug-n-Pay secure web pages. Your credit card information is protected on the Plug-n-Pay secured server and is used only for processing your order. BGB does not store credit card data or order data on its website. 

Packaging  
BGB mails your package in a plain white poly-vinyl envelope, a standard Post Office priority box, or a plain brown box. The return label reads: BGB - 2 Ilene Ct. - Bldg. 1, Unit 19 - Hillsborough, NJ 08844. No indication of the contents of the package is visible on the package except for the word "clothing" and the value of the contents when needed for Canadian, European or other international customs stickers.

Email  
An email acknowledgement is sent when an order is placed on our web site. Additional emails may follow to inform you of the status of your order. If you do not receive these emails, you may have accidentally typed the wrong email address into your order (call us and we'll correct it), or your service provider or spam-blocker software may key on words such as "bra" or "lingerie" and put your confirmation into your spam box. If this is the case, take the necessary steps to allow these emails if you are interested in your order status.

Once or twice a month, a promotional [email newsletter](https://web.archive.org/bras-lingerie-shopping-newsletter.shtml) may be sent to inform interested visitors of new features, new products, or "on-sale" events and fresh coupon codes. Removal instructions are always at the bottom of the promotional emails. 

In an effort to reduce the thousands of inappropriate email (i.e. SPAM lists) sent to our customer service address: Effective January, 2004 we no longer send an auto-reply to incoming emails. We also use our own spam-blocking software, so please reference your name or order id in the subject line of your email along with your questions or comments inside the email. Do not send attachments, they will be deleted.

In order to better assist our existing customers, BGB attempts to personally answer all customer inquiries within 72 to 96 hours. Occasionally, responses may take an additional day. If you do not receive a response in this time-frame and your question is not answered in our help section, call us. Our toll free number is 1-866-352-4494.

Please check our [Help and Frequently Asked Questions](https://web.archive.org/help-for-bras-using-biggerbras-com-lingerie-catalog.shtml) page for common questions and answers.

If you are an existing customer, please include your full name, email address, order date and order-id number in your email, AND complete questions or instructions. One word instructions such as "Cancel" or "Change" can not be processed.

Cookies  
Our web site uses cookie technology to place items in your shopping cart and provide an enhanced shopping experience. If you disabled cookies in the past, please make sure that you have cookies enabled (the default setting when you installed your browser software) on your browser in order to place your order online. If you do not wish to enable cookies, please phone in your order.

Cookies are also used by some of the search engines such as Overture to help us determine which "keywords" are searched most frequently by our customers making purchases. This information remains anonymous and is a tally only of specific keywords.

Additionally, a cookie may be used so that our web site "remembers" who you are when you use one of our premium services so that only information that is important to you is displayed. No personally identifying information is ever collected using cookies.

Conclusion  
BGB receives thousands of visitors each day to our website and we reserve the right to modify or adapt this policy to further protect the privacy of our visitors, the security, aesthetics and functionality of our site, and to provide a quality shopping experience for our customers.
