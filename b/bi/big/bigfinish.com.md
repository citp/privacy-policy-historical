The transmission of information over the internet is not completely secure. We will do our best to protect your information but we cannot guarantee security of transmissions to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use security procedures and features to try to prevent unauthorised access.

All payments for products sold on www.bigfinish.com will be made through the site of one of our payment processing companies. Further information on these payment processing companies and the way that they will use your information is at Section 6 of this page.

###  3\. How Your Information May Be Used

We use information about you in the following ways:

  * To ensure that our site is presented in the most effective manner for you.
  * To carry out our obligations arising from any contracts between you and us, such as providing you with items that you have ordered from us.

###  5\. IP Addresses & Cookies on www.bigfinish.com

We may use automated systems to collect information about your computer, including its IP address, operating system and browser type. This is statistical data that will not identify you individually. We will use this information to help us run and improve www.bigfinish.com.

For the same reasons, we may gather information about your internet usage by using a cookie file stored on your computer. Cookies contain information that help us to improve our site by enabling us:

Please note that advertisers and payment processing companies on our site may use cookies and tracking systems over which we have no control.

###  6\. Security on the Site

We take information security very seriously. For this reason we use advanced internet security systems to safeguard your information.

All the data that you send through to us when submitting an order is encrypted before it is transmitted across the Internet. This means that in the unlikely event of the data being intercepted, it would be difficult to decipher.

To protect your payment details, the payment checkout services we use are run directly through the sites of the payment processing companies. You will automatically be transferred to such a site when making an order. We do not control these sites – information on how they protect your information will be available from their own privacy policies.

Please do not send credit/debit card details directly to us by e-mail, as this may not be secure. Instead, please use the site to place an order. In the unlikely event of unauthorised card use please be sure to contact your card issuer immediately as per your arrangement with them.
