We may receive a confirmation when you open email from Big Fish, if your computer supports such capabilities. We may also track other types of information, such as what games users download and install, any download errors, what games users purchase, how long our users have been participating in any Big Fish Offerings, the last time a user accessed a Big Fish Offering, user behavior and gameplay (e.g., which options you choose, your progress in the game, how long you play), whether a user has won any of our games, sweepstakes, contests or other promotions featured on a Big Fish Offering, ad response measurement and other Big Fish Offerings analytics. 

We use cookies for a variety of reasons, including to: (i) analyze the usage of Big Fish Offerings; (ii) provide a more personalized experience; (iii) manage advertising; (iv) allow you to more easily log in to Big Fish Offerings; (v) help make your use of Big Fish Offerings more efficient and more valuable by providing you with a customized experience and recognizing you when you return.

Subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy, we may use your contact information to process our promotional newsletters and/or email campaigns and to send you updates, security alerts, or administrative messages relating to Big Fish Offerings. Your contact information will allow us to notify you about new features, enhancements, resolution of Big Fish Offerings problems, handle and/or route your customer support questions and issues, and inform you of upgrade opportunities, sweepstakes, contests, prizes, and/or special events. 

If our "Tell a friend" feature is available within a particular Big Fish Offering and you choose to participate in it, your email will be shared with the person to whom you send the Big Fish Offering using this feature.

This helps us and our service providers provide more relevant advertising to you. We and our third party service providers may also use web beacons to monitor user behavior and collect information about visitors viewing a web page. 

### Product Improvement and Security: 

We may use information collected to calculate aggregate, anonymized statistics about our user community for the purpose of enhancing our Big Fish Offerings, or for security purposes. 

### Linking with Social Networks: 

If you access a Social Game, we may use your social networking site profile ID to link your social networking site account with your activities within the Social Game or offer personalized Big Fish advertisements on the social networking site. We may use your social networking site first, last and user names and icon to identify you to the social networking site account you've linked to your activities within the Social Game, as well as for the purposes of rankings, competitions, sweepstakes, game high scores and/or identification to your social network. 

If you access a Social Game and provide us with another person's contact information for purposes of delivering information through a Social Game, we may use this information to contact and, if necessary, remind that person that she or he has been invited to join a Social Game or received content through a Social Game. All invitees are provided with the option not to receive further invitations from Big Fish. 

## SECURITY 

We at Big Fish take reasonable measures to help protect the information we collect from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. While we have employed security technologies and procedures to assist safeguarding your personal data, no system or network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. 

## SHARING INFORMATION 

We may share customer information with Big Fish Affiliates, other companies of the Aristocrat Group to which Big Fish belongs, and as described below. 

### Third Party Marketplaces and Service Providers: 

We may disclose your personal information as well as aggregate, anonymous information to third party business partners, marketplaces, and third parties who perform services for us, such as credit card processing, prize fulfillment, delivering packages, sending postal mail, collecting and analyzing data, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), and providing advertising and marketing assistance, including serving ads on our behalf on third party websites and mobile applications and serving ads on behalf of third parties within certain Big Fish Offerings. Those third parties have access to your personal information only as necessary to perform their functions, and for no other purposes. 

### Business Transfers: 

As Big Fish (and the Aristocrat Group) continues to grow, we might sell or buy certain subsidiaries and/or business units. In such transactions, customer information is generally one of the transferred assets. Also, in the unlikely event that Big Fish or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information would in most cases be one of the transferred assets. 

### Protection of Big Fish and Others: 

We may also disclose your information if there is a violation of the [Terms of Use](https://www.bigfishgames.com/company/terms.html) or other agreements; if we have a good faith belief that the law requires it; or if needed to protect the rights, property or safety of Big Fish, our customers or others. This includes exchanging information with entities for fraud detection and protection, and credit risk reduction. 

## ACCESSING YOUR INFORMATION AND YOUR CHOICES 

Big Fish enables you to access a wide range of information about your account and your interactions with Big Fish Offerings. If you have created a customer account, you may access your account information by logging on to www.bigfishgames.com and clicking on "Account" on the top of your screen. You may also contact us about your information and your choices for limiting the use and disclosure of your information by visiting https://www.bigfishgames.com/help; by emailing us at privacy@bigfishgames.com; or by sending us postal mail at: Big Fish Privacy Policy Department, 906 Alaskan Way, Suite 700, Seattle, WA 98104 USA. 

### Promotional email communications: 

Unless you are located in the EU or certain other jurisdictions, when you create a customer account or provide access to your email address via a Big Fish Offering, you may be automatically registered to receive one or more of our promotional e- newsletters. 

Note that when you provide an email address through a Big Fish Offering, we treat that as a request to be enrolled in one of our promotional e-newsletter lists, even if you previously opted out of receiving newsletters from us. If you change your mind and wish to opt out again, you may do so at any time by clicking the "unsubscribe" link at the bottom of any newsletter and then following the instructions provided. If you express interest in a Big Fish Offering by clicking on a banner within a newsletter, you may be automatically registered to receive newsletters relating to the Big Fish Offering that appeared in the banner. 

At any time, you may opt-out of receiving a newsletter by selecting the "unsubscribe" link at the bottom of any newsletter. We treat each Big Fish Offering individually, so if you are receiving mailings from more than one Big Fish Offering, if you want to unsubscribe you must do so with respect to each individually or you can unsubscribe universally by contacting us at https://www.bigfishgames.com/help. Please note that we reserve the right to send you non-promotional, account or administrative emails even if you opt out of receiving promotional e-newsletters. 

### Mobile Advertising: 

Most mobile devices provide the ability to opt out of the collection and use of information from the apps you use for purposes of serving ads targeted to your interests. For more information, and to exercise these choices, consult the settings on your device. 

### Social Games: 

With respect to Social Games, you may manage your own social network privacy preferences through your social networking site account. 

## THIRD-PARTIES 

Big Fish Offerings may allow you to play or share information through social media (such as by logging in through a social media account or using a "Like" button") or contain links to social media services or other third parties. The use of these features and links are subject to the privacy policies of those companies and your settings on those services. Big Fish has no control over, and is not responsible for, the information submitted to or collected by social networks or other third parties. We encourage you to review those third party privacy policies to understand the way your information may be collected and handled by such third parties. 

## CHAT & MESSAGING 

Big Fish Offerings may operate message boards and/or chat areas where users can exchange ideas and communicate with each other. When posting to a message board or chat area, the information is being made publicly available in an online environment. Any information posted is the sole responsibility of the individual user. 

## CHILDREN 

Big Fish Offerings are designed to avoid the collection and use of "personal information" as defined in the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA") from children under 13 other than for support of internal operations. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you are under 13 (16 in the EU) years old, you may not register for an account or otherwise provide any personal information to us. 

Big Fish respects the privacy of parents and children and is committed to complying with COPPA. If a parent believes that his or her child has submitted personal information to Big Fish, he or she can contact us via email at privacy@bigfishgames.com or postal mail at: Big Fish Privacy Policy Department, 906 Alaskan Way, Suite 700, Seattle, WA 98104 USA. We will take steps to promptly delete the information upon learning that it relates to a child under the age of 13 (16 in the EU). We recognize the importance of safeguarding the privacy of children and encourage parents to check and monitor their children's use of online activities regularly.

We may modify this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we post changes to this Privacy Policy, we will revise the "last modified" date at the top of this page. We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy to be informed of how Big Fish protects your information.

## EU-US PRIVACY SHIELD PROGRAM (EU Users) 

We may transfer, store and/or process personal information in the U.S. or in other countries. Big Fish complies with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework Principles (the "Framework") and the US-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the processing of personal information from the European Union (EU) member countries and Switzerland. For more information about the Framework, please visit the Department of Commerce's [Privacy Shield website](https://www.privacyshield.gov/). To contact Big Fish directly about the Framework, please email us at privacyshield@bigfishgames.com. If we do not resolve your concern, you may contact [JAMS](https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield), Big Fish’s designated Privacy Shield dispute resolution provider. Under certain conditions specified by the Framework, you may also be able to invoke binding arbitration to resolve your complaint. Big Fish is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the FTC. If we share personal information of EU customers with a third party service provider that processes the data solely on our behalf, then Big Fish will be liable for that third party's processing of the information in violation of the Framework, unless Big Fish can prove that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage. When we share your personal information with third party service providers, we will enter into onward transfer agreements or other data processing agreements with those third parties. You may request information on and a copy of those agreements by contacting us at privacy@bigfishgames.com. 

Please note that if you are located in the E.U., Switzerland or other region with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, you are transferring information to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction. 

Please see section (I) on “Sharing Information” to find more about how we share your personal information with Big Fish Affiliates, other companies of the Aristocrat Group (to which Big Fish belongs), and third party service providers.
