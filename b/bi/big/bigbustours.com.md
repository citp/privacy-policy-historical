**WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT AND WHY DO WE COLLECT IT?**

When you visit our Sites, we may collect:

Information such as your computer’s IP address, browser type and version and anonymous information collected from cookies when you are browsing our Sites. We collect this information to help us understand how to improve our services and our Sites and to ensure that the content on our Sites is presented to you in an effective manner.

Personal information such as your name, address, telephone number and email address as provided by you when you register to Big Bus Tours or place an order with us and enter your payment card details. We collect this information for the following reasons:

\- To process your order. We engage third party processors to process the payment of your order online. We collect this information to perform a contract with you and, if you fail to give us the information that we request, then you may not be able to place an order via our Sites. If you consent to them doing so, the third party processors may store your payment card details to speed up your transaction time.

\- For product development (for example, call backs for feedback on new products), for statistical, market research, testing and survey purposes, to notify you about changes to our Sites or our services. We have a legitimate business interest to collect this information: to continue to improve the services we provide to you;

\- To ensure you receive marketing and offers that are of most interest and relevance to you. To help us achieve this, we may share your data with third party analytics companies to understand your purchasing options. We have a legitimate business interest to collect this information: to get to know your preferences and to personalise our offers to you to improve the marketing you receive from us.

**DIRECT MARKETING: YOUR CONSENT MATTERS**

What have I consented to do?

We will not send direct marketing messages to you unless you have opted-in to our marketing. If you have opted-in, this means that we may contact you via your chosen media (such as SMS, email or mail):

\- with offers about our products;

\- to deliver relevant, tailored advertising to you with information about products or services we feel may interest you.

Can I withdraw my consent?

You are always free to opt-in to our marketing and you are always free to opt-out at any time; this will never have an impact on our commitment to provide you with great service and a quality product. Once you have unsubscribed from marketing messages , we will stop sending you marketing messages as soon as possible but in any event, will do so no later than 30 days from your request to withdraw consent.

How long do you keep my consent?

For all contacts already opted-in to our communications, we will assume you want us to keep in touch until the point you have voluntarily opted out.

Updating your consent

Our database will automatically remove you from our communications once unsubscribed. If you are previously opted in from a historical purchase, but decide you do not want to be opted-in on your next purchase - when presented with the opt-in box, if you choose not to receive marketing communication from us on some or all media, we will update our/your records accordingly.

**WHO DO WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION WITH?**

We may share your personal information with a purchaser or a potential purchaser of our business. We have a legitimate business interest to do this: to assist with the sale or potential sale of our business.

We may also share your information with data matching, data analysis or direct marketing companies to perform services on our behalf (such as, for example, Google, Facebook and Instagram) who will only be permitted to use your personal information for the purpose of performing that particular function strictly in accordance with our instructions and not for any other purpose. Please see “What information do we collect and why do we collect it?” above for further information.

In some circumstances, we may have to disclose your personal information by law, because a court or the police or other legal or regulatory enforcement agency has asked us for it.

By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of any data transmitted to our Sites and any transmission is at your own risk.
