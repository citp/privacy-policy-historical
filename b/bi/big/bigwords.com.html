          2. When you order, we need your name, email address, mailing address,

          your order. <br>
          3. When you enter a contest or other promotional feature on the site, 
          we usually need your name, address and email address so we can manage 
          the promotion and notify winners. <br>
          4. We also monitor customer traffic patterns and site usage to help 
          us improve the content, design, and layout of the site. <br>
