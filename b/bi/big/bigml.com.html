        <p class="supertitle">
        Last updated: January 17th, 2012
        </p>
        <h2>Welcome to BigML!</h2>
        <p>PLEASE READ THIS POLICY CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE SERVICES OFFERED BY BIGML INC (“BIGML”).</p>
    	<p class="intro">
Your privacy is important to BigML. We have developed a Privacy Policy that covers the information BigML collects and stores, how BigML uses personal information, how BigML shares, transfers or discloses, your information. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with our privacy&nbsp;practices and let us know if you have any questions.
    	</p>
        <p class="intro">
This Privacy Policy (the “BigML Privacy Policy”) governs the BigML web site located at BigML.com ("BigML.com"), the BigML API  located at BigML.io (“BigML.io”), all the software applications developed, hosted and offered via the Internet by BigML, and all associated sites linked to BigML.com by BigML Inc, its subsidiaries and affiliates, including BigML sites around the world (collectively, “the BigML Services”).
        </p>
        <p class="intro">
This Privacy Policy describes our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personally identifiable information made available by users of the BigML Services.
        </p>
        <p class="intro">
        The use of the BigML Services is governed by the Terms of Service ("Terms of Services") available at <a href="https://bigml.com/tos" target="_blank">https://bigml.com/tos</a>.
        </p>
    	<h2>A. The Information BigML Collects and Stores</h2>
        <p>We may collect and store the following information when running the BigML Services.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Information You Provide</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>When you register an account, BigML collects some personally identifiable information, including but not limited to: name, email address, username, password, country, and any and all other information that you share with us. We receive and store any information you enter through the Service or give us in any other way.</li>

                    <li>You may review, update, correct or delete the Personal Information provided in your registration at <a href="https://bigml.com/account" target="_blank">https://bigml.com/account</a>.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Cookies</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cookies are necessary to use BigML.com.</li>

                    <li>A cookie is an alphanumeric identifier in the form of a text file that is inserted and stored by your Web browser on your computer’s hard drive.</li>

                    <li>BigML.com uses cookies to record current session information, but does not use permanent cookies. You are required to re-login to your BigML account after a certain period of time has elapsed to protect you against others accidentally accessing your account contents.</li>

                    <li>BigML.com uses three types of cookies:
                        <ol>
                            <li>A session cookie that BigML.com uses to enable sessions. Every time you log in we send to your browser a cookie with a special identifier that your browser sends back to us with subsequent requests so that you do not need to provide your login and password with each request.</li>
                            <li>A cross site request forgery protection cookie that needs to be sent back to BigML.com each time that you fill out one of our forms.  This cookie helps us avoid malicious servers sending us request on your behalf.</li>
                            <li>Cookies that help BigML.com to keep the state for the selections that you make in the BigML.com interface. For example, the order of elements in a listing, the length of a listing, etc.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>

                    <li>If you do not enable your browser to accept BigML cookies, you may not be able to use BigML.com.</li>
                    <li>BigML does not use cookies for the purpose of sharing your identity with third party services.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Log Data</strong>
                <p>The BigML Services contain functions for collecting and tracking non-personally identifiable information about you including your IP address, domain name, pages that were viewed, where you were referred from, and technical information such as locale preferences, browser type and operating system from Your Equipment as defined in the BigML Terms of Service.</p>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Payment Data</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>We never have access to your full card number or CVC and therefore cannot store it. Our debit and credit card processing is handed off to Stripe, Inc (“Stripe”). Stripe has been certified to <a href="https://stripe.com/help/security" target="_blank">PCI Service Provider Level 1</a>, the most stringent level of certification available. </li>

                    <li>However, if you decide to store your payment information for further use, then BigML stores the type, the last 4 digits and the expiration date of your card. In this way, you can save more than one payment method and can decide which one to use in the future. If you use this feature, Stripe, Inc will save your full payment information for your future purchases with BigML.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Data sources, datasets, models and predictions</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>We collect and store the data sources that you input, post, transmit, stream, or upload to the BigML Services (“Data”). If you create a new BigML source that has been previously created by you, we never associate all or a portion of the previous source with your  newly created source and always store a duplicate. We assign a unique identifier to every data source that you create. Per our Terms of Use, you cannot download your data sources from BigML. You only have access to a small portion of it that we store separately so that you can preview the content and make sure that we are parsing your data source in the right way.</li>

                    <li>When you create a dataset from a previously created  dataset, we parse your data source and create a summarized version containing  a statical summary of the data in it and also create a serialized version of it. BigML stores both the summarized and the serialized versions. Per our terms of use, you can get access to the summarized version of your dataset but not to the serialized version. We assign a unique identifier to every dataset that you create.</li>

                    <li>If you create a dataset using one or more previously created datasets, we use their serialized versions to create the new dataset. We also store both the summarized version of the new dataset and the serialized version of the new dataset.</li>

                    <li>When you create a model from a previously created dataset, we use the summarized version and the serialized version to create a model.  Models can be seen as sophisticated statical summaries with predictive power. We store each model that you create so that you can use them to create real-time predictions. You can download your models at any time using the BigML API or get a visual representation of them through BigML.com. We assign a unique identifier to every new model that you create.</li>

                    <li>When you create a prediction from a previously created model, we use the corresponding model and the new data that you input to create the prediction. We store the data that you input and the prediction. We assign a unique identifier to every new prediction that you create.</li>

                    <li>At your own discretion, you can delete the data sources, datasets, models and predictions that you create. Upon your request we immediately delete them including their serialized versions from our front-end servers and start a batch process to fully remove them from our systems.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
