	<h3>What Personal Information About Customers Does  Gather?</h3>
		
	<p>The information we learn from customers helps us personalize and continually improve your experience at . Here are the types of information we gather.</p>
	
	<p><strong>Information You Give Us:</strong> We receive and store any 
	information you enter on our Web site or give us in any other way.  You can choose not 
	to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of 
	many of our features. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as 
	responding to your requests, customizing future visits for you, improving our services, 
	and communicating with you.</p>
	
	<p>You provide most such information when you buy, or participate in a contest or 
	questionnaire, or communicate with customer service. For example, you provide 
	information when you purchase a product; join a site; provide information to customer 
	support regarding an account (you might have more than one if you have used more than 
	one e-mail address, user name, or credit card when shopping with us); communicate 
	with us by phone, e-mail, or otherwise; or complete a questionnaire or a contest 
	entry form. As a result of those actions, you might supply us with such information 
	as your name, address, and phone number; credit card information; e-mail addresses; 
	birth date and content of e-mails to us.</p>
	
	<p><strong>Automatic Information:</strong> We receive and store 
	certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many 
	Web sites, we use "cookies," and we obtain certain types of information when your 
	Web browser accesses .  A number of companies offer utilities designed 
	to help you visit Web sites anonymously. Due to the sensitive issues involving 
	access to adult content by children, we do not permit access to our sites from 
	these anonymous services.</p>
	
	<p>Examples of the information we collect and analyze include the Internet protocol 
	(IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet; login name; e-mail 
	address; password; computer and connection information such as browser type and 
	version, operating system, and platform; purchase history; the full Uniform 
	Resource Locators (URL) clickstream to, through, and from our Web site, including 
	date and time; cookie number; products you viewed; services you visited; your 
	customer service history, and phone number used to call our 800 number.</p>
	
	<p><strong>E-mail Communications:</strong> To help us make e-mails 
	more useful and interesting, we often receive a confirmation when you open e-mail 
	from . We also compare our customer list to lists 
	received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages 
	to our customers. If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, 
	simply send email to <a href="mailto:remove@vs.com">remove@vs.com</a>.</p>

	<h3>What About Cookies?</h3>
	
	<p>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard 
	drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser 
	and to provide features such as "What's New".</p>
	
	<p>The "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent 
	your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when 
	you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. However, cookies 
	allow you to take full advantage of some of VideoSecrets' coolest services, and 
	we recommend that you leave them turned on.</p>

<div class="space_big">
	<h3>Does  Share the Information It Receives?</h3>
		
	<p>Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in 
	the business of selling it to others. We share customer information only with the 
	subsidiaries , controls and as described below.</p>

	
	<p><strong>Agents:</strong> We employ other companies and individuals 
	to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include processing credit card payments 
	in real time, sending e-mail notifications or updates, and providing customer 
	service. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, 
	but they do not have our authorization to use it for other purposes.</p>


	<p><strong>Promotional Offers:</strong> Sometimes we send offers to 
	selected groups of VideoSecrets customers on behalf of other businesses. When we do 
	this, we do not give that business your name and address. If you do not want to 
	receive such offers, please send email 
	to <a href="mailto:remove@vs.com">remove@vs.com</a></p>
		
	<p><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> As we continue to develop our 
	business, we might sell or buy sites or assets. In such transactions, customer 
	information may be one of the transferred business assets. Also, in the unlikely 
	event that VideoSecrets, or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer 
	information will of course be one of the transferred assets.</p>

	<p><strong>Protection of  and Others:</strong> We 
	release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate 
	to comply with law; enforce or apply our Terms and Conditions and other agreements; 
	or protect the rights, property, or safety of , our users, or 
	others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for 
	fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</p>

	<p><strong>With Your Consent:</strong> Other than as set out above, you 
	will receive notice when information about you might go to third parties, and you will 
	have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.</p>

	an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate 
	credit card company during order processing.</p>
