<p align="left">Privacy Policy for <span style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: rgb(255,255,255)">bighow.org</span> </p>

<p><br>
    bighow.org respect and are committed to protecting your privacy. That is 
    why we have adopted this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy lets you know 
    how your personal information is processed and used. We promise that we will 
    take steps to use your personal information only in ways that are compatible 
    with this Privacy Policy. Please read the following to learn more about our 
    privacy policy.<br>
    <br>
    </p><h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    bighow.org collects personal information when you register with 
    bighow.org. This is optional and for registration purposes only. 
    Registration allows you to participate in the bighow.org activities and 
    allows us to identify you as a unique member of the bighow.org. <br>
    <br>
    
    We do not collect personal information when you visit our site unless you 
    signup for a service, place an order, register, complete a survey or enter a 
    contest. When you signup for a service, we will ask you for the following 
    personal information: name and e-mail address. We may use your personal 
    information to contact you for account purposes. When you place an order, we 
    will ask you for the following personal information: name, e-mail address, 
    mailing address, phone number, and credit card number and its expiration 
    date. This information is requested to verify your identity. This 
    information is transmitted via a secure encrypted server using Secure 
    Sockets Layer (SSL) technology, the approved industry standard. We may use 
    your personal information to contact you for account purposes. When you 
    submit feedback or questions via e-mail, or contact us for information about 
    our Web site, we will request your name and e-mail address. We use this 
    information solely to respond to your inquiries.<br>
    <br>
    <h2>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    bighow.org certifies that all personal information relating to its members 
    and clients, including email addresses and personal information, will be 
    kept confidential. We do not share, sell, rent or barter any identifiable 
    personal information to any third party. <br>
    <br>
<h2>Advertisments &amp; Resources</h2>
<b>Google</b>, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on our 
        site. <br>
        <br>
        Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to your users 
        based on their visit to your sites and other sites on the Internet. <br>
        <br>
        Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google 
        ad and content network privacy policy. <br>
        Because publisher sites and laws across countries vary, we're unable to 
        suggest specific privacy policy language. However, you may wish to 
        review resources such as the Network Advertising Initiative, or NAI, 
        which suggests the following language for data collection of 
        non-personally identifying information:<br>
        <br>
        We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our 
        website. These companies may use information (not including your name, 
        address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this 
        and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and 
        services of interest to you. If you would like more information about 
        this practice and to know your choices about not having this information 
        used by these companies, <a href="http://networkadvertising.org/" target="_blank">click here</a>.<br>
        <br>
        You can find additional information in Appendix A of the NAI 
        Self-Regulatory principles for publishers (PDF). Please note that the 
        NAI may change this sample language at any time.<br>
        <br>
    <h2>Cookies </h2>
    From time to time, bighow.org or its advertisers may send a "cookie" to 
    your computer. A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent to your 
    Internet browser from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. 
    A cookie can't read data off of your computer hard disk or read cookie files 
    created by other Web sites. Cookies do not damage your system. We use 
    cookies to identify which areas of bighow.org's you have visited or 
    customized, so the next time you visit, those pages may be readily 
    accessible. Our advertisers may also use cookies to ascertain how many times 
    you've seen an advertisement. Our advertisers and we may use this 
    information to better personalize the content, banners, and promotions that 
    you see on our site. You can choose whether to accept cookies by changing 
    the settings of your Internet browser. You can reset your browser to refuse 
    all cookies, or allow your browser to show you when a cookie is being sent.
