# Big Contacts - Contact Management tool for everyone

Big Contacts has created this privacy statement ("Statement") in order to demonstrate our commitment to customer privacy. Privacy on the Big Contacts web service (the "Site") is of great importance to us. We have established this Statement as a means to communicate our information gathering and dissemination practices. We reserve the right to change this Statement and will provide notification of the change at least thirty (30) business days prior to the change taking effect. Notification will appear here and by email sent to all registered users. 

## Collected Information:

We require customers who register to use the services offered on our Site (collectively, the "Service") to give us contact information, such as their name, company name, address, phone number, and e-mail address, and billing information, such as billing name and address, credit card number, and the number of users within the organization that will be using the Service. Customers can opt out of providing this additional information by not entering it when asked. Customers can update or remove their personal information at any time by logging into Big Contacts and editing their Personal Information on the Admin link. Customers can view their updated profile to confirm their changes have been made. 

Big Contacts uses the information that we collect to set up the Service for our users. Email addresses and any personal customer information will not be distributed or shared with third parties. Customers can opt out of being contacted by us, or receiving such information from us, at any time by sending an email to support@bigcontacts.com. Separately, users are also asked to provide an email address when registering for the Service, in order to receive a username and password. We may also email information from time to time regarding updates to the Service or company. 

We do not disclose to third parties any information provided. All billing information that we collect through the Site is used solely to bill for the Service. This billing information is not used by Big Contacts for marketing or promotional purposes. Big Contacts uses a third-party intermediary to manage the credit card processing. This intermediary is solely a link in the distribution chain, and is not permitted to store, retain, or use the information provided, except for the sole purpose of credit card processing. 

Users of the Service ("Users") will be using the Site to host data and information ("Data"). Users own the Data that is hosted on the service. Big Contacts will not review, share, distribute, print, or reference any such Data. Individual records may at times be viewed or accessed only for the purpose of resolving a support issue and only when requested and approved by the User who owns the Data. Users are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of their user registration and password.

When you use the Big Contacts web service, our web servers send a cookie to your computer. Big Contacts uses session cookies containing encrypted information to allow the system to uniquely identify you while you are logged in. Session cookies help us make sure you are who you say you are after you've logged in and are required in order to use the Big Contacts service. Only Big Contacts can read and use these session cookies and only to identify the fact that you are a Big Contacts user. We do not store account numbers or passwords in session cookies. Users who disable their web browsers ability to accept cookies will not be able to use the Big Contacts Service. 

## Security:

Our Site has security measures in place to help protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the Data under our control. Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology protects information using both server authentication and data encryption to help ensure that Data is safe, secure, and available only to you. Big Contacts also implements an advanced security method based on dynamic data and encoded session identifications, and hosts the Site in a secure server environment that uses a firewall and other advanced technology to prevent interference or access from outside intruders. Finally, Big Contacts provides unique user names and passwords that must be entered each time a customer logs on. These safeguards help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of Data.
