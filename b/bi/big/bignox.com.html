            and how we handle that information. </p>

        <p><b style="font-weight: bold;">Information which permits us to identify you directly or indirectly is considered personal data in the European Union (EU) 
            according to the provisions of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). To the extent we collect and process 
            any personal data that is covered by the EU GDPR, we will do so in accordance with the requirements of the EU GDPR.</b>
             The principles of data protection not apply to anonymous information, namely information which does not 
             relate to an identified or identifiable natural person or to personal data rendered anonymous 
             in such a manner that the data subject is not or no longer identifiable. </p>
        <p>In general, you can visit Nox on the Web without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself. 
            To the extent that you do provide information to Nox, Nox will never sell, rent or disclose your personally identifiable
             information to outside parties for their own marketing purposes without your consent. With your permission, 
             Nox may send you e-mail regarding our new products, upgrades, or select third party products. 
             We do not disclose your personally identifiable information to such third parties.</p>
        <h2>What type of information is collected from you?</h2>
        <p>Nox only collects personal information which is reasonably necessary for its dealings with the individuals
             to whom the information relates. The types of personal information Nox collects will 
             depend on the particular dealings we have with you. However, generally, we collect and hold personal information
              about existing and prospective customers, our third party service providers and suppliers, 
              and employment applicants.</p>
        <p>Generally, Nox collects personal information directly from the individuals concerned. 
            For instance, there are times when we may need to collect information from you through our Web Sites. 
            This generally involves filling out forms so you can download or order a Nox or third party product 
            from our Web Sites. When you download the products we require you to fill out a form with your name 
            and email address.</p>
        <p>Nox may also collect personal information about individuals indirectly from third parties, such as 
            from our business partners, from third party providers of marketing lists, and through various other methods, 
            including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cookies</li>
            <li>Referrers</li>
            <li>IP addresses</li>
            <li>System information</li>
        </ul>
        <p>None of these methods can be used to identify, or reasonably identify, you with the exception of cookies, 
            which can optionally store information that you may enter in forms on our Web Sites.</p>

        <h2>How and why is your information used?</h2>
        <p>You have complete control over your personal information. In general, you can visit our website 
            without providing us with any personal information. However, there are instances where 
            we must have your personal information in order for us to grant you access to our protected and secured sites.
             This information may include registration data (your name, address, email address, phone number, title, etc.),
              information request data and response data ("User Information"). When you receive your confirmation email 
              or when you receive any email from the list server, you will be given instructions on how to remove yourself
               from the list.</p>

        <h3>Use of User Information</h3>
        <p>We intend to use such information for purposes of supporting your relationship with Nox by designing content 
            that is suitable to your needs and alerting you to new product and service offerings as they become available. 
            This User Information may be retained by Nox to verify compliance with the agreement between Nox and

            However, we may share User Information with our business partners for marketing, 
            advertising or product/service offering purposes. We disclose User Information 
            if: we have your consent; we need to share it in order to provide you with the 
            products and/or services you requested; we respond to a court order or you violate our Terms of Use. 
            You may separately agree to provide your personal information to third parties 
            that provide content for Nox offerings, in order to access and/or use their products and/or services. 
            If you agree to provide such information to these third parties, then your personal information 
            will be subject to their privacy policies. In the case of a personal data breach, 
            we will without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after 
            having become aware of it, notify the personal data breach to the supervisory authority 
            and also communicate it to the data subject.</p>

        <h3>Accuracy and Security</h3>
        <p>The accuracy and security of the User Information is important to Nox. 
            If you contact us to correct your User Information, we will attempt to 
            correct such inaccuracies in a timely manner.  And you have the right 
            to have incomplete personal data completed, including by means of 
            providing a supplementary statement. Nox is concerned with the security 
            of your User Information and is committed to taking reasonable steps to 
            protect it from unauthorized access and use of that personal information. 
            We implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure 
            a level of security appropriate to the risk, including pseudonymisation 
            and encryption of personal data. We also put in place the appropriate physical, 
            electronic and managerial policies and procedures to secure your personal User Information.
             We continue to implement procedures to maintain accurate, complete and 
             current User Information. While we implement safeguards designed to protect your 
             User Information, no security system is impenetrable and due to the 
             inherent nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that data, 
             during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our systems 
             or otherwise in our care，is absolutely safe from intrusion by others.</p>
        <h3>Use of cookies</h3>
        <p>Nox uses "cookies". The use of cookies is an industry standard, 
            and you'll find cookies at most major websites. A cookie is a small data 
            file that a website can transfer to a visitor's hard drive to keep 
            records of the visits to such site. A cookie contains information, 
            such as your User Information, that helps us recognize the pages 
            you have visited and improve future visits, but the only personal information
             a cookie can contain is the information that you provide yourself. 
             A cookie cannot read data off of your hard drive or read cookie files created 
             by other sites. If you prefer not to accept a cookie, you can set your 
             Web browser to refuse all cookies or to warn you before accepting a cookie. 
             You can still access most of the features on our website even without accepting a cookie.</p>
        <h3>Links to other websites</h3>
        <p>Nox’s website provides links to other third party websites. Even if the third party is 
            affiliated with Nox through a business partnership or otherwise, Nox is not responsible
             for the privacy policies or practices or the content of such external links. 
             These links are provided to you for convenience purposes only and you access them at your own risk.</p>
        <h3>Google Analytics and Advertising</h3>
        <p>Nox uses all features of Google Analytics for Display Advertisers. This includes obtaining specific 
            visitor cookie data, such as the source, medium and keyword used to visit our Web Sites. 
            Google Analytics does not store any visitor-specific data and we will not use visitor-specific data 
            in any way related to Google Analytics, Google AdWords, and Remarketing. Nox and other third-party vendors, 
            including Google, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and 
            third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to inform, optimize, 
            and serve ads based on visitors’ past visits to our Web Sites.</p>

            The length of time we retain your personal information for is determined by operational 
            and legal considerations. For example, we are legally required to hold some types of information

             to object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, at any time to processing 
             of personal data concerning you. We will no longer process the personal data unless 
             we demonstrates compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override the 
             interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject or for the establishment, exercise 
             or defence of legal claims. Please contact support at bignox dot com if you would like 
             to make a request. However, that we may need to retain certain information for record
