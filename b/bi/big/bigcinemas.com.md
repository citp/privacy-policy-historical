You are not obligated to provide us any personal information and if at any time you no longer wish to receive communications from us, you are free to "opt-out" of receiving these communications. Because this Privacy Policy applies to any person who provides information to BIG Cinemas through its website, we strongly urge you to fully review this Privacy Policy. Your use of this website constitutes acceptance of this Privacy Policy and any other applicable terms.

You further acknowledge and agree that BIG Cinemas may, in its sole discretion, preserve or disclose your Content, as well as your information, such as email addresses, IP addresses, timestamps, and other user information, if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: comply with legal process; enforce the TOU; respond to claims that any Content violates the rights of third-parties; respond to claims that contact information (e.g. phone number, street address) of a third-party has been posted or transmitted without their consent or as a form of harassment; protect the rights, property, or personal safety of BIG Cinemas, its users or the general public.

Our surveys may ask you for contact information, demographic information and lifestyle-related information (such as your interests, pastimes, buying preferences, etc). We may run contests on our site in which visitors are asked for contact and/or demographic information. We may also gather the Internet Protocol address and e-mail address of visitors to our website and the e-mail addresses of those who communicate with us via e-mail. In addition to this personal information, our web servers automatically collect website usage information from you when you visit our site. 

**Our Use Of Your Information**

Overall, we seek to use information collected through our website to enhance the experience of visitors to our site. BIG Cinemas, its affiliates or partners may use this information in a variety of ways, including:

To supply you with information, products or services you have requested, or to otherwise contact you about BIG Cinemas or its affiliates, their products, services, advertising, upcoming events, special offers or promotions, or for other purposes disclosed when you submit your information to our website.

  * To facilitate us in marketing and advertising our products and services and those of other businesses.
  * To improve the content and navigation on our website.

We do not share information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless you affirmatively agree to such disclosure - typically by opting in to receive information from a third party that is participating in a sweepstakes or other promotion on one of our websites. If you do not want your information to be used by a third party for direct marketing purposes (or other purposes unrelated to the uses described herein), do not opt in to such use by that third party. Please note that if you opt in to receive direct marketing from a third party, your information will be subject to that party’s privacy policy.

Because the Internet offers open access to a wide range of information, it is important that parents supervise and prevent access to inappropriate content, email or other such communication sessions.
