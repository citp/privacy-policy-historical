## Information we collect and how we use it

Curious about what we do with your data? Well, you’ve come to the right place! When you use any of our websites, our SenseME application or our kickass SenseME products, we may collect information to improve our products and services (progress is kind of our thing), how we market, or to process the data related to energy efficiency and thermal comfort. 

The data collected is gathered using some pretty cool technology, including tools like Google Analytics and reporting from our apps/devices in communication with our cloud servers, aptly dubbed the Big Ass Cloud. Information about your web browser, operating system, pages visited, and more are also gathered through Google Analytics and similar tools. 

If it strikes your fancy, you may choose to provide personal information (such as your name, address, telephone number and email address) on this web site or to Big Ass Fans via other methods as described below. We also tell you how we may use the information (it’s not to stalk you if that’s what you’re worried about). If you use our Haiku Home SenseME products, we’ll collect and store data from your connected fans and/or devices in accordance with this data privacy policy.

Here are some of the ways you may provide the information and the types of information you may submit. Kudos to you for giving a damn!

### Product Registration

When you purchase a product from Big Ass Fans or register through the SenseME application, we may request a variety of information to allow us to provide better service. And better service means a happier YOU. This information can include your name, address, phone number, email address, product’s model number, serial number and purchase date.

### Data from SenseME Products

The data collected is gathered from our apps/devices in communication with our cloud servers, the Big Ass Cloud. This data is used to improve future products and develop more super awesome features or services for our customers.

Our apps and devices collect information such as:

  * Room Temperature
  * The state of the device (examples: on/off, speed)
  * The device’s IP address
  * Occupancy in order to help control energy usage and thermal comfort
  * The device uptime, firmware version, and technical information about the app and device
  * Account information including the data you share during the sign-up process



### Sales, Service and Promotional Activity

If you schedule a service call or delivery, make a consumer inquiry, purchase parts, participate in our promotional activities (such as rebates or contests) or email us through the “Contact Us” link on this site, we ask you for information such as your name and email address so we can respond to your questions and comments. You may choose to provide additional information as well. So click, comment and ask away! Unsurprisingly, we love talking about our products. 

### Questionnaires and Surveys

We occasionally may ask visitors to our web site and consumers to complete online surveys and opinion polls about their activities, attitudes and interests. You’re a donkey person? Hell yes! These surveys help us serve you better and improve the usefulness of our site. In conducting these surveys we may ask you for your name and email address. But no worries; we do not keep any personal information about you in connection with your participation in a Big Ass Fans survey unless you specifically agree to provide that information.

### Information from Third-Party Sources

We may receive information about you from publicly and commercially available sources (as permitted by law), which we may combine with other information we receive from or about you. We also may receive information about you from third-party social networking services when you choose to connect with those services. Yay for interconnectedness! 

### Online Services and Web Browser Tools

We also may use personal information for other additional purposes, which we identify at the time of collection. You may choose not to provide us (we can appreciate a little mystery) with certain types of information, but doing so may affect your ability to use some services.

## Information We Share

We share data inside Big Ass Fans with tools and people who are focused on improving the benefits of our products and services and to learn how to better market and sell. Like how we do things around here? Data from previous customers has helped mold us in to who we are today! The tools used to analyze the data are often developed or hosted by third parties through secure browsing sessions and/or encrypted data. 

Your data is super duper safe with us. We limit data shared with any third party even if you connect to them through our apps. For example, if you sign up to connect your Haiku SenseME fan with a smart thermostat like Nest or ecobee, then you can rest assured we do not share any data with the thermostat company. We do access your thermostat’s data to provide better thermal comfort and increased energy efficiency. This information is transmitted through secure connections. If you connect Amazon’s Echo with our awesome Haiku SenseMe fans or lights, we share the name you gave the fan with Echo so Alexa knows what you want when you say “Alexa – turn on the fan in **Bobby’s Room**.”

If you choose to have your products installed by Big Ass Fans or one of our trusted installers, we’ll keep things on lockdown by **not** sharing information about the products you purchased and any specific installation requirements. 

In the event Big Ass Fans receives a valid legal request, we may be required to share your information with authorities who have jurisdiction to make such requests. 

## Information We Transfer

We’re international, baby, so we may transfer the personal information we collect on this site to other countries where we do business, but we will do so only for the purposes described above. When we transfer your information to other countries, we will protect that information as described here unless otherwise required by applicable laws.

If you choose to provide information to us and are located outside the United States of America, please be advised that Big Ass Fans dba Haiku Home will transfer your personal information to the United States of America and process it there. By submitting your personal information, you consent to this Privacy Policy and consent to such transfer. By using this site or otherwise providing Big Ass Fans with your personal information, you warrant that you have the right to transfer such information outside your country and into the United States of America.

## Links to Other Sites

To keep things running ultra-smooth we provide links to other web sites for your convenience and information. These sites may have their own privacy statements in place, which we recommend you review if you visit any linked web sites. We are not responsible for the content of linked sites or any use of the sites.
