# bigsight - a directory of people doing good work

At bigsight media group, your privacy as a user of our Company Sites is among our top concerns. As we've developed this application over the past six months, we have continually updated and upgraded our Privacy Policy and how it interacts with various iterations of the product. The final Privacy Policy below details the measures taken by the Company to protect your privacy in connection with your use of [_http://www.bigsight.org_](http://www.bigsight.org/) and other sites owned and operated by the Company (henceforth Company Sites). Our Company Sites are built and distributed publicly on the web as public directories of people-specific information. The information included in public profiles is either input by the individual profiled (User Content), by an editor employed by the Company, or by a third party. 

**The Difference Between an Editor-Managed, Public Directory and a User-Managed Profile Network:** Our Company Sites are comprised of editor-managed directories and not user-managed networks like many currently found on the public Internet. This difference is critical to how we approach and deal with privacy and personally identifiable information. There are four key differences between the two:

  
_User-Managed Profile Network_|  _Editor-Managed, Public Directory of Profiles_  
---|---  
  
  * User has 100% editorial control of information 
  * User content must submit to few restrictions
  * User identity must be verified 
  * Site owners cannot build third party profiles

| 

  * User shares editorial control with site editors
  * User content must adhere to form and design standards
  * Verification is at the discretion of site editors
  * Site editors and users can build third party profiles

  
  
**Content Levels and Information Structure in Public Profiles:** Our directory is comprised of public profiles which include various information levels tied to the profiled individual. These include but are not limited to name, age, location, biography, and skills. The Company has sole discretion over which of the over 50 content levels will be included in the public profile, and in what order.

**Disclaimer about Accuracy of Information in Profiles:** As editors we strive to ensure that each profile contains the most accurate and up to date information about the individual profiled; however, given the various sources from which this information is derived, we cannot ensure that it is completely accurate or up-to-date. 

**Acceptable Use and a Note about Children:** Children (i.e. those persons under the age of 18) are not eligible to use any of the Company Sites without supervision. We ask that children do not submit any information to us. If you are under the age of 18 and want to use any of the Company Sites, you may only do so under the supervision of your legal parents or guardians.

**Information Collection, Including Personally Identifiable Information:** The Company collects various levels of information at a number of different stages:

  


_Profile Build:_ At the time of building a public profile, the company asks for full name, e-mail address, birthday, current geographic location, and various other information levels. Once the user has submitted this information, a public profile is created, and may be updated at any time. 

_Editing:_ Anyone may edit a public profile and submit that information for editorial review. At the time of editing, the company asks for any additional or new information. Once this information is submitted, it is sent to the editors for review, and is either accepted, adjusted and accepted, or declined in part or full. At the time of editing we may also collect personally identifiable information to ensure informational integrity.

_Subscription to Additional Services:_ The Company may occasionally present an additional service or special promotion that requires personal information. This includes but is not limited to a job and project board.

_IP Address:_ An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a unique string of numbers assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider. Web servers automatically identify your computer by its IP address. We will use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our site. Your IP address may also be used to gather broad demographic and geographic information for advertising and other purposes.

_Cookies:_ A "cookie is a small data file that is often placed on your hard drive when you visit websites. We use cookies to collect, store, and sometimes track information for statistical purposes in order to improve the services we provide. These cookies do not enable third parties to access any of your personally identifiable information. In addition, be aware that if you visit other websites linked from Company Sites, you may be required to accept cookies. Advertisers and partners may also use their own cookies. We do not control use of these cookies and expressly disclaim responsibility for information collected through them.

  
_Links to Other Sites:_ The Company Sites contain links to other Web sites. The Company is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. The Company Sites may also link to websites that feature Company trademarks and names along with trademarks and names of other companies. You should look at the privacy policy on all such sites, as these sites may not be under Company's control. 

**Information Available to Public Search Engines:** Each profile is created to be open and publicly available on the Internet; as such, information submitted to us through the site quickly becomes part of a much larger public database of web pages. Because of this, profiles will likely appear in public search engines. These search engines often take "pictures" of each page and record past versions of them as "cached" copies of the site. This means that it is possible that search engines might present out-dated data for a profile; furthermore, should you elect to have your profile deleted at any time, we cannot guarantee that it will be deleted from third party databases. As such, we cannot be held liable for this cached information. 

**Limited Editorial and Content Control on Public Profiles:** We operate our site as a public directory; as such, we aim to ensure each profile adheres to standards of form and design that we set and can adjust at any time. These profiles are thus maintained by a team of Company-hired editors. While the editors aim to give as much content control as possible to the users, they retain the right to modify and adjust any profile at any time. Should you disagree with a specific edit, please contact [_editor@bigsight.org_](mailto:editor@bigsight.org) to discuss this matter; if your request is not resolved and you remain displeased, you can have your profile deleted ([delete@bigsight.org](mailto:delete@bigsight.org)).

**How Personally Identifiable Information is Used by the Company:** If you submit a profile to our site for yourself or a third party, you are required to contribute your current e-mail address. We may, from time to time, e-mail you with informative messages about our site and services or third party products or services we believe may be of interest to you. The newsletters may contain code that enables our database to track your usage of the newsletters, including whether the e-mail was opened and/or what links (if any) were followed. We will combine that information to other information we have about you and may use that information to improve your site experience and/or provide customized e-mail communications to you. In addition, the company may from time to time gather user information to provide you with a customized experience on our sites. Your user information helps us to tailor the content, services, goods and advertising to your current and future needs. For this reason, we may at times ask you to register or to provide personal information when you visit certain areas of the Company Sites or subscribe to a newsletter. 

**Limits of Information Available to Web Surfers:** Each profile is open and public to any site visitor or web surfer; however, only limited information is available to them. The company does not allow surfers to view or obtain the profiled individual's birthday or e-mail address.

**Use of Information in Public Profiles:** As a user of the Company Sites you will have access to certain personal information. You agree to use this information for informational purposes only. If you are aware of someone mis-using the site or replicating profile content without permission of the Company, please report it to our editor ([editor@bigsight.org](mailto:editor@bigsight.org)).   


**With Whom Does the Company Share Information:** Your privacy is of utmost importance to us. As such, we do not sell, rent, or give access to your personal information to third parties for any purposes. However, the company may disclose information you provide if required to do so by law or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is necessary to 1) comply with the law or with legal process served on the company; 2) act in an emergency to protect someone's safety. We may at times gather demographic information from you (for example, your age, education level, etc.) from time to time. We will not share that information in a manner that identifies you in any way, unless we specifically ask for your permission at the time of data collection. In the event that Company or part of the company is acquired by another company, your personal information may be part of the assets transferred to the acquiring party.

**Security Measures:** The Company has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. These security measures include a firewall to prevent unauthorized access to our systems and maintenance of registration information in a secure database. Although we will exercise reasonable care in providing secure transmission of information between your computer and our servers, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information transmitted to us over the Internet and we accept no liability for any unintentional disclosure.    


**Acceptance of Privacy Policy:** Your use of the Company Sites, including any dispute concerning privacy, is subject to this Privacy Policy and Company's Terms of Use. By using Company Sites, you are accepting the practices set out in this Privacy Statement and those Terms of Use. We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the changes on this page. Please check the revision date at the bottom of this page to determine if the statement has been modified since you last reviewed it. Your continued use of any portion of the Company Sites following posting of the updated Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of the changes.

In the event that there are significant changes in the way we treat your personally identifiable information, we will display a notice on this site; however unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Policy applies to all information that we have about you and your profile.
