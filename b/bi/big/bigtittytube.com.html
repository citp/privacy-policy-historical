    		<ul class="marginLarge paddingLarge">

    		    <li class="marginMedium">We provide personally identifiable information and non-personally-identifiable information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies, or other businesses or persons for the purpose of processing such information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to process such information in compliance with our privacy policy, and we use reasonable efforts to limit their use of such information and to use other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.</li>

    		    <li class="marginMedium">We do not share your personally identifiable information (such as name or email address) with other, third-party companies for their commercial or marketing use without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out.</li>

    		    <li class="marginMedium">Bigtittytube also reserves the right to disclose personally identifiable information and/or non-personally-identifiable information that Bigtittytube believes, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to enforce our <a href="index.php?view=info_terms">Terms of Use</a>, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend itself against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, to protect the security or integrity of our web site, and to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Bigtittytube, our Users or others.</li>

    		<p class="marginLarge">Bigtittytube allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the Bigtittytube Sites.

However, please note that if an advertiser asks Bigtittytube to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men ages 18-34) or audience segment (for example, men ages 18-24 who have viewed certain channels of content) and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach.</p>

    		<p class="marginLarge">You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks. Bigtittytube's privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites.</p>
