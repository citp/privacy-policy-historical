         As set forth in the Conditions of Use, Bigfoot provides (a) computing and information services and (b)
         telecommunications services (including the Bigfoot SMS Manager, Bigfoot Conference Call and Domain Registration)
         (collectively the "Services" or the "Bigfoot Services") to persons who join Bigfoot as
         non-paying Members or Premium Users or other persons using the Services ("Members" or
         "Users" or "you"). As part of the registration process for the Services, you are asked to
         provide certain personal information and (if applicable) credit card or other billing information. The policy of
         Bigfoot is to protect the privacy of Bigfoot Members who are using any of the Bigfoot Services. Please be aware,
         however, that as a condition of membership and use of the Bigfoot Services, Bigfoot requires Members to select
         areas of interest and thereby agree to receive marketing materials from Bigfoot or third parties related to
         those interests. Members may choose at any time to opt-out of mailings on their profile, including during
         registration and when they receive any third-party mailings from Bigfoot; however, Bigfoot reserves the right to
         cancel the membership of Non-Premium Users in the event such a Member chooses to completely opt-out of all
         mailings.<br><br>
         Please recognize that it is the policy of Bigfoot to protect the privacy of its Members, and thus Bigfoot will
         only allow third parties to have access to information concerning Users ("User Information") in the
         following situations:<br><br>
         (i) Bigfoot will provide access to certain User Information to third-party suppliers in order for them to
         perform certain functions for us as necessitated by the Member's use of any of the Services -- for example,
         credit card numbers are sent to a credit card processing company for billing. These suppliers are not authorized
         to release this information to other third parties.<br><br>
         (ii) Bigfoot will disclose User Information in cases where, in its discretion, it deems such disclosure required
         or appropriate in order to comply with applicable laws and regulations.<br><br>
                  (iii) Bigfoot is a commerce and advertising supported business 
                  and the availability of the Services depends substantially on 
                  its perceived value among marketers that pay for advertisements 
                  and retail opportunities through Bigfoot. Marketers seek to 
                  direct advertisements and shopping opportunities to Members 
                  who have expressed interest in a category relevant to the offer. 
                  Accordingly, Bigfoot may provide User Information (name and 
                  email address, but never your credit/debit card information 
                  or other payment information) to third parties for purposes 
                  of providing you information about third party products, promotions 
                  and services that are likely to be of interest to Members. If 
                  at any time you decide you do not wish to receive such third-party 
                  product information, you may opt-out of future mailings by contacting 
                  us at <a href="http://contactus.bigfoot.com" class="bluelink">http://contactus.bigfoot.com</a> 
                  and Bigfoot will honor such a request without question. Bigfoot 
                  reserves the right to cancel a Non-Premium User's membership 
                  in the event a Non-Premium User chooses to completely opt-out 
                  of all mailings.<br>
                  <br>
         (iv) If you visit or utilize the Bigfoot Directories service, we will collect certain information concerning
         your visits to the Bigfoot Directories, any information voluntarily provided by You to Bigfoot in the
         registration process, and information about websites a user visits and pages viewed by Bigfoot Users. We do this
         at Bigfoot because the information we collect aides in our efforts to analyze the aggregate usage patterns of
         our Users and to improve the Services offered by Bigfoot. But, you should feel comfortable in knowing that the
         collected information is not used to correlate your personal identity to your Internet usage behavior or
         activities. If you have any questions concerning Bigfoot's information collection policies, please contact us at
         <a href="http://contactus.bigfoot.com" class="bluelink">http://contactus.bigfoot.com</a>.<br><br>
         (v) Bigfoot will disclose User Information if the User gives permission, requests products that require
         identifying information for fulfillment, or we are required to do so by law or regulatory authority.<br><br>
         (vi) Notwithstanding anything else contained in this Privacy Policy, Bigfoot reserves the right to sell or
         otherwise transfer your User Information to one or more third parties in connection with a sale of all or
         substantially all of the assets of Bigfoot or in connection with the sale of all or substantially all of the
         stock or ownership interests in Bigfoot.<br>
         Bigfoot may send Users periodic emails containing information about Bigfoot, administrative notices about a
         User's account (such as notices about pending activities), updates on new Service features, usage tips relating
         to the Services, information about Bigfoot or third party products and services that are likely to be of
         interest to you, and user satisfaction questions. Bigfoot may also access user information for the following
         administrative purposes: (a) to examine system accounting logs and other company records to resolve email and
         other system errors or problems and (b) for billing purposes.<br><br>
         (vii) Like many companies, we transmit cookies to the hard drive of your computer. These cookies assign your Web
         browser a unique series of numbers, letters, or characters that enable Bigfoot servers to recognize and identify
         your Web browser when you are using the Service. They also enable Bigfoot to track and store information about
         your Internet usage path while using the Service. We use cookies for such functions as verifying that you are a
         Service user and counting and tracking your Web site visits. We further use cookies to determine the number of
         visitors that came to the Bigfoot Directories Web site through a particular advertisement, and your cookie
         number is also used to create usage paths and to correlate those with any demographic information you provide.
         We do not, however, use your cookies, or usage paths to attempt to determine your identity.<br><br>

         <p>If any person uses a credit or debit card to pay for any of the Services offered by Bigfoot requiring payment
         of a fee or fees (including the Premium User Service and any of the Bigfoot Services), Bigfoot will continue to
         charge your account until you provide Bigfoot notice of termination of use of the service (in accordance with
         the Conditions of Use) and all usage fees have been paid. Notwithstanding termination by a Member of the Premium
         User Services or of any other Bigfoot Service, Bigfoot will not refund any portion of the annual fee, any
         prepaid fee or any charges (except as may be expressly provided in the terms and conditions of use of any of the
         Bigfoot Services). Unless you advise Bigfoot of your desire to cancel the Premium User Service, your membership
         will be automatically renewed on quarterly basis and the quarterly fee will be charged to the credit or debit
         card you provided. As annual, quarterly, monthly or other periodic fees or charges may apply to the other
         Bigfoot Services, you are advised to review the terms and conditions of use for any of the Bigfoot Services you
         may use. If you give us credit or debit card information for any purpose other than payment of fees or charges
         associated with the Bigfoot Services or to pay for any other type of purchase, it will be used one time only to
         fulfill one order, and Bigfoot will not store your credit card information. Each User is responsible for all
         charges resulting from use of the Services, including unauthorized use prior to your notifying Bigfoot of such
         use and taking steps to prevent its further occurrence. Further, each User agrees to be financially responsible
         for use of the Services (as well as for use of your account by others, including minors living with you) and to
         comply with your responsibilities and obligations as stated in this Agreement.</p>

                    consent of a parent or legal guardian, before becoming a member 
                    of Bigfoot and before sending any personal information to 
                    Bigfoot, or anywhere on the Internet. All other children should

                    sending any personal information to Bigfoot, or anywhere on 
                    the Internet. Parents are encouraged to spend time online 
                    with their children to become familiar with the types of content 
                    available through Bigfoot and over the Internet in general 
                    and to regularly oversee their children's use of email and 
                    other online facilities. Children should check with their 
                    parents before supplying any information about themselves 
                    or their likes and dislikes, before they sign up for Bigfoot.

                    may be a condition of use of the Bigfoot Services) that Users 
                    provide certain information concerning the User's interests

         D. Bigfoot will be aggressive in terminating accounts of users who violate Bigfoot's Conditions of Use. If we
         must deny a consumer's application for service or terminate a consumer's relationship with us, in cases other
