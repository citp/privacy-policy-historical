We collect your personal information in the following ways:

  1. **A.     ****Registration**



In order to become a User, you must provide us the following information to create an account: name, email address, country, and password. Without this minimal amount of information, you cannot create a FaceBookPen account. Like other passwords, you should choose one that is known only by you. FacebookPen requests other information from you during the registration process, (e.g., gender, location, etc.) that FaceBookPen uses to provide better, more customized services such as language-specific profile pages and updates, better ads, and more valuable career opportunities. You acknowledge that this information is personal to you, and by creating an account on FaceBookPen, you allow others, including FaceBookPen, to identify you and to allow FaceBookPen to use your information in accordance with our User Agreement.

Once you become a User, you may provide additional information to your FaceBookPen [Profile](http://www.facebookpen.com/elgg/profile) describing your career, skills, professional experiences, educational background, recommendations from other FaceBookPen Users, group memberships, and networking objectives (among other options). Providing additional information about yourself beyond what is minimally required at registration is entirely up to you, but providing additional information enables you to derive more benefit from FaceBookPen and your career network by helping you build your career identity and leverage your career network and facilitating your search for career resources, information, and new opportunities. Any information you provide at registration or in the Profile section may be used by FaceBookPen as described in the User Agreement and this Privacy Policy, including for the purpose of allowing career opportunities to find you on FaceBokPen, or for serving more relevant advertisements on FaceBookPen.

Your FaceBookPen connections will also have access to your email address. You may not invite anyone you do not know and trust to connect with you.

You may also choose to manually enter or upload data about your contacts to the “Contacts” section of your account on FaceBookPen. Information entered into Contacts is only viewable by you. By providing email addresses or other information of non-Users to FaceBookPen, you represent that you have authority to do so. All information that you enter or upload about your contacts is covered by the User Agreement and this Privacy Policy and will enable us to provide customized services such as suggesting people to connect with on FaceBookPen.

  1. **D.     ****Customer Service**



We collect information when you interact with FaceBookPen during registration in order to accurately categorize users and respond to user’s inquiries and investigate breaches of our terms.

  1. **E.      ****Using the FaceBookPen Site and Applications**



We receive information when you interact with and use the FaceBookPen website, FaceBookPen Applications (e.g. FaceBookPen for iPhone, Android, etc.), and FaceBookPen platform technology (such as “Share on FacebookPen” plugins for publishers). For example, we know when you click on ads, upload your address book, join career groups, participate in polls, install a FaceBookPen mobile application, share articles on FaceBookPen, etc.

  1. **F.      ****Using Third Party Services and Visiting Third Party Sites**



We receive information when you use your FaceBookPen account to log in or authenticate to a third-party website or application. Also, if you are logged into FaceBookPen and visit a third party site that embeds FaceBookPen career plugins, like “Share on FaceBookPen” for web publishers, FaceBookPen will receive information that those pages have loaded in your web browser. FaceBookPen will use this information to personalize the FacebookPen-provided functionality, including providing you insights from your FaceBookPen network, allowing you to share information with your network, enabling you to use FaceBookPen functionality off the FcaeBookPen site and serving you more relevant advertising. Users wishing to disable this personalization may opt-out of this feature as of August 2011. FaceBookPen’s retention of this data is addressed in Section 1.K.

  1. **G.     ****Cookies**



Like most websites, we use cookies,third party tracking tool and web log files to track site usage and trends, to improve the quality of our service, to customize your experience on FaceBookPen, as well as to deliver FaceBookPen and third-party advertising to Users both on and off the FaceBookPen site. A cookie is a tiny data file that resides on your computer, mobile phone, or other device, and allows us to recognize you as a User when you return to the FaceBookPen website using the same computer and web browser. You can remove or block cookies using the settings in your browser, but in some cases doing so may impact your ability to use FaceBookPen. One type of cookie, known as a “persistent” cookie, is set once you’ve logged in to your FaceBookPen account. The next time you visit the FaceBookPen website, the persistent cookie will allow us to recognize you as an existing User so you will not need to log in before using the Services. In order to access or change any of your private information (like a credit card number) or to send a message to another User, however, you must log in securely again with your password even if your computer contains your persistent cookie. Another type of cookie, called a “session” cookie, is used to identify a particular visit to the FaceBookPen website. Session cookies expire after a short time or when you close your web browser. Other technology like Macromedia’s flash can be used to place the functional equivalent of a cookie on your computer. You can control flash “local stored objects” or “flash cookies” using the Macromedia Website Privacy Settings Panel at www.macromedia.com. FaceBookPen may use cookie-equivalent technology for the limited purpose of enhancing the security of FaceBookPen 's services. We do not use flash cookies for advertising purposes.

In the course of serving advertisements or optimizing the Services to our Users, we may allow authorized third parties to place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. Any information provided to third parties through cookies will not be personally identifiable but may provide general segment information (e.g., your industry or geography, career field, or information about your professional or educational background) for the enhancement of your user experience by providing more relevant advertising. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. FaceBookPen does not store unencrypted personally identifiable information in the cookies.

  1. **H.     ****Advertising and Web Beacons**



To support the Services we provide at no cost to our Users, as well as provide a more relevant and useful experience for our Users, we target and serve our own ads and third-party ads both on and off the site using ad networks. Ad networks include third party ad servers, ad agencies, ad exchanges, ad technology vendors and research firms.

We target ads to Users based on general profile categories (e.g., “product managers in New York”) or on non-personally identifiable information inferred from a User’s profile (e.g., industry, current or former company, school, compensation bracket, gender, age, ethnic origin, nationality, or other aspects of your life) in addition to a User’s use of FaceBookPen or their clicking on FaceBookPen ad inventory. FaceBookPen does not provide personally identifiable information to any third party ad network.

We use ad technology such as web beacons, pixels, anonymous ad network tags, and cookies to more effectively serve ads to our Users on and off FaceBookPen through ad networks, as well as to collect anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for advertisers. Because your web browser requests advertisements and web beacons directly from ad network servers, these networks can view, edit or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site.

You may opt-out of ads served to you off FaceBookPen by turning off “Advertising Preferences.” If you opt-out you may lose certain functionality of the FaceBookPen Services, as well as the potential benefit of receiving ads that are targeted to your career interests which, in turn, may limit your ability to fully realize the benefits of the FaceBookPen Services to build and leverage your professional network.

  1. **I.        ****Log files, IP Addresses and information about your computer and mobile device**



Due to the communications standards on the internet, when you visit the FaceBookPen website we automatically receive the URL of the site from which you came and the site to which you are going when you leave FaceBookPen. Additionally, advertisers receive the URL of the page you were on when you click on an ad on FaceBookPen. FaceBookPen also receives the internet protocol (“IP”) address of your computer (or the proxy server you use to access the World Wide Web), your computer operating system and type of web browser you are using, email patterns, your mobile device (including your UDID) and mobile operating system (if you are accessing FaceBookPen using a mobile device), as well as the name of your ISP or your mobile carrier. FaceBookPen may also receive location data passed to it from third-party services or GPS-enabled devices that you have enabled. Also, as described above in Sections 1.E. and 1.F., FaceBookPen receives information when you access web pages containing FaceBookPen interactive plugins, such as “Share on FaceBookPen” or “Apply with FaceBookPen” functionality. You can control the collection and use of this information. The link between your IP address and your personally identifiable information is not shared with third parties without your permission, except as described in Section 2.L (“Compliance with Legal Process”), below.

  1. **J.       ****Rights to Access, Correct and Eliminate Information About You**



You have a right to access, modify, correct and eliminate the data you supplied to FaceBookPen. If you update any of your information, we may keep a copy of the information that you originally provided to us in our archives for uses documented in this policy. You may request deletion of your information at any time. We will respond to your request within 30 days. Please note, however that information you have shared with others, or that other Users have copied, may also remain visible even if you request its deletion.

  1. **K.     ****Data Retention**



FaceBookPen will retain your information for so long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services, except in the case of our professional plugin impression data, which we de-identify after 12 months. If you wish to close your account, you may do so at anytime. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce this Agreement.

  1. **2.      ****Uses of personal information**
    1.  **A.     ****Consent to** **FaceBookPen Processing Information About You**



The information you provide to FaceBookPen may reveal, or allow others to identify, your nationality, ethnic origin, gender, age, and other aspects of your life. By providing information to us for the purposes of creating your User account or adding any additional details to your FaceBookPen profile, you are expressly and voluntarily accepting the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy and FaceBookPen’s User Agreement that allow LinkedIn to process information about you. Supplying information to FaceBookPen, including any information deemed “sensitive” by applicable law, is entirely voluntary on your part. You have the right to withdraw your consent to FaceBookPen’s collection and processing of your information at any time, in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy and the User Agreement, by changing your settings, or by closing your account, but please note that your withdrawal of consent will not be retroactive.

  1. **B.      ****FaceBookPen Communications**



As described in the User Agreement, we will communicate with you through email, notices posted on the FaceBookPen website, messages to your FaceBookPen inbox, or through other means available through the service, including mobile text messages. We may send you a series of emails that help inform new Users about the features of the Services, and we will also send you service messages relating to the functioning of the Services. We may also send you messages with promotional information directly or on behalf of our partners, unless you have opted out of receiving promotional information.

You can change your e-mail and contact preferences at any time by logging into your account and changing your settings related to your email notification choices. If you wish, you can also opt-out of receiving promotional emails by sending a request to FaceBookPen customer service through our customer service site.

Please be aware that you cannot opt-out of receiving service messages from LinkedIn. Also, if we send communications to you via the carrier service with which you have a mobile communications subscription or otherwise have access, you understand you will pay any service fees associated with your receipt of messages on your mobile device (including text messaging charges).

  1. **C.     ****User Communications**



Many communications you initiate through FaceBookPen (e.g., an invitation sent to a non-User) will list your primary email address and name in the header of the message. Messages you initiate may also provide aggregate information about your network (for instance how many people are in your network), but will not list the people to whom you’re directly connected. Other communications that you initiate through the FaceBookPen website, like a request for an introduction, will list your name as the initiator but will not include your personal email address contact information. Your contact information will only be shared with another User if both of you have indicated that you would like to establish contact with each other.

  1. **D.     ****Customized Content**



We use information you provide to us (or to third parties with whom FaceBookPen offers combined services) to customize your experience on our website. For example, when you login to your account, we will display the names of new Users who have recently joined your network or recent status updates from your connections.

  1. **E.      ****Sharing Information with Third Parties**



FaceBookPen takes the privacy of our Users very seriously, and we do not sell, rent, or otherwise provide your personally identifiable information to third parties, except as described in this policy. We will also not share other personal information not published to your profile or generated through engagement with other FaceBookPen services (Groups, Answers, Company Pages, etc.) without your explicit consent or to carry out your instructions (for example, to process payment information) unless, disclosure is reasonably necessary in our opinion to: (1) comply with legal process, including, but not limited to, civil and criminal subpoenas, court orders or other compulsory disclosures; (2) enforce this Agreement; (3) respond to claims of a violation of the rights of third parties, whether or not the third party is a User, individual, or government agency; (4) respond to customer service inquiries; or (5) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of FaceBookPen, our Users or the public.

FaceBookPen offers a “public profile” feature that allows Users to publish portions of their FaceBookPen profile to the public internet. This public profile will be crawled by and displayed through search engines when someone searches for your name. You may opt-out of this feature by editing your account settings; however, FaceBookPen does not warrant how often third-party search engines will update their caches, which may contain old public profile information.

Content distributed through FaceBookPen’s sharing features and third party integrations may result in displaying some of your information outside of FaceBookPen. For example, when you post content to a FaceBookPen Career Group or Blog that is open for public discussion, your content, including your name as the contributor, may be displayed in search engine results. Or, if you have bound your FaceBookPen account to your Twitter account, you can easily share content into both FaceBookPen as well as to Twitter.

We may provide aggregated anonymous data about the usage of the Services to third parties for purposes that we deem, in our sole discretion, to be appropriate, including to prospective advertisers on FaceBookPen.

  1. **F.      ****Developers using FaceBookPen Platform Services**



We collaborate with and allow third parties to use FaceBookPen’s developer platform to offer services and functionality in conjunction with and outside of FaceBookPen. These third parties are either partners (“FaceBookPen Partners”) with whom we have negotiated an agreement to provide services (“Combined Services”), for example, InApps, or developers (“Platform Developers”) who have agreed to our developer terms in order to build applications (“Platform Applications”). Both the negotiated agreements and our API terms and conditions contain restrictions on access, storage and use of your information.

If you choose to use Combined Services or a Platform Application, you may be asked to confirm acceptance of the privacy policy and/or user agreement of the FaceBookPen Partner or Platform Developer, which have not necessarily been reviewed or approved by FaceBookPen. It is your choice whether or not to make use of Combined Services or Platform Applications and whether to proceed under any third party terms, and once you do, the third party's terms, and not this policy, will govern how they handle information you provide to them directly or through your FaceBookPen account.

Also, despite our agreements and technical steps taken to restrict access to and avoid possible misuse of information, we may not screen or audit all Combined Services or Platform Applications. We also cannot guarantee that any LinkedIn Partner or Platform Developer will abide by our agreement. You agree that your use of Combined Services or Platform Applications is on an “as is” basis and without any warranty.

If you use any Combined Service or Platform Application, the FaceBookPen Partner or Platform Developer may access and share certain information about you, such as non-public profile information and information visible only to your connections. This includes information about your connections by virtue of you being connected to others. However, unless you have used a Combined Service or Platform Application, it can only access the information about you that is otherwise visible to other FaceBookPen Users.

To revoke permission granted to a Combined Service or Platform Application at any time, please visit the [settings](http://www.facebookpen.com/elgg/settings/) page. If the relevant Platform Developer or Application, or FaceBookPen Partner is not listed under Authorized Applications, go directly to the Application Details page for the Platform Application you wish to uninstall. Note, however, that even if you revoke the permission granted a third party, your connections, other members of your network, or other Users of FaceBookPen may still be using the Platform Application, so the Platform Application or Combined Service may still have access to certain information about you, just as those Users do. You may opt-out of providing information to third parties through others connected to you by accessing the “ **Turn on/off data sharing with third-party applications** ” control in the “Groups, Companies, and Applications” tab under [settings](http://www.facebookpen.com/elgg/settings/). To report any suspected misuse of information, contact FaceBookPen’s customer service. FaceBookPen is not responsible for your use of or inability to use any Combined Service or Platform Application, including the content, accuracy, or reliability of applications and the privacy practices or other policies of FaceBookPen Partners or Platform Developers.

  1. **G.     ****Polls and Surveys**



Polls and Surveys may be conducted by FaceBookPen, FBP Users or third parties. As a User, you may be invited to participate in polls and surveys from the FaceBookPen website. Your selection may be random, or it may be based on your non-personally identifiable information, such as job title, geography, company size and/or industry. Whether or not you decide to participate in a poll or survey is completely up to you.

After you complete a poll, you will be given access to the aggregate responses of the poll on a results page. Some third parties may target advertisements to you on the results page based on your answers in the poll. Further, FaceBookPen or third parties may follow up with you via InMail regarding your participation unless you have opted out of receiving InMail messages.

We may use third parties to deliver incentives to you to participate in surveys or polls. If the delivery of incentives requires your contact information, you may be asked to provide personally identifiable information to the third party fulfilling the incentive offer, which will only be used for the purpose of delivering incentives and/or verifying your contact information. It is up to you whether you provide this information, or whether you desire to take advantage of an incentive.

We will not disclose any personally identifiable information to any third parties in connection with the conduct of any polls or surveys. Your consent to use any personally identifiable information for the purposes set forth in the poll or survey will be explicitly requested by the party conducting it. FaceBookPen is a member of the Council of American Survey Research Organizations (“CASRO”) and abides by CASRO guidelines for market research. You may opt-out of participating in Surveys by changing your settings to stop receiving these inquiries and requests.

  1. **H.     ****Search**



We offer search services to help find information and learn more about other Users (for example, you can search for Users with particular career expertise or consulting experience, or that you may know from your industry or profession), as well as employment opportunities. FaceBookPen search also allows Users to find jobs, feature in, industries, and contributions to the community aspects of the FaceBookPen Services, such as Groups and Answers that will help Users more effectively use FaceBookPen and expand their network. We use information from User profiles and contributions to Groups, Company Pages, and Answers to inform and refine our search service.

  1. **I.        ****Answers, Careers Groups, Industries and other Services**



If you post on the Answers section of FaceBookPen participate in FaceBookPen Career Groups, or import a blog, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you choose to provide there can be read, collected, or used by other Users of these forums, as well as Platform Developers and other third parties, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. FaceBookPen is not responsible for the information you choose to submit in these forums. Also, some content in FaceBookPen Career Groups may be public and searchable on the internet if the Group owner has opened the group for public discussions. You can delete your posts to Answers and FaceBookPen Career Groups at any time. However, please note that ideas you post and information you share may be seen and used by other Users, and FaceBookPen cannot guarantee that other Users have not made copies of or use the ideas and information that you share with others on FaceBookPen.

  1. **J.       ****Testimonials and Advertisements Placed through FaceBookPen Ads Service**



If you provide any testimonials about the FaceBookPen Services or place advertisements through the FacebookPen Ads, we may post those testimonials and examples of advertisements you place in connection with our promotion of these services to third parties. Testimonials and advertisements may include your name and other personal information that you have provided. For more information about FaceBookPen Ads please see the [FaceBookPen Ads Terms of Use](http://www.facebookpen.com/elgg/terms/).

  1. **K.     ****Advertising and Endorsements on FaceBookPen**



In order to deliver relevant and valuable ads to you and your network, FaceBookPen may use your name and profile photo in connection with social advertising based on content shared on FaceBookPen. This advertising may include the fact that you have recommended or endorsed a product or service on FaceBookPen, followed an industry,a company, joined Career Groups or conversations, established or added content to your profile, etc., and will only be displayed to your FaceBookPen network. You can opt-out of allowing your name and/or profile photo to be used in social ads.

  1. **L.      ****Compliance with Legal Process**



It is possible that we may need to disclose personal information, profile information and/or information about your activities as a FaceBookPen User when required by subpoena or other legal process, or if FaceBookPen has a good faith belief that disclosure is necessary to (a) investigate, prevent or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities or to assist government enforcement agencies; (b) to enforce the User Agreement, to investigate and defend ourselves against any third party claims or allegations, or to protect the security or integrity of our site; and/or (c) to exercise or protect the rights, property or personal safety of FacebookPen, our Users, employees, or others.

  1. **M.    ****Disclosures to Others as the Result of a Change in Control or Sale of FaceBookPen**



We may also disclose your personal information and other information you provide to another third party as part of a sale of the assets of FaceBookPen, a subsidiary or division, or as the result of a change in control of the company. Any third party to which Bigyas, Inc. transfers or sells FaceBookPen’s assets will have the right to continue to use the personal and other information that you provide to us.

  1. **3.      ****Your Information Choices**
    1.  **A.     ****Accessing and Changing Your Account Information**



You can review the personal information you provided to us and make any desired changes to the information you publish, or to the settings for your FaceBookPen account including your email and contact preferences, at any time by logging in to [your account](http://www.facebookpen.com/elgg/profile/) on the FaceBookPen website. Please be aware that even after your request for a change is processed, FaceBookPen may, for a time, retain residual information about you in its backup and/or archival copies of its database.

  1. **B.      ****Default Settings**



Because the mission of FaceBookPen is to connect CAREERS and the INDUSTRIES to enable diverse of careers meet the right industries in colaborative, linked, productive and successful, we have established what we believe to be reasonable default settings that we have found most professionals desire. Because Users may use and interact with FaceBookPen in a variety of ways, and because those uses may change over time, we designed our settings to provide our users granular control over the information they share. We encourage our Users to review their account settings and adjust them in accordance with their preferences.

FaceBookPen accounts are also defaulted to allow Users to be contacted to participate in polls, surveys and partner advertising.

**Closing Your Account**

You can close your account through the FaceBookPen customer service site. If you close your FaceBookPen account, we will remove your name and other personally identifiable information from our publicly viewable database. If you close your account, we have no obligation to retain your information, and may delete any or all of your account information without liability. However, we may retain certain data contributed by you if FaceBookPen believes it may be necessary to prevent fraud or future abuse, or for legitimate business purposes, such as analysis of aggregated, non-personally identifiable data, account recovery, or if required by law. FaceBookPen may also retain and use your information if necessary to provide the Services to other Users. For example, just as an email you may send to another person through an email service provider resides in that person’s inbox even after you delete it from your sent files or close your account, emails or InMails you send on FaceBookPen to other Users, as well as your contributions to FaceBookPen Answers, Blogs or Career Groups, may remain visible to others after you have closed your account. Similarly, other information you have shared with others, or that other Users have copied, may also remain visible. FaceBookPen disclaims any liability in relation to the deletion or retention (subject to the terms herein) of information or any obligation not to delete the information. FaceBookPen does not control when search engines update their cache, which may contain certain public profile information that has since been removed from FaceBookPen’s publicly viewable database.

  1. **C.     ****Memorializing Accounts**



If we learn that a User is deceased, we may memorialize the User’s account. In these cases we may restrict profile access, remove messaging functionality, and close an account if we receive a formal request from the User’s next of kin or other proper legal request to do so.

  1. **4.      ****Your Obligations**



As a User, you have certain obligations to other Users. Some of these obligations are imposed by applicable law and regulations, and others have become commonplace in user-friendly communities of like-minded members such as FaceBookPen:

In the event there are significant changes in the way we treat your personally identifiable information, or in the Privacy Policy document itself, we will display a notice on the FaceBookPen website or send you an email, so that you may review the changed terms prior to continuing to use the site. As always, if you object to any of the changes to our terms, and you no longer wish to use FaceBookPen, you may close your account. Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Policy applies to all information that FaceBookPen has about you and your account.

Using the FaceBookPen Services after a notice of changes has been sent to you or published on our site shall constitute consent to the changed terms or practices.

  1. **6.      ****Security**



In order to help secure your personal information, access to your data on FaceBookPen is password-protected, and sensitive data (such as credit card information) is protected by SSL encryption when it is exchanged between your web browser and the FaceBookPen website. To protect any data you store on our servers, FaceBookPen also regularly audits its system for possible vulnerabilities and attacks, and we use a tier-one secured-access data center. However, since the internet is not a 100% secure environment, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to FaceBookPen. There is no guarantee that information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. It is your responsibility to protect the security of your login information. Please note that emails, instant messaging, and similar means of communication with other Users of FaceBookPen are not encrypted, and we strongly advise you not to communicate any confidential information through these means.
