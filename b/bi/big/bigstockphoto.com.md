## Service Providers

Bigstock uses an outside credit card processing company to bill you for goods and services. This company is not permitted to retain, share, store or use personal information for any purpose beyond the scope of its services to Bigstock.

In order to reduce errors in Bigstock's database, authenticate users, and prevent abuse of Bigstock's services, Bigstock may on occasion supplement the personal information you submit to us with information from third-party sources. For example, Bigstock may supplement your Personal Information with address information provided by the U.S. Postal Service to qualify your information and prevent errors in Bigstock's database. As permissible, Bigstock may also supplement the information you provide with demographic and other information (such as age or interest in photography) stored in third-party databases in order to make it more likely that marketing communications Bigstock sends you will be of interest.

## Tracking Technologies

Bigstock may use web analytics software. Web analytics software records data such as your mouse clicks, mouse movements, scrolling activity, page views, average time spent on the Site, among other things. This data is used to analyze and optimize the Site. Bigstock never uses analytics software to record any personal information entered via this Site nor will the web analytics software track browsing habits across other web sites. You can choose to disable the use of such software as it pertains to your use of the Site by contacting Bigstock at [privacy@bigstock.com](mailto:privacy@bigstock.com).

Bigstock and partners of Bigstock may use cookies and action tags to keep track of your visits, preferences and profile information.

  * A cookie is a small, unique text file that a website can send to your computer when you visit a site. Bigstock may use session cookies, which terminate when a user closes his or her browser, and/or persistent cookies, which remain on the user's computer until manually deleted. Most web browsers can either alert you to the use of cookies or refuse to accept cookies entirely. If you do not want us to deploy cookies to your browser, you can set your browser to reject cookies or to notify you when a website tries to put a cookie on your computer. Rejecting cookies may affect your ability to use the Site.
  * An action tag is similar to a cookie. Action tags help us identify and track the performance of web pages on the Site, allowing us to measure the performance and quality of the Site and to manage Site content. In addition, Bigstock may use action tags in emails. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of marketing campaigns by showing, for example, how many emails have been opened.



Electronic tracking technologies are used to enhance your experience on the Site, including allowing you to remain logged in on the Site. Cookies and pixel tags may also be used to collect general usage and aggregated statistical information that does not identify you personally. However, Bigstock and partners of Bigstock may use cookies to store some of your preferences (including limited Personal Information) or to display relevant content based upon what you view on the Site.

## Your choices with respect to personal information

Bigstock recognizes and appreciates the importance of responsible and respectful use of the personal information collected on the Site. You may "opt out" of receiving Bigstock's promotional email updates, newsletters and/or partner emails by clicking on the unsubscribe link available near the bottom of any Bigstock marketing email.

Bigstock reserves the right to contact you when there are changes to the Terms Service, or for other service related announcements as applicable. For instance, if Bigstock's services are temporarily suspended for maintenance, Bigstock may send an email notifying users of same. Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature. If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option of deactivating your account.

## Protection of your personal information

The security of your personal information is important to us and Bigstock protects it several ways.

  * Access to the personal information on your User Account requires a password. You should use a password that is at least 8 characters long, and comprised of a combination of letters, numbers and symbols. Do not divulge your password to anyone. 
  * Your personal information resides on a password-protected, secure server. Only select Bigstock personnel and contractors who require access to do their job are given the password to the server. 
  * Bigstock encrypts your personal information during transmission to prevent unauthorized parties from viewing such information when it is transmitted to and from Bigstock. 
  * When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number) on registration or order forms, Bigstock encrypts that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).



Bigstock strives to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once Bigstock receives it. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. While Bigstock uses commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, Bigstock cannot guarantee its absolute security.

If you have any questions about security on the Site, you can send email to us on Bigstock's [Contact Us page](https://web.archive.org/contactus.html).
