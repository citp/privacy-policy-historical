    these provisions are referring respectively to International Spirit, LTD, a Netherlands company as
    applicable. Additionally, when the terms "The Site" or
    "Site" are used, these terms refer respectively to
    www.bigdoggie.net as applicable.
  </p>
  <p>
    2. <strong>You, the User:</strong>&nbsp; As the user of this Site, this
    policy will refer to the user as "you" or through any
    second-person pronouns, such as "yours," etc. Hereinafter, the

  </p>
  <p>
    3.  <strong>Potential Advertisers:</strong>&nbsp; Some individuals access
    the Site for the purpose of applying to become an Advertiser on the Site.
    These individuals are not considered "Users" as defined
    hereunder.
  </p>
  <p>
    B. This Privacy Policy describes how we use information received about you
    when you visit our Site or when you subscribe to, or otherwise use our
    online services. This Policy does not cover any information that we may
    receive from or about you through channels other than through the use of
    the Site.
  </p>
</blockquote>

<h2>II. Changes in this Privacy Statement.</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to
    this privacy statement, the home page, and other places we deem appropriate
    so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and
    under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
  </p>
  <p>
    We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so
    please review it frequently.  If we make material changes to this policy,
    we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home
    page.
  </p>
</blockquote>

<h2>III. Personal Information That We Collect.</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    A. <b>Personal information:</b> When you sign up on our site you provide us
    with your user name, email, zip code, and location. Once you register you
    can visit your
    <a href="/escorts/edit">profile</a>
    at any time to change personal information about yourself.
  </p>
  <p>
    B. <b>Content:</b> One of the primary reasons people use our site is to
    share content with others. Examples include when you leave a review,
    comment someone else's review, upload a picture, talk on the forums, or
    post classifieds ads.
  </p>
  <p>
    C. <b>Transactional Information:</b> We may retain the details of
    transactions or payments such as credit card number, and billing address
    you make on us. However, we will only keep your payment source account
    number with your consent. We may provide your personal information to
    companies that provide services to help us with our business activities
    such as shipping your order or offering customer service. These companies
    are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to
    provide these services to us.
  </p>
  <p>
    D. <b>Site activity information:</b> We keep track of the actions you take
    on the site, such as sending a message to someone, sending a file to
    someone. In some cases you are also taking an action when you provide
    information or content to us. For example, if you receive a sms message
    from us, in addition to storing the actual content you recieve, we might
    log the fact you process it.
  </p>
  <p>
    E. <b>Access Device and Browser Information:</b> When you access the site
    from a computer, mobile phone, or other device, we may collect information
    from that device about your browser type, location, and IP address, as well
    as the pages you visit.
  </p>
  <p>
    F. <b>Cookie Information:</b> We use "cookies" (small pieces of data we
    store for an extended period of time on your computer, mobile phone, or
    other device) to make the site easier to use, to make our advertising
    better, and to protect both you and the site. For example, we use them to
    store your login ID (but never your password) to make it easier for you to
    login whenever you come back to the site. We also use them to confirm that
    you are logged into the site, and to know when you are interacting with the
    site. You can remove or block cookies using the settings in your browser,
    but in some cases that may impact your ability to use the site. We do link
    the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable
    information you submit while on our site.
  </p>
  <p>
    G. <b>Customer Testimonials/Comments/Reviews:</b> We post customer
    testimonials/comments/reviews on our web site which may contain personally
    identifiable information.  We do obtain the customer's consent via email
    prior to posting the testimonial to post their name along with their
    testimonial.
  </p>
</blockquote>

<h2>IV. How We Use Your Information.</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    A. <b>To manage the service:</b> We use the information we collect to
    provide our services and features to you, to measure and improve those
    services and features, and to provide you with customer support. We use the
    information to prevent potentially illegal activities. We also use a
    variety of technological systems to detect and address anomalous activity
    and screen content to prevent abuse such as spam. These efforts may on
    occasion result in a temporary or permanent suspension or termination of
    some functions for some users.
  </p>
  <p>
    B. <b>contact you:</b> We may contact you with service-related
    announcements from time to time. You may opt out of all communications
    except essential updates on your
    <a href="/support/">account notifications page</a>.
    We may include content you see on the site in the emails we send to you.
  </p>
  <p>
    C. <b>To serve personalized advertising to you:</b> We don't share your
    information with advertisers without your consent. (An example of consent
    would be if you asked us to provide your shipping address to an advertiser
    to receive a free sample.) We allow advertisers to choose the
    characteristics of users who will see their advertisements and we may use
    any of the non-personally identifiable attributes we have collected
    (including information you may have decided not to show to other users,
    such as your ethnicity preference or other sensitive personal information
    or preferences) to select the appropriate audience for those
    advertisements. For example, we might use your interest in asian people to
    show you ads posted by asian providers, but we do not tell the provider who
    you are.  Even though we do not share your information with advertisers
    without your consent, when you click on or otherwise interact with an
    advertisement there is a possibility that the advertiser may place a cookie
    in your browser and note that it meets the criteria they selected.
  </p>
</blockquote>

<h2>V. Special Cases.</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    It is our policy not to use or share the passive information about Users in
    ways unrelated to those described in this Policy without also providing the
    User with an opportunity to opt out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated
    uses. However, we may disclose passively-collected information about Users,
    or information regarding your use of the Services or Web sites accessible
    through our Services, for any reason without notice if, in our sole
    discretion, we believe that it is reasonable to do so, including, but not
    limited to:
  </p>
  <p>
    1. To satisfy any laws, such as the Electronic Communications Privacy Act,
    regulations, or governmental, or legal requests for such information;
  </p>
  <p>
    2. To disclose information that is necessary to identify, contact, or bring
    legal action against someone who may be violating our Terms of Use and
    other policies and procedures;
  </p>
  <p>
    3. To operate our Services properly;
  </p>
  <p>
    4. To protect ourselves, our Users, and the general public. We specifically
    reserve the right to disclose any and all information to law enforcement in
    the event that a crime including, but not limited to, fraud-related
    offenses is committed, is suspected, or if we are compelled to do so by
    lawful criminal, civil, or administrative process, discovery requests,
    subpoenas, court orders, writs, or reasonable request of authorities or
    persons with the reasonable power to obtain such process; and ...
  </p>
  <p>
    5. To cooperate with law enforcement authorities, and other governmental,
    administrative or regulatory agencies about our end users to the extent
    required by applicable law. Examples of such cooperation include lawful
    criminal, civil, or administrative process, discovery requests, subpoenas,
    court orders, or writs. We do not intend to cooperate with private-party
    litigants and others seeking information unless compelled to do so through
    lawful court or administrative process, such as subpoenas, court orders, or
    writs.
  </p>
</blockquote>

<h2>VI. Transmittals from Us.</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    The Company does not presently intend to send promotional e-mails to Users,
    as there is no active collection of a User's email address.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you provide your information to us or use the Site, you will have
    created a commercial relationship with us. Even though the Site presently
    opts not to provide Users, as described above, with e-mail advertising
    materials, your use of the Site and its services constitutes your
    understanding and consent that even unsolicited commercial email sent from
    us or our affiliates is not SPAM as that term is defined under the
    law.
  </p>
</blockquote>

<h2>VII. Public Forums.</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    At the time of the institution of this Policy, the Site  offers a public
    forum for Users. The Company reserves the right to offer other services,
    such as blogging in the future.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you use a bulletin board, blog, or chat room on this Web site, you
    should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit
    there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and
    could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for
    the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these
    forums.
  </p>
</blockquote>

<h2>VIII.Our Commitment to Data Security.</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    We take measures, including data encryption, to protect the transmission of
    all sensitive end-user information. We make every effort to ensure the
    integrity and security of our network and systems. Nevertheless, we cannot
    guarantee that our security measures will prevent third-party
    'hackers' from illegally obtaining this information. We take all
    reasonable measures to prevent such breaches of security, but given the
    resourcefulness of cyber-criminals we are unable to guarantee that our
    security is 100% breach-proof. You assume the risk of such breaches to the
    extent that they occur despite our reasonable security measures.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>
      <span style="font-size: 14px">
        We do not provide User information to third parties. We will not sell,
        rent or provide any of your information to other entities such as
        advertisers, or other companies selling services similar to this
        Company's services.
      </span>
    </b>
  </p>
</blockquote>

<h2>IX. Refund Policy</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    <b>30-day Money Back Guarantee</b>
    If you are not completely satisfied with your account within 30 days of
    signing up for it, you will be given a full refund on your sign-up fee.
    Refunds will be issued to the credit card provided at the time of signup.
  </p>
  <p>
    If your account has been cancelled by us due to abuse of our services
    and/or a violation of our terms of service, the money back guarantee will
    no longer apply.
  </p>
  <p>
    Cancellation requests must be made by regular mail or by email using the
    original email address for the account holder, and including the password
    as verification.  Alternatively, you may request cancellation from within
    our contact area. Phone requests cannot be accepted for cancellations,
    since recorded requests must be kept for any possible future reference.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Monthly Billing</b>
    Monthly billing can be cancelled at any time prior to the next rebill date.
    Refunds will be offered upon notification within 3 business days of the
    rebill date. All other refunds are at our sole descretion.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>CHARGEBACKS</b>
    BigDoggie.net does not take chargebacks lightly. Any member who initiates a
    chargeback with their financial institution after agreeing to these legal
    terms of service, thus entering into a contract, and obtaining a
    BigDoggie.net account, will be subject to collections proceedings including
    the full amount plus the chargeback fee and any other damages incurred by
    their actions. Further, we will initiate legal proceedings against you for
    your violations of our terms of service contract, which may include the
    legal search and seizure of computer components in your home, business or
    institution as evidence in the legal proceedings.
  </p>
