PLEASE BE AWARE THAT BHP AND ALL ASSOCIATED SERVICES AND SYSTEMS ARE HOUSED ON SERVERS IN THE UNITED STATES. IF YOU ARE LOCATED OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, INFORMATION WE COLLECT (INCLUDING COOKIES) ARE PROCESSED AND STORED IN THE UNITED STATES, WHICH MAY NOT OFFER THE SAME LEVEL OF PRIVACY PROTECTION AS THE COUNTRY WHERE YOU RESIDE OR ARE A CITIZEN.

You should periodically review this Privacy Policy to ensure that you are familiar with the most current version. Your continued use of the Site after the Effective Date posted above will constitute your acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy.

**3\. OUR INFORMATION COLLECTION PRACTICES**

**3.1 Personally Identifiable Information**. When you visit the Site without creating an account, you can browse without submitting any personal information about yourself. If you create an account on the Site, we will collect personally identifiable information from you, such as your full name, user name, password, email address, educational institution affiliation, location, and grade level.

**3.2 Log Files**. Similar to other web sites, we will collect some information automatically and store it in log files. This collection may include, but is not limited to, your IP address, browser type and language, referring/exit pages and URLs, other browser history, platform type, number of clicks, landing pages, cookie information, the pages you requested and viewed, the amount of time spent on particular pages, and the date and time.

**3.3 Cookies**. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer and is used to record information about your activities on the Site and to "remember" you when you return to the Site. The use of cookies is common and many websites use them to provide useful features to visitors. Some cookies remain on your computer until you delete them. Others, like session ID cookies, expire when you close your browser. You may set your browser setting to attempt to reject cookies and you may still use the Site. See the section "Online Tracking and your Choices" below for more information on how the Site may respond to your browser settings.

**3.4 Pixels (aka web beacons/web bugs/java script)**. Pixels are tiny graphics with a unique identifier that are used to track the online movements and other information of web users. Unlike cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, pixels are small graphics that are about the size of the period at the end of the sentence that are embedded invisibly on web pages or in HTML-based emails.

**3.5. Third Party Analytics Providers**. We use third parties to help us operate and improve the Site. We may provide these third parties with information we collect and they may collect information from you about your use of the Site. If we provide information to third parties, it will, unless specifically noted otherwise in this Policy, be governed by this Policy and may only be used by those third parties to help us operate or improve our business or the Site and to provide services to us. We do not control information collected by third parties and are not responsible for their use of that information.

**4\. CHILDREN’S PRIVACY**

**4.1 General**. The School Course component of the Site is intended for users of all ages and we may collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13 ("child" or "children"). Any personally identifiable information collected from children is in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"). Below is a list of when we may collect personally identifiable information from children and how and when we will provide parental notice and seek parental consent in such cases. If we collect personally identifiable information from a child, we will only retain the information so long as reasonably necessary to fulfill a request, to allow the child to participate in an activity, to ensure the security of our services, or as required by law. If we discover that we have collected personally identifiable information from a child in a manner that is inconsistent with COPPA, we will either immediately seek parental consent or delete the information.

**4.2 Child Registration**. A child may register on the Site in order to take the course. During the registration process, we may ask the child to provide his or her birth date in order to verify age. If, during the registration process, we determine that a child is a child under the age of 13, we will ask for a parent or guardian email address (or otherwise obtain consent from a parent or guardian) before we collect any personally identifiable information from the child. Following verification, we may collect the child's name, email address, a user name, and password that they select.

**4.3 Teacher Consent**. If a child is using the course as part of a school-based activity, COPPA allows teachers or school administrators to provide consent for the collection of personally identifiable information from children.

**4.4 Child Work**. A child's personally identifiable information in connection with his or her work product may be shared with the child’s teachers and other education support staff. 

**4.5 Email Contact with a Child**. BHP may, from time to time, send email to a child's email address in order to respond to inquiries or for account administration purposes. Following any such use of a child's email address, BHP will immediately delete the child's personally identifiable information. 

**4.6 Parental Control**. At any time, a parent or guardian may request that we delete the personally identifiable information that has been collected in connection with their child. When a parent makes such a request, it may lead to the termination of the child's account. Parents or guardians may make such a request by contacting us at: [info@bighistoryproject.com](mailto:info@bighistoryproject.com). When requesting removal of a child's personally identifiable information or cancellation of a child's account, parents or guardians should include the following information: Account ID (email address). To protect a child's privacy, we will take reasonable steps to verify a parent or guardian's identity prior to deleting a child's information.

**5\. ONLINE TRACKING AND YOUR CHOICES**

As discussed above, because we track website usage information through the use of cookies, pixels and other tracking mechanisms, your selection of the "Do Not Track" option provided by your browser may not have any effect on our collection of cookie information. The only way to completely "opt out" of the collection of any information through cookies or other tracking technology is to actively manage the settings on your browser to delete and disable cookies and other tracking/recording tools. However, getting a "Do Not Track" signal to work as you might want is difficult. Using browsers as an example, not all tracking technologies can be controlled by browsers; unique aspects of your browser might be recognizable even if you disable a tracking technology; not all settings will necessarily last or be effective; even if a setting is effective for one purpose data still may be collected for another; and even if one website observes a "Do Not Track" signal, that website usually will not be able to control other websites.

**6\. INFORMATION SECURITY MEASURES**

Personally identifiable information collected by the Site is stored in operating environments that are not available to the public. While we have mechanisms in place to safeguard your personal information after we receive it, no transmission of data over the internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

**7\. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION**

**7.1 General**. We may use your personally identifiable information for the purpose of communicating with you about the Big History Project; to operate, manage, improve and conduct analysis relating to the Site; to provide you with information that we think may be of interest to you; to prevent fraud or abuse, to address technical and security issues and to otherwise protect users; and to improve our product and services offerings.

**7.2 Account-related Emails**. We may send you emails about your account. For example, when you register, you will receive a welcome email. If our Site is temporarily unavailable, we may also send you an email notice. If you do not wish to receive these emails, you have the option to cancel your account. 

**7.3 Non-Personally Identifiable Information**. We may use non-personally identifiable information for any lawful purpose, including but not limited to operation, management, improvement and analysis of the Site, and to improve our product and services offerings.

**7.4 Information Retention**. In general, we will retain your information indefinitely, or as long as legally required or allowed. If you cancel your account, we may, but are not obligated to, delete information we have collected or obtained from third parties and we may continue to use and disclose it in accordance with this Policy. We may dispose of any information we collect in our discretion without notice, subject to applicable law. 

**8\. OUR INFORMATION SHARING PRACTICES**

**8.1 General**. We will not sell or rent any of your personal information to third parties for marketing purposes. However, we may disclose your personal information to an affiliated person, to your teachers and other education support staff, and to our third party service providers that assist us in the operation, management, improvement and analysis of the Site and the creation of related product and services offerings. In some instances, these third parties may be colleges, universities or companies that help us review, grade or evaluate student submissions, review grader quality and consistency, or develop and improve other aspects of our products and services. Use of information by affiliated persons, teachers and third party service providers will be subject to this Privacy Policy or an agreement that is at least as restrictive as this Privacy Policy.

**8.2 Legal Requirements**. We reserve the right to disclose all information collected via the Site, internally or by third parties, for any lawful purpose or to prevent harm to us or others. For example and without limitation, in our discretion we may disclose information to government regulators, law enforcement authorities or alleged victims of identity theft.

**8.3 Insolvency and Business Transitions**. If we should ever file for bankruptcy or engage in a business transition such as a merger with another company or if we purchase, sell, or reorganize all or a part of our business or assets, we may disclose your personally identifiable information, including to prospective or actual purchasers in connection with one of these transactions.

**8.4 Disclaimer**. We cannot ensure that all of your personally identifiable information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Policy. For example, we may be required to disclose personal information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, or users may abuse or misuse your personal information that they collect from the Site. No transmission of data over the internet can be 100% secure.

**9\. LINKS**

The Site contains links to other sites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices, the terms and conditions of use, or any of the content of such websites. The linked sites may collect personally identifiable information from you that is not subject to our control. The data collection practices of linked sites will be governed by that site's privacy policy.

**10\. CALIFORNIA MINORS**

We may provide you the ability to post information on the Site. If you are a California resident who is under 18 and a registered user of the Site and you are unable to remove content or information you posted in a public area of the Site by following the instructions provided on the Site, you may request removal by using the contact information provided in the "Privacy Questions" section at the bottom of this Privacy Policy.
