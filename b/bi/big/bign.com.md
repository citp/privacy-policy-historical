**The Way We Use Information**

We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order only to complete that order. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order.

We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive or if we need to contact you regarding an order you've placed. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.

A Team National IMD who has an e-mail address on their personal Team National website also has a form on their contact page which you can fill out and submit to allow them to contact you. Your name, phone number and e-mail address is submitted only to the e-mail address of the IMD on whose page you completed the request form.

**Our Commitment To Children's Privacy** 

Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our web site from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our web site is structured to attract anyone under 13.
