<h3>BigBuckSurveys.com Privacy Policy</h3>

<p>BigBuckSurveys.com is committed to protecting your privacy in a manner that will allow you to use our services with confidence and comfort. The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to describe: 1) what information BigBuckSurveys.com collects; 2) how we use it; 3) your control over the information you give us and; 4) how we protect your information from theft or unauthorized use. This Privacy Policy is subject to change from time to time, so please check back periodically. Use of the services offered at this site constitutes acceptance of the terms of this Policy.
If you have a question about the Privacy Policy please send us an e-mail message at <a href="mailto:security@BigBuckSurveys.com">security@BigBuckSurveys.com</a> </p>
<p><b>The Information We Collect </b></p>
<p>Any information that you provide through the BigBuckSurveys.com registration process or responses to offers made available to you through our site is completely voluntary. You always have a choice whether or not to disclose information requested in the survey, registration or offer form or to remain opted-in as a BigBuckSurveys.com user. The information we collect includes contact and postal information (such as name, mailing address and telephone number), e-mail address and demographic information (such as age, interests and additional information). In addition, BigBuckSurveys.com may present questions regarding your health. Your participation in these questions is completely voluntary. Lastly, BigBuckSurveys.com does not collect credit card information or Social Security numbers. Please contact <a href="mailto:security@BigBuckSurveys.com">security@BigBuckSurveys.com</a> immediately should you receive a request for such information.</p> 
We also think that you should be rewarded for the time it takes to fill out our survey. That's why we provide incentives. In part, that's also why we cannot accept information from those under the age of 18 years. Those under 18 cannot participate in sweepstakes and promotions offered by BigBuckSurveys.com or the promotion sponsor. In addition, we do not knowingly collect, use or disseminate any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. If, however, we become aware that personally identifiable information regarding a child under the age of 13 has been collected, we will delete it from our records. We encourage parents and guardians to participate in and supervise the online activities of their children. <p></p>
<p><b>How We Use It </b></p>
<p>Your information will be used to improve and personalize the offers BigBuckSurveys.com sends to you and all our members. By providing your e-mail address to BigBuckSurveys.com, you are agreeing to receive periodic e-mail messages from BigBuckSurveys.com. BigBuckSurveys.com may send you e-mail messages regarding marketing offers from other reputable organizations whose products and services we think you might find interesting. Contact, postal, e-mail address and demographic information may be shared with third party marketers for marketing purposes. Similarly, your answers to health related questions may be used or shared to market or advertise products, goods or services to you. By completing health related questions on the survey, you are consenting to the use of this information for direct marketing purposes. In addition, BigBuckSurveys.com provides services for direct marketing applications including lookup and reference, data enhancement, suppression and validation. </p>
<p><b>The Controls You Have On The Information You Share </b></p>
<p>If you do not want us to share contact, postal, e-mail address and demographic information with third party marketers, we can add your name to our "do-not-share" list.

Unsubscription requests are processed within 72 hours but because of time lags due to scheduling, you may receive one or two additional e-mail messages that are already "in the pipeline."
