<p><em>This policy was last updated on July 16, 2014 </em></p>
<p><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong> <br>
This Privacy Policy describes how IBT Media Inc. and its affiliated United States subsidiaries (collectively, &quot;Company,&quot; &quot;us&quot; or &quot;we&quot;) may collect and use your personally identifiable information (&quot;PII&quot;) (e.g., your full name, email address, mailing address, telephone number, or  credit card number), as well as data that can, under certain circumstances, indirectly lead to PII (&quot;Related Data&quot;) on its Web sites and other applications.</p>
<p>This Policy applies to PII and Related Data (collectively, your &quot;information&quot;) received by us from consumers when you visit, register or subscribe to the online editions of IBT Media Inc (bizu.tv) and related services or sites that link to this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>From time to time Company may revise this Privacy Policy. If we make revisions that change the way we collect or use your PII or Related Data, those changes will be posted in this Privacy Policy and the effective date will be noted at the beginning of the Policy. Therefore, you should review it periodically so that you are up to date on our most current policies and practices. If we make material changes to our practices regarding use of your PII or Related Data, your PII and Related Data will continue to be governed by the Privacy Policy under which it was subject prior to those changes, unless you have been provided notice of, and have not objected to, the changes. Notice of a significant or material change in the way we use your personal information will be made to registered users via e-mail.</p>
<p><strong>INFORMATION THAT WE COLLECT:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Generally:</strong> When you subscribe to our products or services, we collect PII and Related Information from you. We also may collect PII and Related Information from you when you contact us about your subscriptions or participate in activities like: our resume database; job searches; forums; message boards; chats; submitting a letter to the editor; forwarding an article to a friend; creating a community profile; rating, tagging and commenting on articles; or surveys, sweepstakes, contests, or games. When you visit our web sites, we automatically collect non PII such as IP addresses and web site usage information from you.</p>
<p>In compliance with COPPA, we do not, however, knowingly collect or store PII from children under the age of thirteen.</p>
<p>Sometimes we collect personally identifiable information from consumers in manual format or off-line, for example via a post card or subscription form. Providing detailed notice in those situations often proves impractical, so consumers will instead be provided with a short notice that describes how to obtain the full text of this Policy and other relevant information from us.</p>
<p>When you provide PII to us, we will make sure you are informed about the types of uses we will make of the information to the extent it is being used in a manner that differs from what is allowed pursuant to this Privacy Policy. We'll collect only as much personal information as we need for specific, identified purposes, and we won't use it for other purposes without obtaining your consent.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies, Web Beacons, And Other Similar Technologies:</strong> Cookies are small bits of information that our web sites place on the hard drive of your computer. We use cookies to, among other things, facilitate our login processes; allow you to personalize and store your settings; collect usage information; determine our total audience size and traffic; and help us improve our sites by measuring which areas are of greatest interest to users. No personally identifiable information is placed in these cookies. The cookies may reflect de-identified demographic or other data linked to data you voluntarily have submitted to us, e.g., your email address, in hashed, non-human readable form.</p>
<p>Third party advertisements displayed on our sites may also contain cookies set by Internet advertising companies or advertisers. We do not control these cookies and visitors to our web sites should check the privacy policy of the advertiser to see whether and how it uses cookies. (See the &quot;Notice&quot; section below for more information on third party advertisements).</p>
<p>You can set the browser on your computer to warn you each time a cookie is being sent, block third party cookies or block all cookies. However, by blocking all cookies you may not have access to certain features on our web sites. We also use web beacons (invisible images often referred to as pixel tags or clear GIFs) on our sites in order to recognize users and assess traffic patterns, and we include web beacons and cookies in our e-mail messages, including newsletters, in order to count how many e-mail messages have been opened. Users wishing to disable our web beacons should do so by turning images &quot;off&quot; in their email client (e.g., Outlook, Outlook Express). Please see your email client for more information.</p>
<p>When you view an ad for our publications on other sites, our third-party advertising company may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. We and our advertising company may also use web beacons (invisible images often referred to as pixel tags or clear GIFs) to note which pages you visit after viewing our ads. The information that is collected through the use of these images is not personally identifiable and is used only to track response to our advertising efforts.</p>
<p>We may use cookies and similar tools to relate your use of our web sites to PII obtained from you or a reputable third party. For example, if you've asked us to send you information about our upcoming products or promotions, cookie and/or click stream data about your activities on our web sites may allow us to limit the materials we send you to items we think you will find interesting, based on your prior online activities and preferences. However, if we wish to combine your personal and cookie or click stream information in this manner, we will obtain your express affirmative consent.</p>
<p><strong>Third Party Ad Servers:</strong> Some of the advertisements and other services that appear on our web site(s) are delivered to you by Internet advertising companies.

  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><em>This policy was last updated on July 16, 2014 </em></p>
<p><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong> <br>
This Privacy Policy describes how IBT Media Inc. and its affiliated United States subsidiaries (collectively, "Company," "us" or "we") may collect and use your personally identifiable information ("PII") (e.g., your full name, email address, mailing address, telephone number, or  credit card number), as well as data that can, under certain circumstances, indirectly lead to PII ("Related Data") on its Web sites and other applications.</p>
<p>This Policy applies to PII and Related Data (collectively, your "information") received by us from consumers when you visit, register or subscribe to the online editions of IBT Media Inc (bizu.tv) and related services or sites that link to this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>From time to time Company may revise this Privacy Policy. If we make revisions that change the way we collect or use your PII or Related Data, those changes will be posted in this Privacy Policy and the effective date will be noted at the beginning of the Policy. Therefore, you should review it periodically so that you are up to date on our most current policies and practices. If we make material changes to our practices regarding use of your PII or Related Data, your PII and Related Data will continue to be governed by the Privacy Policy under which it was subject prior to those changes, unless you have been provided notice of, and have not objected to, the changes. Notice of a significant or material change in the way we use your personal information will be made to registered users via e-mail.</p>
<p><strong>INFORMATION THAT WE COLLECT:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Generally:</strong> When you subscribe to our products or services, we collect PII and Related Information from you. We also may collect PII and Related Information from you when you contact us about your subscriptions or participate in activities like: our resume database; job searches; forums; message boards; chats; submitting a letter to the editor; forwarding an article to a friend; creating a community profile; rating, tagging and commenting on articles; or surveys, sweepstakes, contests, or games. When you visit our web sites, we automatically collect non PII such as IP addresses and web site usage information from you.</p>
<p>In compliance with COPPA, we do not, however, knowingly collect or store PII from children under the age of thirteen.</p>
<p>Sometimes we collect personally identifiable information from consumers in manual format or off-line, for example via a post card or subscription form. Providing detailed notice in those situations often proves impractical, so consumers will instead be provided with a short notice that describes how to obtain the full text of this Policy and other relevant information from us.</p>
<p>When you provide PII to us, we will make sure you are informed about the types of uses we will make of the information to the extent it is being used in a manner that differs from what is allowed pursuant to this Privacy Policy. We'll collect only as much personal information as we need for specific, identified purposes, and we won't use it for other purposes without obtaining your consent.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies, Web Beacons, And Other Similar Technologies:</strong> Cookies are small bits of information that our web sites place on the hard drive of your computer. We use cookies to, among other things, facilitate our login processes; allow you to personalize and store your settings; collect usage information; determine our total audience size and traffic; and help us improve our sites by measuring which areas are of greatest interest to users. No personally identifiable information is placed in these cookies. The cookies may reflect de-identified demographic or other data linked to data you voluntarily have submitted to us, e.g., your email address, in hashed, non-human readable form.</p>
<p>Third party advertisements displayed on our sites may also contain cookies set by Internet advertising companies or advertisers. We do not control these cookies and visitors to our web sites should check the privacy policy of the advertiser to see whether and how it uses cookies. (See the "Notice" section below for more information on third party advertisements).</p>
<p>You can set the browser on your computer to warn you each time a cookie is being sent, block third party cookies or block all cookies. However, by blocking all cookies you may not have access to certain features on our web sites. We also use web beacons (invisible images often referred to as pixel tags or clear GIFs) on our sites in order to recognize users and assess traffic patterns, and we include web beacons and cookies in our e-mail messages, including newsletters, in order to count how many e-mail messages have been opened. Users wishing to disable our web beacons should do so by turning images "off" in their email client (e.g., Outlook, Outlook Express). Please see your email client for more information.</p>
<p>When you view an ad for our publications on other sites, our third-party advertising company may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. We and our advertising company may also use web beacons (invisible images often referred to as pixel tags or clear GIFs) to note which pages you visit after viewing our ads. The information that is collected through the use of these images is not personally identifiable and is used only to track response to our advertising efforts.</p>
<p>We may use cookies and similar tools to relate your use of our web sites to PII obtained from you or a reputable third party. For example, if you've asked us to send you information about our upcoming products or promotions, cookie and/or click stream data about your activities on our web sites may allow us to limit the materials we send you to items we think you will find interesting, based on your prior online activities and preferences. However, if we wish to combine your personal and cookie or click stream information in this manner, we will obtain your express affirmative consent.</p>
