Bizpinion gathers your personal and professional information upon registering to become part of our Research Community including, but not limited to, your demographics and career information. After registering we may ask panel members to provide us with additional personal information in order to invite them to appropriate surveys. We require your email address in order that we can send you email invitations to participate in our upcoming surveys. The additional information we gather, such as your address, gender, birthday, and employment status, is used to match you with the appropriate market research projects. We only use your information in order to send you opportunities to participate in market research.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><br></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Bizpinion encourages panel members to supply demographic information including, but not limited to: gender, birth date, income level, position of employment, industry employed, decision making authority and responsibilities and medical conditions and keep that information current as it will be used to pre-qualify panel members for survey opportunities and for topics that would be of interest to them. Occasionally we ask panel members and survey participants for additional information related to their interests, hobbies and product usage. Such information facilitates our ability to send surveys corresponding with their area of interest and expertise.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><br></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Bizpinion believes you should be in control of your personal information.

<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><br></strong></span></p>
