These documents are protected by Biz2Credit's [web security system](http://www.biz2credit.com/terms-of-use.html#websecuritysystem) and only the user has password-protected access. No third party has access to these documents, and Biz2Credit will only access content stored in DocVault for site maintenance and technical support purposes.

Biz2Credit does not share any of your personal information with any third parties except as expressly provided below. (See, "[WITH WHOM WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION](http://www.biz2credit.com/privacy-policy.html#PERSONALINFORMATION)", below).We share information with companies like D&B and Equifax, lenders or credit agencies only with prior written authorization of our customers to forward such business credit reports, credit monitoring updates or other customer credit or personal information to third parties.

**WHO WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION WITH**

_**In General.**_ We do not share any information about you with others except as indicated below. During registration, virtually all the information you share with us is publically available business information, plus phone and email contact information. Your registration information, including contact information, is never shared with any third party unless you select one of our partner links. If you select a partner link, you are informed a partner representative will contact you and that your basic business and contact information will be shared with that partner unless you opt out within the stated period of time. We will not at any time transfer your personal information to any third party unless you first select a third party service and then do not opt out of [sharing this information](http://www.biz2credit.com/privacy-policy.html#information-sharing). We may share your registration and other types of information with: 

  * _Prospective lender and other financial institutions._ If you submit a completed Biz2Credit Get a Loan Qualification Form, once you confirm your agreement with the Terms, we will share your information with lenders and other financial institutions on the Biz2Credit network with whom you are or may be matched. However, no credit check will be performed by Biz2Credit unless you expressly authorize us to do so when you submit a completed loan qualification form. The identities of the lenders with whom you are matched, and with whom Biz2Credit has shared your information, will in each case be disclosed to you. Biz2Credit will not share information with any prospective lender not disclosed to you. These lenders or other financial institutions on the Biz2Credit network may retain or use your information whether or not you qualify for, or obtain, a loan from them, subject to the requirement that this information is used only for loan application and [process](http://www.biz2credit.com/privacy-policy.html#process)
  * _Authorized service providers:_ Once you submit a completed Biz2Credit Get a Loan Qualification Form, we may also share your information with authorized service providers that perform certain services on our behalf. These service providers include credit bureaus, title companies, insurance providers, attorneys, appraisal companies, escrow companies, closing agents and other financial institutions. Authorized service providers may also include marketing and customer services firms and credit card payment processors. These service providers may have access to information as needed to perform their functions, but are not in any case permitted to share, disclose, sell or use such information for any other purpose.
  * _Biz2Credit Partners and Affiliates._ When you express interest in promotions or third party services, offered on our website, we may share your expression of interest with the partner or affiliate you have selected to offer you those products, services, and/or promotions. When you elect to engage in a particular offer or program, you authorize us to provide your email address and other business and contact information to that business, and in certain cases noted above, other sensitive personal information to our Partners and/or Affiliates sponsoring the products, [services and/or promotions](http://www.biz2credit.com/privacy-policy.html#Affiliates). As provided above, you always have the right to opt out or unsubscribe from any transfer of your personal information to third parties or otherwise in connection with partner or affiliate offerings or [promotional uses](http://www.biz2credit.com/privacy-policy.html#General).
  * _Biz2Credit.com users._ Your User ID may be displayed throughout Biz2Credit and is therefore available to the public. All of your activity on our website is traceable to your User ID. Other people can see your feedback, businesses, products, classified ads or services that you have posted in the Community. However, no other registration or other information is displayed on the site unless you choose to post it yourself. We send notices to members regarding suspicious activity and policy violations on our sites and refer to User IDs and specific items.



_**Aggregated, non-personal information.**_ We may also share aggregated information (i.e., information about you and other customers collectively, but not specifically identifiable to you) and other non-personally identifiable information we collect from registration, applications or other use of our website or services in order to develop and/or deliver targeted advertising on our website and on website of third parties. We may also combine non-personally identifiable information we collect with additional non-personally identifiable information collected from other sources. In addition, we may share aggregated information with third parties, including advisors, advertisers and investors, for the purpose of conducting general business analysis and developing site metrics. For example, we may tell our advertisers the number of visitors to our website and the most popular features or services accessed or use such aggregated, non-personal information to develop website content and services that we hope you and other users will find of interest and to target content and advertising. 

_**Third-party websites.**_ There are a number of places on our website where you may click on a link to access other websites, each of which operates under its own Policy and not Biz2Credit's Policy. For example, if you click on an advertisement or a search result on our website, you may be taken to a website that we do not control. These third-party websites may independently solicit and collect information, including personal and business information, from you and, in some instances, provide us with information about your activities on those websites. While Biz2Credit will only directly transfer data to other websites that have adequate data protection and [privacy policies](http://www.biz2credit.com/privacy-policy.html#privacypolicies), Biz2Credit can not control such uses or use by companies whose links you click on. We therefore recommend that you consult the privacy statements of all third-party websites you visit by clicking on the "privacy" link typically located at the bottom of the webpage you are visiting.

_**Other circumstances.**_ We also may disclose your information:

  * In response to a subpoena or similar investigative demand, a court order, or a request for cooperation from a law enforcement or other government agency;
  * to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law; 
  * when we believe disclosure is appropriate in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing; 
  * to protect and defend the rights, property or safety of our Biz2Credit, our users, our employees, or others;
  * to comply with applicable law or cooperate with law enforcement; or to enforce our website terms and conditions or other agreements or policies.
  * In connection with a substantial corporate transaction, such as the sale of our business, a divestiture, merger, consolidation or asset sale. In this event, you will be afforded the opportunity to opt out of any further promotional or other communications.



_**Third-party use of your information.**_ Biz2Credit seeks to ensure that all third parties to whom we transfer data maintain appropriate data protection protocols and privacy policies. Accordingly, Biz2Credit contractually requires its vendors and affiliates to maintain appropriate security and privacy policies, and we will not transfer personal information to any entity whose policy would permit the sale or other redistribution of personal information for any reason other than the purpose for which we provided the information to the third party. However, Biz2Credit does not control the actual use of transferred data by such third parties, which are governed by their internal policies and procedures. These entities or their servers may be located either inside or outside the United States, in which case they may be governed by different privacy laws or policies.

_**By disclosing your information to Biz2Credit through registration, the selection of services offered by Biz2Credit partners, affiliates and other third parties, the loan application process or otherwise on our website, you expressly consent to any transfer of your information as described above and in this Policy.**_

**HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION**

_**In General.**_ We are committed to protect the security and integrity of all information you share with us. We have therefore implemented a number of industry-standard security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to help safeguard your information from unauthorized access and disclosure. Only authorized employees and authorized third-party service providers are permitted to access personal information, and they may do so only for specified and limited business functions. In addition, we use encryption in the transmission of certain sensitive information between your system and ours, and we use firewalls to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your information. We want you to feel confident using our website for business transactions. However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, searches, or other communications will always remain secure in all cases. 

_**DocVault.**_ Biz2Credit's Doc Vault system allows only authorized users to upload documents. Biz2Credit does not allow any documents to be edited while in Doc Vault and maintains a log of every document uploaded, tagged and shared. DocVault's history feature also tracks every document which is shared by time and date and also time stamps when the link is clicked and [document downloaded](http://www.biz2credit.com/terms-of-use.html#documentdownloaded).

_**Other Business Tools.**_ Biz2Credit's other proprietary Business Tools, such as BizAnalyzer, Financial Calculator and BizConnect, also allow only authorized users to [access information](http://www.biz2credit.com/terms-of-use.html#accessinformation). Information input into BizConnect will only be shared with prospective lenders with your express consent. 

_**Account security.**_ We have also implemented the following additional features to help strengthen the security of your user account:- 

  * _Session Timeout._ A session timeout has been implemented so that the maximum specified period of user inactivity does not exceed 25 minutes.
  * _Temporary Account Lockout._ Access is locked for 30 minutes if three or more consecutive unsuccessful login attempts are made, regardless of session or time frame. User may not log back in, re-authenticate online, create a new account, order products, view products or use login help when the account is locked out. However, the user can contact the call center/help desk to activate account when the account is locked. 
  * _Long Term Account Lockout._ Access to accounts will be locked indefinitely (until manually unlocked by a Call Center/Help Desk Agent) if the user attempts to use login help unsuccessfully three or more times, regardless of session or time frame. User may not login, create a new account, re-authenticate online, order products, view products or use login help when the account is locked out. As above, the user can contact the Call Center/Help Desk to activate account when account is locked out.



For a more detailed description of these security measures, please refer to our Terms of Use, "[Security Measures](http://www.biz2credit.com/terms-of-use.html#websecuritysystem)".
