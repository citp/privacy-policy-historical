    below are in effect for the BizwareMagic website and newsletters or ezines.

    BizwareMagic only collects information (first name, email and IP address/signup 
    time) for its newsletters and is not used for any other purposes. Removal from 
    these newsletters can be done from the removal links placed in each and all emails.
