After registering we may ask members to provide us with additional personal information in order to invite them to appropriate opportunities. We require your email address in order that we can send you email invitations to participate in our upcoming research opportunities. The additional information we gather, such as your address, gender, birthday, and employment status, is used to match you with the appropriate market research projects.

EOL will commit the surviving entity in the case of a merger, or the acquiring entity in the case of an acquisition or sale, to agree in writing to protect and maintain the security and integrity of the transferred Personal Information in accordance with any applicable laws. Any entity receiving such information in connection with any of these transactions must comply with all the terms of this Privacy Policy, unless advanced notice has been provided to EOL members.

Choice/Opt-Out

Participation in our research communities and all survey invitations are always voluntary. A member can always willingly not participate in a particular opportunity or terminate their membership. If a panel member desires to end his or her membership with EOL, such panel member may terminate their membership by (a) following the instructions set forth in their membership account, (b) sending an email request to [contact@bizpinion.com](mailto:contact@empanelonline.com) from the email address associated with their membership, or (c) selecting the opt-out link contained in each email invitation sent to members of our research communities and following the applicable steps.  Regardless of the method used, opting out deactivates the member’s account and terminates their membership (including all redemption reward points earned). EOL will then deactivate the applicable membership account and the individual will not receive any further opportunities.

Do Not Track

Some browsers have a “do not track” feature that lets you tell websites you do not want to have your online activities tracked. Because these features are not yet uniform, we do not presently respond to “do not track” signals.

To opt-out of business-related email campaigns, (a) send an email request to [contact@bizpinion.com](mailto:contact@empanelonline.com) from the associated email address or (b) selecting the opt-out link contained in each email and following the subsequent steps.
