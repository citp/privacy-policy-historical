To achieve that goal, we want you to understand the information we gather from and about you, how this information is used, shared and safeguarded, and how you can control its use.

 **INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM YOU ONLINE**

**Automatic Collection of Information:** Like many Websites on the Internet, as you visit and use our Services we automatically track certain information about you to help us (1) better understand, improve and modify the Services, (2) better understand how the Services and our websites are used and experienced, and (3) better understand how we can enhance your overall experience on one or more of our Websites and/or Services, including providing advertising and other information that is relevant to you. This tracked or automatically gathered information may include, among other things, your computer’s IP address (Internet Protocol address), browser type, the URLs and pages on the Services you’ve visited, sections of or content on the Websites and/or Services of which you click on or are interested in, the number of times you visit each page on the Services, what downloads and/or search queries you have made, and how long you spent on particular sections of the Services and on the Services generally. This automatically gathered data includes information provided through the use of “cookies”, log files and “clear GIFs” (described in more detail below).

 **Information from Cookies:** When you visit our website(s), we may send a small file to your computer (a “cookie”) which is stored there so that we can recognize your computer as a unique machine the next time you visit PALNESS websites, and which also enables us to, among other things, tailor the Services to your needs. You are always free to decline any cookies we use if your internet browser permits.

However, please note that by declining cookies, certain functionality of our websites may not be available to you. Additionally, some of our third-party service providers working on our behalf may also utilize their own cookies. Also, we and our third-party service providers sometimes use “clear GIFs” in connection with cookies and other website functions and emails. Clear GIFs perform administrative functions (but without detracting from your online experience), including being used to perform statistical and administrative tasks such as measuring traffic on our Websites and Services pages, verifying advertising avenues and positioning images on the web, and allowing us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and email marketing campaigns by letting us know which marketing emails have been opened by you or other recipients. However, please note that clear GIFs do not collect Personal Information.

As mentioned above, we do partner with third party ad network(s) such as Google Adsense/Adwords to either display advertising on our Services or to manage our advertising on other Websites. Our ad network partner may use cookies and/or Web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on our Services and other Websites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests.

 **HOW YOUR INFORMATION IS USED**

 **Personal Information:** We do not share, sell, or buy personal information. We may share the Personal Information we collect from you only with your consent. The information you submit is used only for internal purposes and to provide quality customer service to you as well as to send you our latest updates.

 **Protection of rights:** We may release Personal Information or other information we collect from you if we believe that such action is appropriate to: (I) comply with legal requests and processes; (II) identify, contact or bring legal action against persons or entities who are or we believe have caused or might cause injury to us or a third party; (III) defend or respond to claims brought or threatened against PALNESS MEDIA, its employees, direct sellers, suppliers, service providers, installers, users of our Services or others; or (IV) otherwise protect or assert the rights, property, interests or personal safety of PALNESS, its employees, direct sellers, suppliers, service providers, installers, users of the Services or others. Any such release decisions may be made by us in our sole discretion.

 **Record Keeping:** It may be necessary for PALNESS MEDIA to keep records of certain Personal Information you have provided to us or which we have obtained from you in accordance with this Privacy Policy for business purposes.

 **Non-personal Information:** Information that is automatically gathered, including through the use of cookies (as defined above), may be shared among our Websites, if applicable.
