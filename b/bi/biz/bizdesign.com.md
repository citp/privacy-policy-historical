Some of this information - such as the customer's name, address, telephone number, and credit card data - is provided to BizSecure by its customers in order to establish service. Other information - such as the customer's account status, choice of services, and customer logs - is created and maintained by BizSecure in the normal course of providing service.

This Privacy Policy applies only to BizSecure's treatment of data collected online, and does not apply to any offline data collection practices or to the data collection practices of any third parties, BizSecure customers, or any entities affiliated with BizSecure. Also, please note that use of BizSecure's website constitutes acceptance of this Privacy Policy.

**Data Security**

BizSecure protects the confidentiality of its customers' information, account information and personal communications. To secure the information collected online, prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy and ensure only appropriate use of information that is collected from customers, BizSecure has implemented appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures, for information stored online and offline. Further, BizSecure requires that employees who have access keep customer information confidential.

When customers submit sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - (Secure Sockets Layer). While on a secure page, such as the BizSecure Hosting order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when customers are just 'surfing'.

BizSecure uses a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure once received. For example, BizSecure stores personal information provided by customers on computer systems with limited access, that are located in secured manned facilities. BizSecure's employees are trained and kept up-to-date on our security procedures. If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email to [security@bizsecure.com](mailto:security@bizsecure.co).

BizSecure cautions its customers and website visitors that no medium of communication, including the Internet, is entirely secure.
