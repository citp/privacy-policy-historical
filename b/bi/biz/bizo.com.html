				<h2>Bizo, Inc. Privacy Policy as of December 1, 2009</h2>
				<p>Bizo, Inc. ("Bizo") is a provider of business targeting technologies and services to online marketers and websites and considers the protection of your privacy and full disclosure of the use of your information to be of utmost importance. We operate services relating to the Bizographic Targeting Network (BTN), an online advertising network for business marketers and websites. This Privacy Policy has been created to describe and disclose how we use and collect user data in providing these services. If in reading this document, you have any questions, or become hopelessly bored and are unable to continue, please feel free to contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@bizo.com">privacy@bizo.com</a> or at the address listed below.</p>
				<h2>The Tenets of our Business</h2>
				<p>Since we operate a business that utilizes information about people, we are sensitive to the requirements of trust and responsibility that this carries. We have developed the following tenets that are shared with all of our employees, partners and users that pervade our business and privacy policies from top to bottom:</p>
				<ul class="benefits">
					<li>Be honest</li>
					<li>Be open</li>
					<li>Be trustworthy</li>
					<li>Be fun</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Of course, we're self-policed! If at any time you believe we are not upholding these principles, please feel free to contact our CEO, Russell Glass at (415)830-9420.</p>
				
				<h5>Data Collection and Usage</h5>

				<p>Bizo has developed a proprietary technology that converts and optimizes information about business people into non-personally identifiable business demographic segments called Bizographics. This information includes, but is not limited to, information such as industry, company size, functional area, seniority, location and gender.</p>

				<h5>Personal Information and Registration Data</h5>

				<p>"Personal information" is data about you that is personally identifiable like your address, email address, or phone number. As part of providing services relating to the BTN, Bizo may collect, host and manage the personal information that our website partners have collected from their sites. This data is the property of the particular collecting website partner and is subject to its privacy policy. Bizo will not use this data in any way that is not authorized by that partner. Bizo never shares or distributes personal information about people who interact with any of the sites on the BTN.</p>

				<p>In order to make use of certain Bizo products and services you may be required to register as a user. From time to time we may use your personal email address to send you information and keep you informed of products and services in which you might be interested. You will always be provided with an opportunity to modify or opt-out of receiving such information. Your contact information may also be used to reach you regarding issues concerning your use of our services or our site, including changes to this privacy policy.</p>

				<p>Some partner websites or advertisements on the network may collect additional information about you, through registration, for activities such as access to premium content or for fulfilling offers such as email newsletter subscriptions or whitepaper access. This information sometimes includes personal information such as your name, address or phone number, and bizographic information such as domain, title, company name, industry or zip code. To refine the targeting of ads that are most appropriate for you, Bizo may access the information that may have been collected in a registration environment to convert into Bizographic segments. However, Bizo never uses personal information such as name, address or phone number for these purposes. If an email address is given, Bizo will always convert it into non-personal bizographic segment information before using it for any targeting purposes.</p>

				<h5>Non-Personally-Identifiable Information (Non-PII)</h5>

				<p>When you are on one of the BTN partner websites, the BTN collects certain Non-PII from you, including but not limited to your browser type and your operating system. In addition, the sites in the network collect information about your browsing behavior, such as the date and time you visit the websites, the ads that were on pages you visited, and other click-stream data, none of which includes personal information about you. Finally, the BTN may collect Non-PII about your IP address, such as where your computer is located or what domain it is using to access the internet.</p>
				
				<p>In order to serve targeted business ads, Bizo will temporarily assemble non-personal, bizographic, demographic, behavioral and technical information to create large targeted audience segments. These segments represent data that has been aggregated into large anonymous groupings. After the ad or ads have been served, only aggregate segment level data is retained by Bizo.</p>

				<p>Bizo does not provide any personal information to marketers when you interact with or view a targeted ad.</p>

				<p>To make certain that ads served by Bizo are targeted correctly, partner websites in the network place Bizo data tags on their sites. These tags are not personally identifiable nor do they collect personal information. They are used to match user browsing behavior to a segment profile designated for targeting ads to users.</p>
				
				<p><em>Customer Information</em></p>

				<p>Prospective customers (websites and online marketers) can go to <a href="http://www.bizo.com">http://www.bizo.com</a> to provide their contact information to learn more and to be contacted by a Bizo representative. Bizo or its partners reserve the right to use this information for business purposes such as responding to the request, marketing and research. Bizo or its partners will not use this information for other purposes or share this information with other companies.</p>

				<p><em>Cookies</em></p>

				<p>Many websites, including those participating in the BTN, set "cookies" on your computer. Cookies are small packets of data stored on your computer that allow sites to recognize the computer when you revisit the site. The site uses this cookie to provide services such as auto login, information delivery, and to better understand how you are interacting with the site. These cookies enable sites to customize the site to your needs and interests, so that they can be as valuable and relevant to you as possible.</p>

				<p>You are always free to decline cookies, but by doing so you may not be able to use certain features on the websites or take full advantage of all the website offerings and targeted advertising. You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, erase cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set.</p>

				<p>Alternatively, you may <a href="opt_out.html">click here to opt-out of data collection and targeting cookies from Bizo</a>. This will result in your inability to benefit from many of the Bizo features described above. Note that if you change computers or browsers, or use multiple computers or browsers, you will need to repeat this process for each computer and each browser.</p>

				<p><em>Disclosure of Information</em></p>

				<p>Non-personal information may be transferred or disclosed by Bizo to the following entities for the following purposes: (1) to our partner websites to segment and target relevant advertisements to you; (2) to entities authorized to handle data such as our employees, independent contractors, subsidiaries, partners, consultants, acquirers, business associates, service providers and suppliers (though disclosure would be made only to enable these entities to perform a business, professional or technical support function for us); and (3) to respond to judicial process and provide information to law enforcement agencies or in connection with an investigation on matters related to public safety, as permitted by law, or otherwise as required by law.</p>

				<p><em>Compliance with Safe Harbor Frameworks</em></p>

				<p>Bizo complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland. Bizo has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view Bizo’s certification, please visit <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor">http://www.export.gov/safeharbor</a>. Furthermore, Bizo (1) will cooperate with the European Union Data Protection Agencies (“DPAs”) in the investigation and resolution of complaints brought under the Safe Harbor, and (2) will comply with any advice given by the DPAs where the DPAs take the view that Bizo needs to take specific action to comply with the Safe Harbor Principles, including remedial or compensatory measures for the benefit of individuals affected by any non-compliance with the Principles, and will provide the DPAs with written confirmation that such action has been taken.</p>

				<h5>The Right to Change This Policy</h5>

				<p>We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we decide to change it, we will post a link from our homepage, and possibly other highly visible places we deem appropriate, so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we may disclose it.</p>
