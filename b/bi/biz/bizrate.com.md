# BizRate.com : Privacy Policy

BizRate.com Privacy Notice  
---  
   
  
BizRate.com is an online shopping marketplace and merchant rating service designed to deliver the best possible online shopping experience to you, our users. We are committed to protecting the privacy and security of the information we may gather about you, and we appreciate your trust that we will use and share that information carefully and sensibly. 

As part of our ongoing commitment to your privacy and security, we are proud to be a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program, a leading industry-sponsored privacy program. More information about TRUSTe is set forth below. 

This Privacy Notice describes our privacy policy. **By using BizRate.com, shopping at participating merchants, or otherwise interacting with BizRate.com, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Notice.**

_**What Personal Information Does BizRate.com Gather?** _   
The information we learn from shoppers helps us personalize and continually improve your shopping experience at BizRate.com and our participating merchants. Here are the general types of information we gather. 

**Information You Give Us**   
We receive and store any information you provide to us when you complete merchant surveys, participate in a sweepstakes or contest, open an account or otherwise become a BizRate.com member, apply for our newsletter, or communicate with customer service by e-mail, or otherwise. Such information may include your name, address, email address, shopping interests and preferences, transaction history, and other personal data. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to participate in our surveys or contests or take advantage of certain useful BizRate.com features. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as providing research reports to merchants, customizing future shopping and savings opportunities for you, improving our services, and communicating with you if you have authorized such communication. 

**Information Gathered Automatically**   
We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many Web sites, we use "cookies," and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses BizRate.com or other participating sites or when you are provided the opportunity to complete merchant surveys or participate in a sweepstakes or contest. Examples of the information we may collect and analyze include the Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet; computer and connection information such as browser type and version, operating system, and platform; the full Uniform Resource Locators (URL) clickstream to, through, and from our Web site and related services, including date and time; cookie number; products and merchants you viewed or searched for; and participating merchants you visited. We may work with third parties who use "cookies" and/or "pixel tags" to collect non-personally identifiable information when you visit our Web site or are offered the opportunity to participate in an incentive. This information may be used to provide you with better shopping or savings opportunities through advertisements on Web sites that you visit, or to conduct market research analysis. If you would like to opt out of any use of such information by such third parties, please [click here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp) and opt out for all companies listed. 

**Other Information**   
In order to improve our service and personalize our service (for example, providing special offers from our participating merchants that we think might interest you), we may in the future also receive information about you from other sources. 

_**What About Cookies?**_   
Cookies are small files that we transfer to your computer's hard drive or your Web browser memory to enable our systems to recognize your browser and to provide convenience and other features to you, such as recognizing you as a BizRate.com member or customizing merchant surveys you may be asked to complete so that you don't need to provide the same information more than once. 

The "help" portion of the toolbar on most Web browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. However, if you turn off your ability to receive and use cookies, you may have to re-enter information that would otherwise have been stored for you, and you may not be able to take full advantage of our services. Therefore, we recommend that you leave them turned on. 

_**Does BizRate.com Share the Information It Receives?**_   
Information about BizRate.com shoppers and other users is an important part of our business, and we take steps to maintain the privacy and security of such information against unauthorized access. In an effort to serve you better and improve your online shopping experiences, we may share such information as described below. 

**Aggregated Research Data**   
We produce research reports and other information and data about online shopping for participating merchants and other customers, as well as media and other interested parties. Such information and data is based upon aggregated, anonymous information about millions of online shoppers and does not include personally identifiable information about individuals. 

**Agents**   
We may employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include sending postal mail and e-mail, analyzing shopper data, and providing other services. In such instances, they may have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but will be prohibited from using it for other purposes. 

**Special Offers**   
Sometimes we send special offers to selected groups of BizRate.com shoppers on behalf of participating merchants or other businesses. When we do this, we do not give that merchant or business your name and address. If you do not want to receive such offers, please [click here](https://web.archive.org/help/contact_us.xpml) to contact us and be removed from our mailing list. 

**Business Transactions**   
As we continue to develop our business, we may participate in corporate transactions such as mergers and acquisitions, and it is possible that another company may acquire BizRate.com or its business assets in the future. In such cases, user information may be shared with the acquirer and/or other reputable parties involved in those transactions. 

**Protection of BizRate.com and Others**   
We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with law; enforce or apply our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/content/legal.xpml) and other agreements; assist in fraud protection or investigation; or protect the rights, property, or security of BizRate.com, our users, or others. 

**With Your Consent**   
Other than as described above, with your consent we may also share information with participating merchants where you have shopped or with other third parties from time to time. 

_**Participating Merchant Policies**_   
Online merchants and others who participate in BizRate.com services are encouraged to participate in industry privacy initiatives and to take a responsible attitude towards consumer privacy. However, since we do not have direct control over the policies or practices of participating merchants, we cannot be responsible for their actions. We recommend that you always review each online merchant's privacy policies before you provide any personal information or complete any transaction with that merchant. 

_**Co-Branded Services**_   
In certain areas on our site (such as the Wireless & Telecom and Personal Finance areas), we have joined forces with a reputable third-party source of specialized information and other content so that you can quickly and easily make informed decisions about such products and services. In each of these areas, the BizRate.com header notes that the services are "Powered by" or "By" the third-party (such as GetConnected.com in the Wireless & Telecom area and Bankrate.com in the Personal Finance area). This indicates that the content resides on the third party's servers and your use of those "co-branded" services is governed by that company's privacy policies and terms of use, which you can access at the bottom of each page in those areas. We recommend that you always review their privacy policies and terms of use before you complete any transaction with them. BizRate.com's Terms of Use (but not our privacy policies) also apply as between you and BizRate.com with respect to your use of those third-party co-branded services accessed through our site. 

_**How Secure Is Information About Me?**_   
We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input. We also use a secure server hosting location, firewall protection, controlled access and encryption technology to protect your data. While no system is completely foolproof, we take the security of your personal information very seriously, and our security measures are designed to protect that information in a responsible manner. 

_**What Information Can I Access?**_   
If you establish a member account, BizRate.com gives you access to certain account information about you for the purpose of viewing and updating that information. 

_**What Choices Do I Have?**_   
As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide information, although that might prevent us from personalizing our service for you or prevent you from participating in a survey or contest or taking advantage of certain BizRate.com features. 

If you have opened a member account, you can add or update certain account information at any time. 

From time to time, BizRate.com will send newsletters and other email to members and others who have agreed to be contacted by BizRate.com. You can always choose not to receive email from BizRate.com. Most messages carry opt-out or unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of the email. If you do not want to receive e-mail from us, please [click here](https://web.archive.org/help/contact_us.xpml) to be removed from our mailing list. (If you do not want to receive [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/content/legal.xpml) and other legal notices from us, such as this Privacy Notice, those notices will still govern your use of BizRate.com, and it is your responsibility to review them for changes.) 

The "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. However, you may not be able to take advantage of all of our features if you do not use cookies. 

_**Children**_   
BizRate.com is not designed or intended for use by children under 13, although participating merchants on our site may offer children's products for purchase by adults. If you are under 18, you should use BizRate.com only with involvement of a parent or guardian. 

_**Privacy Questions?**_   
If you have any questions or concerns about privacy at BizRate.com, please contact us at [privacy@bizrate.com](mailto:privacy@bizrate.com), and we will try to answer your questions or otherwise resolve the matter to your satisfaction. If you do not receive acknowledgment of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you may then contact TRUSTe (<http://www.truste.org/users/watchdog.html>). TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with the Web site to resolve your concerns. To find out more about TRUSTe, [click here](https://www.truste.org/validate/2518).

**_Terms of Use and Revisions_**   
Your contacts with BizRate.com and use of BizRate.com services, including any dispute related to privacy, are subject to this Privacy Notice and our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/content/legal.xpml), including limitations on damages, arbitration of disputes, and application of the law of the state of California. Since our business changes constantly, this Privacy Notice and the [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/content/legal.xpml) will also change from time to time, and use of information that we gather now will be subject to the Privacy Notice in effect at the time of use. We may e-mail periodic reminders of our notices and other conditions and future changes that may occur, unless you have instructed us not to, but we are not obligated to do so, and you should check for recent changes on our Web site or other services whenever you visit.
