**Does BizRate.com collect personal information?**

Yes, we do collect personal information. However, it is your right to have your information remain private.

We request personal information from you when you complete a BizRate.com survey after shopping at a BizRate.com Customer Certified online store. We ask for your email address and demographic information such as gender, age range, occupation, education level, income, marital status, connection speed and zip code when you complete the survey. With the exception of providing a valid email address, the choice to provide the requested information is up to you. We need your email address upon completing the point-of-sale survey to verify the uniqueness of respondents and in order to send a follow-up survey about your satisfaction with your order delivery.

If you join our BizRater Membership Program, we ask for your email address when you sign up. If you take advantage of our BizRater Rebates Program, we need your name and mailing address in order to send your rebates check to you. We may also ask you for personal information at other times, including but not limited to when you enter a sweepstakes, contest or promotion sponsored by BizRate.com. Also, if you contact BizRate.com, we may keep a record of that correspondence.

The information you provide may also be used to occasionally notify you about important changes to our website, new BizRate.com services, and special opportunities we think you'll find valuable. We may also use this information to provide a more personalized experience on our site.

**What does BizRate.com do with my personal information?**

BizRate.com's goal in collecting personal information is to provide you, as a BizRate.com member, with the most personalized Web experience possible when visiting our site. BizRate.com does not publish, sell, trade, or rent your identifiable personal information to others. 

We compile the opinions of online consumers gathered in our surveys into marketing research reports that provide insights about the current trends in the world of e-commerce. However, the primary use of our survey data is to rate an online store’s performance, so that other online shoppers can benefit from your experience. At no time in this process does any outside party have access to your individual identifiable personal information. The only exception is, at your request only, we will forward your email address to the online retailer for whom you completed a survey, so that they may respond to any comments you might have provided.

BizRate.com does not own these businesses. All transactions and use of any customer information gathered during the purchase process are the sole responsibilities of the online store. For further information regarding the online store's use of customer information, contact that online store directly.
