# BizRate.com : Privacy Policy

This confirms that BizRate.com is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. This privacy statement discloses the privacy practices for www.BizRate.com. 

BizRate.com is an online shopping marketplace designed to deliver the best possible online shopping experience to you, our users. You are the reason we exist as a business. We depend upon our relationship with you and remain committed to protecting your privacy and security. 

Everyday, thousands of online shoppers just like you enjoy our services and entrust BizRate.com with their shopping information. This information allows us to provide services to make online shopping as rewarding and efficient as possible. __You__ are the power behind BizRate.com. The more you share about how you shop, the better shopping can be for you and for everyone. 

**Two Kinds of Information**

The information you provide allows us to deliver valuable services and promotions to meet the needs of online buyers and sellers. To protect your privacy, we keep the information we collect in two distinct categories: 

**1\. Personally Identifiable Information** is information associated with you as an individual. It is kept in a record that matches it with a customer number so we can access it to make the site more relevant and useful when you visit. 

**2\. Aggregate Information** comes from many sources and is combined to show a big picture, such as trends or statistics, and does not reveal the identity of the individuals who shared it. This information is used primarily for research purposes. 

**_How We Use the Information You Provide_**

**Personally Identifiable Information**

You control the personally identifiable information you share with us. We use it to provide you with a better shopping experience and to enhance our ability and the ability of our participating online stores to serve you. Online stores and others who are part of the BizRate.com shopping community may work with us to deliver personalized discounts and promotions to you, but they do NOT have access to your personally identifiable information. 

**Your personally identifiable information is NOT sold to third parties for marketing purposes.** For example, we do NOT sell your phone number to telemarketers or a list containing your mailing address to "junk mail" marketing companies. 

**Aggregate Information**

Aggregate Information allows people and their businesses to be smarter about online shopping. When a business knows more about its customers, they both win. Without giving out personally identifiable information, we make aggregate information available to online stores or other third parties that deliver valuable products or services to our users. 

BizRate.com provides timely, insightful and detailed analysis of online buying and customer satisfaction through a variety of reports. By sitting at the point-of-sale across thousands of quality online retailers, BizRate.com is uniquely positioned to monitor e-Commerce activity across the Web, soliciting information from millions of online buyers like you as they make their purchases. 

**_How We Gather Information_**

**BizRate.com Surveys.** When you complete a survey after purchasing from a BizRate.com Customer Certified online store, the only information we require is your email address. Your valid email address allows us to certify that you are an actual customer and to send you a follow-up survey about your satisfaction following delivery. 

We ask for your demographic information (like gender, age range, occupation, education level, income, marital status, and zip code) but this is always voluntary. This information is used in aggregate, or to enhance the level of service BizRate.com can provide you. 

We mainly use your survey data to rate an online store's performance. Your feedback allows online shoppers to benefit from your experience. We compile the survey responses of online consumers into marketing research reports that provide insights about the current trends in the world of e-commerce. At no time in the survey process does any outside party have access to your personally identifiable information. The only exception is that, at your request only, we will forward your email address and comments to the online retailer for whom you completed a survey, so that they may respond directly to any comments you might have provided. 

We may also gather statistics about the use of various aspects of the service for administrative purposes or to determine what services to offer or enhance. 

**BizRate.com membership information.** If you join our BizRater Membership Program and become a member of the BizRate.com shopping community, you need to enter some personally identifiable information, such as your user ID, password, first and last name, zip code, and an email address through which we can contact you when necessary. All information you provide at registration, except for your username, may be edited whenever you like through your MyBizRate page. 

**Information used for form filling, rebate offers, and other services.** We store and use personally identifiable information such as user ID, passwords, addresses, billing, and credit card information to enable form-filling convenience for our members, and to customize and personalize our services. We may also use your mailing address to send you rebate checks. 

**Enhanced features may require more information.** Some enhanced BizRate.com features, such as the BizRate.com Shopping Toolbar, form-filling, order tracking, and rebate offers, require that we collect additional personally identifiable information from you, such as your billing, shipping, and transaction information. 

**BizRate.com customer service contacts**. If you contact BizRate.com by email, telephone, or mail, we may keep a record of that contact or correspondence. 

**BizRate.com contests or promotions.** We may also ask you for personally identifiable information at other times, including but not limited to when you enter a sweepstakes, contest, or promotion sponsored by BizRate.com. 

**The BizRate Shopping Toolbar.** We use the completed transactions that are securely logged in your private account to allow you to keep track of online purchases, and to further enhance and personalize your shopping experience. We may also collect information regarding your transactions and purchasing patterns when the BizRate Shopping Toolbar is inactive, in order to customize and personalize your shopping experience in the future. 

**Transactions and purchasing pattern information.** We collect information regarding your online transactions and purchasing patterns through the use of "cookies". If you use the BizRate.com Shopping Toolbar, we collect and securely log information regarding your completed transactions into your private account. If you are a member and make purchases or other transactions through a mybizrate.com email account that we maintain for you, you may thereafter receive order confirmations and other emails from the online stores through that mybizrate.com email account. We may also collect relevant information from those emails before forwarding them on to your registered email account. We use the information we collect on your transaction and purchasing pattern information to deliver customized promotions and offers to you, and to better understand your needs and preferences. 

**Use of Cookies**

In order to provide personalized services, we use "cookie" capabilities enabled by your Internet browser. "Cookies" are small files that your web browser places on your computer's hard drive or in your browser memory for security purposes and to remember your site preferences and personalization.

Even without accepting cookies, you can still use the features on our web site, although certain enhanced features may not be available. 

**Security**

This site has security measures in place to prevent the loss, misuse or alteration of the information under our control. We have invested in industry-leading security technology to make your shopping experience as secure as possible and to protect your privacy. We currently employ the following techniques: 

> **· Encryption.** Leading encryption technologies, comparable to those used in Internet-based home banking services provided by financial institutions, are used for both the data transmission during form filling and for data storage in our secure database. 
> 
> **· Secure data storage.** Our secure database protects your personally identifiable information. We provide a secure server hosting location, firewall protection, controlled access, and encryption technology. 
> 
> **· Non-cached data transmission.** Form filling data are directly obtained from our secure server -- they are not filed in any cache. This is done to assure that this personally identifiable information will not be easily exposed to hackers or other unauthorized users. 

**Required and Additional Disclosures**

It is our general policy not to release any personally identifiable information without your permission. We may in certain circumstances disclose information to online stores or other third parties when we believe in good faith that such action is necessary to: (1) conform with legal requirements or comply with legal processes, such as a court-ordered subpoena; (2) protect and defend our legal rights and property, and the legal rights and property of our users, online stores and other parties, such as fraud investigations; and (3) as otherwise permitted by law. Our disclosures in such circumstances will be limited to just the particular information we believe in our good faith judgment is necessary or appropriate to satisfy the particular legal requirement or other appropriate disclosure situation. 

**Shopping at Participating Online Stores**

BizRate.com encourages participating online stores to participate in industry privacy initiatives and to take a responsible attitude towards consumer privacy. However, since we do not have any direct control over the privacy policies or practices of the participating online stores, we cannot be responsible for their actions. We recommend that you always review each online store's privacy policies before you complete any transaction with them. 

**Co-Branded Services**

In certain areas on our site (such as the Wireless & Telecom and Personal Finance areas), we have joined forces with a reputable third-party source of specialized information and other content so that you can quickly and easily make informed decisions about such products and services. In each of these areas, the BizRate.com header notes that the services are "Powered by" or "By" the third-party (such as GetConnected.com in the Wireless & Telecom area and Bankrate.com in the Personal Finance area). This indicates that the content resides on the third party's servers and your use of those services is governed by that company's privacy policies and terms of use, which you can access at the bottom of each page in those areas. We recommend that you always review their privacy policies and terms of use before you complete any transaction with them. BizRate.com's Terms of Use (but not our privacy policies) also apply as between you and BizRate.com with respect to your use of those third-party services accessed through our site.

**Service Providers and Joint Marketing Activities**

We may provide personally identifiable information on a limited basis (i) to third parties who are perform services for us or functions on our behalf in accordance with applicable law, and (ii) when we engage in joint marketing activities or in corporate transactions such as mergers and acquisitions from time to time with other reputable parties as permitted by applicable law. In such instances, we will contractually prohibit the third party involved from disclosing or using the information other than for the purposes for which we disclosed the information. For instance, they would be prohibited from selling the information to a telemarketer or "junk mail" marketing company in violation of our Privacy Policy.

If you receive any junk email that mentions BizRate.com, please send details to [privacy@bizrate.com](mailto:privacy@bizrate.com) and we will investigate promptly.
