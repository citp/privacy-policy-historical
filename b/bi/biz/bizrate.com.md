BizRate.com Privacy Notice  


BizRate.com is an online shopping marketplace and merchant rating service designed to deliver the best possible online shopping experience to you, our users. We are committed to protecting the privacy and security of the information we may gather about you, and we appreciate your trust that we will use and share that information carefully and sensibly. 

As part of our ongoing commitment to your privacy and security, we are proud to be a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program, a leading industry-sponsored privacy program. TRUSTe's certification covers BizRate.com's gathering and dissemination of information, not any services or products. More information about TRUSTe is set forth below. 

This Privacy Notice describes our privacy policy. Although this Privacy Notice may seem long, we have prepared a detailed policy because we believe you should know as much as possible about BizRate.com's practices so that you can make informed decisions. By accepting the User Agreement, using BizRate.com or any co-branded Web site, shopping at participating merchants, completing our surveys, participating in our sweepstakes or other incentives, responding to our emails, or otherwise interacting with BizRate.com, you are consenting to the use and disclosure of any personally identifiable information you have shared with us and to the other BizRate.com practices described in this Privacy Notice. 

**A SPECIAL NOTE ABOUT CHILDREN**   
BizRate.com is not designed or intended for use by children under 13, although participating merchants on our site may offer children's products for purchase by adults. If you are under 18, you should use BizRate.com only with involvement of a parent or guardian. Children under 13 may not submit any personally identifiable information to us, and if we discover that we have inadvertently gathered any such information from a child under 13, we will take appropriate steps to delete it. 

**WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DOES BIZRATE GATHER?**   
The information we learn from shoppers helps us personalize and continually improve your shopping experience at BizRate.com and our participating merchants. Here are the general types of information we gather. 

**Information You Give Us**   
We receive and store any information you provide to us when you complete merchant surveys, participate in a sweepstakes or other incentive, become a BizRate.com member, sign up to receive our newsletter or other email communications, communicate by email, telephone or physical mail with our customer service, or otherwise interact with us. Such information may include your name, address, email address, shopping interests and preferences, transaction history, and other personal data. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to participate in our surveys or incentives or take advantage of certain useful BizRate.com features. 

**Information Gathered Automatically**   
We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many Web sites, we use "cookies" and "clear gifs" to obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses BizRate.com and our participating merchants' sites, or when you are provided the opportunity to complete merchant surveys, participate in a sweepstakes or other incentive, or open or respond to any BizRate.com newsletter or other email you may have requested. 

Briefly, "cookies" are small files that we transfer to your computer's hard drive or your Web browser memory to enable our systems to recognize your browser and to provide convenience and other features to you, such as recognizing you as a BizRate.com member or customizing merchant surveys you may be asked to complete so that you don't need to provide the same information more than once. "Clear gifs" are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and may be used to track the online movements of Web users or to determine if someone has opened an email. 

Examples of the information we may collect and analyze in this manner include the Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet; computer and connection information such as browser type and version, operating system, and platform; your behavior on our Web site and related services, including the products and merchants you view or searched for, as well as the URL you come from and go to next (whether this URL is on our site or not); cookie number; and participating merchants you visit. 

You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although in that case you may not be able to use certain features on our site or to participate in BizRate.com incentives. 

**Third Party Advertising**   
We work with third parties, including advertising companies and website analysis firms, who use cookies and clear gifs to collect non-personally identifiable information when you visit our Web site and other sites or are offered the opportunity to participate in an incentive. This information may be used to provide you with better shopping or savings opportunities through advertisements on this and other Web sites that you visit, or to conduct market research and website analysis. 

The ads appearing on our site are delivered to users by a DoubleClick DART ad server. Information about users' visits to our site, such as number of times they have viewed an ad (but not user name, address or other personal information), is used to serve ads to users of our site. 

Users who visit a participating merchant that is a customer of Coremetrics, a website analysis firm, and complete our survey regarding that merchant may receive cookies intended to help analyze their use of the merchant's site in relation to their satisfaction with the site. 

**DOES BIZRATE SHARE THE INFORMATION IT GATHERS?**   
Information about BizRate.com shoppers and other users is an important part of our business, and we take steps to maintain the privacy and security of such information against unauthorized access. We generally use such information for such purposes as providing research reports to merchants, customizing future shopping and savings opportunities for you, improving our services, and communicating with you if you have authorized such communication. In an effort to serve you better and improve your online shopping experiences, we may also share such information as described below. 

**Aggregated Research Data**   
We produce research reports and other information and data about online shopping for participating merchants and other customers, as well as media and other interested parties. Such information and data is based upon aggregated, anonymous information about millions of online shoppers and does not include personally identifiable information about individuals. 

**Agents**   
We may employ other companies and individuals to perform various functions on our behalf. Examples include sending postal mail and e-mail, analyzing shopper data, and providing other data and services. In such instances, they may have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but will be prohibited from using it for other purposes. 

**Special Offers**   
Sometimes we send email newsletters or special offers to selected groups of BizRate.com shoppers who have chosen to receive email on behalf of participating merchants or other businesses. When we do this, we do not give that merchant or business your name and address. If you do not want to receive such newsletters or offers, please [click here](https://web.archive.org/help/contact_us.xpml) to contact us and be removed from our mailing list. 

**Survey Incentives**   
We sometimes share customer information with the third parties that help us provide survey incentives, such as discounts on cruises, travel programs, magazine subscriptions or other items, and they may share such information with us. For instance, for users who elect to use an online coupon for a vacation discount and provide us with their contact information for that purpose, we will share that information with the vacation sponsor so that they can make arrangements directly with the coupon holder. 

**Business Transactions**   
As we continue to develop our business, we may participate in corporate transactions such as mergers and acquisitions, and it is possible that another company may acquire BizRate.com or its business assets in the future. In such cases, user information may be shared with the acquirer and/or other reputable parties involved in those transactions. Users will be notified via email or a prominent notice on our Web site for 30 days prior to a change of ownership or control of their personal information in such a transaction. We provide you with 30 days notice to allow you the opportunity to notify BizRate.com if you do not wish such information to be shared by notifying us at [privacy@bizrate.com](mailto:privacy@bizrate.com). 

**Protection of BizRate.com and Others**   
We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with law; enforce or apply our User Agreement and other agreements; assist in fraud protection or investigation; or protect the rights, property, or security of BizRate.com, our users, or others. 

**With Your Consent**   
Other than as described above, with your consent we may also share your information with participating merchants where you have shopped or with other third parties from time to time. 

**PARTICIPATING MERCHANT POLICIES**   
Online merchants, survey incentive vendors, and others who participate in BizRate.com services are encouraged to participate in industry privacy initiatives and to take a responsible attitude towards consumer privacy. However, since we do not have direct control over the policies or practices of participating merchants, survey incentive vendors, and other third parties, we cannot be responsible for their actions. We recommend that you always review the privacy policies of merchants and other third parties before you provide any personal information or complete any transaction with such parties. 

**CO-BRANDED SERVICES**   
In certain areas on our site (such as the Cellular Services and Personal Finance areas), we have joined forces with a reputable third-party source of specialized information and other content so that you can quickly and easily make informed decisions about such products and services. In each of these areas, the BizRate.com header notes that the services are "Powered by" or "By" the third-party (such as LetsTalk.com in the Cellular Services area and Bankrate.com in the Personal Finance area). This indicates that the content resides on the third party's servers and your use of those "co-branded" services and information gathering and usage is governed by that company's privacy policies and terms of use, which you can access at the bottom of each page in those areas. We recommend that you always review their privacy policies and terms of use before you complete any transaction with them. BizRate.com's User Agreement (other than provisions relating to our privacy policies) also apply as between you and BizRate.com with respect to your use of those third-party co-branded services accessed through our site. 

**HOW SECURE IS INFORMATION ABOUT ME?**   
We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input. We also use a secure server hosting location, firewall protection, controlled access and encryption technology to protect your data. While no system is completely foolproof, we take the security of your personal information very seriously, and our security measures are designed to protect that information in a responsible manner. 

**WHAT INFORMATION CAN I ACCESS?**   
If you register as a BizRate.com member, BizRate.com gives you access to your registration information for the purpose of viewing and updating that information. 

**WHAT CHOICES DO I HAVE?**   
As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide information, although that might prevent us from personalizing our service for you or prevent you from participating in a survey or sweepstakes or taking advantage of certain BizRate.com features. 

If you have registered as a member, you can add or update your registration information, or delete your membership account entirely, at any time by visiting the Your Account area. 

We will retain in our files information you have requested to delete in some circumstances, such as to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our User Agreement. Furthermore, such prior information is never completely removed from our databases due to technical and legal constraints, including stored "back up" systems. 

From time to time, BizRate.com will send newsletters and other email to members and others who have agreed to be contacted by BizRate.com. You can always choose not to receive email from BizRate.com. Most messages carry opt-out or unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of the email. If you do not want to receive e-mail from us, please [click here](https://web.archive.org/help/contact_us.xpml) to be removed from our mailing list. (If you do not want to receive notice of changes to our [User Agreement](https://web.archive.org/content/legal.xpml) and other legal notices from us, such as this Privacy Notice, those notices will still govern your use of BizRate.com, and it is your responsibility to review them for changes.) 

**PRIVACY QUESTIONS?**   
If you have any questions or concerns about privacy at BizRate.com, please contact us at [privacy@bizrate.com](mailto:privacy@bizrate.com), and we will try to answer your questions or otherwise resolve the matter to your satisfaction. If you do not receive acknowledgment of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you may then contact TRUSTe (<http://www.truste.org/users/watchdog.html>). TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with the Web site to resolve your concerns. To find out more about TRUSTe, [click here](https://www.truste.org/validate/2518). 

**USER AGREEMENT AND REVISIONS**   
Your contacts with BizRate.com and use of BizRate.com services, including any dispute related to privacy, are subject to this Privacy Notice and our User Agreement, including limitations on damages, arbitration of disputes, and application of the law of the state of California. Since our business changes constantly, this Privacy Notice and the User Agreement will also change from time to time, and use of information that we gather now will be subject to the Privacy Notice in effect at the time of use. We may email periodic reminders of our notices and other conditions and future changes that may occur, unless you have instructed us not to, but we are not obligated to do so, and you agree to check for recent changes on our Web site or other services whenever you visit.
