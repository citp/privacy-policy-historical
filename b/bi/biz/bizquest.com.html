            This privacy statement covers the website <a href="http://www.BizQuest.com/" title="Franchises for sale on BizQuest">
                http://www.BizQuest.com/</a>. By accessing, using or registering with BizQuest's

            variety of online services to assist individuals and brokers with buying and selling
            businesses and franchises. BizQuest values your privacy, feedback and candor very
            highly. Any user information we collect is considered private and we do not use
            it or share it except as permitted herein, without the user's permission. We use
            this personal information at BizQuest to provide the best quality service possible.
            The following privacy statement summarizes BizQuest's protection and use of any
            personal information provided by visitors to the BizQuest site.
        </p>
        <p>
            This policy does not apply to any public area of BizQuest's web site or services.
            In the event you submit personally identifiable information to contact another member,
            contact a lister about a listing, create a listing, add a contact on a listing,
            the BizQuest Blog or Broker Directory, such information becomes publicly available
            and BizQuest is not responsible for the personally identifiable information you
            choose to submit to these services, forums, listings, or persons.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Information Collected by BizQuest: </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            BizQuest collects user information from several areas of the BizQuest site including
            products; business services; the adding and editing of business and franchise listings;
            the adding and editing of Broker Directory Listings; email forms; the BizQuest Blog;
            and any surveys or contests that BizQuest may sponsor. BizQuest collects individual
            user search activity for statistical, archival, and business purposes. BizQuest
            collects financial information (such as billing address, credit card number, expiration
            date) for billing payment and credit card authorization purposes. BizQuest may track
            the IP address of a user's computer or place a "cookie" in the browser
            files of a user's computer. This is required by BizQuest services to provide automated
            features.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Use of Information Collected: </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Collected information helps BizQuest better understand its users' needs in order
            to improve its product and service offerings. Email addresses are used to communicate
            with members through the BizQuest Buyer, Broker and Franchise Newsletters (weekly
            or bi-weekly email news summaries); Promotional emails; Partner emails and for site
            administration purposes. Users may be deleted from Newsletters, Promotional email
            and Partner email lists at their request. Personal information may be used to contact
            users for the purpose of research, product development, marketing, or customer service,
            if the user has opted to receive such communication. User search activity is collected
            and analyzed and may be utilized by BizQuest in the aggregate or in the abstract
            for a variety of business purposes. Financial information is used to bill users
            for products and services purchased. Within BizQuest, only accounting managers have
            access to the credit card account information. This information is not shared with
            anyone outside of BizQuest. IP address and cookie log data is analyzed to better
            understand traffic flows and user preferences.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Use of Email Tools: </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            You may NOT use the Email the Broker, Email a Listing service or other email services
            that we offer to send spam (i.e. unsolicited commercial email) or otherwise send
            content that would violate BizQuest's Terms and Conditions. We may monitor, track
            or save the use of this feature, but will be under no obligation to monitor, track
            or save these email messages sent from these tools. If you send an email using the
            Email a Listing to a Friend service to an email address that is not registered in
            our system, we do not use that email address for any purpose other than to send
            your email, and for us to automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting
            him or her to visit the site. BizQuest stores this information for the sole purpose
            of sending this one-time email and for tracking the success of our referral program.
            We also do not rent or sell these email addresses of un-registered users.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Shared information: </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Though BizQuest makes every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose
            personal information when required by law wherein we have good faith belief that
            such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order
            or legal process served on our Web site.
        </p>
        <p>
            BizQuest shares member information in the following areas on the site: Business
            and Franchise Listing Service, Saved Search Email Alerts, BizQuest Blog and the
            Broker Directory. When a member enters a business or franchise listing in the Listing
            Service, listing contact information is also entered. In addition, members searching
            BizQuest can view contact information when they view a listing profile. BizQuest
            allows users to share contact information with one another via its Saved Search
            Email Alert service. With Saved Searches users can save their business search criteria
            to have information about businesses that match the specified criteria emailed to
            them. When selecting this service, users are given the option of releasing their
            contact information to other users who have business listings that match their criteria.
            This contact information is then shared with the users who have business listings
            that match the buying or leasing criteria. Unless required by law as detailed in
            this section or a user specifically takes action as discussed in this paragraph,
            BizQuest does not share individual user search activity information and such activity
            information remains private to the individual user and to BizQuest. Broker Members
            agree to share their contact information and allow all BizQuest users to view their
            contact information via the BizQuest Business Broker Directory or via links made
            available to users on a listing or in an email. BizQuest users who do not opt out
            of the Broker Directory service during registration with BizQuest (or anytime thereafter)
            also agree to share their contact information via the BizQuest Broker Directory.
        </p>
        <p>
            BizQuest shares information with its partners for the purpose of providing related
            services in which we deem our users have interest. The use that BizQuest's partners
            make of customer information will not exceed BizQuest's use of the data. Key billing
            information (such as credit card number, expiration date and dollar amount) gathered
            from users making online purchases of products or services is shared with PayPal,
            our credit card processing partner, in order to authorize charges to the credit
            card. BizQuest also uses third party providers to perform email and postal mailings
            on behalf of BizQuest, but this information (such as name, address and email) is
            confidential and is not used by the provider for any other purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
            BizQuest does not rent or lease user information to any third party, except as disclosed
            here. From time to time, BizQuest may obtain information (such as electronic mail
            addresses) from third party providers. It is our goal to only contact individuals
            who we believe may have a legitimate business interest in BizQuest based on their
            membership or participation in other organizations or web sites, and who have indicated
            a willingness to be contacted for this purpose. While BizQuest endeavors to work
            with other sites and companies with a similar respect for user privacy, BizQuest
            cannot be responsible for the privacy practices of other sites.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please be aware that in the event BizQuest merges with a third party, or in the
            event all or substantially all of BizQuest's assets are acquired by a third party,
            customer information, including personally identifiable information, will be shared
            and/or transferred to such third party. The information may only be used or shared
            by such third parties for the primary purpose for which the information was originally
            collected. If such third parties, or if BizQuest for its own business needs, desire
            to use the personally identifiable information for another purpose, you will be
            notified prior to the information being used for a new purpose, and you will have
            the opportunity to opt out of such new use of your personally identifiable information.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Security of personal information: </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            BizQuest's clients and their personal information are considered to be BizQuest's
            greatest asset and thus their privacy is treated with the utmost regard and respect.
            BizQuest takes every reasonable precaution to secure personal information within
            both its computers and its physical premises.
        </p>
        <p>
            The security of your personal information is important to BizQuest. When you enter
            sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our registration or order
            forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). [To
            learn more about SSL, follow this link <a href="http://www.verisign.com" title="VeriSign" target="_blank">http://www.verisign.com</a>].
        </p>

        <p>
            BizQuest utilizes email as a vital and primary communication channel with registered
            users and customers. As a registered user/customer, you hereby acknowledge and grant
            BizQuest the permission to communicate with you via email (as well as other communication
            channels such as phone and fax) for any purposes BizQuest determines to be relevant
            including, but not limited to, system messages, product updates, service announcements
            and other marketing messages. BizQuest will use best efforts to honor customers
            request to opt out of marketing messages, but under no circumstances will BizQuest
            have any liability for sending any email to its registered users/customers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Users who do not wish to receive marketing emails including the BizQuest Newsletters,
            BizQuest Promotional Emails, or Sponsor Emails are requested to contact <a href="http://www.bizquest.com/support/contact.asp" title="BizQuest Client Services">BizQuest Client Services</a>, or select the

            may also opt out of Saved Search Email Alerts by returning to the Saved Search section
            and clicking on the "Remove this Search" button. We also send our users
            site and service announcement updates. Members are not able to un-subscribe from
            service announcements, which contain important information about service notices
            and responsibilities. BizQuest occasionally communicates with its users via email
            and phone to provide information about requested services and regarding issues related
            to their account. It is important to note that this communication is not used for
            marketing or promotional purposes. Requesting the deletion of certain types of user
            information may prevent users from accessing some web site features.
        </p>
        <p>
            You may correct or update your personally identifiable information by going to the

        </p>
        <p>
            Credit card information submitted to BizQuest is typically used for a one-time charge
            to your account, and subsequent orders for renewals require users to resubmit the
            credit information. (An exception: Broker Membership accounts and Franchise Directory
            advertising are automatically renewed each month, using the original credit information
            submitted.) Therefore, for added security, any credit card information submitted
            to BizQuest is not accessible for review or modification by signing on to your ad.
            If you have questions regarding the credit card information used in ordering your
            products or services, please <a href="http://www.bizquest.com/support/contact.asp" title="Contact Us">contact us</a> or at 888-280-3815.</p>
