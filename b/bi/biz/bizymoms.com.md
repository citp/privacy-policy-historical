Bizymoms shares your concern for privacy online and has implemented the following privacy policy to make you aware of how your visit, and any information you share with us while on our site, is utilized.

**Bizy News Subscriptions** \- When you submit your email address to us for inclusion in our Bizy News email list your address is used solely to share news about our site. This news is delivered primarily through our Newsletters, but also may arrive in occasional special announcements about our site. Please see the information at the bottom of each mailing for easy instructions on how to unsubscribe if at any time you wish to stop receiving the mailings. Your email address will not be shared with any third parties or be used for any purpose other than those described in this section.  
  
   
  
**Message Board Registration -** In order to post on our message boards you must be a registered member. This policy was implemented to decrease the amount of unacceptable posts on our boards, so that all members can enjoy the time they spend there. The information which you share during registration and in your profile is retained in our message board database, we do not use your information for any other purpose*. Be aware that the only required information is: your first name, email address, a user name, and a password. All other information in your profile is entirely optional and can be hidden or deleted by you at any time.

Unfortunately there are unscrupulous individuals out there who use special programs to gather email addresses on the internet without permission. If you notice an increase in spam after registering for the message boards it is due to these aforementioned unscrupulous people gathering your email address from your postings, NOT from your protected profile information. Unfortunately this problem exists on any site where people post messages or share their email address openly on the internet. Bizymoms is constantly monitoring the internet for new security features to prevent the gathering of email addresses on our site and will use new technology if/when it becomes available to protect you.

This is entirely optional and has been included as a service to you, to make your visit easier. Your chat name and color choice is not saved in any way on our servers. Bizymoms does log all chat activity in our chat room, these logs are used to share chat content with your fellow visitors who could not attend the chat, for security purposes so we can monitor the room for unacceptable behavior, and all logs are discarded after 14 days.

Your activity and IP address is not retained and is merely used by Bizymoms to guage page popularity, problems experienced when accessing pages, and for our own review to make improvements to our site. This information is not shared with any third parties or used in any other manner.

In addition we do rotate banners on the site. While most of our banners are local to our server a few are delivered by affiliate programs which may place a cookie on your computer to prevent your being counted as viewing their banners more than once, no personally identifiable information is retained by Bizymoms or our banner suppliers. Any cookies can easily be removed from your computer by reading your browser help file and there are programs available to automatically remove, or prevent the saving of cookies on your computer without your knowledge.
