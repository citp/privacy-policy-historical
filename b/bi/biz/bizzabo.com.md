The Bizzabo Service, Sites and the Software are individually and collectively referred to herein as the “Services”.

#### 1\. Introduction.

We have implemented this Privacy Policy because your privacy, and the privacy of other users, is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your Personal Information is collected and used in connection with the Services. “ **Personal Information** ” means any information that may be used, either alone or in combination with other information, to personally identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, a personal profile, an email address, a home or other physical address, or other contact information.

#### 2\. Terms of Use.

This Privacy Policy forms part of our Bizzabo End User Terms of Service which can be viewed from within the Service and which you accepted prior to downloading, installing and/or using the Software for the first time (“ **Terms** ”). Any capitalized but undefined term in this Privacy Policy shall have the meaning given to it in the Terms.

#### 3\. Consent and Modification.

By using the Services, you consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy and to our collection, processing and sharing of Personal Information for the purposes set forth herein. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not access or otherwise use the Services. We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change this Privacy Policy at any time. Such change will be effective ten (10) days following posting of the revised Privacy Policy on the Services, and your continued use of the Services thereafter means that you accept those changes.

#### 4\. What Personal Information We Collect and How We Collect It.

We do not currently require you to provide Personal Information in order to have access to general information available on the Services. But, we do receive and/or collect Personal Information from you in the following ways:

#### 4.1 Account.

In order to use certain Services, you may be required to create an account (“ **Account** ”). We may offer different options to create an Account, including:

#### A. Online Registration Form:

You may choose to complete and submit an online registration form. You will be asked to provide us with certain mandatory information such as your name and email address, and also a password that you will use for your Account. You may choose to provide optional information such as your age and gender.

#### B. Third Party Accounts:

You may choose to create an Account by clicking on a ‘connect’ or ‘sign-in’button that we may display on the Services for a designated third party website or service (each a “ **Third Party Account** ”), including but not limited to, LinkedIn, Facebook or Twitter. Doing so will enable you to link your Service Account and your Third Party Account. If you choose this option, then you will be required to approve the connection as well as the types of information (which may include Personal Information) that we will obtain from your Third Party Account and the types of activities that we may perform in connection with your Third Party Account. Please note that in order to use this option, you will need to have, and may need to be signed-in to, an existing Third Party Account.

#### C. Event Registration:

You may be creating an Account in connection with your attendance at an event. Information you provide in the course of creating an Account or registering for an event or for use of the Services, including but not limited to, name, email address, phone number, physical address, and employer, may be provided to and maintained by the organizer of the event (“ **Event Organizer** ”), whether or not you complete the registration process, and may be used by the Event Organizer in connection with the event or future events or other products and services. If you wish to opt-out from receiving email solicitations from the Event Organizer for future events or other products and services, you may do so through the Event Organizer’s website or the unsubscribe link provided with the Event Organizer’s email solicitations.

Regardless of which method you choose to register your Account, we may send an email to your nominated email address to instruct you how to confirm your registration.

#### 4.2 ‘Contact Us’ Information.

If you send us a “Contact Us” request, whether by submitting an online form that we make available or by sending an email to an email address that we display, you may be required to provide us with certain information, such as your name and email address.

The Services may enable you to invite your friends to use our Services by sending them an invitation email or message. You may do so by: (i) using the Services to send or post an invitation message via your Third Party Account; and/or (ii) using the Services to send an invitation email to your friend’s external email address. If you send or post an invitation message, we may collect Personal Information about the recipient such as their email address or their third party website account user name and id.

#### 4.4 Location Data.

We may provide certain location-based services (“ **Location Services** ”) in connection with the Services that are dependent on data related to the geographic location of your mobile device on which the Software is installed (“ **Location Data** ”).

Some parts of the Services may enable you to build a public profile in connection with your Account (“ **Public Profile** ”). Your Public Profile will include your name and other information that you choose to include in your Public Profile, such as your gender and a profile picture, and you may control which such information will appear on your Public Profile. In some cases, even if you do not create a Public Profile, the applicable Event Organizer (as defined below) may create a public profile for you, based on the information you provided while registering for the Services or event, and publish such public profile amongst other attendees of such event (the “ **Event Community** ”). If you do not want the Event Organizer creating you such public profile and publishing it automatically within the Event Community, opt out by visiting your Account settings.

The Services may include the option to purchase certain products or services from us or from Organizers or other third parties offering products and services through our Services. If you choose to make a purchase we will require sufficient information from you to complete the transaction. Such information could include a credit card number and related account and billing information, invoice related information, and other data required to process the order. We may also update such data should you grant us permission to bill you or your credit card for recurring charges, such as monthly or other types of periodic payments. We may use thetools, software or services of third-party service providers to process transactions on our behalf, in which case you acknowledge and agree to our disclosure and transmission of information required to process the transactions and you agree to review and be bound by the terms of use and privacy policy of said third-party service providers.

#### 4.8 Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies.

Our Services may utilize “cookies”, anonymous identifiers and other tracking technologies in order to for us to provide our Services and present you with information that is customized for you. A “cookie” is a small text file that may be used, for example, to collect information about activity on the Services. Certain cookies and other technologies may serve to recall Personal Information, such as an IP address, previously indicated by a user. Most browsers allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them. You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser.

Such information may include your mobile device type, mobile device id, and date and time stamps of Software use. In addition, we may deploy tracking technologies within the Software to help us gather aggregate statistics.

#### 5\. Publicly Available Information.

Publicly Available Information. Your Public Profile and any publicly available content that you post on or via the Services (“ **User Submissions**  ”) may be publicly available to other users of the Services, and may also be accessed and used by people off the Services. For instance, if you view another user’s profile or ‘like’ a certain event within the Services, such information can be viewed by others. The notices and tools that we provide on the Services should help inform you which information will be made publicly available. If you publish your contact information in any User Submissions or as part of your Public Profile, you may receive unsolicited messages from other users of the Services or the public. We therefore encourage you to only post information that you are sure you want to be accessible to anyone.

If you believe that we might have any such information, please contact us at [support@bizzabo.com.](mailto:support@bizzabo.com)

#### 13\. Security.

The security of Personal Information is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards, including the use of appropriate administrative, physical and technical safeguards, to protect the Personal Information submitted to us. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security or confidentiality. If you have any questions about security on the Service, you can contact us at [support@bizzabo.com.](mailto:support@bizzabo.com)
