##  **BizQuest's Privacy Statement**

This privacy statement covers the website [ http://www.BizQuest.com/](http://www.bizquest.com/ "Franchises for sale on BizQuest"). By accessing, using or registering with BizQuest's web site, you accept and agree to BizQuest's Privacy Policy. BizQuest provides a variety of online services to assist individuals and brokers with buying and selling businesses and franchises. BizQuest values your privacy, feedback and candor very highly. Any user information we collect is considered private and we do not use it or share it except as permitted herein, without the user's permission. We use this personal information at BizQuest to provide the best quality service possible. The following privacy statement summarizes BizQuest's protection and use of any personal information provided by visitors to the BizQuest site. 

This policy does not apply to any public area of BizQuest's web site or services. In the event you submit personally identifiable information to contact another member, contact a lister about a listing, create a listing, add a contact on a listing, the BizQuest Blog or Broker Directory, such information becomes publicly available and BizQuest is not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit to these services, forums, listings, or persons.

**Information Collected by BizQuest:**

BizQuest collects user information from several areas of the BizQuest site including products; business services; the adding and editing of business and franchise listings; the adding and editing of Broker Directory Listings; email forms; the BizQuest Blog; and any surveys or contests that BizQuest may sponsor. BizQuest collects individual user search activity for statistical, archival, and business purposes. BizQuest collects financial information (such as billing address, credit card number, expiration date) for billing payment and credit card authorization purposes. BizQuest may track the IP address of a user's computer or place a "cookie" in the browser files of a user's computer. This is required by BizQuest services to provide automated features.

**Use of Information Collected:**

Collected information helps BizQuest better understand its users' needs in order to improve its product and service offerings. Email addresses are used to communicate with members through the BizQuest Buyer, Broker and Franchise Newsletters (weekly or bi-weekly email news summaries); Promotional emails; Partner emails and for site administration purposes. Users may be deleted from Newsletters, Promotional email and Partner email lists at their request. Personal information may be used to contact users for the purpose of research, product development, marketing, or customer service, if the user has opted to receive such communication. User search activity is collected and analyzed and may be utilized by BizQuest in the aggregate or in the abstract for a variety of business purposes. Financial information is used to bill users for products and services purchased. Within BizQuest, only accounting managers have access to the credit card account information. This information is not shared with anyone outside of BizQuest. IP address and cookie log data is analyzed to better understand traffic flows and user preferences.

**Use of Email Tools:**

You may NOT use the Email the Broker, Email a Listing service or other email services that we offer to send spam (i.e. unsolicited commercial email) or otherwise send content that would violate BizQuest's Terms and Conditions. We may monitor, track or save the use of this feature, but will be under no obligation to monitor, track or save these email messages sent from these tools. If you send an email using the Email a Listing to a Friend service to an email address that is not registered in our system, we do not use that email address for any purpose other than to send your email, and for us to automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. BizQuest stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and for tracking the success of our referral program. We also do not rent or sell these email addresses of un-registered users.

**Shared information:**

Though BizQuest makes every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web site. 

BizQuest shares member information in the following areas on the site: Business and Franchise Listing Service, Saved Search Email Alerts, BizQuest Blog and the Broker Directory. When a member enters a business or franchise listing in the Listing Service, listing contact information is also entered. In addition, members searching BizQuest can view contact information when they view a listing profile. BizQuest allows users to share contact information with one another via its Saved Search Email Alert service. With Saved Searches users can save their business search criteria to have information about businesses that match the specified criteria emailed to them. When selecting this service, users are given the option of releasing their contact information to other users who have business listings that match their criteria. This contact information is then shared with the users who have business listings that match the buying or leasing criteria. Unless required by law as detailed in this section or a user specifically takes action as discussed in this paragraph, BizQuest does not share individual user search activity information and such activity information remains private to the individual user and to BizQuest. Broker Members agree to share their contact information and allow all BizQuest users to view their contact information via the BizQuest Business Broker Directory or via links made available to users on a listing or in an email. BizQuest users who do not opt out of the Broker Directory service during registration with BizQuest (or anytime thereafter) also agree to share their contact information via the BizQuest Broker Directory. 

BizQuest shares information with its partners for the purpose of providing related services in which we deem our users have interest. The use that BizQuest's partners make of customer information will not exceed BizQuest's use of the data. Key billing information (such as credit card number, expiration date and dollar amount) gathered from users making online purchases of products or services is shared with PayPal, our credit card processing partner, in order to authorize charges to the credit card. BizQuest also uses third party providers to perform email and postal mailings on behalf of BizQuest, but this information (such as name, address and email) is confidential and is not used by the provider for any other purpose. 

BizQuest does not rent or lease user information to any third party, except as disclosed here. From time to time, BizQuest may obtain information (such as electronic mail addresses) from third party providers. It is our goal to only contact individuals who we believe may have a legitimate business interest in BizQuest based on their membership or participation in other organizations or web sites, and who have indicated a willingness to be contacted for this purpose. While BizQuest endeavors to work with other sites and companies with a similar respect for user privacy, BizQuest cannot be responsible for the privacy practices of other sites. 

Please be aware that in the event BizQuest merges with a third party, or in the event all or substantially all of BizQuest's assets are acquired by a third party, customer information, including personally identifiable information, will be shared and/or transferred to such third party. The information may only be used or shared by such third parties for the primary purpose for which the information was originally collected. If such third parties, or if BizQuest for its own business needs, desire to use the personally identifiable information for another purpose, you will be notified prior to the information being used for a new purpose, and you will have the opportunity to opt out of such new use of your personally identifiable information.

**Security of personal information:**

BizQuest's clients and their personal information are considered to be BizQuest's greatest asset and thus their privacy is treated with the utmost regard and respect. BizQuest takes every reasonable precaution to secure personal information within both its computers and its physical premises. 

The security of your personal information is important to BizQuest. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). [To learn more about SSL, follow this link [http://www.verisign.com](http://www.verisign.com/ "VeriSign")]. 

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
