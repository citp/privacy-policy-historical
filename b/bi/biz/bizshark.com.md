BizShark uses cookies to help deliver a personalized user experience. We may collect IP addresses, date/time stamp, referring/exit pages, and other traffic data for aggregated system analysis. We do not collect any personally identifiable information from our visitors.

2\. Collection of Premium Member Information

When BizShark premium members sign up for a subscription, they must enter a valid credit card and/or other payment information needed to process their payments.

We use this information to process registrations, maintain premium accounts, send important account notifications, and complement our services. All member information is kept private and secure.
