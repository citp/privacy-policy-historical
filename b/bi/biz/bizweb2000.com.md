" I LOVE your new CD!! I can't tell you how delighted I was to FINALLY receive your product and see that, unlike some, it offered what your sales letter promised... and more. I now believe I'm going to set up a business on the internet after being overwhelmed with how to info products for the past couple of years."

"I viewed the ezWebBusinessBuilder CD yesterday and find it is excellent. It was laid out in such a way that each demonstration is the next logical step to follow."

"The whole program is like someone gently holding your hand and leading you down a path that leads you to your goal. Before receiving this program the whole subject of getting starting scared me to the point that I didn't want to do anything. Questions like where to start, do I do this first or last, and so forth are all sorted out in a understandable way using this CD."

I have had a good look through your new CD and it is brilliant. It's the best I have seen to date and I have seen a lot of web site building programs. This is the easiest to follow, in fact a no-brainer. I am building a new website and I will be promoting your CD. I am also advertising it already on the web site that came with the package. Well done."

**Hi Jim,

"I got my ezwebbusinessbuilder disc today and I've been reviewing it all day. I have to say all credit to you, Jim. I've never seen anything like this, it's absolutely amazing. If somebody can't get their business going with this there would have to be something wrong with them."

"It's packed with so much information that a lot of us just take for granted and presented in such an easy to assimilate manner that anyone can do this now."

"Well done, I'll be recommending it to my readers and putting together a marketing campaign for it right away."

"Jim, I haven't even implemented anything yet, but wanted to let you know that this CD is unbelievable. I am excited even though I have no idea what I could sell yet! I definitely want to promote this CD for commissions though - it is truly unreal."

**"We received your CD and have used quite a bit of it. The way you have put it together makes it so easy to use. We really like how after each lesson, it connects to the Internet to so we can perform the tasks. Everything is laid out step-by-step and extremely easy to understand. If you can't get a web site up using this CD then you just can't do it. Thanks Jim for a great CD!" A++++
