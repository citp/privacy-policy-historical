## BizFilings Privacy Policy 

**BizFilings respects the privacy of the users of our services and Web site. To that effect, we have instituted the following Privacy Policy:**

**Collection of Information**   
To effectively process your order, BizFilings needs to know some standard information, such as your name, e-mail address, mailing address, credit card number and telephone number. For the purpose of forming your corporation or limited liability company (LLC) we need to know the following information: the name you want your business entity to have, a brief description of the purpose of your business, the name and address of the corporation or LLC’s registered agent, the name and address of the directors and officers of your corporation or members or managers for an LLC, how many shares of stock your corporation will be authorized to issue and the par value of such stock.

It is our policy that the information you provide is private and confidential. All order information is encrypted with secure server software to protect it from unauthorized access. Your credit card information and password for accessing the Online Corporate Status Center remain encrypted within our database and we have appropriate security measures in place in our physical facilities to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information that we have collected from you at our site. Additionally, we do not sell, rent or trade your personally identifiable information.

**Updates**   
BizFilings may occasionally notify you of new services and special offers via periodic mailings or email updates. For all email-based marketing communications BizFilings utilizes a double opt-in policy in which individuals must explicitly request our e-newsletter and email-based promotions and then respond to a confirmation email to receive them. If you are receiving these materials and would like to be removed from our list, please send an email to [marketing@bizfilings.com](mailto:marketing@bizfilings.com).

**Personally Identifiable Information**   
Our computer is not set up to track, collect or distribute personal information about our web site visitors. It does recognize the home server of visitors, but not email addresses. For example, we can tell which Internet Service Provider our visitors use, but not the names, addresses or other information about our visitors that would allow us to identify the particular visitors to our site. Cookies are used to store visitor preferences and improve the content of our site. When visitors type information into our online order form, but do not complete the order process, that information is temporarily stored in our database.

Solely for the purposes of confirming valid traffic from certain pay per click search engines, IP addresses for these visitors are monitored, and may be compared to the records of that search engine.

In addition, our Web site tracks information about the visits to our Web site. For example, we compile statistics that show the daily number of visitors to our site, the daily requests we receive for particular files on our Web site, and from which countries those requests come. These aggregated statistics are used internally to better provide services to the public and may also be provided to others, but again, the statistics contain no personal information and cannot be used to gather such information.

Customers may prevent their information from being used for purposes other than those for which it was originally collected by e-mailing us at [marketing@bizfilings.com](mailto:marketing@bizfilings.com).

Upon request we will provide customers with access to their own records. Customers can access and correct this information by e-mailing us at [info@bizfilings.com](mailto:info@bizfilings.com) or calling us at (800) 981-7183.

If you feel that this site is not following its stated information policy, you may contact us at the above addresses or phone number.
