			<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Privacy Policy Statement</strong></p>
<p><strong>EFFECTIVE DATE</strong><strong>:  June 16, 2008</strong></p>
<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
<p>B-Stock Solutions, Inc.  (“B-Stock,” “us” or “we”) has created this Privacy Policy to explain how the information (“PII”) that you provide through your use of this website located at <a href="/">bstocksolutions.com</a> (the “Site”) is protected, collected and used.</p>

<p>“You” or “your” means the individual using the Site and the entity which such individual represents.  By using the Site, you consent to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>INFORMATION THAT WE COLLECT</strong></p>
<p><strong>Generally.</strong> If you submit a seller inquiry or buyer registration, we collect minimal personally identifiable information (“PII”) and related information from you, including without limitation, your first and last name, the name of the entity which you represent (if applicable), your email address, your phone number.</p>
<p>We do not, however, knowingly collect PII from children under the age of thirteen.</p>
<p>When you visit our Site, we automatically collect non PII such as IP addresses and web site usage information from you.</p>

<p><strong>Cookies</strong>. We may use cookies and other technologies to collect information Cookies are small bits of information that our Site places on the hard drive of your computer.

However, by blocking all cookies you may not have access to certain features on our Site.</p>
<p><strong>HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p><strong>Generally:</strong> We may use information in the following ways: (1) for the purposes for which you specifically provided it including, without limitation, to enable us to contact you to discuss our services; (2) to send you information about your relationship or transactions with us; (3) to notify you about the future launch of auction sites for our corporate customers; (4) to otherwise contact you with information that we believe will be of interest to you; (5) to enhance or develop features, products and services.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing your Information:</strong> Except as set forth herein, or if we inform you otherwise at the time of data collection, we will not share your PII with other parties.</p>
<p><strong>B-Stock</strong>: B-Stock is hosting the Site and will have access to your information.  B-Stock may use your information for its own business purposes and share such information in all manners permitted hereunder.</p>
<p><strong>Service Providers</strong>: B-Stock may use other companies to perform services including, without limitation, facilitating some aspects of the Site, sending e-mail, and calling potential customers inquiring about our services. These other companies may be supplied with or have access to your PII solely for the purpose of providing these services to us or on our behalf.</p>

<p><strong>Special Circumstances</strong>: There may be instances when B-Stock may disclose PII without providing you with a choice in order to protect our legal rights or those of any of our affiliates, employees, agents and contractors; to protect the safety and security of visitors to our Site; to protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; or to comply with the law or legal process. In addition, if B-Stock sells all or part of its business or makes a sale or transfer of assets or is otherwise involved in a merger or business transfer, or in the unlikely event of a bankruptcy, we may transfer your PII to a third party as part of that transaction.</p>

If we make revisions that change the way we collect or use your PII, those changes will be posted in this Privacy Policy and the effective date will be noted at the beginning of the Policy. Therefore, you should review it periodically so that you are up to date on our most current policies and practices. If we make material changes to our practices regarding use of your PII, your PII will continue to be governed by the Privacy Policy under which it was subject prior to those changes, unless you have been provided notice of, and have not objected to, the changes.</p>
