Privacy Policy</h1>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Your privacy is critically
important to us.<br>
At GLO-BUS Software, Inc. we have a few fundamental
principles:</h2>
<br>
<ul>
<li>We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need
it.</li>
<li>We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to
comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our
rights.</li>
<li>We don’t store personal information on our servers unless
required for the on-going operation of one of our services.</li>
</ul>
<p>Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals:</p>
<p>If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal
data please <a href="https://www.bsg-online.com/feedback.html">contact our support
team</a>.</p>
<p>GLO-BUS Software, Inc. operates several websites including
bsg-online.com and glo-bus.com. It is GLO-BUS Software, Inc.’s
policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may
collect while operating our websites.</p>
<h3>Website Visitors</h3>
<p>Like most website operators, GLO-BUS Software, Inc. collects
non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web
browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser
type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of
each visitor request. GLO-BUS Software, Inc.’s purpose in
collecting non-personally identifying information is to better
understand how GLO-BUS Software, Inc.’s visitors use its website.
From time to time, GLO-BUS Software, Inc. may release
non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by
publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
<p>GLO-BUS Software, Inc. also collects potentially
personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP)
addresses for logged in users and for users.</p>
<h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
<p>Certain visitors to GLO-BUS Software, Inc.’s websites choose to
interact with GLO-BUS Software, Inc. in ways that require GLO-BUS
Software, Inc. to gather personally-identifying information. The
amount and type of information that GLO-BUS Software, Inc. gathers
depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask
visitors who sign up for an account at https://www.bsg-online.com/
to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in
transactions with GLO-BUS Software, Inc. – by purchasing access to
the <em>The Business Strategy Game</em> service, for example – are
asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the
personal and financial information required to process those
transactions. In each case, GLO-BUS Software, Inc. collects such
information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill
the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with GLO-BUS Software,
Inc. GLO-BUS Software, Inc. does not disclose
personally-identifying information other than as described below.
And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying
information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging
in certain website-related activities.</p>
<h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>
<p>GLO-BUS Software, Inc. may collect statistics about the behavior
of visitors to its websites. For instance, GLO-BUS Software, Inc.
may monitor the IP geolocation of logged-in users to help prevent
fraudulent access. GLO-BUS Software, Inc. may display this
information publicly or provide it to others. However, GLO-BUS
Software, Inc. does not disclose personally-identifying information
other than as described below.</p>
<h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
<p>GLO-BUS Software, Inc. discloses potentially
personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only
to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations
that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on
GLO-BUS Software, Inc.’s behalf or to provide services available at
GLO-BUS Software, Inc.’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to
disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and
affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home
country; by using GLO-BUS Software, Inc.’s websites, you consent to
the transfer of such information to them. GLO-BUS Software, Inc.
will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and
personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its
employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described
above, GLO-BUS Software, Inc. discloses potentially
personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only
in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental
request, or when GLO-BUS Software, Inc. believes in good faith that
disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or
rights of GLO-BUS Software, Inc., third parties or the public at
large. If you are a registered user of an GLO-BUS Software, Inc.
website and have supplied your email address, GLO-BUS Software,
Inc. may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new
features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with
what’s going on with GLO-BUS Software, Inc. and our products. We
expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a
request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback
mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us
clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other
users. GLO-BUS Software, Inc. takes all measures reasonably
necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use,
alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and
personally-identifying information.</p>

to refuse cookies before using GLO-BUS Software, Inc.’s websites,
with the drawback that certain features of GLO-BUS Software, Inc.’s

<h3>Business Transfers</h3>
<p>If GLO-BUS Software, Inc., or substantially all of its assets,
were acquired, or in the unlikely event that GLO-BUS Software, Inc.
goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would
be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third
party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any
