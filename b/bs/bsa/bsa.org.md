In addition, we may collect data about participation in trade shows, policy events, and conferences, as well as credentials and associations of such individuals from both online and offline sources, including from the individuals directly. To the extent a transaction or reimbursement is involved, we may also collect necessary information for payments (e.g., credit card information, bank account information, personal identity card information) (“ **Payment Data** ”). In addition to the General Uses, we use this data to promote BSA membership, service existing BSA members, process membership, provide access to BSA resources, host and sponsor events, disseminate materials related to our advocacy, to advance our advocacy with such contacts, provide invitations to and facilitate events, and interact with current and prospective members, and government, media and policy contacts.

We may also collect certain background check information, including government identification numbers, criminal background, associated companies, and other information (all to the extent permitted under applicable law) from the individual and from third parties (“ **Background Check Information** ”). We use this information to consider individuals for employment and contractor opportunities, address compliance and legal obligations, and manage on-boarding procedures.
  

  * **Software Copyright Infringement Reporting Contacts:** We collect Contact Data and Registration Data from individuals where they provide it in the context of their reporting of alleged instances of noncompliance with the intellectual property rights of our members.

We do not use automated decision-making without human intervention, including profiling, in a way that produces legal effects concerning individuals (e.g., not offering an employment opportunity) or that otherwise significantly affects individuals.

Some jurisdictions require an explanation of the legal basis for the collection and processing of Personal Data. We have several different legal grounds on which we collect and process Personal Data, including: (a) as necessary to perform a transaction (such as when we respond to your requests); (b) as necessary to comply with a legal obligation (such as when we use Personal Data for record keeping to substantiate tax liability); (c) consent (where you have provided consent as appropriate under applicable law); and (d) as necessary for legitimate interests (such as when we act to maintain our business generally or to pursue our rights or the rights of our members).
