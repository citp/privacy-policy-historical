# Business Software Alliance

The Business Software Alliance (BSA) believes that addressing consumer concerns about privacy online is critical. To this end, BSA promises to protect the personal information given to us by visitors to BSA's website and information included on our electronic mail lists. Any information that you give to BSA will be held with the utmost care, and will not be used in ways that you have not consented to. A more detailed explanation about how we care for your personal information follows. 

**COLLECTION AND USE OF INFORMATION:**

_Voluntary E-Mail Lists_ : Visitors to the BSA website are invited to sign up to receive news about breaking events which may be of interest to them. To do this, visitors are asked to provide their name and employment details, together with certain contact information. We do not sell, rent, loan, trade, or lease the personal information on our list to anyone. In addition, we configure our list server software to refuse to divulge the personal information on our list to anyone but us. The information is not, for example, available to other subscribers. Details on how to correct, change or remove subscription information from our email lists are provided in the text of each email distribution to the subscriber. 

_GASP Software:_ BSA, with the co-operation of Attest Systems, Inc., offers a version of GASP® software to our users. The version available for download includes most of the functions of the full release of GASP®, but is restricted to the audit and processing of 100 PCs for 60 days. The personal information volunteered by visitors to our website to download GASP software will be transferred to Attest who will use the personal information for a number of purposes, including the identification of users, direct marketing and online transactions. Other than for the purpose of transferring the information to Attest, BSA does not collect, use or store any personal information given by users downloading GASP software. For information about Attest's privacy practices, please go to [http://www.attest.com](http://www.attest.com/). 

_Piracy reporting:_ Visitors to our website are invited to report possible incidents of software piracy to BSA through electronic mail and our online reporting system. We use this information to investigate such claims and, if necessary, to bring legal and other enforcement action. 

_Browser information collected on the website:_ As with many website operators, BSA analyses our website logs to constantly improve the value of our website to our visitors. We use an external service to provide real-time reporting to us and our authorized agents of browser accesses to our site. This includes page views, unique views, unique visitors, repeat visitors, frequency of visits, and peak-volume traffic periods. In our use of this service, we do not gather, request, record, require, collect, or track any Internet users' personally identifiable information. 

_Use of cookies:_ We use cookies on our website to provide each visitor with a unique aesthetic experience. Cookies are small data files that are downloaded onto your computer when you visit our site and that automatically identify your browser to our server whenever you interact with our site. We do not link the cookies to any personally identifiable information. We do not use cookies to track your travels through the site and we do not share cookies with any other site. If you prefer not to allow us to collect cookie information, you can block cookies with your browser as described below. 

By modifying your browser preferences, you have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is sent, or to reject all cookies. For more information on how to modify your browser settings to block or filter cookies, see [ http://www.cookiecentral.com/faq/](http://www.cookiecentral.com/faq/). However, please note that if you reject some or all cookies, your experience at our sites and on other sites throughout the World Wide Web may not be complete. In addition, if you do not allow cookies, you will not be able to take advantage of personalized content delivery offered by other Internet sites or by us. 

_Other uses of your personal information:_ In addition to using information about you for the specific purposes set out above, from time to time we may also use your personal information to send you news about our organization and promotional materials about BSA initiatives, provided that you have not opted out of receiving such information as described below. 

**DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION:**

_Resale or disclosure of information to third parties:_ BSA does not sell, rent, loan, trade, or lease personal information collected on our website or included on our e-mail lists to any third party. When BSA employs subcontractors that may have access to personal information, they are bound by a confidentiality agreement to ensure that they exercise the same level of care when handling your personal information as we do. 

_Privacy of piracy reporting:_ Individuals often report incidents of software piracy to BSA through electronic mail and our online reporting system. Except where the personal information provided to us for this purpose is disclosed to BSA's legal counsel for legal and other enforcement purposes, the information is not disclosed to any third parties without the prior authorization of the person providing the information or unless otherwise required by applicable law. We use strong encryption technology to ensure that this information is protected in transit. 

**DATA SECURITY:**

BSA uses strong encryption technology to protect personal information collected on our server. This does not include the personal information submitted to Attest during the GASP Software registration process. The information that is submitted during this process is transmitted directly to Attest servers. For more information about the GASP Software registration process, see the above section of this privacy policy. 

We take strong precautions to protect your data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration, or destruction. When BSA employs subcontractors that may have access to personal information, they are bound by a confidentiality agreement to ensure that they exercise the same level of care when handling your personal information as we do. 

**DATA QUALITY AND ACCESS:**

BSA provides you with the opportunity to know about the information that BSA holds about you, together with the ability to correct, amend or delete, as appropriate, any such information that is incomplete or inaccurate. Should you wish to exercise any of these options or should you have any questions or concerns about information that BSA has collected in relation to you, please feel free to contact us by sending a message to [webmaster@bsa.org](mailto:webmaster@bsa.org). Specific details on how to correct, change or remove subscription information from our e-mail lists are provided in the text of each e-mail distribution to the consumer. These rights do not apply in relation to information submitted to Attest during the GASP Software registration process, because BSA only transfers such information to Attest, and does not otherwise collect, use or store the information. 

**OPT-OUT:**

Although most visitors to the BSA website indicate that they welcome details of BSA initiatives, educational efforts and other BSA materials, we acknowledge that individuals should have the right to choose. You will be given the right to opt out of receiving BSA information whenever you are asked to provide personal information on this site. If you do not opt out immediately, but later decide that you do not wish to receive future BSA communications, you can notify us of this as set out below. This right to opt out does not apply in relation to information submitted to Attest during the GASP Software registration process, as BSA only transfers the information to Attest and does not otherwise collect, use or store it. 

**ENFORCEMENT:**

If for any reason you believe that BSA has not adhered to these privacy principles, please notify us by e-mail at [webmaster@bsa.org](mailto:webmaster@bsa.org), and we will endeavour to review and correct the problem promptly. Please use the words "Privacy Policy" in the Subject line. 

**EXTERNAL LINKS:**

This website provides links to various websites that BSA does not control. When you click on one of these links, you will be transferred out of our website and connected to the website of the organization or company that you selected. Even if an affiliation exists between our website and a third party website, we exercise no control over linked sites. Each of these linked sites maintains its own independent privacy and data collection practices and procedures. If you visit a website that is linked to our site, you should consult that site's privacy policy before providing any personal information. 

**CHILDREN'S PRIVACY:**

Because we care about the safety and privacy of children online, we comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA). COPPA and its accompanying FTC regulation establish United States federal law that protects the privacy of children under 13. Our site is not intended to solicit information of any kind from children under 13, and we have designed our sites to block our knowing acceptance of information from children under 13 whenever age-related information is requested. 

It is possible that due to fraud or deception by others, we may unknowingly receive information pertaining to children under 13. If we are notified of this, once we have verified the information, we will promptly obtain parental consent or otherwise delete the information from our servers. If you want to notify us of our receipt of information in relation to children under 13, please do so by emailing us at [webmaster@bsa.org ](mailto:webmaster@bsa.org). 

**INTERNATIONAL INFORMATION TRANSFERS**

Any personally identifiable information that you provide to BSA will be collected directly on servers located in the United States and maintained on servers located in the United States or other countries. If you are located outside the United States, this means that any information you provide will be transferred abroad. While BSA is committed to providing your information with the highest level of privacy protection, we believe you should know that the general level of protection for personal information in the United States may not be the same as that provided in other countries, including those that belong to the European Economic Area. 

**TERMS AND MODIFICATIONS TO PRIVACY POLICY:**

By using this website, you signify your agreement to the terms of our privacy policy. If you do not agree with these terms, please do not disclose any personal information through this site. 

BSA may modify this privacy policy at any time at its discretion and modifications are effective upon being posted on this site. You are responsible for reviewing this privacy policy periodically to ensure that you are aware of any changes to it. 

**CONTACTING BSA ON PRIVACY:**

If you have any questions or concerns regarding privacy on the BSA network of websites, please contact the Webmaster at [webmaster@bsa.org](mailto:webmaster@bsa.org).
