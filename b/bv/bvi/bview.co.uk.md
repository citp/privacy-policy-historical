BView is registered under the Data Protection Act, registration number Z1261666.

This Privacy policy outlines what we will and will not do with your personal information, and was last updated on 16th February, 2009. When we refer to personal information we mean information that refers to you personally, such as your name, postal address, email address or telephone number.

Please read this Privacy policy. If you register with us, or use the Site, you confirm that you agree to be subject to this Privacy policy. If you do not agree with this Privacy policy, please do not register with us or use the Site. 

The purpose of BView is to provide, via our Site, an interactive community of businesses and their customers (or 'Community') in order to improve the way that our Community members do business. We work hard to find the best sources of reliable information about businesses so that you can make the best decisions possible.

You can find, add, promote and share information about businesses that you own or manage, or businesses and people that you have dealings with. You can also build new networks of people and businesses within the Community.

  


##### 2\. Personal information we collect

In order for us to provide services to you through the Site, you must register and provide personal information to us. We store your personal information on our servers. All of our servers are located inside the United Kingdom.

We strive to minimise the amount of 'required' personal information that you need to provide us across our Site, but if you do not want to provide us with certain personal information, it may not be possible for us to provide all aspects of our services to you.

Your full name will be used when you send out invitations, notifications of reviews and follower notifications to any third parties. This helps our Community to engage with you.

We will also use your email address to send you updates on actions on the system, such as (but not limited to) when your business is reviewed, when someone follows you, or when you register with us. We also use your email address when a Community member wishes to message you via the Site. We never disclose your email address to others.

Information that you post on the Site may also contain personal information.
