### Why we collect personal information

XPmedia.com collects and discloses personal information about a variety of individuals, including subscribers, employees, volunteers, teachers, intercessors and ministers primarily in order to build relationship with these individuals through email transmissions.

### Subscribers

In voluntarily subscribing for newsletters, product specials, event registrations, or platinum membership, whether by mail or on the internet, subscribers provide basic contact information to us, and sometimes credit card or other payment information. We use that information to keep you informed of updates, provide the material or product to you, to process payment, to track your utilization of our resources and to recommend other products or services that we believe may be of interest to you.

XPmedia.com also purchases email lists containing subscriber contact information from marketing sources. These names and contact information are added to our database.

### Employees/Volunteers

With respect to employees and volunteers, we collect personal information in order to manage and supervise the employment or volunteer relationship between our organization and the individual. The information is not utilized for any other purpose without your consent.

### Teachers, Intercessors and Ministers

In the case of our teachers, intercessors and ministers, personal information is collected with consent in order to verify qualifications, match participants with appropriate programs and enable the proper use of XPMedia.com  resources in fulfilling our mandate and operational goals.

### The kinds of information we collect

XPmedia.com collects widely varying types of personal information, depending on the circumstances. What we collect depends on the particular purpose for collection and the particular circumstances involved. For example, employee information includes certain medical and health information. Teachers, intercessors and ministers provide us with more detailed background information. Subscribers voluntarily supply us with name, address, phone number and email particulars.

### How we obtain the personal information

Most of the personal information collected by XPmedia.com is collected directly by our representatives from either subscribers, employees, volunteers, teachers, intercessors and ministers along with subscriber information obtained form marketing companies.

In many cases, the consent of the individual providing information to us is inferred from the circumstances in which the information is provided. On occasion, as with compilation of subscriber information, we rely on specific subscriber consent or provide the individual with an opportunity to “opt out” of participation in certain programs.

### Disclosure of personal information

Disclosure of subscriber information is generally restricted to our own purposes, and disclosure outside the organization is usually limited to those circumstances where consent has been provided although we reserve the right to disclose or sell subscriber information when the corporation determines necessary. With respect to employee and volunteer information, XPmedia.com may from time to time disclose that information to affiliated organizations or to third party service providers. In all cases, disclosure may be made to legal counsel and other consultants and agents, to government authorities and otherwise as permitted or required by law.

Electronically recorded information is stored on computer systems maintained by us and our affiliated organizations or service providers. Those computer systems and the information stored in them are protected by electronic security systems. We restrict access to personal information to only those employees or volunteers who have a legitimate purpose in doing so. Employees who routinely handle personal information receive training with respect to proper personal information handling practices and they are under an obligation to comply with all privacy laws, this policy and any related codes of conduct.
