	This Privacy Policy was last updated on October 15, 2003.<br><br>
	XpressBet ("MEC") respects your individual privacy. This privacy policy (the "Privacy Policy") embodies our commitment to its protection through adherence to fair electronic information practices. This Privacy Policy puts You in control of how your personal information is processed. You have our promise that we will not electronically process your personal information in any way that is incompatible with this Privacy Policy.<br><br>
<b>
	COLLECTION AND USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</b>
<br><br>
	We use information about You for purposes of monitoring and improving our internal operations, as well as to ensure we (i) bill You properly, (ii) administer your Account in accordance with your agreements with us, (iii) properly perform the services You have requested, and (iv) comply with applicable state and federal laws and regulations. We also use the information we collect to monitor and improve our internal operations, as well as to improve the experience of users in our network of web sites. For example, we may correlate Web Site traffic information with data about individual users. This data helps us to determine how much our customers use parts of this Web Site, allowing us to enhance it to fit the needs of as many of our customers as possible. We may also break down overall usage statistics according to customers' domain names, browser types, and MIME types by reading this information from the browser string (information contained in every user's browser). MEC owns and operates this Web Site. MEC does not collect personal information about You except when You provide it to MEC on a voluntary basis. 	Personal information is collected from You at this Web Site when You complete a survey, request to be notified or request information, products or services. The personal information collected by MEC includes your name, address, e-mail address, profile data and other demographic information (including your zip code, age, gender or income level). Your contact information is used to contact You when necessary. It is also used to identify what future products or services You may require. All information remains within MEC and its affiliates and is not sold to other companies. We use the information we collect to direct important notices and information affecting your Account or services on this Web Site as well as to provide general information that may be of interest to You which may include newsletters, surveys, contest announcements, and information about our service or product offerings or the offerings of our business affiliates. You may opt-out of receiving information from us simply by notifying us by writing to the Director of Operations, 200 Race Track Road, Building 26, Washington, PA 15301 or by e-mailing us at 	<a href="mailto:customerservice@xpressbet.com">customerservice@xpressbet.com</a> 
	or in accordance with the opt-out instructions contained in any information message You receive from us. Note, however, that in order to fulfill our service obligations to You, we must continue sending You notices and other important information affecting your Account or services. MEC reserves the right to provide Your personal information to a company or individual employed by MEC to perform functions on its behalf, to another company or person for the development, enhancement, marketing or provision of MEC's products or services, to an agent or third party retained by MEC in connection with MEC'S administration or the provision of MEC's products or services or an agent used by MEC to evaluate Your creditworthiness or to collect Your Account. If MEC provides Your personal information to a third party then that third party will be subject to the highest level of confidentiality with respect to Your personal information. We destroy customer information that is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it is collected unless there is a legitimate request or order to inspect the information still outstanding or the information remains in routine records that are periodically discarded under our document retention policies.	The information You have provided us is maintained in our management information system and billing systems, and is updated as new information is added. Accounting and billing records are retained for ten years for tax and accounting purposes or until the relevant income tax years for which the document was created have been closed for income tax purposes and/or all appeals have been exhausted. Records may remain on file even after You have terminated Your Account. Subject to applicable law, we may also keep records to facilitate collection and to evaluate credit worthiness. A "cookie" is a small data file that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies do not damage your system or impair its functioning in any way. 	MEC uses cookies to tailor and enhance your experience at this Web Site, to show You content that You might be interested in, and to display the content according to your preferences. Cookies do not contain any personal identifying information and only contain information such as a user ID that a web site uses to track the pages You have visited. The only personal information a cookie can contain is information You supply yourself. A cookie cannot read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other web sites. We use cookies to track users traffic patterns when You make any requests for MEC services. When You make your request, we may use a cookie to store a unique, random user ID. We use this ID to identify You anonymously in our database and to track the pages You visit on this Web Site. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to allow your browser to show You when a cookie is sent.<br><br>
