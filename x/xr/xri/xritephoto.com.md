### INFORMATION GATHERING AND USAGE

**Your personal data**

We intend to give you as much control as reasonably possible over your personal data. In general, you can visit our Site without revealing your personal data. This includes information which can be used to identify you, such as your name, email address, telephone numbers, postal address, credit card information, job function, industry, product application, contact preferences or experience with our products.

There are times, however, when we may need information from you in order to best service your needs. If you wish to order or request products, services, or information from us through the Site, including registering for various services that may be available, you may be required to share certain personal data with us so that we can process your order or request. We also may use this personal data for other business purposes, such as to invite you to participate in surveys or notify you about special promotions for our products. We generally collect this information at the time of registering to use our Site, subscribing to our services, posting materials, or requesting further services.

We also collect other information that is not linked to your personal data such as your Internet Protocol ("IP") address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Site.

**Information sharing**

We may share the personal data that you provide to us among our affiliates, partner companies and organizations that are responsible in whole or in part for processing or fulfilling your order or request, marketing our products, and to any successor to our business.

We will not otherwise use, share, disseminate, publish or disclose your personal data (except as may reasonably be required in response to litigation, investigations or other legally required disclosures).

**Links to third-party websites**

Our Site may contain links to other websites of interest. However, once you have used these links to leave our Site, you should note that we do not have any control over that other website. Therefore, we cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of any information which you provide whilst visiting such websites as these websites are not governed by this Privacy Policy. You should always be sure to exercise caution and read the privacy policy applicable to the website in question.

**Message boards/forums**

This Site may make forums and message boards available to you. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information. You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal data.

**Electronic newsletters**

We offer various free electronic newsletters. We do not spam, never sell or rent email addresses, and there's an easy unsubscribe in every email you'll receive.

**Contests**

We sometimes offer contests on our Site. Participation in these contests requires that you provide us with certain personal data. At a minimum, the required information includes name and email address. In some cases, the entrant must answer mandatory survey questions about a range of technical interests and personal data. The information gathered in the entry form is used to verify the entrant's identity and eligibility, to contact winners or prize recipients, and to market and sell our products. As the rules and terms of each contest can vary, all information pertaining to a specific contest is clearly posted on our Site during the event.

**Forward to a friend feature**

If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our Site, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address. Your email address will appear as the sender of the email and we will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the Site. Both your email address and the recipient's email address will not be used for any other purpose except to facilitate the sending of this one-time email to your friend.

**Log files**

Like most standard websites, we use log files to automatically log information such as IP addresses, browser type, internet service provider ("ISP"), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks. We log this information to manage traffic loads, identify the content most commonly accessed and determine information technology requirements for providing reliable service, or other web management, deployment, tracking, maintenance and similar activities. We do not use this information to identify you.

**Where we store your personal data**

We may transfer your personal data to, or store it at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who works for us, for our affiliates, or for one of our suppliers. Our staff may be engaged in, among other things, the provision of services, fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the delivery of support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storage, or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy including: (i) diligently choosing third party service providers, and (ii) requiring, via appropriate contract or otherwise, that any third party service providers or affiliates maintain adequate technical and organizational security measures to safeguard your personal information, and to process personal information only as instructed by us in accordance with applicable law and for no other purposes. Such protections of cross-border transfers of personal information will be based on a mechanism approved by the European Commission as providing adequate protection. From time to time, this may include, where valid and appropriate, certification to US/EU Safe Harbor Privacy Principles published by the US Department of Commerce or an equivalent, succeeding bi-lateral agreement between the US and the European Union that ensures an equivalent level of data protection in the US ("Safe Harbor" or equivalent), or a data transfer agreement based on the EU Commission standard contractual clauses for the transfer of data to third countries.
