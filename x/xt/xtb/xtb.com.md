personal data.
Please read this privacy policy carefully. It is the stated policy of XTB that we will act in accordance
with current legislation and aim to meet current best practice with regard to the processing of

We understand the importance of maintaining the privacy of your personal information. By
entrusting us with your information, we would like to assure you of our commitment to keeping it
private. We have taken measurable steps to protect the confidentiality, security and integrity of your

If you decide to apply to open an account with us, there is certain information that we will require
from you in order to do so. This information includes, but is not limited to personal details such as
name, address, date of birth, contact details, employment details, assets and liabilities, payment
details, including credit card, debit card and bank account details, and other necessary financial
information. From time to time we may also request further information to help us improve our
service to you. We obtain most of the information directly from you through application or other
forms, and from maintaining records of information provided in the course of ongoing customer
service. We may also collect information about your use of the website, such as pages visited,
frequency and duration and visit and trading activities.
We will use information collected from you to provide the information and services requested by you
and to improve the quality of our service. Unless you are informed otherwise, the personal
information we hold is used for establishing and managing your account, reviewing your ongoing
needs, enhancing customer service and products, giving you ongoing information or opportunities
that we believe may be relevant to you.
We limit access of your data to only those employees or partners that need to know the information
in order to assist in carrying out your request for products or services. We have procedures in place
regarding how to safeguard and use non public personal information.
Depending on the product or service concerned and particular restrictions on sensitive information,
this means that personal information may be disclosed to: service providers and specialist advisers to
us who have been contracted to provide us with administrative, financial, research or other services;
referring parties and introducing partners with whom we have a mutual relationship; courts, tribunals
and regulatory authorities as agreed or authorised by the law, and when we believe that disclosure is
necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding; or reference agencies;
anyone authorised by an individual, as specified by that individual or the contract.
The following measures are in place to safeguard your personal data:
          Access to your account is controlled by password and username which are unique to you
          Your personal data is stored on secure servers
          Payment details are encrypted using Ingrain devices which provide tamper-resistant
           protection of cryptographic keys to ensure encrypted data is kept private and secure.
While we will use all reasonable efforts to safeguard your personal data, you acknowledge that the
use of the internet is not entirely secure and for this reason we cannot guarantee the security or
integrity of any personal data transferred from you, or to you via the internet.
