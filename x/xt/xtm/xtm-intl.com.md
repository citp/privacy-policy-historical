   treat your personal information.
   Our website uses cookies. By using our website and agreeing to this policy, you consent to our use of

   (a) information about your computer and about your visits to and use of this website (including your

   A cookie consists of information sent by a web server to a web browser, and stored by the browser.
   The information is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the
   server. This enables the web server to identify and track the web browser.
   We use both “session” cookies and “persistent” cookies on the website. We will use the session
   cookies to: keep track of you whilst you navigate the website; and. We will use the persistent cookies
   to: enable our website to recognise you when you visit.
   Session cookies will be deleted from your computer when you close your browser. Persistent cookies
   will remain stored on your computer until deleted, or until they reach a specified expiry date.
   We use Google Analytics to analyse the use of this website. Google Analytics generates statistical
   and other information about website use by means of cookies, which are stored on users' computers.
   The information generated relating to our website is used to create reports about the use of the
   website. Google will store this information.              Google's privacy policy is available at:
   http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html.
   Most browsers allow you to reject all cookies, whilst some browsers allow you to reject just third party
   cookies. For example, in Internet Explorer you can refuse all cookies by clicking “Tools”, “Internet
   Options”, “Privacy”, and selecting “Block all cookies” using the sliding selector. Blocking all cookies
   will, however, have a negative impact upon the usability of our website.
