Xtranormal may disclose personally identifiable information and non-personally-identifiable information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies or other businesses or persons for the purpose of processing such information on our behalf. We require that they agree to process such information in compliance with our privacy policy, and we use reasonable efforts to limit their use of such information and to use other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.

Xtranormal employs other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf such as processing payments and providing customer services. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.

Xtranormal may disclose 'automatically collected' information and other aggregate non-personally-identifiable information with interested third parties to assist such parties in understanding the usage and demographic patterns for certain programs, content, services, advertisement, promotions, and/or other functionality on the Site.

Xtranormal may disclose personally identifiable information and/or non-personally identifiable information if required to do so by law, or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with applicable laws (such as copyright laws) or respond to a court order, subpoena, or search warrant.

It may be necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities, including but not limited to, fraud, potential threats to public safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Service, or as otherwise permitted by law. We may make such disclosures, in some cases, without providing Users notice.

Xtranormal reserves the right to disclose User information that we believe, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to take precautions against liability; protect Xtranormal from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses; to investigate and defend ourselves against any third party claims or allegations; to assist government enforcement agencies; to protect the security or integrity of the Site; and to protect the rights, property or personal safety of our Users or other persons.

**How long does Xtranormal retain personal information?**  
Xtranormal keeps your information for a period reasonably necessary to meet the purposes for which it was collected or to comply with any legal requirements, including statutory retention periods. When your personal information is no longer required for a specific purpose or legal requirement, it will be erased from our records.

**Where is my personal information located?**  
Your personal information may be stored and processed in servers, including those of our authorized third parties, located in Canada. These servers shall always be subject to the safeguards described in this Privacy Policy to protect against unauthorized collection, use or disclosure, and you shall be able to access the personal information stored in such servers in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

Your choices:

You may, of course, decline to share your personally identifiable information with Xtranormal, in which case, Xtranormal may not be able to provide certain services to you. You may update, correct, or delete your User account information and email preferences at any time by going to the Edit Profile section of the Site; provided however, that upon deletion of your account or profile, please note that some of your personal information, including billing and contact information, may remain in Xtranormal's systems for some limited period of time.

You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information at all times.

**Third-Party advisers, Links to other Sites:**  
Xtranormal allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the Site. These third party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly through your browser, the advertisements that appear within the Site and they automatically receive your IP address when this happens. Such third party ad servers may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content.

Xtranormal does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in. However, please note that if an advertiser asks Xtranormal to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men ages 18-34) or audience segment (for example, men ages 18-24 who have viewed certain channels of content) and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach.

You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third party ad servers or ad networks. Xtranormal privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of such other advertisers or web sites.

Xtranormal uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of User information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of User information you transmit to Xtranormal and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your information, Xtranormal makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.

If Xtranormal learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. Xtranormal may post a notice on the Site if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive a free written notice of a security breach you should e-mail [customer support](mailto:support@xtranormal.com).
