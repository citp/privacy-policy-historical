Privacy Policy:

Ximage (“Ximage”) operates [Ximage.me](https://ximage.me/) and may operate other websites. It is Ximage’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.  
Website Visitors

Like most website operators, Ximage collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Ximage’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Ximage’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Ximage may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

Ximage also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on Ximage.me blogs/sites. Ximage only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog/site where the comment was left.

Those who engage in transactions with Ximage are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Ximage collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Ximage. Ximage does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
