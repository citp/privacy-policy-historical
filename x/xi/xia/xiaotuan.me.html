Exposure Labs Inc., (“<strong>Exposure</strong>”)
</p>
cares deeply about the
privacy of its visitors and users and would like to share the steps it
takes to protect your personal information in compliance with data privacy
laws. The below policy describes: (1) what information may be collected;
(2) how such information may be used; and (3) your rights as a visitor or
user of this site regarding such information. Information may be collected
at www.exposure.co (the “<strong>Site</strong>”). Exposure uses this
information to deliver the services offered on the Site, to inform you of
changes to the Site or your account, to enhance the Site, to prevent
illegal or potentially prohibited conduct, and to enforce our Terms of Use
(the “<strong>Terms</strong>”), which incorporate this Privacy Policy by
reference.
<p>
Before you access or use any of our services we encourage you to read the
entire Privacy Policy. A short summary is below:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
We collect information related to your use of the Site:

Such information is used to provide you the services on the Site:
</li>
<li>
You have the right to request the deletion of your personal information
at any time and for any reason by contacting: hello@exposure.co.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>1.</strong>
<strong>Please Read the Whole Policy</strong>
</p>
<p>

including how Exposure gathers, stores or shares your information, if at
all. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, this Privacy Policy does not
apply to information that is gathered or collected offline. By using the
Site and by submitting information to Exposure, you agree to the practices
described in this Privacy Policy and to any other applicable terms,
including the Terms. This Privacy Policy is intended to provide you with a

<strong>What Information Is Collected?</strong>
</p>
<p>
We collect two types of information from visitors and users. The first,
unidentified and non-identifiable information (“
<strong>Anonymous Information</strong>”)
</p>
<p>
The second type of information we collect is individually identifiable
information, meaning information that can identify an individual or may,
with reasonable efforts, lead to the identification of an individual (“
<strong>PII</strong>”).
<strong>User Account</strong>”)
</p>
<p>
Please note that your name may be publicly available on the Internet when
you use some features of the Site, such as user comments, forums, instant
messaging, e-mail, or social networking functions. Use your discretion when
using these services. It is your responsibility to review what information
you wish to share with members and non-members of the Site. You are solely
responsible for any public content in your user profile. You may review,
amend or delete any and all information and content associated with your
User Account by signing in to your account on the Site. You may also
request the deactivation of your User Account by sending an e-mail to
hello@exposure.co.
</p>
<p>
3.
<strong>How Is Information Collected?</strong>
</p>
<p>
Exposure collects information about you only if we have a reason for such
collection, such as to provide the services, to communicate with you, or to
improve our Site. Information is collected in three ways:
</p>
<p>
(a)
<strong>
Information collected automatically through accessing the Site
</strong>
. When you visit the Site (or any website), your actions while your browse
the Site, upload information, download information, or access any links,
either directly through the Site or with the help of third-party services
such as cookies, are tracked. Learn more about how we use cookies and
third-party services in Section 7 below.
</p>
<p>
(b)
<strong>Information you provide Exposure.</strong>When
</p>
<p>
(c)
<strong>Information obtained from outside sources</strong>.
</p>
<p>
4.
<strong>Why Is Information Collected?</strong>
</p>
<p>
Both Anonymous Information and PII is collected so that Exposure may
provide the services on the Site. This includes: correspondence from
Exposure regarding your User Account, to further develop and improve the
services based on user preferences, to provide customer assistance and
technical support, to create aggregated statistical data from Anonymous
Information which Exposure or its partners may use to provide or improve
their respective services, and to enhance data and fraud security
capabilities.
</p>
<p>
Exposure will not sell, license, rent, or otherwise disclose your PII
except as stated herein, or under the following circumstances: (1) you have
given your consent; (2) we previously notified you of the disclosure in
this Privacy Policy or when you provided your information on the Site; (3)
we are compelled by law, legal process, or court order to disclose; (4)
disclosure is required to identify, contact, or bring legal action against
someone who may cause harm to, or interference with, Exposure’s rights or
property, our users, or anyone else; or (5) to respond to an inquiry,
request or complaint that you have made. Exposure may cooperate with
Internet service providers to identify users whenever required to comply
with law, to enforce compliance with this Privacy Policy or our Terms, or
to protect the Site, our customers and others.
</p>
<p>
5.
<strong>Where is Information Stored?</strong>
</p>
<p>
Exposure uses industry standard technologies to safeguard your data (both
Anonymous Data and PII) from unauthorized use and disclosure and to
prohibit possible security breaches of the Site. Unfortunately, no website,
computer system or online communication is completely secure. Exposure
cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, or other
breaches will never occur. Your use of the Site is at your own risk.
</p>
<p>
Exposure will take commercially reasonable steps to use heightened security
technologies to protect the transmission and storage of transactional
information to the Site. Such heightened security measures may include the
secure transmission and encryption of all supplied sensitive financial or
other transaction-related information. Such information will only be
accessible by authorized individuals with special access rights to our
payment systems.
</p>
<p>
Unless otherwise specified, whenever you make a purchase, your financial
and other transaction-related information will only be used to process your
transaction and will not be stored on our servers or used for marketing
purposes.
</p>
<p>
Data will be maintained, processed and stored by Exposure in the United
States of America or other jurisdictions, as necessary, for proper delivery
of the services or as required by law.
</p>
<p>
6.
<strong>Requesting Deletion of Information and Your Rights</strong>
</p>
<p>
Upon written request Exposure will provide you with information about
whether we hold any of your PII. You may access, correct, or request
deletion of your PII by emailing: hello@exposure.co. We will respond to
your request within a timeframe imposed by local laws or a reasonable
timeframe.
</p>
<p>
Please note that permanently deleting your Exposure User Account erases all
of your information from our system. After completing this process your
User Account and all its data will be removed permanently, and Exposure
will not be able to restore your User Account or retrieve your data in the
future.
</p>
<p>
If you are located in countries that fall under the scope of the European
General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), data protection laws give you
rights with respect to your personal data, subject to exemptions provided
by law. These rights include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The right to request access to your personal data;
</li>
<li>
The right to request correction or deletion of your personal data;
</li>
<li>
The right to object to the use and processing of your personal data;
</li>
<li>
The right to request that Exposure limit its use and processing of your
personal data;
</li>
<li>
The right to request portability of your personal data.
</li>
<li>
The right to make a complaint to a governmental supervisory authority.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Exposure strives to provide these rights to all visitors and users. Please

Similarly, third-party websites may embed or contain links and

information you provide to said third party, will be subject to the privacy
policy of the third party. If you later decide to opt out, you should
contact the third party directly.
</p>
<p>
Where permitted by local data laws, Exposure may disclose or otherwise
allow others to access your PII pursuant to a legal request, such as a
subpoena, legal proceedings, search warrant or court order, or in
compliance with applicable law. If we have a good faith belief that the law
requires disclosure, we may disclose your PII, with or without notice to
you.
</p>
<p>
<strong>8.</strong>
<strong>Children and Privacy</strong>
</p>
<p>
This Site is NOT directed towards children under the age of 13. Exposure
recognizes the importance of maintaining the privacy of children,
especially those under the age of 13. Exposure is committed to complying
with all applicable laws and regulations regarding children, including the
Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“<strong>COPPA</strong>”), 15
U.S.C. § 6501, et seq.
</p>
<p>
Except in limited circumstances allowed by COPPA, Exposure does not and
will not knowingly request, collect, store, maintain, or share any
personally identifiable information of children under the age of 13,
without first obtaining the consent of a legal guardian. In those limited
instances, Exposure will only collect reasonably necessary information, and
Exposure will not share with third parties any personally identifiable
information of a child under the age of 13 without the explicit consent of
a legal guardian, or as permitted by COPPA or other applicable law.
</p>
<p>
You may revoke your consent and request the removal of your child’s
information at any time. If you are the legal guardian of a child under the
age of 13 and discover that your child has submitted their personally
identifiable information without securing your consent, Exposure will use
commercially reasonable efforts to remove this information. If at any point
you wish to review, amend, or request the removal of your child’s
information, please send an e-mail to hello@exposure.co and provide the
name and account information for your child’s user account.
</p>
<p>
<strong>9.</strong>
<strong>Notification of Changes</strong>
</p>
<p>
Exposure may at any time and in its sole discretion, add, modify, or remove
any feature, function or portion of the Site, the Terms, and/or the Privacy
Policy, in whole or in part, with or without notice to you, prior or
otherwise. Any changes to the Privacy Policy will be effective as of the
posting date. Exposure will provide prominent notice on the Site of any
major changes to the Privacy Policy. Your continued use of the Site after
Exposure posts any modifications to the Privacy Policy shall be deemed your
explicit acceptance of those modifications and shall constitute your
agreement to comply with the Privacy Policy, as modified.
</p>
<p>

is defined in Section 1798.83) to request certain information about the
disclosure of that information to third parties for their direct marketing
purposes. If you are a California resident with questions regarding this,
or how the Exposure reviews and processes any request from you to amend
your personal information, please contact us as
