### What we collect 

You may visit the Site without providing any personal information. When you register to use the Site, the only information required is your name, email address, and a unique user ID. If you register for online seminars or software evaluations, or if you participate in our online contests or contact us for information, you will be asked to provide additional information such as your title, company, address, and telephone number. If you make purchases on the Site, we will also ask you for billing and credit card information.

### How we collect it

Xilinx collects your personal information when you submit it through the Site, for example, when you complete registration forms, make purchases on the Site, or contact Xilinx for additional information about our products and services. 

### Tracking Technologies

We Xilinx, Inc. and our marketing partners, affiliates, analytics or online customer support providers, use technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags, and scripts, to analyze trends, administer the Site, track users’ movements around the Site, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual and aggregated basis.

We use cookies for our shopping cart, to remember users’ settings (e.g., language preference), for authentication. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use our Site, but your ability to use some features or areas of our Site may be limited.

We partner with a third party to either display advertising on our Site or to manage our advertising on other websites. Our third-party partner may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities on this Site and other websites in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based advertisements, you may opt-out by clicking [here](http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/). Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertisements. You will continue to receive generic advertisements.

We use local storage, such as HTML5, to store content information and preferences. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our Site or to display advertising based upon your web browsing activity also use HTML5 to collect and store information. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5.

### Analytics / Log Files

As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.

### Widgets

Our Site includes social media features, such as the Facebook Like button. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it. 

### Information Sharing; Use and Disclosure of Information

Xilinx will not use or disclose personal information for purposes other than those for which it was collected, except with your consent or as required or permitted by law. Consent may be express or implied, and given in writing, by using or not using a check-off box, electronically, orally, or by your conduct, such as use of services or products.

Xilinx uses your personal information to respond to your requests for information; to complete transactions (including purchases) requested by you, to administer customer, website, and technical support; and when otherwise reasonably necessary. Xilinx, or authorized Xilinx representatives, may contact you regarding products and services that may be of interest to you. 

We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy.

Xilinx may disclose personal information as consented to by you from time to time, including to fulfill any purposes that are identified when the personal information is collected. Xilinx uses certain third-party vendors to assist Xilinx in providing our products and services, including marketing and selling Xilinx products and fulfillment and delivery of customer orders. Xilinx may transfer your personal information only to such vendors who have entered into a contract with Xilinx that protects the privacy of your personal information and permits the vendor to use it only as reasonably necessary to fulfill its contractual obligations to provide services to Xilinx. Xilinx may also disclose your personal information as it believes is reasonably necessary to comply with laws, such as to comply with a subpoena, bankruptcy proceedings, regulation, or other governmental authority or to prevent harm to Xilinx, its employees and customers or the public. Xilinx may disclose your personal information upon a transfer or sale to another entity of all or substantially all of Xilinx assets or stock in the Xilinx line of business to which this Policy relates or upon any other corporate reorganization. You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.

### Customer Surveys

In an effort to provide the highest quality products and services, Xilinx may contract with third-party providers of customer feedback campaigns. When you visit our Site, you may encounter a pop-up dialog box requesting your participation in a customer feedback survey. Participation in these customer feedback campaigns is voluntary and you may chose whether or not you wish to provide any information to the third-party survey provider. When you participate in a customer feedback campaign, the information is being provided to the third-party survey provider and the terms of the third-party service provider's privacy policy, and not this Policy, will apply to any personal information that you may provide in connection with your voluntary participation in any customer survey activities.

### Forums

Our Site offers publicly-accessible community forums. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. Any such disclosures are made at your own risk. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at [privacy@xilinx.com](mailto:privacy@xilinx.com). In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.

The Site does not target and is not intended for children under the age of 13. Xilinx does not want to collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If you are under 13, do not provide Xilinx any information about yourself, including your name, address, telephone number or email address. 

### Links

For your convenience, we may provide links on our Site to certain third-party websites or referrals to certain third-parties' products or services. If you choose to visit a third-party's website, or use its products or services, please be aware that the third-party's privacy policy, and not this Policy, will govern your activities and any information you disclose while interacting with the third party. 

### Security

Personal information collected via the Site may be stored and processed in the United States and/or any other country in which Xilinx or its affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities, and by using the Site, you consent to any such transfer of information into and out of your country, state, and/or territory.

Xilinx employs procedural and technological measures reasonably designed to protect your personal information under our control from loss or unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. Xilinx stores your personal information on secure computers located in a controlled access data center, to which only a small number of Xilinx employees involved in the management of the data center have physical access. Where reasonably practical, Xilinx uses encryption, firewalls, and other security technology to help prevent unauthorized access to your personal information. 

We follow generally-accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
