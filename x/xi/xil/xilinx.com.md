Last Updated: August 24, 2016  


In this Privacy Policy ("Policy"), we, Xilinx, Inc., describe our data collection and usage practices with respect to personal data we collect through [www.xilinx.com](http://www.xilinx.com/) and Xilinx mobile applications that directly link to this Policy (collectively the "Site"). 

This Policy and our TRUSTe certification covers only information collected through the Site and not information that we collect offline, through other websites or through software downloaded from websites. In order to view information on our relationship with TRUSTe, please visit the validation page by clicking on the TRUSTe seal. If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact TRUSTe at <https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request>. 

If you have questions or complaints regarding our Privacy Policy or practices, please contact us at [privacy@xilinx.com](mailto:privacy@xilinx.com).

### Information That You Provide 

You may visit the Site without registering or actively submitting personal data to us. If you do not register, then we receive only information that your computer or other device sends to us in connection with access requests and via cookies and other technologies that we use to analyze and enhance your use of our Site.

When you register to use the Site, you will provide your name, email address, and a unique user ID. If you register for online seminars or software evaluations, or if you participate in our online contests or contact us for information, you will be asked to provide additional information such as your title, company, address, and telephone number. If you make purchases on the Site, we will also ask you for billing and credit card information. You may also submit personal information when you contact Xilinx for additional information about our products and services. We also collect resume and applicant information for those applying to job openings.

We use your information to operate, evaluate and improve our business (including developing new products and services; enhancing and improving our services; managing our communications; and analyzing our products).

### Information We Share 

We disclose your personal information only as follows: 

  * With your consent. 
  * We use affiliated and unaffiliated service providers all over the world that help us deliver our service and run our business subject to confidentiality agreements.
  * We share aggregated usage statistics that cannot be used to identify you individually.
  * We will disclose data as required by law or to protect you, other users, us or third parties from harm, including fraud, data security breaches or where someone's physical safety seems at risk.
  * In a reorganization or sale of our company or assets, your data may be transferred, subject to the acquirer accepting the commitments made in this Statement and compliance with applicable law.



### How We Protect Personal Information

Personal information collected via the Site may be stored and processed in the United States and/or any other country in which Xilinx or its affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities, and by using the Site, you consent to any such storage, processing and transfer of information into and out of your country, state, and/or territory. 

Xilinx employs procedural and technological measures reasonably designed to protect your personal information under our control from loss or unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. Xilinx stores your personal information on secure computers located in a controlled access data center, to which only a small number of Xilinx employees involved in the management of the data center have physical access. Where reasonably practical, Xilinx uses encryption, firewalls, and other security technology to help prevent unauthorized access to your personal information. 

We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Site, you can contact us at [privacy@xilinx.com](mailto:privacy@xilinx.com)

### Tracking Technologies

We and our marketing partners, affiliates, analytics or online customer support providers use technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags, and scripts, to analyze trends, administer the Site, track users' movements around the Site, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual and aggregated basis.

We use cookies for our shopping cart, to remember users' settings (e.g., language preference), and for authentication. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use our Site, but your ability to use some features or areas of our Site may be limited.

We partner with a third party to either display advertising on our Site or to manage our advertising on other websites. Our third-party partner may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities on this Site and other websites in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. If you wish not to have this information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based advertisements, you may opt-out by clicking [here](http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/). Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertisements. You will continue to receive generic advertisements.

We use local storage, such as HTML5, to store content information and preferences. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our Site or to display advertising based upon your web browsing activity also use HTML5 to collect and store information. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5.

We may not recognize or take action in response to Do-Not-Track (DNT) signals from Web browsers. At this time there is not any universally accepted standard for a company's adoption for how to respond when a DNT signal is detected. In the event a final standard is established, we will determine how to appropriately respond to these signals. 

### Widgets

Our Site includes social media features, such as the Facebook Like button. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it. 

### Customer Surveys

Xilinx may contract with third-party providers of customer feedback campaigns. When you visit our Site, you may encounter a pop-up dialog box requesting your participation in a customer feedback survey. Participation in these customer feedback campaigns is voluntary and you may choose whether or not you wish to provide any information to the third-party survey provider. When you participate in a customer feedback campaign, the information is being provided to the third-party survey provider and the terms of the third-party survey provider's privacy policy, and not this Policy, will apply to any personal information that you may provide in connection with your voluntary participation in any customer survey activities. 

### Forums

Our Site offers publicly accessible community forums. Any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. Any such disclosures are made at your own risk. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at [privacy@xilinx.com](mailto:privacy@xilinx.com). In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.

### Links to Other Websites

For your convenience, we may provide links on our Site to certain third-party websites or referrals to certain third-parties' products or services. If you choose to visit a third party's website, or use its products or services, please be aware that the third party's privacy policy, and not this Policy, will govern your activities and any information you disclose while interacting with the third party. 

### Unsubscribe/Opt-Out
