                    The owners and operators of XZoom.in take your online privacy seriously. This 
                    document outlines the types of information collected by our servers and provides 
                    links to the privacy policies of our third-party advertising partners.<br>
                    <br>
                    User Accounts<br>
                    <br>
                    Membership is an optional part of the XZoom.in web site. No user account is 
                    required in order to browse or download the content we provide. However, 
                    creating an account enables extra features such as (but not limitted to) the 
                    ability to submit content, create a list of your own wallpapers, or post 
                    comments.<br>
                    <br>
                    By creating an account, you are volunteering certain information about yourself 
                    that will be stored on our servers. This data includes at a minimum a username, 
                    password, and valid email address. Additional information may optionally be 
                    added by you to your account profile. Your profile information is public and may 
                    appear on our web site, with the exception of your email address and password.<br>
                    <br>
                    Personally Identified Data<br>
                    <br>
                    We strongly discourage users from entering their full name, phone number, 
                    physical address, or other sensitive information in user profiles, comments, or 
                    other areas of the site. Furthermore, we request that minors and any individuals 
                    with limited decision making ability not create an account on this site without 
                    the approval and supervision of a guardian.<br>
                    <br>
                    We make a reasonable attempt to monitor for cases where users post personally 
                    identifiable information about other individuals to public portions of the web 
                    site and remove the offending material.<br>

                    Server Logs<br>
                    <br>
                    Like most web sites, XZoom.in free wallpaper site logs web-, database-, and 
                    other server-software usage and access information. This information may include 
                    your internet protocal (IP) address, which in many cases can be translated to an 
                    affiliation (such as your work, school, or internet service provider), or a 
                    geographical location. We only use this information for debugging purposes and 
                    for aggregating into anonymous usage and traffic statistics.<br>
                    <br>
                    Cookies<br>
                    <br>
                    While browsing XZoom.in for free HD wallpaper for free, a small number of text 
                    files referred to as "cookies" may be created on your local file system by your 
                    web browser at the request of our servers. These files allow us to personalize 
                    the browsing experience for both registered and non-registered users. You are 
                    free to delete them at any time, or configure your browser not to create them. 
                    However, we do not promise that every feature of XZoom.in will function as 
                    expected without cookies enabled.<br>
