					<p>This Privacy Policy describes the information collected by Nevexa Digital Private Limited. d/b/a www.xappie.com, (“Xappie”, “us”, “we” “our”), how that information may be used, with whom it may be shared, and your choices about such uses and disclosures. By using the website http://www.xappie.com (the “Site”) and the services, features, content, applications or widgets, as well as mobile device applications offered by Xappie (collectively with the Site, the “Services”), you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy. This Policy forms an integral part of Xappie’s Terms of Service, which is incorporated by reference. Any capitalized term used but not defined in this Policy will have the meaning defined in the Terms of Use. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully when using the Services.<br>
<br>
<strong>The Information Xappie May Collect</strong></p>
                <h2 class="title2">1. Information You Provide</h2>
                    <p>Xappie may collect and store any personal information you enter through the Services or the Site. This may include personally identifying information, such as your name, username, residence, e-mail address, birthdate, pictures, and/or credit card information. Xappie may also request information about your interests and activities, and location. No system can be completely secure. Therefore, Xappie does not promise, and you should not expect, that such information may not be inadvertently collected and that such personal information will remain secure. 
<br>
<br>
You also may give us permission to access your information on other services. If you connect to the Services using your Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram or other third-party service credentials (each, a “Supported Platform”), you authorize us to collect your authentication information, such as your username, encrypted access credentials, and other information that may be available on or through your Supported Platform account, including but not limited to your name, pictures, and friends/followers lists. The information we get from Supported Platforms may depend on your settings or their privacy policies. 
<br>
<br>
Xappie does not store any user financial information, even though we may request information about you and your credit card and/or bank account. Xappie does not store certain financial data due to its use of third party agents, such as PayPal, as its financial transaction facilitator. Please refer to such third parties' Terms (https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/useragreement-full) and Privacy Policies (https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full) for more information about how these parties use your information. We do not store any user financial information, even though we may request information about yourself and your credit card and/or bank account. That financial information is handled, processed, and stored by the third party financial transaction processing companies. To the extent that Xappie uses third party providers such as PayPal for financial transaction services, we believe that such third parties take the privacy of your personal information seriously and will use your information only in accordance with the terms of their privacy policies. </p>
<h2 class="title2">2. Information Collected Automatically</h2>
                    <p>Like many sites on the Internet, the Site automatically collects information from your browser when you visit the Site. This information includes your IP address, your browser type and language, access times, the content of any undeleted cookies that your browser previously accepted from Xappie (see "Cookies" below), and the referring website address. If you use Xappie's mobile application, Xappie may collect various non-identifying information, such as your mobile device type, device properties, IP address, profile views, ad views, ad clicks, search queries, store and product views, photo views, and page views. We may also combine all of this non-identifying information with other non-identifying information to infer interests or demographic characteristics. In order for Xappie to work with your iPhone, iPod touch, iPad, BlackBerry, or other mobile device, Xappie must collect your Device Identification Code or "DIC". The DIC is a special type of identifier used in software applications in order to provide a unique reference number for applications like those used by your mobile device. Your DIC is not shared with other users.
                    </p>
<h2 class="title2">3. Cookies and Use of Cookie Data</h2>
                    <p>Like many sites on the Internet, when you visit the Site, Xappie may assign your computer one or more cookies to facilitate access to the Site and to personalize your online experience. Through the use of a cookie, Xappie also may automatically collect information about your online activity on the Site, such as the web pages you visit, the time and date of your visits, the links you click, and the searches you conduct on the Site. Xappie may use this data to better understand how you interact with the Site, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on the Site, and to improve the Site and our Services. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies.

In addition, please be aware that other parties may also place their own cookies on or through the Site, and may collect or solicit personal information from you. Other cookies may reflect de-identified demographic or other data linked to the registration data you have submitted to Xappie in hashed, non-human readable form. No personally identifiable information is contained in these cookies.<br>
<br>
 
If you use Xappie's mobile device applications, Xappie may also use mobile cookies. A mobile cookie is a small data file transferred to your mobile device for record-keeping purposes.

                    </p>
					
					<h2 class="title2">4. Information Collected by Third Parties</h2>
                    <p>Xappie may allow third parties, advertising companies, and ad networks to display advertisements on the Site and via the Services. These companies may use tracking technologies, such as cookies, to collect information about users who view or interact with their advertisements. Xappie does not provide any personal information to these third parties. <br>

<br>
You understand and agree that Supported Platforms’ or other third parties’ use of information they collect from you is governed by their privacy policies, and Xappie’s use of such information is governed by this Privacy Policy.</p>
