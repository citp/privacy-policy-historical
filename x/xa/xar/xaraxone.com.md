### Information collected by cookies

 **Our own cookies**

 We use cookies to make our website work including:

  * Making our shopping basket and checkout work
  * Determining if you are logged in or not
  * Remembering if you have accepted our terms and conditions



The site also uses cookies as part of the Xara Affiliate Program. Affiliate cookies last for 30 days and simply identify an anonymous user as having come from a specific referring site which is a member of the affiliate program. This means that Xara can pay commission to its affiliates if users subsequently return to the site and purchase one of Xara's products. 

**Third party 'social' functions**

 Our site, like most websites, includes 'social' functionality provided by third parties. For example, we have included share and like buttons so you can easily like or share our content with social networks. The following services use cookies:

  * [Google](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/)
  * [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/)
  * [Twitter](https://twitter.com/privacy)
  * [StumbleUpon](http://www.stumbleupon.com/privacy)



 Disabling these cookies will likely break the functions offered by these third parties.

**Anonymous Visitor Statistics Cookies, Analytics**

Our site, like most websites, uses cookies to compile visitor statistics such as how many people have visited our website, what type of technology they are using, how long they spend on the site, what page they look at etc. This helps us to continuously improve our website. These so called "analytics" programs also tell us on an anonymous basis, how people reached this site (e.g. from a search engine) and whether they have been here before, helping us to put more money into developing our services for you instead of marketing spend.

In addition we also occasionally use Google remarketing technology on our website, which uses the Google Analytics cookies. This technology allows users that have already visited our website to be subsequently presented with specific relevant Google Adwords advertisements, with the benefit that the adverts you are shown are tailored to your interest.
