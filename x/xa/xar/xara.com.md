Information collected by order forms, registration forms, download forms, opt-in mailing list and surveys

The site's **order and registration forms** require users to provide contact information (their name, postal and e-mail address) and **orders forms** require financial information (credit card number.) Contact information from the order and registration form is used to send orders and information about the orders, registration and company to our customers. The customer's contact information is also used to get in touch with the customer when necessary. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. Financial information that is collected is used to bill the user for products and services. **None of the information collected on Xara's order forms is ever passed to third parties**. 

The site's **mailing list sign-up forms** offer site visitors the option to subscribe to our email newslists. Contact information from this form is used to send information about Xara products and the company to our customers. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings at the time; see the choice/opt-out section below. **None of the information collected for Xara's opt in mailing lists is passed to third parties**.

Occasionally we run **online surveys** which may ask visitors for contact information (like their e-mail address) and demographic information (like their zip code, age, or income level) and questions about their use of Xara's products and web site. The customer's contact information may be used to contact the visitor when necessary but **is not used for mailings**.

Other Information

The Xara web site logs each user's **IP address** and **domain name** in order to provide aggregate site usage statistics, such as the number of unique users, and in order to help diagnose problems with servers and assist in the administration of the web site. 

The site uses **temporary cookies** on secure ordering pages to keep track of user session information during the purchase process. This saves you having to enter your password in each page. Xara does not use these cookies to record your progress through the site or for any other purpose. The cookie information is lost when you leave the site. You can find further information about these cookies at: <http://www.club.xara.com/support/cookies.asp>.

The site also uses cookies as part of the Xara Referrer Scheme. Referrer cookies last for 30 days and simply identify an anonymous user as having come from a specific referring site which is a member of the affiliate program. This means that Xara can pay commission to its affiliates if users subsequently return to the site and purchase one of Xara's products. **The information collected by the cookies is not used for any other purpose**.

Contact with Xara Servers

Some Xara products make contact with Xara servers in order to check whether updates are available for the program or resources. This might be instigated either manually or automatically. Version number and language information may be sent with the query so that the appropriate update information is returned to the customer. **The information collected in this way is not used for any other purpose**. 

Security

This site has **security measures in place** to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under Xara's control. All Xara transactions are protected by **SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption**. All pages that contain customer information are password protected. Some customer information can be viewed online if a correct user name and password is entered but **financial information cannot be viewed online** under any circumstances. Password hints and customer information can only be sent to the e-mail address registered for the user, and this cannot be changed unless the user logs in. **Financial information will never be sent under any circumstances**. 

This site does contain links to other sites. **Xara is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of web sites which may be linked from this site**.
