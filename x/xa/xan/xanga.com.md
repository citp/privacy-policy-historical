# Xanga.com: Privacy Policy

**What personal information does Xanga collect?**  
  
---  
  
During registration, the only personal information that Xanga currently requests is your email address.

You may volunteer additional personal information at other times including, but not limited to, creating a Public Profile or updating your Personal Account Information. Any additional personal information that you submit to Xanga will be protected under the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.  
  
**Who else collects personal information from me?**  
  
Any personal information that you volunteer on Xanga.com (any URL that starts with http://www.xanga.com) is collected by Xanga alone, unless specifically noted otherwise.

When you sign up for an affiliate program with one of the vendors promoted on your Xanga Site, you are submitting your personal information to that vendor. Any personal information you volunteer to that vendor is subject to the terms and conditions of that vendor's privacy policy.  
  
**How does Xanga use my personal information?**  
  
Xanga.com uses your personal information primarily to customize your experience using the Site. The more information you volunteer, the better we can personalize Xanga's products and services to match your needs and interests.

Xanga uses your email address only to confirm your account and contact you in case of any problems with your account. Upon your request, Xanga may forward additional information to your email address including, but not limited to, messages from visitors to your Xanga Site or additional information about the Company. If you sign up for an affiliate program with one of the vendors promoted on your Xanga Site, Xanga will also forward emails from that vendor about your affiliate account.

To continue to provide Xanga's products and services free-of-charge, Xanga may display advertisements or other promotional information. Any additional personal information that you volunteer will help Xanga customize the advertisements it displays to match your interests.

Xanga does not share any personally identifiable information with advertisers. Xanga may share general demographic information with advertisers and business partners (such as aggregated statistics about members' interests and occupations). But Xanga never gives advertisers access to your individual personal account information.  
  
**How can I control the privacy of my Xanga Site?**  
  
You have complete control over which items and areas of your Xanga Site are publicly viewable.

To change the privacy status of any item, click on the "public" or "private" label to the right of the item or the "edit or move" link to the right of the item. Inside the resulting edit window, you will see a pair of radio buttons allowing you to alter the privacy status of the item.

"Public" items are published on a special public version of your Xanga Site, accessible to anyone browsing the Xanga Community.

"Private" items appear only on your private Xanga Site, accessible only by you (or anyone to whom you've given your username and secret password), invisible to the rest of the Xanga Community.   
  
**What can I do to protect my Xanga account?**  
  
Be careful to keep your Xanga username and password secret! Anyone who knows your username and password can log onto your Xanga account.

If you are using a shared computer to access your Xanga account, remember to log out of Xanga before you leave that computer. If you forget to log out, the next person who uses that shared computer may have access to your Xanga account.

To minimize the risk of other people accessing your private Xanga account, we suggest you log out of Xanga before you leave any computer that you use, even a personal one.  
  
**What does Xanga do to protect my private and personal information**  
  
Xanga.com has built a secure infrastructure to safeguard your private information. We will continue to do everything we can to maintain and improve the security of our network. After all, every Xanga employee is also an active Xanga member. We all understand the importance of maintaining a secure system for our private and personal information.

No data transmission over the Internet, however, can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Although Xanga pledges to put forth its best efforts to protect your private information, Xanga cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk. For further information on this subject, please see our [Terms of Use](http://www.xanga.com/About/default.asp?item=18).  
  
**Is there anything else I should know about privacy issues?**  
  
We will do everything in our power to maintain your privacy and online security. Strong privacy and security, however, requires effort from both Xanga.com and its members. Please be sure to follow the advice listed above for protecting your Xanga account. The best way to protect your privacy is to protect your password; change your password often, and keep it secret, even from Xanga.com employees.

Xanga.com employees will never ask you for your password!
