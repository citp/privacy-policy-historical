			  <p><strong>Privacy Statement</strong><br>
			  Xactly Corporation ("Xactly" or "we") has created this privacy statement ("Statement") in order to demonstrate our commitment to privacy. Privacy on the www.xactlycorp.com Web Site (the "Site") is of great importance to us. Since we gather important information from our visitors and customers, we have established this Statement to communicate our information gathering and dissemination practices. In an effort to ensure the highest levels of data  privacy our standards meet the U.S. Department of Commerce's "Safe Harbor"  standards.

			  In order to access certain portions of the Site, you will be required to register by providing certain limited information regarding you and the company you represent.

Customers can opt out of being contacted by us, or receiving such information from us, at any time by sending an email to <a href="mailto:marketing@xactlycorp.com">marketing@xactlycorp.com</a>. If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask them for the friend's name and email address.

			  <p><strong>Cookies</strong><br>
			  When you interact with the xactlycorp.com Site, we strive to make that experience easy and meaningful. When you come to our Site, our Web server may send a cookie to your computer. Cookies are files that Web browsers place on a computer's hard drive and are used to tell us whether customers and visitors have visited the Site previously. Standing alone, cookies do not identify you personally. They merely recognize your browser. Unless you choose to identify yourself to Xactly either by requesting a download or registering for a demo or webinar, you remain anonymous to Xactly. If you do not accept cookies from the domain "xactlycorp.com", you cannot access certain portions of the Site without registering again each time you would like to access restricted information.</p>
			  <p><strong>Log Files</strong><br>
We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the Site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses that we collect are not linked to personally identifiable information.</p>
				<p><strong>Users Outside of the United States</strong><br>
				While we make every effort to honor the laws and wishes of all users, this Site is available for users located primarily in the United States of America and therefore may not recognize foreign laws.</p>
