WHAT INFORMATION DOES X2ENGINE COLLECT?

X2Engine collects personal information from users for different purposes.  Information gathered

online can be identified as either anonymous or identifiable.  Anonymous information is

Like many sites, the Website gathers certain information automatically and stores it.  This

information may include Internet protocol (IP) addresses, searches performed, browser types,

Internet services providers (ISP), referring/exit pages, date/time stamps, and clickstream data.

X2Engine uses this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends

administer the Website, gather demographic information about its user base as a whole, and

improve its level of service to you. X2Engine does not link this automatically-collected data to

personally identifiable information.

use of our Website. We will share with these companies only that personal information which

they need to work on our behalf. Some of these service providers may be located in other

use such information solely for the purpose of providing services to X2Engine, and under the

instructions of X2Engine, and with respect to that information, to act in a manner consistent with

the relevant principles articulated in this Privacy Policy.

IS MY PERSONAL INFORMATION SECURE?
