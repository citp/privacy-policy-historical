Collection of Personal Information

x2VOL collects personal information, such as e-mail address, a parent's e-mail address, name, home or work address, telephone number, and mobile number. x2VOL also collects anonymous demographic information, which is not unique to you, such as your ZIP code, age, gender, preferences, school you attend, interests and favorites.

There is also information about your computer hardware and software that is automatically collected by x2VOL. This information can include: your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring Web site addresses. This information is used by x2VOL for the operation of the service, to maintain quality of the service, and to provide general statistics regarding use of the x2VOL Web site.

x2VOL encourages you to review the privacy statements of Web sites you choose to link to from x2VOL so that you can understand how those Web sites collect, use and share your information. x2VOL is not responsible for the privacy statements or other content on Web sites outside of the x2VOL and x2VOL family of Web sites.

For organizations, we provide a way to add additional people to your organizations profile, and we will collect name, e-mail address and phone numbers of additional members you wish to add to your profile. We use this information to initiate messages from the system to organization contacts, identify contact and project locations, and facilitate contact between organization managers. Organizations may including both volunteering organizations, which provide opportunities, and sponsoring organizations (such as schools) that monitor, track, and report on the activities of volunteers.

Organizations may manage projects, including adding new projects, reviewing existing ones, and deleting projects. Projects may be defined as unstructured projects or with defined event calendars requiring signup. To enable this functionality, organizations will be able to view basic information such as the names of volunteers signing up for its projects and events and the hours they claim for events, and will have the option of initiating contact with those volunteers through the system. As subscribers, organizations and their designated contacts are able to receive detailed project tracking and progress reporting and define approved projects and organizations which are given preference in searches by that organization's volunteers.

Sponsoring organizations may define groups of volunteers with independent sets of goals to be applied to volunteers within those groups and are able to see basic information such as name, student identifier, and e-mail address in order to verify that the volunteer's membership is appropriate.

For volunteers, we provide the ability to search for and review volunteering opportunities based on their your profile information and volunteering preferences. Volunteers may claim time spent on structured projects defined by organizations or on personal unstructured projects. Hours claimed for structured projects can be verified by organizations and approved by schools or sponsoring organizations to provide auditability. You will also be able to view logged and approved volunteer hours, on-going projects and upcoming events, goups the volunteer is a member of, goals and goal deadlines, and progress toward those goals. You may also keep track of your volunteer days in a customized event calendar.

Mobile

When using our mobile application the only information we will ask for is the contact details of a third party to verify your time spent on that job. We will collect the name, phone number and email address so that they may be contacted.

You are able to add activities and view all activities and recurring activities. You may also edit or delete activities as well. We will send you alerts within the application of upcoming events as a reminder.

We do not ask you for, access or track any location based information from your mobile device at any time while downloading or using our Mobile Apps or services.

Profiles

Once you have created an account you are able to create a profile. We will ask for certain information such as company name, company URL, company's mission statement, etc. This information is viewable by the organizations that you are volunteering for only and will not be displayed to any other users of the site.
