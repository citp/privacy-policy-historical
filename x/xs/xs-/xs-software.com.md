  * at your request for the purpose of participating in promotions and surveys, or to receive newsletters.



XS Software also collects user data to the extent that it is necessary for the performance of services or for the billing of these services. This refers in particular to game processes, game scores and information regarding the use and settlement of services.

In certain situations XS Software may use your IP address and the corresponding date and time to track and stop use of multiple accounts for fraudulent purposes.

Subject to your consent, we keep you informed about news, events and promotions either via e-mail or text message. 

#### Data transfer

We will treat your data with the strictest confidentiality and will not disclose it to any third parties.
