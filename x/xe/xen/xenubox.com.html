                    This privacy policy ("<strong>Policy</strong>") explains how personally identifiable information is collected,
                    used and disclosed by New IT Solutions Ltd. ("<strong>we</strong>" or "<strong>us</strong>") with respect to your access

                    xenubox Music and xenubox ("Apps" or "App"), so you can make an informed decision about
                    using the Service.
                
                <br><br>
                
                    We reserve the right to change the provisions of this Policy at any time. We will alert you
                    that changes have been made by indicating on this Policy the date it was last updated. If we
                    make any material changes we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in
                    your account) or by means of a notice on this Site prior to the change becoming effective. We
                    encourage you to review this Policy from time-to-time to make sure that you understand how any
                    personally identifiable information you provide to us or collected about you will be used.
                
                <br><br>
                <b>What Is Personal Information?</b><br><br>
                
                    As used in this Policy, the term "personally identifiable information" means information
                    that specifically identifies an individual (such as a name, user name or e-mail address), or
                    information about that individual that is directly linked to information that specifically identifies
                    an individual. Personally identifiable information does not include "aggregate" information,
                    which is data we collect about the use of the Service or about a group or category of services
                    or users, from which individual identities or other personally identifiable information has
                    been removed. This Policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate
                    information.
                
                <br><br>
                <b>What Information Do We Collect?</b><br><br>
                
                    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Active Collection:</span> We collect information from you in various ways when you use the Service
                    and Apps. For example, we collect information: (i) that you voluntarily provide to us (such as
                    when you send us an email); and (ii) to which you provide us access. Such information may
                    include personal information, such as your name, email address, date of birth, social network
                    data and performance related data. When using our Apps we will collect information such as
                    device type, operating system type and version. Personal and demographic information may also
                    be collected if you provide such information in connection with posting data, providing access to
                    your online groups and other activities in connection with the Service.
                
                <br><br>
                We do not ask you for, access or track any location based information from your mobile device at any time while downloading or using our Mobile Apps or services.
                <br><br>
                
                    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Passive Collection:</span>
                    When you use the Service and our Apps, some information is also
                    automatically collected, such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address, your operating system, the
                    browser type, the address of a referring website, and your activity on the Service. We may also
                    automatically collect certain logistical information in server logs, including information about
                    how you use various features of the Service and information about the number, frequency and
                    length of each session.
                
                <br><br>
                
                    We may also automatically collect certain information through the use of "cookies" when you
                    use the Service. Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive at the request of a website.
                    Among other things, cookies help us to improve the Service and your experience. If we link
                    cookies to any personally identifiable information, we will treat this information as personally
                    identifiable information. If you wish to block, erase, or be warned of cookies, please refer to your
                    browser manufacturer to learn about these functions. However, if you choose to remove or reject
                    cookies, this could affect certain features or services made available via the Service.
                
                <br><br>
                
                    The use of cookies by our partners is not covered by our privacy statement. We do not have
                    access or control over these cookies.
                
                <br><br>
                
                    We may use Web beacons or similar technology on the Service and in our Apps. We do not tie
                    the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information.
                    Web beacons are small, invisible graphic images that may be used on the Service or in emails
                    relating to the Service to collect certain information and monitor user activity on the Service,
                    such as to count visits, understand usage effectiveness and to tell if an email has been opened
                    and acted upon. Such technologies are used to collect aggregate statistics related to usage of the
                    Service and do not collect personally identifiable information.
                
                <br><br>
                
                    Personally identifiable information will be stored on secured servers, and we may store and
                    process personally identifiable information in the United States and other countries.
                
                <br><br>
                <strong>How Do We Use the Personally Identifiable Information We Collect?</strong>
                <br><br>

                    purposes described in this Policy or elsewhere on the Service or in the Apps. For example, we
                    may use personally identifiable information we collect:
                    <ul class="privacy-ul">
                        <li>to process and complete any transactions in connection with the Service and Apps;</li>

                            Service and Apps (such as providing content or features that match interests), and to
                            increase the Service's or Apps’ functionality and user friendliness;</li>
                        <li>to send you confirmations, updates, security alerts, additional information about our

                            your use of, and our administration and operation of, the Service or Apps. When sending
                          marketing information about our services or products, we will only use your email address
                          used during registration; we will not use other email addresses you may have provided to us,
                          for instance in a feedback form, to send marketing emails;</li>
                        <li>to notify you about important changes to the Service and Apps.</li>
                    </ul>
                
                <b>What Personally Identifiable Information Do We Share With Third-Parties?</b><br><br>
                We will not knowingly share the personally identifiable information we collect from you through
                    the Service or Apps with third-parties, except as described in this Policy or on the Service or
                    Apps. For example, we may share personally identifiable information as follows:

                        <li>with vendors, consultants, and other service providers such as a credit card processing
