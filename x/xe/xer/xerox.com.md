# Xerox Corporation Privacy Policy

  


**This is the Online Privacy Policy of Xerox Corporation in the United States.**

This privacy policy covers the websites belonging to Xerox Corporation (“Xerox” or “we”) in the United States. It does not cover the websites of Xerox subsidiaries or affiliates who publish their own policies.

At Xerox, privacy on the Internet means that: 

  * Xerox informs its website users (“you”) how it uses personally identifiable information that is collected online;
  * Xerox maintains confidentiality and security safeguards for personally identifiable information;
  * You have control over personally identifiable information you decide to submit to Xerox; and
  * You can opt-out of receiving commercial email from Xerox at any time.



Xerox maintains the information it receives online in strict confidence; information you submit to Xerox is not sold to or shared with third parties, except our subsidiaries, affiliates, agents and partners as described in this policy. 

Xerox reserves the right to notify you about administrative matters that pertain to your Xerox products or services. We may disclose your personally identifiable information, as required by law or regulation, in connection with law enforcement, fraud prevention, or other legal action; or if Xerox reasonably believes it is necessary to protect Xerox, our customers, or the public. Although we do not currently anticipate a change in our corporate status, in the event of a merger or acquisition of the company or a substantial portion of its assets, Xerox may disclose, transfer or sell personal information collected online to the surviving or acquiring party, respectively. Personal information collected online will remain subject to promises made in this Online Privacy Policy. 

If you would like to contact Xerox without submitting personally identifiable information online, you can reach a Xerox representative by calling 1-800-ASK-XEROX.
