The personal data we collect can include the following:

**Name and Contact Data**. Your first and last name, email address, postal address, phone number and other similar contact data in order to communicate with you, process orders or provide you with products or services. We may also collect your employer name, if you are procuring products or services on behalf of an organization, and information related to your prior purchases and online buying preferences. Some forms may ask for your customer number or product details such as a serial number.

**Credentials**. Passwords, password hints and similar security information used for authentication and account access.

**Payment Data**. Data necessary to process your payment if you make purchases, such as your credit card number and the security code associated with your payment card.

Precise location data can be Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data (e.g. GPS), as well as data identifying nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi hotspots, that we collect when you enable location-based products or features. Imprecise location data includes, for example, a location derived from your device or data that indicates where you are located with less precision, such as a city or postal code.

**Social Media Data.** We may provide social media features that enable you to share information with your social networks. Your use of these features may result in the collection or sharing of information about you by the social networking site. Please review the privacy policies and settings of social networks you use to understand their practices.

**Job Applications/CVs/Resumes**. Information on job applications/CVs/resumes which you provide to us if you submit a job application to Xerox either directly or indirectly. You acknowledge that your application may include sensitive personal data. Xerox uses this information in order to evaluate your application and perform related employment activities.

**Feedback and Product Reviews.** Information you provide to us and the content of messages you send to us, such as feedback and product reviews you write, blog posts or questions and information you provide for customer support. When you contact us via our website, a Xerox application or a Help Desk, such as for customer support, phone conversations or chat sessions with our representatives may be monitored and recorded. Your feedback, posts and reviews will be used to seek improvements in our products and services.

**Website Browsing.** Information about your visits to our websites and your browsing patters. This may include data about your device, including Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, and regional and language settings. This is more fully described under the section entitled “Cookies, Web Beacons and Privacy Choices” below. We collect this information to determine such things as the number of visitors to various parts of our websites, to personalize your experience on our sites, and tailor our interactions with you.

**Products.** Certain Xerox products collect data, such as product registration, meter reads, supply levels, equipment configuration and settings, software version, and fault codes. Xerox uses this information for product improvement, billing, report generation, supplies replenishment and support services.

**Third Party Sources**. We also obtain data from third-parties. These third-party sources vary over time, but they are sources deemed credible by us and may be publicly available or available on a commercial basis. They can include:

  * Data brokers from which we purchase demographic data to supplement the data we collect;
  * Social networks when you grant permission to a Xerox product to access your data on one or more networks;
  * Designated entities within your business or enterprise (such as a member of your IT department) in the course of providing services to you;
  * Partners with whom we offer branded services or engage in joint marketing activities. If you purchase Xerox services or products from a Xerox partner we may receive certain information about your purchase from that partner;
  * Fraud prevention agencies or credit reporting agencies in connection with credit determinations; and
  * Publicly available sources such as open government databases or other data in the public domain.



## How We Use Personal Data

We collect and process personal data with your consent, as required by law, or as necessary to fulfill the legitimate interests of Xerox, including to: (i) provide you with products and services; (ii) manage, administer and operate our business; (iii) meet our contractual and legal obligations; (iv) carry out direct marketing; (v) prevent fraud; and (vi) protect the security of our systems and our customers.

Personal data that is submitted in a business capacity may be merged with available business database directories. Xerox uses personal data to:

  * respond to your questions and communicate with you;
  * provide customer support;
  * share news, updates, or helpful tips about Xerox products and services;
  * enable online shopping;
  * inform you of special promotions and other advertising;
  * allow you to sign up for online services;
  * create reseller partnerships;
  * receive and evaluate job applications;
  * customize, analyze, and improve our products, services, technologies, communications and relationships with you;
  * deliver products and services requested by you;
  * notify you about administrative matters that pertain to your Xerox products or services; and
  * in the event of a merger or acquisition of Xerox or a substantial portion of its assets, disclose or transfer personal data to the surviving or acquiring party, respectively.



We share your personal data as necessary to complete a transaction or provide a product or service you have requested or authorised. For example, when you provide payment data to make a purchase, we will share your payment data with banks and other entities that process payment transactions or provide other financial services, and for fraud prevention and credit risk reduction.

We share personal data among Xerox affiliates and subsidiaries to efficiently manage the operation of our business. We also share personal data with vendors or agents working on our behalf for the purposes described in this statement or in our contracts with you. For example, companies we've hired to provide customer service support or assist in maintaining and servicing products via our systems and services may need access to personal data to provide those functions. In such cases, these companies are required by contract to abide by our data privacy and security requirements and are not allowed to use personal data they receive from us for any other purpose. We may also disclose personal data as part of a corporate transaction such as a merger or sale of assets.

Finally, we will transfer or disclose personal data when we have a good faith belief that doing so is necessary to:

  * Comply with applicable law or respond to valid legal process, including from law enforcement or other government agencies;
  * Protect our customers, for example to prevent attempts to defraud users of our products, or to help prevent the loss of life or serious injury of anyone; or
  * Operate and maintain the security of our products, including to prevent or stop an attack on our computer systems or networks.



## Where We Process and Store Personal Data

The criteria used to determine the retention periods include: (i) how long personal data is needed to provide our products or operate our business; (ii) whether the personal data is of a sensitive type; and (iii) whether Xerox is subject to a legal, contractual or similar obligation to retain the data.

## Your Rights Regarding Personal Data

You have choices about the data we collect. When you are asked to provide personal data, you may decline. However if you choose not to provide data that is necessary to provide a product or feature, you may not be able to use that product or feature.

## Children

Xerox does not direct any part of its website to children under 13 years old (or such age as a child is defined by local law if higher) and does not knowingly collect personal data from children or target its website or products to children.

## Security of Personal Data

Xerox is committed to protecting the security of your personal data and maintains strict access control over it. We utilize reasonable and appropriate physical, technical and administrative procedures to safeguard personal information we collect and process. Only authorized Xerox personnel, and those of our subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, and partners are allowed to handle information submitted to Xerox.

Xerox websites store personal data in password-protected environments on servers that are subject to Xerox's information security policies, standards, and procedures. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal data from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. For example, we store the personal data you provide on computer systems that have limited access and are in controlled facilities. When we transmit sensitive personal data such as a password over the Internet, we protect it through the use of encryption.

To ensure that you can purchase with confidence from Xerox websites, Xerox protects credit card information submitted online with industry-standard encryption technology or tokenization.

## Our Agents and Partners Protect Personal Data

When you provide personal data to Xerox, it may be necessary to transfer personal data to our subsidiaries, affiliates, agents or partners, who then fulfill the orders or provide the services. Xerox requires that its subsidiaries, affiliates, agents and partners handle personal data with the same concern for personal data privacy as Xerox.
