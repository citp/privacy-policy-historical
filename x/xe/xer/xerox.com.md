| While we at Xerox are pleased to offer convenient services and shopping options online in the United States, we are also mindful to protect the confidentiality of the personally identifiable information we receive. 

**Our agents and partners protect personally identifiable information.**

When a customer purchases equipment or supplies or arranges for service online from Xerox it may be necessary to transfer personally identifiable information to an independent Xerox-authorized agent or partner, who then fills the order. Xerox requires that its independent agents and partners handle personally identifiable information with the same concern for personal privacy as Xerox. 

Whenever Xerox transfers personally identifiable information to its agents and partners, it is with the understanding that the information should be used for the sole purpose of fulfilling the customer's request and that the information should be kept confidential and secure at all times. 

In some instances, when Xerox transfers personally identifiable information to one of its authorized agents or partners, that agent or partner may need to share information with an unaffiliated third party for the purpose of completing an order or providing a service. 

**Xerox gets your consent before sending you additional information.**

Xerox may send commercial email to customers who have expressed an interest in its products and services. If you contact Xerox over the Web, you can choose to receive commercial email or opt-out of such email by using the checkbox provided on our Web forms. Some forms on our site have no opt-out box. That is because those forms are "reply only" forms used only to respond to your particular request. If you receive commercial email from Xerox and wish to discontinue these mailings, you may unsubscribe at [www.xerox.com/unsubscribe](http://www.xerox.com/go/xrx/template/018u.jsp?Xcntry=USA&Xlang=en_US), or you may send an email to [customer.privacy@email.ebusiness.xerox.com](mailto:customer.privacy@email.ebusiness.xerox.com?subject=Remove) with the word "Remove" in the subject line. You may also mail an unsubscribe request to:
