**Xero collects Your personal information**

Xero is a provider of beautiful online accounting software that’s simple, smart, and secure and gives business owners and their advisors real-time visibility of a business’ financial position.

The Service involves the storage of Data about a company or individual. That Data can include personal information. “Personal information” is information about an identifiable individual, and may include information such as the individual’s name, email address, telephone number, bank account details, taxation details, and accounting and financial information.

**Xero may receive personal information from You about others**

Through Your use of the Service, Xero may also collect information from You about someone else. If You provide Xero with personal information about someone else, You must ensure that You are authorized to disclose that information to Xero and that, without Xero taking any further steps required by applicable data protection or privacy laws, Xero may collect, use and disclose such information for the purposes described in this Policy.

This means that You must take reasonable steps to ensure the individual concerned is aware of and/or consents to the various matters detailed in this Policy, including the fact that their personal information is being collected, the purposes for which that information is being collected, the intended recipients of that information, the individual's right to obtain access to that information, Xero’s identity, and how to contact Xero.

Where requested to do so by Xero, You must also assist Xero with any requests by the individual to access or update the personal information You have collected from them and entered into the Service.

**Xero collects, holds, and uses Your personal information for limited purposes**

Xero collects Your personal information so that we can provide You with the Service and any related services You may request. In doing so, Xero may use the personal information we have collected from You for purposes related to the Services including to:

  * verify Your identity,

  * notify You of new or changed services offered in relation to the Service,
  * carry out marketing or training relating to the Service,

You should notify us as soon as possible if You become aware of any misuse of Your password, and immediately change your password within the Service or via the [“Forgotten Password”](https://login.xero.com/ForgottenPassword) process.

**Xero can aggregate Your non-personally identifiable data**

By using the Service, You agree that Xero can access, aggregate and use non-personally identifiable data Xero has collected from You. This data will in no way identify You or any other individual.

Xero may use this aggregated non-personally identifiable data to:

  * assist us to better understand how our customers are using the Service,
  * provide our customers with further information regarding the uses and benefits of the Service,
  * enhance small business productivity, including by creating useful business insights from that aggregated data and allowing You to benchmark Your business’ performance against that aggregated data, and
  * otherwise to improve the Service.



**Xero holds your personal information on servers located in the United States of America (the U.S.)**

We use top tier, third party data hosting providers’ (Rackspace, AWS, and Microsoft Azure) to host our Services on servers located in the U.S. If you are a non-U.S. resident, this means that your personal information will be transferred to the U.S.

We have in place transfer mechanisms with all our third party data hosting providers that satisfy the requirements relating to Xero’s transfer of data from the European Union to the U.S.

By entering personal information into the Services, you consent to that personal information being hosted on servers located in the U.S. While your personal information will be stored on servers located in the U.S., it will remain within Xero’s effective control at all times. Each data hosting provider’s role is limited to providing a hosting and storage service to Xero, and we’ve taken steps to ensure that our data hosting providers do not have access to, and use the necessary level of protection for, Your personal information. They do not control, and are not permitted to access or use your personal information, except for the limited purpose of storing the information. This means that, for the purposes of Australian privacy legislation and Australian users, Xero does not currently “disclose” personal information to third parties located overseas.

If You do not want Your personal information to be transferred to a server located in the U.S., You should not provide Xero with Your personal information or use the Service.

**Xero takes steps to protect your personal information**

Xero is committed to protecting the security of Your personal information and we take all reasonable precautions to protect it from unauthorized access, modification or disclosure. Your personal information is stored on secure servers that have SSL Certificates issued by leading certificate authorities Entrust & GTE Cybertrust, and all Data transferred between You and the Service is encrypted. You can find out more about our security arrangements and our data protection measures on our [security page](https://web.archive.org/us/about/security).

However, the Internet is not in itself a secure environment and we cannot give an absolute assurance that Your information will be secure at all times. Transmission of personal information over the Internet is at Your own risk and You should only enter, or instruct the entering of, personal information to the Service within a secure environment.

We will advise You at the first reasonable opportunity upon discovering or being advised of a security breach where Your personal information is lost, stolen, accessed, used, disclosed, copied, modified, or disposed of by any unauthorized persons or in any unauthorized manner.

**Xero only discloses Your Personal Information in limited circumstances**

Xero will only disclose the personal information You have provided to us to entities outside the Xero group of companies if it is necessary and appropriate to facilitate the purpose for which Your personal information was collected pursuant to this Policy, including the provision of the Service.

Xero will not otherwise disclose Your personal information to a third party unless You have provided Your express consent. However, You should be aware that Xero may be required to disclose Your personal information without Your consent in order to comply with any court orders, subpoenas, or other legal process or investigation including by tax authorities, if such disclosure is required by law. Where possible and appropriate, we will notify You if we are required by law to disclose Your personal information.

You may request access to the information we hold about You, or request that we update or correct any personal information we hold about You, by setting out Your request in writing and sending it to us at [privacy@xero.com](mailto:privacy@xero.com).

Xero will process Your request as soon as reasonably practicable, provided we are not otherwise prevented from doing so on legal grounds. If we are unable to meet Your request, we will let you know why. For example, it may be necessary for us to deny Your request if it would have an unreasonable impact on the privacy or affairs of other individuals, or if it is not reasonable and practicable for us to process Your request in the manner You have requested. In some circumstances, it may be necessary for us to seek to arrange access to Your personal information through a mutually agreed intermediary (for example, the Subscriber).

We’ll only keep Your personal information for as long as we require it for the purposes of providing You with the Service. However, we may also be required to keep some of Your personal information for specified periods of time, for example under certain laws relating to corporations, money laundering, and financial reporting legislation.

**Xero uses cookies**

In providing the Service, Xero utilizes "cookies". A cookie is a small text file that is stored on Your computer for record-keeping purposes. A cookie does not identify You personally or contain any other information about You but it does identify Your computer.

We and some of our affiliates and third-party service providers may use a combination of “persistent cookies” (cookies that remain on Your hard drive for an extended period of time) and “session ID cookies” (cookies that expire when You close Your browser) on the Website to, for example, track overall site usage, and track and report on Your use and interaction with ad impressions and ad services.
