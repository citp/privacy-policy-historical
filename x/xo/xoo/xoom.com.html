    with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our
    agreements.</p>

<h2>HOW WE SHARE INFORMATION WITH OTHERS</h2>

    permission to do so. Nevertheless, we may share information about
    you (including nonpublic, personal information) with:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Third-party service providers under contract with Xoom that
        help us with our business operations, such as transaction

        and services, such as long-distance telephone minutes, gift cards

        transferred assets. We shall notify you in the event of such an
        occurrence, as well as any choices you may have regarding your
        personal information, by placing a notice on our website.
    </li>
    <li>Law enforcement, government officials or other third parties,
        but only
        <ul>
            <li>in connection with a formal request, subpoena, court order, or
                similar legal procedure
            </li>

            <li>when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to
                comply with the law, prevent physical harm or financial loss,
