We may send "cookies" to your computer primarily to enhance your online experience. "Cookies" are files that can identify you as a unique customer and store your personal preferences as well as technical information (including click through and click stream data). Cookies can either be permanent (i.e., they remain on your computer until you delete them) or temporary (i.e., they last only until you close your browser). We may also use tracking systems such as "web beacons," which monitor your use of our websites. Tracking systems (web beacons or web bugs) are small strings of code that provide a method for delivering a graphic image on a web page for the purpose of transferring data, such as the Internet Protocol address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the web beacon appears, the Uniform Resource Locator of the page on which the web beacon appears, the time the page containing the web beacon was viewed, the types of browser that fetched the web beacon and the identification number of any cookie on the computer previously placed by that server. When corresponding with you via HTML capable e-mail, web beacons let us know whether you received and opened our e-mail.

 On their own, cookies or web beacons do not contain or reveal any personally identifiable information. However, if you choose to furnish one of our websites with personally identifiable information, this information can be linked to the data stored in the cookies/web beacons. Through your ongoing use of the Website and mobile application, you specifically agree to our described use of cookies and web beacons. You may adjust the privacy and security settings of your browser or mobile device to reject cookies from us or from any other site. Additionally, by setting your web browser to display HTML e-mails as text only, you may be able to prevent the use of some web beacons. Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for more information, or consult the instructions set forth by your mobile service provider or mobile device manufacturer.
