This Privacy Policy was last updated on June 28, 2011.

XpressBet respects your individual privacy. This privacy policy (the "Privacy Policy") embodies our commitment to its protection through adherence to fair electronic information practices. This Privacy Policy puts You in control of how your personal information is processed. You have our promise that we will not electronically process your personal information in any way that is incompatible with this Privacy Policy.

### COLLECTION AND USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

We use information about You for purposes of monitoring and improving our internal operations, as well as to ensure we (i) bill You properly, (ii) administer your Account in accordance with your agreements with us, (iii) properly perform the services You have requested, and (iv) comply with applicable state and federal laws and regulations. We also use the information we collect to monitor and improve our internal operations, as well as to improve the experience of users in our network of web sites. For example, we may correlate Web Site traffic information with data about individual users. This data helps us to determine how much our customers use parts of this Web Site, allowing us to enhance it to fit the needs of as many of our customers as possible. We may also break down overall usage statistics according to customers' domain names, browser types, and MIME types by reading this information from the browser string (information contained in every user's browser). XPRESSBET owns and operates this Web Site. XPRESSBET does not collect personal information about You except when You provide it to XPRESSBET on a voluntary basis.

Personal information is collected from You at this Web Site when You complete a survey, request to be notified or request information, products or services.

You specifically acknowledge that XPRESSBET will be providing Your personal information to a third party provider for the verification of Your age, residency and background for the purposes of providing you an account with XPRESSBET.

Your contact information is used to contact You when necessary. It is also used to identify what future products or services You may require. XPRESSBET will not sell Your personal information to third parties. We use the information we collect to direct important notices and information affecting your Account or services on this Web Site as well as to provide general information that may be of interest to You which may include newsletters, surveys, contest announcements, and information about our service or product offerings or the offerings of our business affiliates. You may opt-out of receiving information from us simply by notifying us by writing to the Director of Operations, 200 Race Track Road, Building 26, Washington, PA 15301 or by e-mailing us at customerservice@xpressbet.com or in accordance with the opt-out instructions contained in any information message You receive from us. Note, however, that in order to fulfill our service obligations to You, we must continue sending You notices and other important information affecting your Account or services. XPRESSBET reserves the right to provide Your personal information to a company or individual employed by XPRESSBET to perform functions on its behalf, to another company or person for the development, enhancement, marketing or provision of XPRESSBET's products or services, to an agent or third party retained by XPRESSBET in connection with XPRESSBET’s administration or the provision of XPRESSBET's products or services or an agent used by XPRESSBET to evaluate Your creditworthiness or to collect Your Account. If your account is in arrears for any amount in excess of 30 days, XPRESSBET also reserves the right to transfer any and all of Your personal information to third parties for any reason whatsoever. If XPRESSBET provides Your personal information to a third party then that third party will be subject to confidentiality obligations with respect to Your personal information. We destroy customer information that is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it is collected unless there is a legitimate request or order to inspect the information still outstanding or the information remains in routine records that are periodically discarded under our document retention policies.

The information You have provided us is maintained in our management information system and billing systems, and is updated as new information is added. Accounting and billing records are retained for ten years for tax and accounting purposes or until the relevant income tax years for which the document was created have been closed for income tax purposes and/or all appeals have been exhausted. Records may remain on file even after You have terminated Your Account. Subject to applicable law, we may also keep records to facilitate collection and to evaluate credit worthiness.
