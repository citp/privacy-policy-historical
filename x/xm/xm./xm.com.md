# XM Privacy Policy

## Introduction

As part of our daily business operations, we need to collect personal information from our clients and prospective clients in order to provide them with our products and services and ensure that we can meet their needs when providing these products and services, as well as when providing them with the respective information.

Your privacy is of utmost important to us, and it is our policy to safeguard and respect the confidentiality of information and the privacy of individuals. This Privacy Policy sets out how Trading Point of Financial Instruments Ltd (the “Company” or “XM”) collects, uses and manages the personal information we receive from you, or a third party, in connection with our provision of services to you or which we collect from your use of our services and/or our website (i.e., www.xm.com) and/or any other related websites and applications including, among others, the Company’s Members Area. The Privacy Policy also informs you of your rights with respect to the processing of your personal information.

Our Privacy Policy is reviewed regularly to ensure that any new obligations and technologies, as well as any changes to our business operations and practices are taken into consideration, as well as that it remains abreast of the changing regulatory environment. Any personal information we hold will be governed by our most recent Privacy Policy.

Please note that if you are an employee of the Company, a contractor to the Company or a third-party service provider, your personal information will be used in connection with your employment contract or your contractual relationship, whichever applies.

This Privacy Policy applies to the processing activities performed by XM to the personal data of its clients and its potential clients, website visitors and employees. This Privacy Policy does not apply to websites operated by any other organisations or other third parties.

## Who we are

Trading Point of Financial Instruments Ltd is a licenced Cyprus Investment Firm (CIF), regulated by the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (CySEC) under license number 120/10, with its registered office at 12, Richard & Verengaria Street Araouzos Castle Court, 3rd Floor 3042 Limassol, Cyprus P.O.Box 50626, 3608 Limassol, Cyprus. 

Trading Point of Financial Instruments Ltd is part of the XM Group. Each entity of the XM Group has its own separate Privacy Policy. Such entities operate their own websites and as such, if you are interested in learning about how such entities process your personal data, please refer to their corresponding privacy statements which may be found on their specific websites.

## Safeguarding the confidentiality of your personal information and protecting your privacy

The Company respects the privacy of any users who access its website(s), and it is therefore committed to taking all reasonable steps to safeguard any existing or prospective clients, applicants and website visitors.

The Company keeps any personal data of its clients and its potential clients in accordance with the applicable data protection laws and regulations.

We have the necessary and appropriate technical and organisational measures and procedures in place to ensure that your information remains secure at all times. We regularly train and raise awareness for all of our employees to the importance of maintaining, safeguarding and respecting your personal information and privacy. We regard breaches of individuals’ privacy very seriously and will impose appropriate disciplinary measures, including dismissal from employment. We have also appointed a Data Protection Officer to ensure that our Company manages/processes your personal information in compliance with the applicable data protection laws and regulations and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. 

The personal information you provide us with when registering yourself as a user of the Company’s website(s) or of its services is classified as registered information, which is protected in several different ways. You can access your registered information after logging in to the Members Area by entering a username and a password that you select. It is your responsibility to make sure that your password is only known to you and not disclosed to anyone else. Registered information is securely stored in a safe location, and only authorised personnel have access to it via a username and a password. All personal information is transferred to the Company over a secure 128-bit SSL connection and thus all reasonable measures are taken to prevent unauthorised parties from viewing any such information. Personal information provided to the Company that does not classify as registered information is also kept in a safe place and accessible by authorised personnel only via a username and a password.

Transmission of information via the internet is not always completely secure, but the Company tries to protect your personal data by taking significant precautions. Once we have received your information, we will apply procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.

## What personal information do we collect?

In order to open an account with us, you must first complete and submit an application form to us by completing the required information. By completing this application form, you are requested to disclose personal information in order to enable the Company to assess your application and comply with the relevant laws (including their regulations).

  * profession and employment details;

  * authentication data (e.g. signature);

  * location data;

  * verification information, which includes information necessary to verify your identity such as a passport or driver’s license (examples also include background information we receive about you from public records or from other entities not affiliated with us). Furthermore, we may collect other identifiable information, such as identification numbers and/or passport/tax registration numbers;

  * any other information customarily used to identify you and about your trading experience which is relevant to us providing our services to you.




We obtain this information in a number of ways through your use of our services, including through any of our websites, apps, the account opening applications, our demo sign-up forms, webinar sign-up forms, subscribing to news updates, and from information provided in the course of ongoing customer service communications. We may also collect this information about you from third parties such your payment providers and through publicly available sources. We also keep records of your trading behaviour, including records regarding the following:

  * products you trade with us and their performance;

  * historical data about the trades and investments you have made, including the amount invested;

We may ask you for other personal information voluntarily from time to time (for example, through market research or surveys).

If you choose not to provide the information, we need to fulfil your request for a specific product or service, we may not be able to provide you with the requested product or service.

We may record any communications, electronic, by telephone, in person or otherwise, that we have with you in relation to the services we provide to you and our business relationship with you. These recordings will be our sole property and will constitute evidence of the communications between us. Such telephone conversations may be recorded without the use of a warning tone or any other further notice. Further, if you visit any of our offices or premises, we may have CCTV which will record your image.

## Lawful basis for processing your personal information and purposes

We may process your personal data on the following bases and for the following purposes:

  1. **Performance of a contract**

We process personal data in order to provide our services and products, as well as information regarding our products and services based on the contractual relationship with our clients (i.e. so as to perform our contractual obligations). In addition, processing of personal data takes place to be able to complete our client on-boarding/acceptance procedures.

In view of the above, we need to verify your identity in order to accept you as our client and we will need to use those details in order to effectively manage your trading account with us. This may include third parties carrying out credit or identity checks on our behalf. The use of your personal information is necessary for us to know who you are as we have a legal obligation to comply with ‘Know Your Customer’ and customer due diligence’ regulatory obligations.

  2. **Compliance with a legal obligation**

There are a number of legal obligations imposed by relevant laws to which we are subject, as well as specific statutory requirements (e.g. anti-money laundering laws, financial services laws, corporation laws, privacy laws and tax laws). There are also various supervisory authorities whose laws and regulations apply to us. Such obligations and requirements impose on us necessary personal data processing activities for credit checks, identity verification, payment processing, compliance with court orders, tax law or other reporting obligations and anti-money laundering controls.

These obligations apply at various times, including client on-boarding/acceptance, payments and systemic checks for risk management.

  3. **For the purposes of safeguarding legitimate interests**

We process personal data so as to safeguard the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party. A legitimate interest is when we have a business or commercial reason to use your information. Despite that, it must not unfairly go against what is right and best for you. Examples of such processing activities include the following:

    * initiating legal claims and preparing our defense in litigation procedures;

    * means and processes we undertake to provide for the Company’s IT and system security, preventing potential crime, asset security, admittance controls and anti-trespassing measures;

    * setting up CCTV systems (e.g. at our premises for security reasons);

    * measures to manage business and for further developing products and services;

    * sharing your personal data within the XM Group for the purpose of updating/verifying your personal data in accordance with the relevant anti-money laundering compliance framework;

    * risk management.

  4. **You have provided your consent**

Our storage and use of your personal data is based on your consent (other than for the reasons described or implied in this policy when your consent is not required). You may revoke consent at any time; however, any processing of personal data prior to the receipt of your revocation will not be affected.

  5. **To assess the appropriateness of our services/products for the Clients**

  6. **To provide you with products and services, or information about our products and services, and to review your ongoing needs**

Once you successfully open a trading account with us, or subscribe to an update or webinar, we will need to use your personal information to perform our services and comply with our obligations to you. It is also in our legitimate interests to try to ensure that we are providing the best products and services so we may periodically review your needs based on our assessment of your personal information to try to ensure that you are getting the benefit of the best possible products and services from us.

  7. **To help us improve our products and services, including customer services, and develop and market new products and services**

We may, from time to time, use personal information provided by you through your use of the services and/or through client surveys to help us improve our products and services. It is in our legitimate interests to use your personal information in this way to try to ensure the highest standards when providing you with our products and services and to continue to be a market leader in the financial services industry.

  8. **To form a profile about you**

We may, from time to time, use personal information provided by you through your use of the services and/or through client surveys to help us improve our products and services.

  9. **To investigate or settle enquiries or disputes**

We may need to use personal information collected from you to investigate issues or to settle disputes with you because it is in our legitimate interests to ensure that issues and disputes get investigated and resolved in a timely and efficient manner.

  10. **To comply with applicable laws, court orders, other judicial process, or the requirements of any applicable regulatory authorities**

We may need to use your personal information to comply with any applicable laws and regulations, court orders or other judicial process, or the requirements of any applicable regulatory authority. We do this not only to comply with our legal obligations but because it may also be in our legitimate interest to do so.

  11. **To send you surveys**

From time to time, we may send you surveys as part of our customer feedback process. It is in our legitimate interest to ask for such feedback to try to ensure that we provide our services and products at the highest standards. However, we may from time to time also ask you to participate in other surveys and if you agree to participate in such surveys we rely on your consent to use the personal information we collect as part of such survey. All responses to any survey we send out whether for customer feedback or otherwise will be aggregated and depersonalised before survey results are shared with any third parties.

  12. **Data analysis**

Our website pages and e-mails may contain web beacons or pixel tags or any other similar type of data analysis tools that allow us to track receipt of correspondence and count the number of users that have visited our webpage or opened our correspondence. We may aggregate your personal information (such as trading history) with the personal information of our other clients on an anonymous basis (that is, with your personal identifiers removed) so that more rigorous statistical analysis of general patterns may lead to us providing better products and services

If your personal information is completely anonymised, we do not require a legal basis as the information will no longer constitute personal information. If your personal information is not in an anonymised form, it is in our legitimate interest to continually evaluate that personal information to ensure that the products and services we provide are relevant to the market.

  13. **Marketing purposes**

We may use your personal information to send you marketing communications by email or phone or other agreed forms (including social media campaigns) to ensure that you are always kept up to date with our latest products and services.

We will also keep records to ensure that you comply with your contractual obligations pursuant to the agreement governing our relationship with you.

  15. **Legal Notifications**

Often the law requires us to advise you of certain changes to products or services or laws. We may need to inform you of changes to the terms or the features of our products or services. We need to process your personal information to send you these legal notifications. You will continue to receive this information from us even if you choose not to receive direct marketing information from us.

  16. **Corporate restructuring**

If we undergo a corporate re-structuring or part, or if all of our business is acquired by a third party, we may need or choose to use your personal information in association with that re-structuring or acquisition. Such use may involve sharing your information as part of a due diligence enquiries or disclosures pursuant to legal agreements. It is our legitimate interest to use your information in this way, provided we comply with any legal obligation we have to you.

  17. **Physical security**

If you enter any of our premises we may record your image on our CCTV for security reasons. We may also take your details to keep a record of who has entered our premises on any given day. It is in our legitimate interest to do this to maintain a safe and secure working environment.

  * a copy of the documents we used in order to comply with our customer due diligence obligations;

  * supporting evidence and records of transactions with you and your relationship with us

We may keep your data for longer than 5 years if we cannot delete it for legal, regulatory or technical reasons.
