We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.  No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

###  **Tracking Technologies**  
 

####  **Cookies**

A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We, and our third party service providers, use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies.  Session cookies make it easier for you to navigate our site and expire when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file.

If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site will be limited. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.

####  **Web Beacons / Gifs**

Our third party web analytics partners employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective.  Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of users.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. The information gathered by clear gifs is not tied to our customers’ personally identifiable information.

###  **Changes to this Privacy Policy**

We may update this privacy statement to reflect changes to our information practices. If we make any material changes we will notify you or our Client by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) or by means of a notice on this Site prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.

####  **Additional Information**

If you submit personal information to any of those sites, your information is governed by their privacy statements. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy statement of any Web site you visit.

 **Blog / Forum**

Our web site offers publicly accessible blogs or community forums. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us via one of the methods listed below.  In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.
