# Privacy Policy | xForceCracks

## What personal data we collect, and why?

We collect information to provide you with the services you have subscribed to, and to personalize and improve your experience using our services.

All this information is stored on secure servers.

We only use personal data that you have given us or collected during your visit to our site or our purchase orders. We do not collect personal information or sell it to external partners. We may share your information with partners but only to provide you with the publication to which you have subscribed or to improve your user experience on the site. We never share your personal information with third parties for their own marketing purposes.

The personal information about you that we collect generally falls into 2 categories:

  * __The information you provide__



We may ask you to provide us with personal information to provide you with the service you expect. We may ask you for your contact information to provide you with your publication or to create an account to access the reserved parts of the site. We may also ask you to enter your payment information so that you can pay for your purchases, and also offer to back them up to facilitate your subsequent orders.

The personal data we ask you to provide, and the reason we ask for it, are clearly indicated at collection points.

  * __The information we collect automatically__



When you visit our site or our purchase orders, we may automatically collect certain information from your device. The data we collect may include information such as your ip address, device type, unique identification number, browser type, and other technical information. We may also collect information about how your device interacted with our site or purchase orders, including the list of pages you accessed and links you clicked on. We collect this information in order to better understand the visitors who visit our website and who look at our order forms, and to identify the content that interests them the most. The use of this information allows us to improve the quality and relevance of our website and services. Some of this information may be collected through the use of cookies and other similar technologies. You will find more information in our [Cookie Usage Policy](http://www.xforce-cracks.com/cookies-policy/)

We may share your information with the following categories of recipients:

  * The Support Companies that provide us with the main services of data processing, such as ensuring the security of our site, and processing data for the purposes described above, or that were presented to you when we collected your data. Publishing Factory (based in Lausanne, Switzerland) provides us with most data processing services, including hosting and storing our database on their servers.
  * Trusted Third-Party Companies that provide additional data processing services, analyze data, provide marketing services, and manage credit card processing. These third parties have only limited access to the data they need when performing their services, and can not use them for any other purpose. In addition, they have a contractual obligation to use them in accordance with this Privacy Policy and in accordance with applicable data protection legislation.
  * Legal or similar bodies, since we believe that the transmission of information is necessary (i) in case of legal obligation or (ii) to establish and defend our legitimate rights, and

## Data retention
