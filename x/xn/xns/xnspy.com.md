# XNSPY Privacy Policy – How and what information is collected

This Privacy Policy governs the manner, in which XNSPY collects, uses, maintains and discloses information collected from the users (hereinafter referred to as “User” or “Users”) of the http://www.XNSPY.com Website (hereinafter referred to as “Site”). This Privacy Policy applies to the Site and all the products and services offered by XNSPY. 

### INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE

We gather two types of information: (1) personally identifiable information that you supply voluntarily when you register for interactive services, order other products or services, or enter certain other areas of our Web sites as noted below in this Privacy Policy and (2) aggregate tracking and site usage information that we gather automatically as you access our Site. 

### Personally Identifiable Information 

We may collect personally identifiable information from Users in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, when Users visit the Site, register, place an order, subscribe to the newsletter, respond to a survey, fill out a form, and in connection with other activities, services, features or resources we make available on our Site. Users may be asked for, as appropriate, name, email address, mailing address, phone number, credit card information, and social security number. Users may, however, visit our Site anonymously. We will collect personally identifiable information from Users only if they voluntarily submit such information to us. Users can always refuse to supply personally identifiable information, except that it may prevent them from engaging in certain Site-related activities. 

Anyone can access our Site, but there are certain areas and services that require registration or provision of certain personal information if accessed, such as by way of example: entering premium content areas, placing advertisements online and making other online purchases, signing up for e-mail newsletters, promotions, contests, sweepstakes or special offers, or participating in reader forums, message boards, chats and reader surveys. If you choose to make a purchase or use such areas, we will ask for certain personally identifiable information, which may include name, mailing address, valid e-mail address and other personal information. Based upon the personally identifiable information you provide us at registration, we may send you a welcoming e-mail to verify your username and password. We will also communicate with you in response to your inquiries, regarding any information or services you request, and to manage your "account". We will communicate with you by e-mail or other method as directed by you. If you decline to supply or maintain with us certain information while using our Web sites, please understand that you may not be able to use or participate in some or all of the features offered through the Site. 

It is our policy to use the personally identifiable information we acquire at our Site for internal business uses only and to provide content, products and services to you that you value and request. We do not authorize the use of your personal information by any third party (other than XNSPY business services providers discussed in the next section, or, under exceptional conditions as described under "Legal Matters" below). We operate and maintain a variety of online security measures to safeguard and keep your information private. 

### Links to Other Sites 

Our Users may find advertising or other content on our Site that is linked to the sites and services of our partners, suppliers, advertisers, sponsors, licensors and other third parties. We do not control the content or links that appear on these sites and are not responsible for the practices employed by the Sites linked to or from our Site. In addition, these sites or services, including their content and links, may change occasionally. These sites and services may have their own privacy policies and customer service policies. Your browsing through and interacting with any other Site, including Sites, which are linked to our Site, is subject to that Site’s own terms and policies. If you submit personal information to any of those Sites, your information is governed by their privacy policies. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any Site you visit. 

### Non-personally Identifiable Information

We may collect non-personally identifiable information about Users whenever they interact with our Site. Non-personally identifiable information may include the browser name, the type of computer and technical information about User’s means of connection to our Site, such as the operating system and Internet service providers utilized and other similar information. 

### WEB-BROWSER COOKIES 

Our Site may use “cookies” to enhance User experience. User’s web browser places cookies on their hard drive for the purpose of keeping records and tracking information about them. Users may choose to set their web-browser to refuse cookies, or to alert them when cookies are being sent. If they do so, Users need to remember that some parts of the Site may not function properly.

### OTHER AGGREGATE INFORMATION 

If we gather demographic information from you (for example, your age, education level or household income), we will not share that information in a manner that identifies you as an individual with any other third party. Any information that might be shared with third parties will be aggregate information only ("aggregate" meaning demographic information speaking only to the broad characteristics of a group), unless we are required to release additional information under conditions described in next section "Legal Matters". 

### LEGAL MATTERS 

"XNSPY" considers your use of the service to be private.

Failure to do so is likely to result in violation of applicable law and may result in severe monetary and criminal penalties imposed on the violator.
