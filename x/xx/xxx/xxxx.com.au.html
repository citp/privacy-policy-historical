<p><strong>About this Policy</strong></p>
<p>Lion Pty Ltd (“Lion” or “we” “us” or “our”) is committed to protecting the privacy of any personal information it holds about individuals in accordance with the applicable laws. “Personal information” is information about an identifiable individual, as defined by applicable law. &nbsp;Lion has implemented measures to comply with its obligations under the relevant Australian and New Zealand privacy<em> </em>laws.</p>
<p>This policy forms part of our Terms and Conditions for use of this website, which you should also read</p>
<link to="" t&amp;cs="">.&nbsp; Privacy statements in relation to this website and in relation to calls received by our Consumer Enquiries line are also incorporated into this policy.<p></p>
<p><strong>Why does Lion collect my personal information? </strong></p>
<p>Lion collects your personal information to allow it to perform its business functions. For example, Lion may collect your personal information to enable you to participate in a Lion promotion or to allow Lion to market its current and future products and services to you.</p>
<p><strong>What personal information does Lion collect?</strong></p>
<p>The types of personal information Lion collects will depend on the nature of your dealings with Lion and may (but does not always) include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your name;</li>
<li>Gender;</li>
<li>Date of birth;</li>
<li>Address;</li>
<li>Personal and/or work contact details (e.g. phone numbers and email addresses);</li>
<li>Any information about you which you provide through promotions, competitions or customer surveys; and/or</li>
<li>Payment details (e.g. credit card number).</li>
</ul>
<div>
<p>If necessary, Lion may also ask you to provide it with additional personal information from time to time, including when you call our Consumer Enquiries line.</p>
<p><strong>What if you don’t provide Lion the personal information it requires?</strong></p>
<p>If you can’t, or won’t, provide Lion with the personal information it reasonably requires, Lion may be unable to provide you with the information, goods or services you have requested.</p>
<p><strong>How does Lion collect my personal information?</strong></p>
<p>Lion tries to collect personal information directly from you. That collection generally occurs when you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Request information from, or have dealings directly with Lion or one of its related companies;</li>
<li>Participate in a competition or trade promotion conducted by Lion or one of its related companies;</li>
<li>Participate in a survey conducted by Lion or one of its related companies;</li>
<li>Purchase tickets or merchandise from a website operated by Lion or one of its related companies;</li>
<li>Access or request information from Lion’s website or the website of one of its related companies; or</li>
<li>Provide information to Lion’s customer service call centre.</li>
</ul>
<p>In some circumstances however, Lion may also collect your personal information from third parties, but where it does so, it will ensure that it acts in accordance with relevant privacy laws.</p>
<p>Lion will take reasonable steps to ensure that you are aware of the purposes for which it collects your personal information.</p>
<p><strong>How does Lion use my personal information?</strong></p>
<p>Lion uses your personal information for purposes including (but not limited to):</p>
<ul>
<li>Providing you with the Lion goods or services you request;</li>
<li>Promoting and marketing Lion’s current and future products and services to you;</li>
<li>Informing you of upcoming events, special promotions and offers, discounts and other matters which Lion considers may be of interest to you;</li>
<li>Conducting research (including but not limited to client surveys) concerning Lion’s current and future products or services; and</li>
<li>To improve the operation or navigation of Lion’s website.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lion may also use your personal information for other purposes not listed above which will be made clear to you at the time Lion collects that information, or for such purposes as may be required or permitted by law.</p>
<p>If Lion uses your personal information for direct marketing purposes, all correspondence sent to you by Lion will give you the opportunity to “opt out” of receiving any further direct marketing correspondence.</p>
<p><strong>Will Lion give your personal information to anyone else?</strong></p>
<p>In providing you the information, goods or services you request, Lion may be required to disclose your personal information to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lion’s related companies (including those located in Australia and New Zealand); and</li>
<li>Lion’s consultants, contractors and service providers performing services including (but not limited to) promotions agencies, advertising agencies, legal and accounting services, credit reporting, mail-house, transport, prize providers and printing services.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other than those third parties referred to above, Lion will not disclose your personal information to any other third party unless it has reasonable grounds to believe:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have authorised Lion to do so;</li>
<li>Your safety, or the safety of others in the community, is at risk; or</li>
<li>Lion is required or permitted by law to do so.</li>
</ul>
<p>If Lion provides your personal information to a third party, Lion generally requires the third party to protect your personal information in the same way Lion does.</p>
<p><strong>Is my personal information secure?</strong></p>
<p>Lion takes reasonable steps to ensure personal information it holds about you is protected from risks such as loss, unauthorised access, use, destruction, modification or disclosure.</p>
<p>No data transmission over the internet is totally secure. As a result, any personal information you send to Lion over the Internet (including via email) is sent at your own risk.</p>
<p><strong>Your rights of access and correction </strong></p>
<p>The accuracy of your personal information is important. Lion takes reasonable steps to ensure personal information it holds about you is accurate, complete, up-to-date, relevant and not misleading. If you believe that any personal information Lion holds about you is incorrect, please contact us on 1800 677 852 or <a onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/mailto/consumers@lionco.com');" href="mailto:consumers@lionco.com">consumers@lionco.com</a>.</p>
