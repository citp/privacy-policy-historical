			<h1>Lion Nathan Privacy Policy</h1><br>
			<h3>About this Policy</h3>
			<p>Lion Nathan Limited ('Lion Nathan') is  committed to protecting the privacy of any personal information it holds about  individuals in accordance with the applicable laws. Lion Nathan has implemented  measures to comply with its obligations under the relevant Australian and New Zealand  privacy laws.<br>
			  Why does Lion Nathan collect my personal  information?<br>
			  Lion Nathan collects your personal  information to allow it to perform its business functions. For example, Lion  Nathan may collect your personal information to enable you to participate in a  Lion Nathan promotion or to allow Lion Nathan to market its current and future  products and services to you.<br>
			  What personal information does Lion Nathan  collect?<br>
			  The types of personal information Lion  Nathan collects will depend on the nature of your dealings with Lion Nathan and  may (but does not always) include:</p>

			<p>If necessary, Lion Nathan may also ask you  to provide it with additional personal information from time to time.</p>
			<p>Importantly, Lion Nathan does not collect  any personal information it does not need to perform a business function, and  generally it will not collect any information about you without your prior  consent.<br>
			  What if you don't provide Lion Nathan the  personal information it requires?<br>
			  If you can't, or won't, provide Lion Nathan  with the personal information it reasonably requires, Lion Nathan may be unable  to provide you with the information, goods or services you have requested.<br>
			  How does Lion Nathan collect my personal  information?<br>
			  Lion Nathan tries to collect personal  information directly from you. That collection generally occurs when you:</p>
			
			<ul>
			  <li>request information from, or  have dealings directly with Lion Nathan or one of its related companies;</li>
			  <li>participate in a competition or  trade promotion conducted by Lion Nathan or one of its related companies;</li>

			</ul>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>In some circumstances however, Lion Nathan  may also collect your personal information from third parties, but where it  does so, it will ensure that it acts in accordance with relevant privacy laws.</p>
			<p>Lion Nathan will take reasonable steps to  ensure that you are aware of the purposes for which it collects your personal  information.<br>

			  <li>to improve the operation or  navigation of Lion Nathan's website. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>Lion Nathan may also use your personal  information for other purposes not listed above which will be made obvious to  you at the time Lion Nathan collects that information, or for such purposes as  may be required or permitted by law.</p>
			<p>If Lion Nathan uses your personal  information for direct marketing purposes, all correspondence sent to you by  Lion Nathan will give you the opportunity to 'opt out' of receiving any further  direct marketing correspondence.<br>

			  <li>Lion Nathan's consultants,  contractors and service providers performing services including (but not  limited to) legal and accounting services, credit reporting, mail-house,  transport and printing services. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>Other than those third parties referred to  above, Lion Nathan will not disclose your personal information to any other  third party unless it has reasonable grounds to believe:</p>
			<ul>
			  <li>you have authorised Lion Nathan  to do so;</li>
			
			  <li>your safety, or the safety of  others in the community, is at risk; or</li>
			  <li>Lion Nathan is required or  permitted by law to do so. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>If Lion Nathan provides your personal  information to a third party, Lion Nathan generally requires the third party to  protect your personal information in the same way Lion Nathan does.<br>
			  Is my personal information secure?<br>
			  Lion Nathan takes reasonable steps to  ensure personal information it holds about you is protected from risks such as  loss, unauthorised access, use, destruction, modification or disclosure. Lion  Nathan only permits its authorised personnel or consultants to access your  personal information for legitimate business purposes.</p>
			<p>No data transmission over the internet is  totally secure. As a result, any personal information you send to Lion Nathan  over the Internet (including via email) is sent at your own risk.</p>
			
			<p>If Lion Nathan determines it no longer  requires your personal information, Lion Nathan will take reasonable steps to  de-identify or securely destroy that information as soon as practicable.<br>
			  Your rights of access and correction<br>
			  The accuracy of your personal information  is important. Lion Nathan takes reasonable steps to ensure personal information  it holds about you is accurate, complete, up-to-date, relevant and not  misleading.
