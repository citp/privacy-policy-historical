This Privacy Statement is a formal document that outlines the information which may be collected about you while you use XXXMatchLive, and how that information may be used. This Statement will also instruct you on what to do if you do not want your personal information collected or shared when you visit the XXXMatchLive website.

XXXMatchLive will not collect any personal identifying information about you (including, but not limited to, your name, address, telephone number, email address, Social Security number, bank account or credit card information, or any combination of data that could be used to identify you, such as birth date, zip code, and gender) unless you provide it to us voluntarily.

When you do provide us with personal identifying information, such information will be gathered solely by XXXMatchLive, and is for use solely by XXXMatchLive and trusted partners.

We may use personal identifying information in the following ways, unless stated otherwise: we may store and process that information to better understand your needs and how we can improve our products and services; and we may use that information to contact you. Financial information that is collected is used to check the users' qualifications for registration and to bill the user for products and services.

XXXMatchLive may request personal identifying information on specific pages that allow users to contact XXXMatchLive. Such information is being collected to assist us in solving a specific issue addressed by the user and/or to allow us to contact the user with an appropriate response.

There are a limited number of situations where we may disclose your personal information to others without first receiving your consent: (1) when legally ordered to do so by a lawful subpoena or court order, (2) if you violate or breach an agreement with us, (3) if we believe conduct by you will harm the property or rights of XXXMatchLive or those of XXXMatchLive customers or chat hosts, (4) under exigent circumstances to protect the physical safety of XXXMatchLive, its employees, users or the general public, (5) in connection with the sale of all or substantially all of our company’s assets or the sale of an entire web site or business division or (6) in order to validate credit card numbers for charging for fee services.
