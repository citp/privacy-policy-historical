# Xlibris.Com

Xlibris respects your right to the privacy of the personal information you provide us on our website. To that end, unless we state otherwise in this policy or at the time information is collected, any personal information you provide to Xlibris will be known only to two parties: you and Xlibris. The following policy is intended to explain how your personal information will be treated as you make use of our site and its features. Personal information includes your name, street and email addresses, billing information, click-through activity and any other personal information you may provide here. This policy may change from time to time, so please check back periodically.

**Traffic data**   
Each time a visitor comes to the Xlibris website, our servers — like most on the Web — collect some basic technical information, including, for example, the visitor's domain name (e.g., whether the user is logged on from aol.com or earthlink.net), referral data (e.g., we record the address of the last URL a user visited prior to clicking through to the Xlibris website) and browser and platform type (e.g., a Netscape browser on a Macintosh platform).

We also count, track, and aggregate the visitor's activity into our analyses of general traffic flows at our site (e.g., tracking where traffic comes from, how traffic flows within the Xlibris site, etc.). To these ends, we may merge information about visitors and visits into group data, which may then be shared on an aggregated basis. We will not, however, disclose your individual identity or personally identifiable data without your permission. When we do present aggregated information to outside organizations, no one will be able to identify you or contact you.

**Use of cookies**   
A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. We use cookies in a limited way to help identify unique browsers that visit us and to track usage throughout our site. We also use cookies on our Xlibris bookstore site to make the ordering process more convenient for users.

**Surveys**   
From time to time, Xlibris will conduct voluntary surveys of visitors to the site to obtain information on various subjects. Such information may be compiled and shared in the aggregate with advertisers and other third parties, but no personal details will be traceable or associated with specific individuals.

**Other disclosure of personal information**   
Xlibris will not otherwise use or disclose your personal information without your consent except as described in this privacy policy, or as required by law, court order, or as requested by other government or law enforcement authority. This policy does not protect information you post to any bulletin board, chat room, or other public forum within our website.

**Other sites**   
Xlibris contains many links to other sites on the Web. We cannot control and are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of other websites. We do not share information about your account or personal information with other websites.

**Who can I ask if I have any additional questions?**   
If you have any further questions or concerns about the Xlibris privacy policies and use of personal information, please send them to [techsupport@xlibris.com](mailto:techsupport@xlibris.com).
