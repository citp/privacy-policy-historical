##  **How we use cookies**

When you access our website, we, or companies we work with, may place small data files called "cookies" or image files called “web beacons” on your computer. We and our service providers also use these files to customize the x.com Services, content and advertising, measure promotional effectiveness, and improve the website experience.  

Most of these cookies are "session cookies" on your computer when you log in to your account or otherwise use the x.com Services. A session  cookie helps us to recognize you if you visit multiple pages on our site during the same session, so that we don’t need to ask you for your password on each page. Once you log out or close your browser, session cookies expire and no longer have any effect. 

We also use longer-lasting cookies for other purposes such as to display your logon in our sign-in form, so that you don't need to retype it each time you log in to your account. 

We encode our cookies so that only we can interpret the information stored in them. You are free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, but doing so may interfere with your use of our website.

You may encounter cookies from third parties when using the x.com Services on websites that we do not control (for example, if you view a web page created by a third party or use an application developed by a third party, there may be a cookie placed by that web page or application.)
