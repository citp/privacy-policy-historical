**How Xdrive uses contact information that you might provide when "Sending a File" or "Sharing a Folder"**  


When you use Xdrive to "Send a File" or "Share a Folder" with someone, you normally enter the intended recipientÂ’s e-mail address into the system so that a message can be sent informing him or her of the share. . We do not sell or make those E-mail addresses available to any 3rd parties.

When you use Xdrive's "Send a File" feature, you can elect to have the system send a notification message on your behalf by entering the e-mail address(es) of the person(s) with whom you want to share the file. If you prefer, you can instead generate a web link to the file, which can be sent as part of your own message. Send a File notification messages sent by Xdrive are one-time only messages with the sole intent of notifying the recipient of the shared file.

Using Xdrive's "Share a Folder" feature requires that the person with whom you are sharing to have an Xdrive account to access the folder. If the person with whom you are sharing does not already have an Xdrive account, a free sharing account will be created for that person when you share the folder. Xdrive will automatically send an e-mail inviting the person to activate their free account so they can access the folder you have shared. To activate, the sharing account holder will need to register for the service and will need to provide standard information to do so.
