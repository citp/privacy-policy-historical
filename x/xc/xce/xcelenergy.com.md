Web Browsing Details
When you visit our websites or social media pages we may collect certain information by
automated means, such as cookies and web beacons. A “cookie” is a text file that
websites send to a visitor’s computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely
identify the visitor’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser. A “web
beacon,” also known as an Internet tag, pixel tag or clear GIF, is used to transmit
information back to a web server. We also may use website analytics tools that collect
information about visitor traffic on our websites or social media pages. Examples of the
information we may collect by automated means include details about the devices our
visitors use to access the Internet (such as the Internet service provider, IP address and
device, browser and operating system type); URLs that refer visitors to our websites;
dates, times, and lengths of visits to our websites; site navigation patterns; a general
geographic location from which a visitor accesses our websites; and search terms that
visitors use to reach our websites.

Online Advertising
You may see ads about our products and services on other sites because we participate in
advertising networks. Ad networks allow us to target our advertising to users through
demographic, behavioral and contextual means. These networks track your online
activities over time by collecting information through automated means, including
through the use of cookies, web server logs, web beacons and other methods. The ad
network vendors may collect information about your visits to websites that participate in
the vendors’ advertising networks, such as the pages or advertisements you have viewed,
and the actions you take on the sites. The networks use this information to show you
advertisements for our products and services. This data collection and ad targeting take
place both on our websites and on third-party websites that participate in the ad networks.
This process also helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.
Information We Share
We do not disclose Personal Information or Customer Energy Usage Data about our
customers, except as described in this Privacy Policy. This means that, with the exception
of disclosures of the information described in this Policy and any disclosures you
specifically authorize, you have an expectation that we will keep confidential and not
otherwise disclose the information we maintain about you.
As we explain below, certain disclosures of information about you do not require your
consent because they are specifically permitted or required by applicable laws and
regulations, while other disclosures will not occur without your explicit authorization.
Customer Authorization Not Required
         We may disclose Customer Energy Usage Data as required or permitted by law or
         applicable regulations (for example, in Colorado, we are authorized to disclose
         information regarding a customer’s typical or estimated average monthly energy
         bill to licensed real estate brokers or other individuals or entities with similar
         interest in the sale or purchase of the customer’s property).
         We may disclose Personal Information:
          To a federal, state or local governmental agency with the power to compel such
           disclosure;
          If we are required to disclose the information by law; or


         As  otherwise permitted or required by applicable regulations.
        We may disclose aggregated data to third parties. We aggregate the information in
        accordance with applicable legal requirements, including those designed to
        prevent the re-identification of the information.
        We may disclose Customer Energy Usage Data or Personal Information about
        you to service providers who perform services on our behalf, such as companies
        that assist us in providing products and services to customers, billing customers or
        processing credit card payments. We prohibit these service providers from using
        or disclosing the information except as necessary to perform services on our
        behalf or comply with legal requirements.
        We also reserve the right to transfer any information we have about you in the
        event we sell, merge or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets. Should
        such a sale, merger or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to direct the
        transferee to use information you have provided to us in a manner that is
        consistent with our Privacy Policy. Following such a sale, merger or transfer, you
        may contact the entity to which we transferred your information with any
        inquiries concerning the processing of that information.
Customer Authorization Required
        We disclose Personal Information only as described in the “Customer
        Authorization Not Required” section above. We do not provide an option for
        customers to authorize other disclosures of their Personal Information to third
        parties.
        We may share your Customer Energy Usage Data with third parties if you have
        previously authorized the disclosure. If a third party requests access to your
        Customer Energy Usage Data, the entity must first ask you to authorize the
        disclosure by completing the appropriate consent form.
Prior to authorizing the disclosure of your Customer Energy Usage Data to a third party,
you should consider the third party’s proposed scope, purpose, and use of the information.
Note that depending on metering technology and infrastructure, it may be possible to
obtain insight into your activities within the premises receiving service, including the
way you use energy at your premises through analysis of Customer Energy Usage Data.
Declining a request from a third party to authorize access to your Customer Energy
Usage Data will not affect the provision of any service, including utility service that you
receive from Xcel Energy.
You may authorize us to disclose your Customer Energy Usage Data to a third party by
completing the applicable consent form:
      o Colorado Customers - Electric Energy Usage Data Release Form
      o Colorado Customers - Natural Gas or Steam Energy Usage Data Release
      o Customers Outside Colorado – Electric and Natural Gas Usage Data Release
      Form
