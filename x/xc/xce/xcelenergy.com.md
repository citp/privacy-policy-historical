**SECURITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION**

Maritz has implemented reasonable and appropriate security measures to help protect the personal information Maritz collects from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.  Although Maritz attempts to protect the personal information in its possession, no security system is perfect, and Maritz cannot promise that your personal information will remain absolutely secure in all circumstances.

**RETENTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION**

Maritz will retain your personal information as needed to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected.   Maritz will retain and use your personal information as necessary to comply with Maritz’s business requirements, legal obligations, resolve disputes, protect our assets, and enforce our agreements.

**DATA INTEGRITY AND PURPOSE LIMITATION**

Maritz limits the use of personal information to ways that are compatible and relevant to the purposes for which the personal information was collected or subsequently authorized or for which consent was obtained.  Maritz will take reasonable steps to ensure that personal information is reliable for its intended use, accurate, complete, and current.

**YOUR CHOICES**

You can make the following choices regarding your personal information:

  * _Promotional Emails_. You may choose to provide us with your email address for the purpose of allowing us to send free newsletters, surveys, offers, and other promotional materials to you, as well as targeted offers from third parties or Maritz’s clients.  You can stop receiving promotional emails by submitting a request at the contact in the “Communications” section below or following the unsubscribe instructions in e-mails that you receive.  Clicking on an unsubscribe link will take you to a webpage where you can complete the opt-out process.  Certain programs will provide a contact for support or other means to remove your name to remove your name from our contact list.  If you decide not to receive promotional emails, we may still send you transactional communications, such as those about your Account, to fulfill orders you have made, to ask you to rate a product you purchased, event you attended, or other service-related communications.

  * _Deletion of Your Personal Information_. Typically we retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.  Some Users may have the legal right (for example, under the EU General Data Protection Regulation) to request that we delete their personal information.  All deletion requests must be directed to the contact in the “Communications” section below.  We may also decide to delete your personal information if we believe that the data is incomplete, inaccurate, or that our continued use and storage are contrary to our obligations to other individuals or third parties.  When we delete personal information it will be removed from our active database, but it may remain in archives where it is not practical or possible to delete it.  In addition, we may keep your personal information as needed to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, or enforce any of our agreements.

California residents may be entitled to ask us for a notice describing what categories of personal information (if any) we share with third parties or affiliates for those parties to use for direct marketing.  If you are a California resident and would like a copy of such notice, please submit a written request to us using the information in the “Communications” section below.


  * _European Economic Area Citizens_. Where you believe that we have not processed your personal information in accordance with the applicable provisions of the EU General Data Protection Regulation, you may lodge a complaint with the respective EU data protection authority (DPA).



**CROSS-BORDER TRANSFER OF PERSONAL INFORMATION**

Maritz may transfer your personal information to Maritz’s entities in the United States, or to third parties as described in this Privacy Policy that are located in various countries around the world.  By using Maritz’s Platform, or providing any personal information to Maritz, where applicable law permits, you consent to the transfer, processing, and storage or such information outside of your country of residence where data protection standards may be different.  When Maritz collects information in one country, and transfers it to another, to the extent possible it applies the same level of data protection required under the laws in the first country even when the data is in the second country.

Maritz safeguards and enables the global transfer of personal information in a number of ways.  The following describes some of the protections that are taken with regard to data originating from certain countries:

  * _EU-U.S. Privacy Shield_ : Maritz adheres to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework concerning the transfer of personal information from the European Union  and Switzerland to the United States. Accordingly, Maritz follows the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Principles published by the U.S. Department of Commerce (“ **Privacy Shield Principles** ”) with respect to all such data.  Maritz complies with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of personal information from the EU, including the onward transfer liability provisions.  Maritz specifies in contracts with service providers that handle the personal information collected by Maritz that the personal information “may only be processed for limited and specified purposes consistent with” the purposes laid out in this Privacy Policy.  Those third parties agree to provide the same level of protection as the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield.  In certain situations, if a third party that receives personal information from Maritz takes an action that is contrary to the principles of the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, Maritz will be liable for those actions unless it can prove that it was not responsible for causing them.  If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.  Compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles may be limited, however, in certain cases to the extent necessary to meet national security, public interest, or law enforcement requirements.  All Maritz personnel with access to personal information are obligated to familiarize themselves and comply with provisions of this Privacy Policy.  To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view the Maritz certification, please visit [https://www.privacyshield.gov/](https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome) and search for the Maritz subsidiary or division.  A violation of Maritz’s commitment to EU-U.S. Privacy Shield may be investigated by the Federal Trade Commission.  With respect to personal information received or transferred pursuant to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, Maritz is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.



**DISPUTE RESOLUTION**

In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, Maritz commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information.  EU individuals with questions or concerns about our use of personal information or our privacy policy should submit a written request to us using the information in the “Communications” section below.

If your question or concern is not satisfied through this process Maritz has further committed to refer unresolved EU-U.S. Privacy Shield complaints to JAMS, an independent dispute resolution provider located in the United States.  Information about how to file a complaint with JAMS related to our EU-U.S. Privacy Shield program can be found at <https://www.jamsadr.com/file-an-eu-us-privacy-shield-or-safe-harbor-claim>.  The services of JAMS are provided at no cost to you.  Under certain circumstances, EU individuals may seek redress from the Privacy Shield Panel, a binding arbitration mechanism.

Maritz commits to cooperate with EU data protection authorities (DPAs) and comply with the advice given by such authorities with regard to human resources data transferred from the EU in the context of the employment relationship.
