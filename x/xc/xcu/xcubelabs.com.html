                    <h3>Use of Cookies</h3>
                    <p align="justify">
                    The PurpleTalk Web site use "cookies" to help you personalize your online
                    experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page
                    server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer.
                    Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the
                    domain that issued the cookie to you.

                    <p align="justify">
                    One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save
                    you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned
                    to a specific page. For example, if you personalize PurpleTalk pages, or register
                    with PurpleTalk site or services, a cookie helps PurpleTalk to recall your specific
                    information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your
                    personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When
                    you return to the same PurpleTalk Web site, the information you previously provided
                    can be retrieved, so you can easily use the PurpleTalk features that you customized.

                    if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully
