        <h1>Privacy Statement</h1>
        This privacy statement discloses the privacy practices for
        www.a-msystems.com.
        <h4>Information Collection and Use</h4>
        A-M Systems, Inc. is the sole owner of the information collected on this
        site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in
        ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. A-M Systems,
        Inc. collects and uses information from our customers in several ways,
        including the processing of purchase orders, return authorizations,
        mailing list subscriptions, requests for literature, and website usage.
        <h4>Information Requests and Order Processing</h4>
        Our collection of your personal information is to facilitate the
        delivery of product information and purchases. Contact information
        (i.e., name, address, account number), financial information (i.e.
        credit card number, expiration date, purchase order number) and shipping
        instructions may be collected and retained.&nbsp; This includes purchase
        history information as required by the United States Food and Drug
        Administration for tracking of regulated medical devices.
        <h4>Mailing List</h4>
        We maintain a mailing list of our customers.&nbsp; We provide you with
        the opportunity to received Product Catalogs, Sale Flyers, and other
        product information in print or electronic formats.&nbsp; We also
        provide you with the ability to stop subscriptions to this information.<br>
        <br>
        However, you may still receive literature from us occasionally when we
        rent or purchase mailing lists from other organizations.&nbsp; This is
        always done within the contract provisions provided by the mailing list
        owner, and may not provide us with the ability to combine a rented list
        with the user preferences in our mailing list database.
        <h4>Passwords</h4>
        We ask you to select a password to protect your personal information
        when you request information or place an order with us. The password
        will allow you to update this information. Our Customer Service
        Representatives will not ask you for your password over the telephone or
        in writing. For your own protection, we urge you not share your password
        with anyone. Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the
        secrecy of your password.
        <h4>EMail-A-Friend</h4>
        If you elect to use our referral service for informing a friend about
        our site, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address. We
        will automatically send this person a one-time email containing the
        information you wish to send.&nbsp; The friend will not be entered as an
        active member of our mailing list as a result of this process.
        <h4>Cookies</h4>
        A cookie is a small text file stored on your hard drive containing an
        temporary identification number used to track the products and services
        you place in your shopping cart. A cookie can never tell us any
        personally identifiable information you have not already given us. If
        you reject our cookie, some services of our site will be unavailable.
        Cookies can also enable us to track the interests of our users to
        enhance the experience on our site.
        <h4>Log Files</h4>
        We use log files containing computer IP addresses to analyze trends,
        administer the website, and gather broad demographic information for
        aggregate use. For your protection, we also record you computer's IP
        address when you log in, change personal information, or make a
        purchase, in order to guard your security by facilitating any
        investigation of&nbsp; unusual user activity. 
        <h4>Sharing</h4>
        We do not share customer information with third parties for marketing
        purposes.<br>
        <br>
        We use outside shipping companies to ship orders, and a credit card
        processing company to bill credit card transactions for goods and
        services.
        <h4>Links</h4>
        Our web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we are
        not responsible for the content or privacy practices of other
        sites.&nbsp; This privacy statement applies to information collected at
        www.a-msystems.com.
        <h4>Surveys</h4>
        From time-to-time our site may request information from users via
        surveys. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and you
        have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information
        requested may include contact information and/or demographic
        information, and participation may require registration with the
        website.
        <h4>Security</h4>
        A-M Systems, Inc. takes every precaution to protect our users’
        information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, it
        is protected both online and off-line. Sensitive information submitted
        to our website is encrypted and protected with SSL, which is the best
        encryption software available today. While on a secure page, such as our
        order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape
        Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer indicates that all data is
        being encrypted for your protection. While we use SSL encryption to
        protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power
        to protect this information offline. All of our users’ information is
        restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to
        perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer
        service representative) are allowed access to personally identifiable
        information. Furthermore, the servers which store personally
        identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.
        <h4>Supplementation of Information</h4>
        In order for us to fulfill our obligation to our customers, occasionally
        it is necessary for us to supplement the information we receive with
        information from third party sources. For example, with specific
        permission, we may conduct a credit check in conjunction with a purchase
        order.
        <h4>Updating Personal Information &amp; Opt-out</h4>
        When your personally identifiable information changes, we encourage you
        to log in to our website by clicking 'My Account' where you will be
        given an opportunity to update any personal information on record with
        us. You are always given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having your
        information used for any purpose by choosing to unsubscribe from our
        mailing list. Your contact information will be retained in our mailing
        list to ensure that you are not added back to the list at a later time
        without your permission.
        <h4>Notification of Changes</h4>
        If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post an updated
        privacy statement here so you are always aware of our current policy. We
        will use information in accordance with the privacy policy in effect
        when the information was collected. If at any point we desire to use
        personally identifiable information in a manner different from that
        stated in the privacy policy at the time the information was collected,
        we will only do so if we first obtain your permission.</td>
