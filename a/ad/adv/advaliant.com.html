      <h3>The Advaliant Privacy Policy</h3>
      <p>Advaliant Inc. (“Advaliant”) respects the privacy of those who use the Advaliant website (the “Advaliant service”). Information that relates to any individual will not be not intentionally disclosed to any third party without first receiving your permission, as explained in this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy").</p>
      <h4>Advaliant and Cookies</h4>
      <p>When you first visit Advaliant , Advaliant sets a "cookie" on your computer. A cookie is a small file that identifies you as a unique user. Advaliant uses cookies to improve the quality of our service and to better understand our user base. Advaliant does this by storing user preferences in cookies and by tracking user trends and patterns of how people use the Advaliant service. Advaliant will not disclose its cookies to third parties except as required by a valid legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, or court order.</p>
      <p>Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Be aware, however, that some parts of the Advaliant Service may not function properly if you refuse cookies.</p>
      <h4>What Information Do We Collect?</h4>
      <p>Advaliant does not collect any unique information about you through the cookie process (such as your name, email address, etc.), except when you specifically and knowingly provide such information; whether you have a query or are registering for the Advaliant service. Advaliant notes and saves information such as time of day, browser type, browser language, and IP address with each query. That information is used to verify our records and to provide more relevant services to users.</p>
      <h4>Links to Other Sites</h4>
      <p>From time to time, Advaliant may display links to sites that are developed by people over whom Advaliant exercises no control. These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data, or solicit personal information. Advaliant may choose to exhibit these links as an "URL redirecter." When Advaliant uses a URL redirecter, if you click on a URL, information about the click is sent to Advaliant , and Advaliant in turn sends you to the site you clicked on. Advaliant uses this URL information to understand and improve the quality of Advaliant’s technology and for advertising effectiveness purposes.</p>
      <h4>With Whom Does Advaliant Share Information?</h4>
      <p>Advaliant may share information about you with advertisers, business partners, sponsors, and other third parties. However, we only divulge aggregate information about our users and will not share personally identifiable information with any third party without your express consent. However, by filling in your personal information through the Advaliant service it is understood and you hereby agree that you are giving your express consent for Advaliant to forward your personal information for services provided by our partners. We may also provide you with special exclusive offers from time-to-time which you may unsubscribe from by following the relevant unsubscribe information as provided in each instance. Notwithstanding the aforementioned, please be aware, however, that we will release specific personal information about you if required to do so in order to comply with any valid legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, or court order.</p>
      <p>This Privacy Policy applies to consumers that have signed up on the Advaliant website. We may use the personal information that you supply to us and work with other third party businesses to bring selected retail opportunities to our members via direct mail, email and telemarketing. These businesses may include providers of direct marketing services and applications, including lookup and reference, data enhancement, suppression and validation and email marketing.</p>
      <h4>Your consent and changes to the Privacy Policy</h4>
      <p>By using the Advaliant service, you consent to the collection and use of your information as we have outlined in this policy and to our Terms and Conditions Policy. Advaliant may decide to change this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of the information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.</p>
      <p>By submitting your application, you are consenting to be contacted by at least one mortgage broker or lender. Such contact may be made by email or via phone, even if you have listed yourself on a Do-Not-Call Registry. Further, Advaliant is not a bank or lending establishment, all mortgage information and rate quotes will be provided to you by independent providers. You are also granting permission for a representative of Advaliant to contact you to verify your application, if need be, for quality control purposes.</p>
