We use that data to send you our weekly newsletters which consist of the latest offers. We send no more than one (1) newsletter per week per vertical. In addition, we send occasional newsletters with industry news and company news, which we think may be relevant to you and your business. We shall not send more than four (4) of these industry news and company news newsletters per month.

#### Corporate news
