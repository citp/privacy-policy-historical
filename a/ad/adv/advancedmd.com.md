4. Why Personal Information is disclosed by AdvancedMD
We limit our sharing of your Personal Information as follows:
     •    We may share your Personal Information with our affiliates, which may only use your Personal
          Information for the purposes listed above in Section 3.
     •    We may also share your Personal Information with our service providers, who are bound by law or contract
          to protect your Personal Information and only use your Personal Information in accordance with our
          instructions.
     •    We may share your Personal Information with business partners if you have purchased products or services
          from such partner, interacted with such partner, or otherwise indicated interest in that partner’s products or
          services. For example, if you are referred to AdvancedMD from a business partner website, we may
          provide that partner with your Contact Information and certain Transactional Information to validate the
          referral. We may also provide your Contact Information to companies that offer complementary products
          and services if you request information about these solutions.
     •    We may also disclose Personal Information where needed to affect the sale or transfer of business assets, to
          enforce our rights, protect our property, or protect the rights, property or safety of others, or as needed to
          support external auditing, compliance and corporate governance functions. We will also always disclose
          Personal Information when required to do so by law, such as in response to a subpoena, including to law
          enforcement agencies and courts in the United States and other countries where we operate.
Please note that we may also use and disclose information about you that is not personally identifiable. For example,
we may publish reports that contain aggregated and statistical data about our clients. These reports do not contain
any information that would enable the recipient to contact, locate or identify you. These reports also do not contain
any identifiable company information.
5. Cookies and Other Data Collection Technologies and Google Analytics
When you visit our website, use our mobile applications, or email with us, we collect certain Transaction
Information by automated means, using technologies such as cookies, pixel tags, browser analysis tools, server logs
and web beacons.
For example, when you visit our website, we place cookies on your computer. Cookies are small text files that
websites send to your computer or other internet-connected device to uniquely identify your browser or to store
information or settings in your browser. Cookies allow us to recognize you when you return. They also help us
provide a customized experience and enable us to detect certain kinds of fraud. In many cases, you can manage
cookie preferences and opt-out of having cookies and other data collection technologies used by adjusting the
settings on your browser. All browsers are different, so visit the “help” section of your browser to learn about cookie
preferences and other privacy settings that may be available.
Pixel tags and web beacons are tiny graphic images placed on website pages or in our emails that allow us to
determine whether you have performed a specific action. When you access these pages or open or click an email, the
pixel tags and web beacons generate a notice of that action. These tools allow us to measure response to our
communications and improve our web pages and promotions.
We collect many different types of information from cookies and other technologies. For example, we may collect
information from the device you use to access our website, your operating system type, browser type, domain, and
other system settings, as well as the language your system uses and the country and time zone where your device is


located. Our server logs also record the IP address assigned to the device you use to connect to the internet. An IP
address is a unique number that devices use to identify and communicate with each other on the internet. We may
also collect information about the website you were visiting before you came to AdvancedMD and the website you
visit after you leave our site.
In many cases, the information we collect using cookies and other tools is only used in a non-identifiable way,
without any reference to Personal Information. For example, we use information we collect about all website users
to optimize our websites and to understand website traffic patterns.
In some cases, we do associate the information we collect using cookies and other technology with your Personal
Information. This Privacy Statement applies to the information when we associate it with your Personal Information.
