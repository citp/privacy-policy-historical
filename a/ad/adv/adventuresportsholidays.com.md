This information may be collected in conjunction with third party services such as Google Analytics. However, this information is made anonymous at the point of collection meaning  **you  **cannot personally be identified from it.

#### _Personal information provided by third parties_

We may receive information about you from a third-party source. We will only accept that information if we have evidence that you have consented for the personal information to be passed to us or it is passed pursuant to another legal basis under the GDPR.

#### _Personal information about other individuals_

If you give us information on behalf of someone else, you confirm that the other person has appointed you to act on his/her behalf and has agreed that you can:

  * give consent on his/her behalf to the processing of his/her personal data;
  * receive on his/her behalf any data protection notices; and
  * give consent to the transfer of his/her personal data abroad.



#### _Sensitive personal information_

It is very unlikely that we will ask you to provide sensitive personal information. If we request such information, we will explain why we are requesting it and how we intend to use it.

This information helps us to build a profile of our users. This data will be aggregated or statistical, which means that, in respect of that data, we will not be able to identify you individually.

You can set your browser not to accept cookies and easily remove cookies from your browser. However, some of our **Website** features may not function as a result.

We will use technical and organisational measures to safeguard your personal data, for example:
