<br><br>

<li>other information, including users IP address and standard web log information. </li>
</ul>
<br><br>

<br> 
<ul>
<li>provide our services</li><br> 
<li>resolve disputes, collect fees, and troubleshoot problems;</li><br>
<li>encourage safe trading and enforce our policies; </li><br>
<li>customize users' experience, measure interest in our services, and inform users about services and updates; </li><br>
<li>communicate marketing and promotional offers to you; </li><br>
<li>do other things for users as described when we collect the information.</li> 
</ul>
<br><br> 
 
 
<strong>Disclosure.</strong> We don't sell or rent users' personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes without users explicit consent. We may disclose personal information to respond to legal requirements, enforce our policies, respond to claims that a posting or other content violates other's rights, or protect anyone's rights, property, or safety.

<br><br>
 <ul>
<li>corporate affiliates who help detect and prevent potentially illegal acts and provide joint services. (Our corporate affiliates will market only to users who ask them to). </li><br>
<li>service providers who help with our business operations. </li><br>

<br>
<strong>Using Information from Adverts.pk.</strong> You may use personal information gathered from Adverts.pk only to follow up with another user about a specific posting, not to send spam or collect personal information from someone who hasn't agreed to that.

Contact customer support ( support@Adverts.pk ) to review any personal information we store that is not available on Adverts.pk.

We delete personal information when we no longer need it for the purposes we described earlier. We retain personal information as permitted by law to resolve disputes, enforce our policies; and prevent bad guys from coming back.

<strong>Security.</strong> We use lots of tools (encryption, passwords, physical security) to protect your personal information against unauthorized access and disclosure, but as you probably know, nothing's perfect, so we make no guarantees.
<br><br>
<strong>General.</strong> We may update this policy at any time, with updates taking effect when you next post or after 30 days, whichever is sooner. If we or our corporate affiliates are involved in a merger or acquisition, we may share personal information with another company, but this policy will continue to apply.
