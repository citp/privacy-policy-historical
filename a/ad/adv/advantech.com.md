# Advantech - Privacy Policy

Advantech respects your right to privacy. The following policy we hope will answer any questions you might have concerning the way customer information is collected, controlled and safeguarded. Advantech follows all applicable laws on data privacy protection and data security. The ultimate goal for gathering information is to improve service and support to customers.

Personal data

Advantech will not collect any personal data about you (e.g. your name, address, telephone number or e-mail address), unless you voluntarily choose to provide us with it (e.g. by registration, surveys, etc.).

Advantech is the sole owner of the information collected on our web sites. Under no circumstances will we share your customer information with anyone other than those directly involved with the purchase and shipment of your order, unless you explicitly give us permission to do so.

We may use your e-mail address to notify you of special offers and promotions that you are eligible to participate in as a registered customer. You may decline this service.

Non-Personal Data Collected Automatically

When you access our Web site, we may automatically (i.e., not by registration) collect non-personal data (e.g. type of Internet browser and operating system used, IP address, domain name of the Web site from which you came, number of visits, average time spent on the site, pages viewed). We use this data to monitor web interaction, analyse trends, improve performance and content and study the needs of customers more closely. This will be performed in accordance with the applicable data privacy protection legal framework.

Purpose of Use

When you do provide us with personal data, we usually use it to respond to your inquiry, process your order or provide you access to specific information or offers. Also, to support our customer relationship with you:

  * we may store and process personal data and share it with our worldwide affiliates and partners to better understand your business needs and how we can improve our products and services; or 
  * we (or a third party on our behalf) may use personal data to contact you about an Advantech offer in support of your business needs or to conduct online surveys to understand better our customers' needs. 



If you choose not to have your personal data used to support our customer relationship (especially direct marketing or market research), we will respect your choice. We do not sell or otherwise market your personal data to third parties, except to Advantech's affiliates and partners.

Purpose Limitation

Advantech will collect, use or disclose personal data supplied by you online only for the purposes disclosed to you, unless the disclosure:

  * is a use of the personal data for any additional purpose that is directly related to the original purpose for which the personal data was collected, 
  * is necessary to prepare, negotiate and perform a contract with you, 
  * is required by law or the competent governmental or judicial authorities, 
  * is necessary to establish or preserve a legal claim or defense, 
  * is necessary to prevent fraud or other illegal activities, such as wilful attacks on Advantech IT systems. 

"Cookies" - Information Stored Automatically on Your Computer

When you view one of our Web sites, we may store some data on your computer in the form of a "cookie" to automatically recognize your PC next time you visit. Cookies can help us in many ways, for example, by allowing us to tailor a Web site to better match your interests or to store your password to save you having to re-enter it each time. If you do not wish to receive cookies, please configure your Internet browser to erase all cookies from your computer's hard drive, block all cookies or to receive a warning before a cookie is stored.

Children

Advantech will not knowingly collect personal data from children without insisting that they seek prior parental consent if required by applicable law. We will only use or disclose personal data about a child to the extent permitted by law, to seek parental consent pursuant to local law and regulations or to protect a child. The definition of "child" or "children" should take into account applicable laws as well as national and regional cultural customs. 

Security

To protect your personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or alteration and against unauthorized disclosure or access, Advantech uses technical and organizational security measures.

Links to Other Web Sites

Advantech Web sites contain links to other Web sites. Advantech is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of other Web sites.

Questions and Comments

Advantech will respond to reasonable requests to review your personal data and to correct, amend or delete any inaccuracies. If you have any questions or comments about the Advantech Web Security and Privacy Policy (e.g. to review and update your personal data), please click on "Worldwide Contacts" in the upper right-hand corner of this window, and select the Advantech Headquarters info@advantech.com.tw As the Internet matures, so will our Web Security and Privacy Policy. We will post changes to our Web Security and Privacy Policy on this page. Please check this page regularly to keep up-to-date.

Secure Shopping

This website takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via our website, your information is protected both online and off-line. When our order form, log-in page, and/or registration page asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL.

In addition, VeriSign is used as our certifying authority. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, in normal non-secure use. While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information.

Consent 

By visiting Advantech's website, you consent to the practices described in the Privacy notice and your visit and any dispute over privacy is subject to this notice.
