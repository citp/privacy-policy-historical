Cookies

Renegade Internet uses cookies to measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. Cookies are small text files created and stored on your computer by your web browsing software (i.e. Internet Explorer or Firefox) on behalf of web sites that you visit. While cookies have many applications, we use them only to assign an anonymous and unique ID number to you when you view, click, or interact in some way with one of our client's advertisements. The cookie does NOT include your name, address, phone number, email address, or any other information that may personally identify you.

Internet Protocol Address

Renegade Internet uses Internet protocol (IP) addresses to measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. Through the use of IP mapping technology, we are able to translate your IP address into a geographic location, which may include a close approximation of your Continent, Country, State/Province, City, and Postal/Zip Code. This technology does NOT provide us with your street address, telephone number, or any other information that may personally locate you. 

Referrer URL

Renegade Internet uses Referrer URLs to measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. By examining the Referrer URL, we are able to determine which web site is displaying one of our client's advertisements. We are NOT able to extract any information that may personally identify you from the Referrer URL. 

Beacons

Renegade Internet uses beacons, which are also commonly referred to as "action tags" or "tracking pixels", in combination with cookies to measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. Advertisers may place beacons on their contact form and/or order form "thank you" pages to identify leads and sales as resulting from an advertising campaign. The beacon does NOT collect your name, address, phone number, email address, or any other information that may personally identify you.
