# Privacy Policy | Adventure Travel Trade Association

**Privacy Commitment**

Adventure Travel Trade Association, Inc. (“ATTA” or “we” or “us”) understands your privacy is important. We take the responsibility of protecting your privacy very seriously. For this reason, we have created this Privacy Policy to help you understand how we collect, use and protect the information we collect through our website and the websites of our associated services such as www.adventuretravel.biz, www.adventuretravelnews.com, www.adventuretravelworldsummit.com, www.adventure.travel, http://members.adventuretravel.biz, http://careers.adventuretravel.biz, http://summitconnections.adventuretravel.biz, www.adventuredrinks.org, and www.adventureconnect.travel, and other websites we own or manage now or in the future (collectively referred to as “website,” “our website,” or “this website”). This Privacy Policy is binding agreement between you and ATTA. This policy may change from time to time so we recommend that you check it regularly. Your continued use of this website after the posting of any changes will constitute your acceptance of those changes.

**Information We Collect and How We Use It**

**Information You Choose to Give Us:** We receive and store any information you enter on our website or give us by phone, email or in any other way. On our website, you may request information, subscribe to our newsletter, purchase our products and services, participate in our contests and surveys, and use any other services we provide. To take advantage of these offerings, it is necessary for you to disclose personal information (referred to as “personal information,” “personally identifiable information,” and “your information”) to us, including but not limited to one or more of the following identifying information: name, age, address, telephone number, email address, and credit card details. We use the information you provide to respond to your requests, communicate with you, provide information about our company and promotional material from some of our partners, and customize and improve our services. To purchase our goods or services, you must submit financial information in addition to certain personal information, which we use to bill you for the purchased goods or services.

**Information We Collect through Google Analytics:** Users who visit this website and have javascript enabled are tracked through Google Analytics. Google Analytics collects information anonymously and reports website trends to us without identifying individual visitors. Google Analytics collects a variety of information from users, including the Internet protocol (IP address) that is used to connect your computer to the Internet (which it does not report to us), your Internet service provider (ISP), browser type, type of operating system, the full Uniform Resource Locator (URL) clickstream to, through, and from our website, including date and time, cookie, the length of time you spend on particular pages, which links you click while on our site, and similar site visit information. Google Analytics data is shared with Google. For more information on Google Analytics or to opt-out of having your information shared through Google Analytics, visit: http://www.google.com/intl/en/analytics/privacyoverview.html. For more information on Google’s privacy policy, visit http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/.

We use this information to make our website easier to find on the Internet and to improve our website by learning which pages and features are interesting to our visitors. We treat this information as non-personal information and do not attempt to connect it to personally identifiable information, except as otherwise required by law.

**Information from Others:** We might receive information from you about third parties whom you authorize to interact with our website to provide or receive personalized information about you. That information might include your name and possibly other information used by that third party to identify your account.

**Sharing Your Information**

We share your information with our family of brands, including Adventure Travel World Summit, ATTA 360, ATTA Regional Meetings, AdventureTravelNews, Adventure.Travel, AdventureDrinks and AdventureConnect. We may share personally identifiable information with third parties only as described in this section.

**Third-Party Service Providers:** We employ other companies and persons to perform certain business functions on our behalf, including but not limited to website development and maintenance, marketing, accounting and payment processing. These third parties have access to user information needed to perform their functions, but they may not use it for any other purposes.

**Business Transfers:** As our business continues to develop, your information may be sold to any successor to or purchaser of part or all of the assets of our business. Business assets typically include customer information.

**Aggregated Demographic Information:** We may share aggregated demographic information with third parties. We do not link this aggregated information to any personal information that can identify your or any other person and, thus, do not disclose any personal information in this manner.

**Survey Data:** The ATTA occasional conducts industry and customer surveys. If the survey is listed as “anonymous” this means that your personal information is not stored in relation to your survey response, unless you specifically opt to provide your contact information within the survey. Your responses to the survey are reported only in the aggregate and will not link this to any personal information. Your participation in the survey is completely optional.

**Legal Purposes:** We may disclose your information if required to do so pursuant to judicial or governmental subpoenas, warrants, and orders, or as otherwise required by law. In addition, notwithstanding any terms to the contrary in this Privacy Policy, we retain the right to use, disclose and/or share your personal and non-personal information to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, and situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person.

**With Your Permission:** For situations other than those described in this Privacy Policy, we will notify you when personally identifiable information might be disclosed to a third party and you can opt-out of sharing your information.

**Links to Third Party Websites**

This website contains links to third-party websites, including public forums (e.g., chat rooms, forums, message boards and/or news groups) and Google, that are not owned by or affiliated with us. These links do not constitute an endorsement of the linked websites or the products and/or services offered on those websites. We have no control over and are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such sites. These websites may or may not have a privacy policy. This Privacy Policy applies only to our website and not to any third-party websites to which it links. We encourage our users to contact those sites directly about their privacy practices.

**Our Security Practices**

We use commercially reasonable security measures to protect our databases and information under our control against loss, misuse, destruction, unauthorized access, alteration, or inadvertent disclosure of data. We use secure sockets layer software to encrypt the information that you submit in your booking form, including financial data. Our customers’ financial information is kept in a secure storage facility and only accessible by authorized employees and third-party service providers who need to access the information to perform their duties.

**Your Choices**

You can always choose not to give us your personally identifiable information, although this information is required if you want to take advantage of some of our services such as subscribing to our newsletter or joining the ATTA.

Most browsers automatically accept all cookies by default. You should be able to adjust your browser’s settings to reject new cookies, prompt you before accepting a cookie, or disable cookies. Check your browser’s help section for instructions on how to do this.

You may opt-out of receiving emails or other communications from us and our partners at the point where we ask whether you would like to receive such communications.

You may a) unsubscribe from our newsletters and other mailing lists, or b) request that your personally identifiable information be removed from our database so that you no longer receive our communications or our service. If you request that your personally identifiable information be removed from our database, please understand that it may be impossible to remove this information completely due to backups and records of deletions. Further, we will not be able to remove any personal information that we are required to retain by law (for instance, tax purposes, notices, etc.). If you wish to unsubscribe from our newsletters and mailings lists, please send an email with the term “Unsubscribe” in the subject line to the email listed in the “Contact Us” section of this Privacy Policy or write to us at the address listed in that section. If you wish to remove your personally identifiable information from our database, please send an email with the phrase “Remove from Database” in the subject line or write to us. You will be removed from our databases usually within ten business days of our receipt of your request, except where we are required to maintain the personal information by law. You may also request to review or amend any personally identifiable information that we maintain about you by sending a written request to us. We may take reasonable steps to confirm your identity before fulfilling any of these requests. Note that if you opt-out of our marketing materials but you purchased a product or service from us, you will continue to receive communications from us about your specific purchase. Further, if third parties already have your information, you will have to contact them directly to opt-out of their marketing communications.

**Children**

Our website is not directed to children under 18, and we do not offer products or services for use by children. If you are under 18, you may not provide us with any personally identifiable information and you may not use our website without the supervision of a parent or guardian. If a child under the age of 18 has provided us with personally identifiable information, the child’s parent or guardian may contact us and request that such information be deleted from our records.

**Notice to International Users**

Our website is hosted in the United States. If you are accessing our website from the European Union (“EU”) or elsewhere, be aware that you are transferring your personal data to the United States, which does not have the same personal data protection laws as the EU and other regions. That being said, we take steps to ensure that your privacy is protected as described in this policy. By using our website, you consent to have your personal information used and transferred to the United States as set forth in this policy.

**Changes to Privacy Policy**

As stated above, this policy may change from time to time so we recommend that you check it regularly. Your continued use of our website after the posting of any changes will constitute your acceptance of those changes. If we are going to use any personally identifiable information in a manner that is materially less restrictive from that stated in our Privacy Policy at the time we collected such information, we will either attempt to obtain your consent before implementing the change or, in the absence of your consent, the new policy will not apply to information collected prior to the change.

**Applicable Law and Choice of Forum**

By visiting our website, you agree that any dispute relating to or arising out of this Privacy shall be resolved exclusively by binding arbitration. The binding arbitration shall take place in Seattle, Washington, in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association. Such proceedings will be governed by substantive (but not procedural) Washington state law. The arbitrator and not any federal, state or local court or agency shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, conscionability, or formation of this contract, including but not limited to any claim that all or any of this Privacy Policy is void or voidable.
