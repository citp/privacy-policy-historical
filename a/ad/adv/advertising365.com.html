        <b>Privacy Policy</b></p>
		  <p class="style2">
       <b>What This Privacy Policy Covers</b><br>
      <br>
      </p><ul>
        <li class="style2">This policy covers how Network22 treats personal information that Network22 
          collects and receives, including information related to your past use 
          of Network22 products and services. Personal information is information 
          about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email 
          address, or phone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available. <br><br>
        </li><li class="style2">This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Network22 
          does not own or control, or to people that Network22 does not employ or 
          manage. <br><br>
      </li></ul>
      <span class="style2"><b> Information Collection and Use</b></span>
      <p class="style2"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>General </b><br>
      </p><ul>
        <li class="style2">Network22 collects personal information when you register with Network22, 
          when you use Network22 products or services, when you visit Network22 
          pages or the pages of certain Network22 partners. Network22 may combine 
          information about you that we have with information we obtain from business 
          partners or other companies. <br><br>
        </li><li class="style2">When you register we ask for information such as your name, email 
          address, birth date, gender, zip code, occupation, industry, and personal 
          interests. For some financial products and services we may also ask 
          for your address, Social Security number, and information about your 
          assets. Once you register with Network22 and sign in to our services, you 
          are not anonymous to us. <br><br>
        </li><li class="style2">Network22 collects information about your transactions with us and 
          with some of our business partners, including information about your 
          use of financial products and services that we offer. <br><br>
        </li><li class="style2">Network22 automatically receives and records information on our server 
          logs from your browser, including your IP address, cookie information, 
          and the page you request. <br><br>
        </li><li class="style2">Network22 uses information for the following general purposes: to customize 
          the advertising and content you see, fulfill your requests for products 
          and services, improve our services, contact you, conduct research, and 
          provide anonymous reporting for internal and external clients. <br><br>
      </li></ul>
      <span class="style2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Information Sharing and Disclosure</b><br></span>
      <ul>
        <li class="style2">Network22 does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you 
          with other people or nonaffiliated companies except to provide products 
          or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under 
          the following circumstances: <br><br>
          <ul>
            <li class="style2">We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf 
              of or with Network22 under confidentiality agreements. These companies 
              may use your personal information to help Network22 communicate with 
              you about offers from Network22 and our marketing partners. However, 
              these companies do not have any independent right to share this 
              information. <br><br>
            </li><li class="style2">We have a parent's permission to share the information if the 
              user is a child under age 13. Parents have the option of allowing 
              Network22 to collect and use their child's information without consenting 
              to Network22 sharing of this information with people and companies 
              who may use this information for their own purposes; <br><br>
            </li><li class="style2">We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to 
              establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; <br><br>
            </li><li class="style2">We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, 
              prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected 
              fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety 
              of any person, violations of Network22's terms of use, or as otherwise 
              required by law.<br> <br>
            </li><li class="style2">We transfer information about you if Network22 is acquired by or 
              merged with another company. In this event, Network22 will notify you 
              before information about you is transferred and becomes subject 
              to a different privacy policy. <br><br>
          </li></ul>
        </li><li class="style2">Network22 displays targeted advertisements based on personal information. 
          Advertisers (including ad serving companies) may assume that people 
          who interact with, view, or click on targeted ads meet the targeting 
          criteria - for example, women ages 18-24 from a particular geographic 
          area. <br><br>
          <ul>
            <li class="style2">Network22 does not provide any personal information to the advertiser 
              when you interact with or view a targeted ad. However, by interacting 
              with or viewing an ad you are consenting to the possibility that 
              the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting 
              criteria used to display the ad.<br> <br>
            </li><li class="style2">Network22 advertisers include financial service providers (such as 
              banks, insurance agents, stock brokers and mortgage lenders) and 
              non-financial companies (such as stores, airlines, and software 
              companies). <br><br>
          </li></ul>
      </li></ul>
      <span class="style2"><b> Cookies</b><br></span>
      <ul>
        <li class="style2">Network22 may set and access Network22 cookies on your computer. <br><br>
        </li><li class="style2">Network22 lets other companies that show advertisements on some of 
          our pages set and access their cookies on your computer. Other companies' 
          use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this 
          one. Advertisers or other companies do not have access to Network22's 
          cookies. <br><br>
      </li></ul>
      <span class="style2"><b> Confidentiality and Security </b><br></span>
      <ul>
        <li class="style2">We limit access to personal information about you to employees who 
          we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information 
          to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs.<br> <br>
        </li><li class="style2">We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply 
          with international regulations to protect personal information about 
          you. <br><br>
      </li></ul>
      <span class="style2"><b> Changes to this Privacy Policy</b><br></span>
      <ul>
        <li class="style2">Network22 may update this policy. We will notify you about significant 
          changes in the way we treat personal information by sending a notice 
          to the primary email address specified in your account or by placing 
          a prominent notice on our site.
