It is the policy of Advanstar to handle social security numbers obtained in the ordinary course of its business activities with a high degree of security and confidentiality. In general, Advanstar restricts access to information and documents containing social security numbers to Advanstar employees, agents and contractors who have a legitimate business reason to access such information and documents.

All Advanstar departments and business units having access to information, documents and records containing social security numbers will determine on an ongoing basis which personnel have a legitimate business reason to access those materials. No other Advanstar personnel will be authorized to access social security numbers maintained by Advanstar.

  * The confidentiality of social security numbers is maintained
  * Social security numbers are not unlawfully disclosed 
  * Records containing social security numbers are disposed of in a commercially reasonable manner (such as destroying, erasing or making unreadable social security numbers contained in data, computer files and documents) that minimizes the risk that social security numbers maintained by Advanstar will be obtained by unauthorized persons 
  * Social security numbers are not publicly displayed, used as the primary account number or identifier for an individual or printed on identification cards or badges 
  * Social security numbers are not used, transmitted or stored in documents, files, computer programs or databases that are not encrypted or secure 



_Authorized Use of Social Security Numbers_

This Privacy Policy does not prohibit the use of social security numbers obtained by Advanstar where the use is authorized or required by state or federal statute, rule, regulation, or court order or rule, or pursuant to legal or discovery process.

This Privacy Policy does not prohibit the collection or use of social security numbers belonging to customers, creditors, contractors, vendors, employees and other individuals associated with Advanstar for other legitimate business reasons, including, without limitation:

  * The conduct by Advanstar of pre-employment background, reference and related inquiries
  * For purposes of verifying employment candidates’ eligibility for employment by Advanstar
  * For employee tax reporting purposes, including new hire reporting and enrollment and participation in Advanstar benefit plans
  * For tax reporting purposes pertaining to customers, creditors, contractors, vendors and other individuals providing goods or services to Advanstar



Unauthorized Use or Disclosure  
Advanstar will take commercially reasonable measures to enforce this Privacy Policy and to correct and prevent the reoccurrence of any known violations. Non-compliance with this Privacy Policy may constitute a violation of federal and state law, and Advanstar will fully cooperate with all law enforcement and administrative agencies in the apprehension and prosecution of any person who knowingly obtains, uses or discloses social security numbers for any unlawful purpose. Willful violation of this Privacy Policy by Advanstar employees will result in disciplinary action up to and including discharge.

Notification of Changes
