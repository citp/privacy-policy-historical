# Privacy Policy - Adventures in Coupons

Your privacy is important to me and I will respect the information that you submit to me in order to subscribe to my blog, enter [giveaways](http://www.adventuresincoupons.com/category/giveaways "giveaways"), participate in a poll or survey, or post a comment. This blog does not collect information from minors, only from adults ages 18 and above. I will never give or sell your email address to anyone.

All information collected regarding promotions, contests or giveaways (with the exception of comments made on this blog or the Adventures in [Coupons](http://www.adventuresincoupons.com/category/printable-coupons "Coupons") Facebook page) is destroyed at promotions end. However, if you win a prize with a verifiable monetary value, I will keep your information (name, email address and mailing address) for tax purposes. Anyone winning prize(s) valued at over $599.99 USD in one calendar year will be required as well to fill out an IRS-1099 form before their prize is shipped (this is HIGHLY unlikely to ever occur however). Also, I do not put a monetary value on coupon envelopes aside from my cost of the envelope and the stamp used to mail.

Prizes with verifiable monetary value may be, but are not limited to:

Jewelry

Electronics

Gift Cards or codes

Gift boxes

In general, you are responsible for the information you submit when you subscribe to my blog, enter giveaways, participate in a poll or survey, or post a comment. Your comments on posts and profile information can be read by anyone and I discourage you from including your email address or other personally identifying information. I do allow you to post comments as “Anonymous” as a way to help protect your privacy.
