What information do we collect?  
This site recognizes and collects, when possible, the domain name of a visitor's server (for example, advocatehealth.com or aol.com). We do not automatically collect the full e-mail address of visitors to our website. The only way we obtain your name or e-mail address is when you choose to provide that information to us. Examples of how you might provide us with such personal information include:

  * Completing a survey or feedback form;
  * E-mailing us with a comment or question;
  * Subscribing to our e-mail notification service for new editions of Health Advocate magazine;
  * Establishing a personalized homepage via our website.



How do we use the information we collect?

  * Advocate Health Care does not sell, trade or rent personal information about its website visitors.
  * The information we collect about the domain name of the server from which you are visiting is aggregated and used solely to determine the number of visitors to our site each day, and sources of traffic.
  * E-mail addresses provided by visitors are used to respond to comments submitted through our feedback and surveys forms, when indicated. E-mail addresses provided when subscribing to e-mail bulletins are used to distribute the bulletins via email to subscribers. Information provided by visitors who choose to establish a personal homepage is used to furnish that page with the data requested by the visitor and to send information requested by the visitor.
  * If a website visitor asks us to send material that cannot be transmitted electronically, we will need to know the visitor's name, e-mail address and mailing address. We will use that information only to fulfill the visitor's request.
  * Website visitors who complete a website survey and indicate a willingness to participate in future surveys are asked to provide their name, e-mail address and telephone number. That information is shared with carefully screened market research firms with which Advocate Health Care has business relationships.



How can I get my name removed from your files?  
If you do not want to receive e-mail from Advocate Health Care, please let us know by sending an e-mail notification to [webmaster@advocatehealth.com](mailto:webmaster@advocatehealth.com). When you write, it is imperative that you provide the following information so that we can be sure to honor your request:

  * A sentence asking that your e-mail address be removed from our files.
