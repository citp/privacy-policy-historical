We are responsible for maintaining and protecting personal information under our control and have designated an individual or individuals responsible for ensuring compliance with our privacy policy.

## 2\. Identifying Purposes

We collect, use, and disclose personal information to provide you with the product or service you have requested and to offer you additional products and services we believe you might be interested in. The purposes for which we collect personal information will be identified before or at the time we collect the information. In certain circumstances, the purposes for which the information is being collected may be clear, and consent may be implied, such as when your name, address, and payment information is provided as part of the ordering process.

## 3\. Consent

Knowledge and consent are required for the collection, use, or disclosure of personal information except where required by law. Providing us with your personal information is always your choice. However, if you decide not to provide certain information, our ability to provide you with our products or services may be limited. We will not require you to consent to the collection, use, or disclosure of personal information as a condition to supplying a product or service unless we are unable to supply the product or service without it.

Personal information collected will be limited to those details necessary for the purposes identified by ADLC. With your consent, we may collect your personal information in person, over the telephone, or by corresponding with you via mail, facsimile, email or the Internet.

## 5\. Limiting Use, Disclosure, and Retention

Personal information may be used or disclosed only for the purpose for which it was collected unless you have otherwise consented, or when it is required by law. Personal information will be retained only for the period of time required to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected it or as required by law.

## 6\. Accuracy

Personal information will be kept as accurate, complete, and up-to-date as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it is to be used.

Personal information will be protected by security safeguards that are appropriate to the sensitivity level of the information. We take all reasonable precautions to protect your personal information from loss and unauthorized use, access, or disclosure.

ADLC will communicate our policies and practices with respect to the management of your personal information.

## 9\. Customer Access

Upon request, you will be informed of the existence, use, and disclosure of your personal information and given access to it. You may verify the accuracy and completeness of your personal information, and you may request that it be amended.
