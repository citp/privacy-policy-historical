<h1 class="pagetitle">Our Privacy Policy</h1>
<hr>

<p>We at Adultspace take very seriously the private nature of your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle the information we collect when you visit our site and/or become a member. Please read this notice carefully.</p>
<p>Adultspace is an online adult-oriented community where you can learn about and communicate with others. As a user, you can create a public personal profile, which can include pictures and other information about yourself. The purpose of profiles is to provide an easy way for our members to identify people they might be interested in meeting. To facilitate this social purpose of our service, the information you include in your profile is freely displayed to the public. Users can also search profiles, and communicate and send messages to each other through Adultspace.  Beyond what you choose to share, we will never use, sell, share or disclose your personal information, except as described here, or as may be required by law.</p>

<h1>Information We Collect</h1>
<hr>

<h2>Information You Provide To Us</h2>

<h3>1. Your Email Address</h3>

<p>When you join Adultspace, you are required to supply us with your email address. This is the only piece of mandatory user-specific information that we gather from you.</p>

<h3>2. Your public information</h3>

<p>When joining Adultspace.com, you are encouraged and in certain instances required to provide certain information for display to others or to the public as a part of your personal profile.  This can include your choice of an available username, a description of yourself and your interests, profession, educational level, body type, eye color, height, martial status, age, location, whether you smoke or drink, and your sexual activities and interests.</p>
<p>If you wish to remain anonymous, don’t include profile information that would allow anyone to personally identify you. For example, don’t put your real name or street address in your description of yourself, and don’t adopt a username that is similar to your real name. Also be aware that any photograph you supply will be publicly displayed, and people may recognize you.</p>
<p>Members can change their profile information at any time.</p>

<h3>3. Information Related to Financial Transactions</h3>

<p>Users must make a credit card or check payment in order to become full paid members of Adultspace.  We use the services of an outside vendor to collect these payments, and never receive information such as your credit card or bank account number, or any other information you furnish when setting up payments.  We receive only confirmation that the transaction has completed.  Our outside vendor for payment has its own privacy policy, which may be viewed at the website where payments are processed, as of this writing the direct URL for this privacy policy is: <a href="http://about.ccbill.com/html_forms/privacy_policy-english.html" target="_blank">http://about.ccbill.com/html_forms/privacy_policy-english.html</a>.  We will not use any outside vendor for payment or any other service unless they maintain a stringent privacy policy and represent that they will never give out your personally-identifiable information.</p>

<h2>C. Information We Receive and Store</h2>

<h3>1. Information Logged By Adultspace</h3>

<p>We also log certain non-personally-identifiable information, including the Internet Protocol ("IP") address assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider, aggregate user data, and browser type, as you visit our site or use our service.</p>

<h3>2. Cookies</h3>

<p>A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. Like most sites, we use cookies to store user and visitor data and to record session information.  Additionally, our advertisers may set cookies ("Advertiser Cookies") to allow an ad server to recognize your computer each time the advertiser sends you an online advertisement.</p>

<h1>II. Use and Disclosure of Information We Collect</h1>
<hr>

<p>We will use and disclose your information only as follows:</p>

<h2>B. Generally</h2>

You will also find our postal mailing address at the bottom of every email should you wish to send a written Opt-Out instruction via hardcopy.  You may also visit your account settings page to disable the sending of notifications you do not wish to receive.</p>

<h2>D. Your Public Information</h2>

<p>We may also use your profile data to improve our site and/or tailor your experience at our site, for instance to show you content that we think you might be interested in. We may also share this information with others, such as advertisers interested in our site, in aggregate, anonymous form, which means that the information will not contain any personally identifiable information about you or any other person.</p>

<h2>E. Cookies</h2>

<p>Our cookies are used to enhance the user experience, and to focus advertising. Users may be able to configure their browser to accept or reject cookies, or notify the user when a cookie is set. It is the user's responsibility to set browser preferences regarding cookies, although you should be aware that disabling cookies will affect performance and functionality of our site.  Advertisers may use Advertiser Cookies to gather information about where you accessed their advertisements and to determine which ads you clicked on.

<p>Except as set forth above, we will disclose your information to third parties only as reasonably required to protect the legal rights of us, our shareholders, members, employees and customers (such as legal representatives and law enforcement), as you expressly permit, and as required by law (such as the result of a court subpoena). We may transfer your information in the event of a sale of substantially all of the assets of our business to a third-party or in the event of a merger, consolidation or acquisition.  However, in such event, any acquirer will be subject to the provisions of our commitments to you.  We will never provide, share, rent, trade or sell user-specific personal information such as your email address to any third party marketers, unless you ask us to.</p>

<h2>D. Security</h2>

<p>Your user account is protected by the user ID and password you created. We take reasonable and proper precautions to make sure that this information is kept secret. For example, we provide access to your user information only to those employees who need access to perform their job functions, such as our technical staff.</p>

<h2>E. Notification of Changes</h2>

<p>Any changes in our Privacy Policy will be posted to this website and will become effective as of the date of posting with respect to information we then collect in the future, but will not be changed with respect to information that we have then already collected.
