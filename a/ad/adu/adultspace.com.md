We at Adultspace take very seriously the private nature of your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle the information we collect when you visit our site and/or become a member. Please read this notice carefully.

Adultspace is an online adult-oriented community where you can learn about and communicate with others. As a user, you can create a public personal profile, which can include pictures and other information about yourself. The purpose of profiles is to provide an easy way for our members to identify people they might be interested in meeting. To facilitate this social purpose of our service, the information you include in your profile is freely displayed to the public. Users can also search profiles, and communicate and send messages to each other through Adultspace. Beyond what you choose to share, we will never use, sell, share or disclose your personal information, except as described here, or as may be required by law.

## Information You Provide To Us

### 1\. Your Email Address

When you join Adultspace, you are required to supply us with your email address. This is the only piece of mandatory user-specific information that we gather from you.

### 2\. Your public information

When joining Adultspace.com, you are encouraged and in certain instances required to provide certain information for display to others or to the public as a part of your personal profile. This can include your choice of an available username, a description of yourself and your interests, profession, educational level, body type, eye color, height, martial status, age, location, whether you smoke or drink, and your sexual activities and interests.

If you wish to remain anonymous, don’t include profile information that would allow anyone to personally identify you. For example, don’t put your real name or street address in your description of yourself, and don’t adopt a username that is similar to your real name. Also be aware that any photograph you supply will be publicly displayed, and people may recognize you.

Members can change their profile information at any time.

We receive only confirmation that the transaction has completed. Our outside vendor for payment has its own privacy policy, which may be viewed at the website where payments are processed, as of this writing the direct URL for this privacy policy is: <http://about.ccbill.com/html_forms/privacy_policy-english.html>.
