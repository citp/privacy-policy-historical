                    “web beacons” or other tracking technologies. Cookies are text files placed in your computer's
                    browser to store your preferences. We use cookies or other tracking technologies to understand
                    Service and Internet usage and to improve or customize the products, content, offerings, services
                    or advertisements on our Services. For example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience
                    at our Services (e.g., to recognize you by name when you return to a Service), save your password
                    in password-protected areas, and enable you to use shopping carts on our Services. We also may use
                    cookies or other tracking technologies to help us offer you products, content, offerings or
                    services that may be of interest to you and to deliver relevant advertising when you visit this
                    Service, a Turner Affiliate’s Service, or when you visit other websites or applications. We or a
                    third party platform with whom we work may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser to
                    enable you to receive customized content, offers, services or advertisements on our Services or

                    may be associated with de-identified demographic or other data linked to or derived from data you
                    voluntarily have submitted to us (e.g., your email address) that we may share with a service

                    We, our third party service providers, advertisers, advertising networks and platforms, agencies,

                    performance of advertisements displayed on or delivered by or through the Turner Network and/or
                    other networks or Services. This also helps us, our service providers and Partners provide more

                cookies) in order to match our Partners’ uniquely coded user identifiers to our own. We may do this,
                for instance, to enhance data points about a particular unique browser or device, and thus enable us or
                others to send ads that are more relevant, match Users to their likely product interests, or better
                synchronize, cap, or optimize advertising.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Locally Stored Objects.</strong> Services on the Turner Network may employ locally stored
                objects (“LSOs”) and other client side storage tracking technologies in certain situations where they
                help to provide a better user experience, such as to remember settings, preferences and usage similar
                to browser cookies, or in order to target or help our Partners target ads, analyze ad performance, or
                perform user, website or market analytics. For LSOs utilized by Adobe Flash you can access Flash
                management tools from&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html"><strong>Adobe’s

                    However, if you disable the use of cookies in your web browser, some features of the Services may

                <strong>Web Beacons.</strong> We and our Partners may also use “web beacons” or clear GIFs, or similar
                technologies, which are small pieces of code placed on a Service or in an email, to monitor the
                behavior and collect data about the visitors viewing a Service or email. For example, web beacons may
                be used to count the users who visit a web page or to deliver a cookie to the browser of a visitor
                viewing that Service. Web beacons may also be used to provide information on the effectiveness of our
                email campaigns (e.g., open rates, clicks, forwards, etc.).

            <li>
                <strong>Mobile Device Identifiers and SDKs.</strong> We also sometimes use, or partner with publishers
                or publisher-facing or app developer platforms that use, mobile Software Development Kits (“SDKs”), to
                collect information, such as mobile identifiers (e.g., IDFAs and Android Advertising IDs), and
                information connected to how mobile devices interact with our Sites and those using our Sites. Such
                SDKs provide computer code that app developers can include in their apps to enable ads to be shown,
                data to be collected, and related services or analytics to be performed. We may use this technology to
                deliver or help our partners and other third parties to deliver certain advertising through mobile
                applications and browsers based on information associated with your mobile device. If you’d like to
                opt-out from having ads tailored to you in this way on your mobile device, please follow the

                <p>
                    California’s “Shine the Light” law, Civil Code section 1798.83, requires certain businesses to
                    respond to requests from California customers asking about the business' practices related to
                    disclosing personal information to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes.
                    Alternately, businesses may have in place a policy not to disclose personal information of
                    customers to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes if the customer has
                    exercised an option to opt-out of such information-sharing. We have such a policy in place. As
                    discussed above in <strong><a href="#how-to-contact">How to Contact Us/Opting Out of Marketing
                            Communications</a></strong>, if you wish to opt-out of our sharing of your personal
                    Information with third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes or to find out more
                    about your opt-out rights, please contact our Privacy Policy Coordinator as described above.
