				<strong>CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS PRIVACY RIGHTS</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				Companies that collect personally identifiable information ("PII")
				from California residents and disclose such information to Third
				Parties (including affiliated entities) for marketing purposes must,
				in response to a request by a consumer, either (1) provide a list
				detailing the categories of information shared and the entities to
				which such information was provided, or (2) provide a mechanism by
				which a consumer may opt-out of having their information shared with
				Third Parties. We have elected the second option and you may request
				that your PII not be shared with Third Parties by sending your
				request, including your full name, email address and postal address
				to:
				AdultRev				, LLC., P.O. Box 96718, Las Vegas, NV 89193-6718. In
				accordance with California Civil Code Sec. 1789.3, California
				resident users are entitled to know that they may file grievances
				and complaints with California Department of Consumer Affairs, 400 R
				Street, Suite 1080, Sacramento, CA 95814; or by phone at
				916-445-1254 or 800-952-5210; or by email to dca@dca.ca.gov.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>THE INFORMATION COLLECTION, USE AND DISSEMINATION
					PRACTICES OF AdultRev.
				</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>1. Collection of Information.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>1.1 Survey Information</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				AdultRev				collects information from individuals by various methods, including,
				but not limited to, when an individual voluntarily completes a
				survey, order form, or a registration page either online or offline,
				or by means of online or offline surveys, order forms, or
				registration pages operated by Third Parties (collectively, a
				"Survey"). (As used herein, "online" means using the Internet,
				including the Websites, and related technologies, and "offline"
				means by methods other than online, including in person, in the
				postal mail, using telephones and cell phones, and other similar
				means.) In the Surveys,
				AdultRev				or a Third Party (a "Third Party") may ask an individual to provide
				various information to
				AdultRev				, which may include his or her name, email address, street address,
				zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and
				carriers), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital
				status, occupation, social security number, employment information,
				personal and online interests, and such other information as may be
				requested from time to time (together, "Survey Information").
				AdultRev				may also collect information concerning an individual from another
				source and uses that information in combination with information
				provided from this web site. Completing the Surveys is completely
				voluntary, and individuals are under no obligation to provide Survey
				Information to
				AdultRev				or Third Party, but an individual may receive incentives from
				AdultRev				or a Third Party in exchange for providing Survey Information to
				AdultRev				.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>1.2 Site Membership or Registration</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				To the extent registration is required to receive email and possibly
				postal communications from
				AdultRev				or a Third Party Advertiser, this Privacy Policy also applies to
				consumers that have agreed to receive e-mail marketing from
				AdultRev				or a Third Party Advertiser, whether at our Website, via email, on
				Third Party websites or otherwise. We collect information in certain
				portions of our Website, where guests provide content submissions
				and suggestions or participate in interactive online activities
				(i.e., by way of responding to questions and surveys, community
				listings, ratings, searches and comparison searches, bidding,
				purchasing, chat, games, or bulletin boards, etc.). The personal
				profile information you submit to
				AdultRev				or Third Party Advertisers remains your property, but by submitting
				that information to
				AdultRev				or Third Party Advertisers, you grant
				AdultRev				and/or Third Party Advertisers, the right to use that information
				for marketing purposes.
				AdultRev				or Third Party Advertisers may also use such information for content
				improvement and feedback purposes. We may sell the personal
				information that you supply to us and we may join together with
				other businesses to bring selected retail opportunities to you.
				These businesses may include providers of direct marketing services
				and applications, including lookup and reference, data enhancement,
				suppression and validation. In addition,
				AdultRev				reserves the right to release current or past information in the
				event
				AdultRev				believes that the information is being or has been used in violation
				of the Rules or to commit unlawful acts, if the information is
				subpoenaed, if
				AdultRev				is sold or acquired, or when
				AdultRev				deems it necessary or appropriate. By agreeing to these terms, you
				hereby consent to disclosure of any record or communication to any
				Third Party when
				AdultRev				in its sole discretion, determines the disclosure to be appropriate.
			</p>
			<p>
				"Subscription" occurs when an end-user registers for
				AdultRev				's and/or Third Party Advertisers' services, either via registration
				at our website, via co-registration at a marketing partner's
				website, or via a permission pass / opt-out / no-opt mailing
				AdultRev				collects personally identifiable information about our subscribers,
				based on: information gathered at the time of registration,
				subscriber interaction and response to subsequent electronic
				mailings and website use, information provided by marketing
				partners, and information appended from data aggregators.
				Information collected may include, but is not necessarily limited
				to: name, email address, postal address, gender, birth date,
				telephone number, activity, interests, user behavior and other
				demographic information. This information enables us to better
				tailor our content to subscribers' needs and to help our clients to
				promote and sell their products and services.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>1.3 Third Party List Information</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				AdultRev				collects information from individuals when an individual provides
				information to a Third Party and
				AdultRev				subsequently purchases, licenses, or otherwise acquires the
				information from the Third Party (the "Seller"). Such purchased
				information may include, but is not limited to, an individual's
				name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers
				(including cell phone numbers and carriers), birth date, gender,
				salary range, education and marital status, occupation, industry of
				employment, personal and online interests, and such other
				information as the individual may have provided to the Seller
				(together, "Third Party List Information"). When acquiring Third
				Party List Information,
				AdultRev				seeks assurances from the Seller that the Seller has a right to
				transfer the Third Party List Information to
				AdultRev				and that the Seller has a right to provide offers from Advertisers
				to the individuals whose personal information is included on the
				Seller's list.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>1.4 Other Information.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				Other occasions when
				AdultRev				obtains information from individuals include (1) when an individual
				is making a claim for a prize or seeking to redeem an incentive
				offered by
				AdultRev				or by a Third Party, (2) when an individual requests assistance
				through
				AdultRev				's customer service department, (3) when an individual voluntarily
				subscribes to a service or newsletter; (4) when private information
				is provided by means of a referral by a third party to
				AdultRev				or a Third Party Advertiser (together, "Other Information").
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>1.5 Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Info Collected
					using Technology.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				AdultRev				currently uses cookie and web beacon technology to associate certain
				Internet-related information about an individual with information
				about the individual in our database. Additionally,
				AdultRev				may use other new and evolving sources of information in the future
				(together, "Technology Information").
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>a.Cookies.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				A cookie is a small amount of data stored on the hard drive of the
				individual's computer that allows
				AdultRev				to identify the individual with his or her corresponding data that
				resides in
				AdultRev				's database. You may read more about cookies at
				http://cookiecentral.com. Individuals who use the Websites need to
				accept cookies in order to use all of the features and functionality
				of the Websites.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>a.Web Beacons.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				A web beacon is programming code that can be used to display an
				image on a web page (by using a programming function -- see
				http://truste.org for more information), but can also be used to
				transfer an individual's unique user identification (often in the
				form of a cookie) to a database and associate the individual with
				previously acquired information about an individual in a database.
				This allows
				AdultRev				to track certain websites an individual visits online. Web beacons
				are used to determine products or services an individual may be
				interested in, and to track online behavioral habits for marketing
				purposes. For example,
				AdultRev				might place, with the consent of a Third Party website, a web beacon
				on the Third Party's website where cosmetics are sold. When Jane, an
				individual listed in
				AdultRev				's database, visits the cosmetic website,
				AdultRev				receives notice by means of the web beacon that Jane visited the
				cosmetics site, and
				AdultRev				would then update Jane's profile with the information that Jane is
				interested in cosmetics.
				AdultRev				may thereafter present offers of cosmetic related products and
				services to Jane. In addition to using web beacons on web pages,
				AdultRev				also uses web beacons in email messages sent to individuals listed
				in
				AdultRev				's database.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>a.New Technology.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				The use of technology on the Internet, including cookies and web
				beacons, is rapidly evolving, as is
				AdultRev				's use of new and evolving technology. As a result,
				AdultRev				strongly encourages individuals to revisit this policy for any
				updates regarding its use of technology.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>a.Usage Tracking.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				AdultRev				tracks information related to the electronic mailings and web pages
				viewed by users and subscribers, as well as the hyperlinks clicked
				by subscribers, while viewing our emails or visiting our websites.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>a.Log Files.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>Log files are used to track and monitor subscriber usage.</p>
			<p>
				<strong>a.Optional Registration.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				AdultRev				may offer free voluntary registration to potential subscribers.
				During such registration, the subscriber is required to supply an
				email address and other personal information. This information is
				required if the subscriber wants to participate in Company services
				or Third Party Services.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>a.Feedback and Inquiries.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				You have the ability to contact
				AdultRev				to provide us with your feedback.
				AdultRev				uses this information to respond to you and analyze customer service
				issues.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>1.6 Outside Information</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				AdultRev				may receive information about individuals from Third Parties or from
				other sources of information outside of
				AdultRev				including information located in public databases ("Outside
				Information").
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>1.7 Individual Information</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				As used herein, Individual Information means Survey Information,
				Third Party List Information, Other Information, Technology
				Information, and Outside Information, and any other information
				AdultRev				gathers or receives about individuals.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>1.8 No Information Collected from Children.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				AdultRev				encourages parents and guardians to spend time online with their
				children and to participate and monitor the interactive activities
				of their children.
				AdultRev				will never knowingly collect any personal information about children
				under the age of 18. MINORS UNDER THE AGE OF 18 SHOULD NOT PROVIDE
				ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION, INCLUDING THEIR EMAIL ADDRESS, TO
				ADULTREV				. If
				AdultRev				obtains actual knowledge that it has collected personal information
				about a child under the age of 18, that information will be
				immediately deleted from our active database. Because it does not
				collect such information,
				AdultRev				has no such information to use or to disclose to Third Parties.
				AdultRev				has designed this policy in order to comply with the Children's
				Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA").
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>1.9 Credit Card Information.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				AdultRev				may in certain cases collect credit card numbers and related
				information, such as the expiration date of the card ("Credit Card
				Information") when an individual places an order from
				AdultRev				. When the Credit Card Information is submitted to
				AdultRev				, such information is encrypted and is protected with SSL encryption
				software.
				AdultRev				will use the Credit Card Information for purposes of processing and
				completing the purchase transaction, and the Credit Card Information
				will be disclosed to Third Parties only as necessary to complete the
				purchase transaction. Although
				AdultRev				takes all commercially reasonable action to protect Credit Card
				Information, you ultimately assume the risk of any damage or loss as
				a result of transmitting such information to
				AdultRev				, including but not limited to, identify theft, credit card fraud or
				credit card loss.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>1.10 Links to External Websites.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				AdultRev				's emails and websites contain links to external websites. You will
				be taken to external websites if you click on these links. Your
				information may be passed from
				AdultRev				's database to the external website, and/or external database, for
				your convenience (e.g. your information may be used to pre-fill a
				form at a destination website).
				AdultRev				is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of any
				external website owner. We encourage you to review the privacy
				policy of any website they visit.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>2. Use of Individual Information.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>2.1 Discretion of Information.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>THE COMPANY MAY USE INDIVIDUAL INFORMATION FOR ANY
					LEGALLY PERMISSIBLE PURPOSE IN COMPANY'S SOLE DISCRETION.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				The following paragraphs in Section 2 describe how
				AdultRev				currently uses Individual Information, but
				AdultRev				may change or broaden its use at any time. As noted below,
				AdultRev				may update this policy from time to time.
				AdultRev				may use Individual Information to provide promotional offers to
				individuals by means of email advertising, telephone marketing,
				direct mail marketing, online banner advertising, and package
				stuffers, among other possible uses.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>2.2 Email and Unsubscribe Policy.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				AdultRev				uses Individual Information to provide promotional offers by email
				to individuals.
				AdultRev				may maintain separate email lists for different purposes. If email
				recipients wish to end their email subscription from a particular
				list, they need to follow the instructions at the end of each email
				message to unsubscribe from the particular list. To unsubscribe from
				all
				AdultRev				's email lists, a person must send an email to network@
				AdultRev				.com.
				AdultRev				's unsubscribe process impacts only the future delivery of
				electronic mailings disseminated by
				AdultRev				on its own behalf. You may still receive electronic mailings sent on
				behalf of Third Parties and your personal information may still be
				shared with Third Parties for use in offline marketing and data
				appends, including email appends.
			</p>
			<p>
				You should also note that unsubscribing from
				AdultRev				's electronic mailings will not automatically unsubscribe the
				subscriber's information from any Third Party associates and
				licensees of the data. Since Third Party associates and licensee
				partners maintain separate databases from
				AdultRev				, and you will need to unsubscribe from each source individually, if
				desired. This allows you the freedom to pick and choose which
				subscriptions to maintain and which to discontinue.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>2.3 Content of Email Messages.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				In certain commercial email messages sent by
				AdultRev				, an Advertiser's name will appear in the "From:" line but hitting
				the "Reply" button will cause a reply email to be sent to
				AdultRev				. The "Subject:" line of
				AdultRev				email messages will usually contain a line provided from the
				Advertiser to
				AdultRev				.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>2.4 Solicited Email.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				AdultRev				only sends email to individuals who have agreed on the Websites to
				receive email from
				AdultRev				or to individuals who have agreed on Third Party websites to receive
				email from Third Parties. As such
				AdultRev				does not send unsolicited email messages. As a result, statutes
				requiring certain formatting for unsolicited email are not
				applicable to
				AdultRev				's email messages.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>2.5 Targeted Advertising.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				AdultRev				uses Individual Information to target advertising to an individual.
				When an individual is using the Internet,
				AdultRev				uses Technology Information (see also Section 2.7 below) to
				associate an individual with that person's Individual Information,
				and
				AdultRev				attempts to show advertising for products and services in which the
				person has expressed an interest in the Surveys, indicated an
				interest by means of Technology Information, and otherwise.
				AdultRev				may, at its discretion, target advertising by using email, direct
				mail, telephones, cell phones, and other means of communication to
				provide promotional offers.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>2.6 Direct Mail and Telemarketing.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				AdultRev				uses Individual Information to advertise, directly or indirectly, to
				individuals using direct mail marketing or telemarketing using
				telephones and cell phones.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>2.7 Use of Technology Information.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				AdultRev				uses Technology Information (1) to match a person's Survey
				Information and Third Party List Information to other categories of
				Individual Information to make and improve profiles of individuals,
				(2) to track a person's online browsing habits on the Internet, (3)
				to determine which areas of
				AdultRev				's websites are most frequently visited. This information helps
				AdultRev				to better understand the online habits of individuals so that
				AdultRev				can target advertising and promotions to them.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>2.8 Profiles of Individuals.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				AdultRev				uses Individual Information to make a profile of an individual. A
				profile can be created by combining Survey Information and Third
				Party List Information with other sources of Individual Information
				such as behavioral and other information obtained from public
