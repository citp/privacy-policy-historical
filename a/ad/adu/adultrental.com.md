# Privacy Policy Statement

### Privacy Policy Statement

We recognize the importance of protecting the privacy of personal information about our customers. As such, this Privacy Policy applies to collection, use, storage and disclosure of information by us. 

In General, we do not collect, store, use or disclose personally identifying information. For each visitor to our Web page, our Web server automatically recognizes only the consumer's domain name, but not the e-mail address (where possible). 

We collect only the domain name, but not the e-mail address of visitors to our web page, aggregate information on what pages consumers access or visit, user-specific information on what pages consumers access or visit and information volunteered by the consumer, such as survey information and/or site registrations. 

The information we collect is used for internal review and is then discarded, used to improve the content of our Web page and not shared with other organizations for commercial purposes. 

Where the email address is actively disclosed to us, whether through submission in a form or as a part of the signup process for a website subscription, we will use this primarily as an identifier of your user account, but there may be periodic mailings from us of related news and information regarding your subscriptions. We may also send you additional email relating to third-party websites or offers that we deem may be of interest based on your subscription details. For all of these mailings there will be a full and clear opt-out link, and you can always request removal from these mailing lists by emailing support@customercarelive.com with subject line "REMOVE". 

Please be aware that, as part of the Services, we provide links to Web sites operated by third parties, and is not responsible for the information collection or privacy practices or the content of those third party Web sites or applications. 

Epoch, CC Bill, Prolast and iBill are our credit card processors. Web Transaction Services (WTS) is our online check processor. We do not store or maintain any credit or personal information. All information is stored at our designated processors' highly secure sites.
