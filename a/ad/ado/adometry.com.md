# Privacy Policy - Adometry by Google

## Adometry Products and Services Privacy Policy

Adometry is the leading provider of ad analytics, delivering actionable insight to improve the performance of online advertising. Adometry provides scoring, auditing, verification, and attribution metrics to optimize results and improve return. Formerly known as Click Forensics, Inc., Adometry has been improving online traffic quality for over half a decade. We have created this privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”) to demonstrate our commitment to our customers, the privacy of their website visitors and our website visitors, and the right of privacy throughout the Internet. Privacy is of great importance to us. Because we gather important information on behalf of our customers on portions of their websites and/or advertising campaigns, we have established this Privacy Policy as a means to communicate our information gathering and dissemination practices.

## Customer Personal Information

Adometry collects and uses the personal information of its customers to provide, maintain, protect, and improve its services, and to develop new ones.  Adometry may share that information with affiliates and other trusted businesses third-party service providers to process that information for Adometry in accordance with Adometry’s instructions, privacy policy, and other appropriate confidentiality and security practices.

## Customer Data

We act as a limited agent to each of our customers only for the purpose of providing Internet data hosting and optimization products and services. Our corporate customers may use information that has been gathered by us on their website(s) and/or ad servers and other information provided to us (by the customer or their trusted partners or agencies) to optimize results of online advertising campaigns. This information may include (but is not limited to) general website traffic patterns, pages visited, referring domains, referring search engines, campaign success rates, visitor attrition rates, and types of product(s) purchased. All such information is and will remain customer property, and will be treated by Adometry as proprietary and confidential information of each customer. As such, and subject to the remainder of this paragraph, Adometry will not disclose such information to any third party, unless specifically and rightfully instructed or directed to do so by the customer. Adometry will not review, share, disclose, distribute, print, or reference any such information except as requested or directed by the customer or as may be required by law. Individual customer records may at times be viewed or accessed only for the purpose of resolving a problem, addressing a support issue, fulfilling a billing requirement, or as may be required by law. Our corporate customers are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of their usernames and passwords to log into their accounts. We may store and process personal information in the United States or any other country in which we maintain facilities.

## Cookies and Anonymous Identifiers

Cookies are files that Web servers place on an Internet user’s computer that are designed to store basic information (such as visitor preferences). Most of our customers use Adometry cookies with their websites and advertisements. On mobile platforms, where cookies are not available, our customers may also use anonymous identifiers made available through those platforms, to serve the same purposes.  This helps our customers to better estimate the number of individual anonymous visitors to their website(s) and measure the performance of their marketing. There are two types of cookies that may be used: session and persistent. Session cookies exist only during a website visitor’s online session. They disappear from the visitor’s computer when he/she closes the browser software. Persistent cookies remain on the visitor’s computer after the browser has been closed. Adometry uses cookies on its site to improve the experience of site visitors. Adometry also works with its affiliates and partners who use cookies to gather information about how visitors use Adometry.com and may use this information for its advertising purposes.  Adometry may also combine the information collected about how visitors use this site with other information that they provide to us directly, including personal information, such as information that provided in a request for information about Adometry’s services, for marketing purposes as described herein.

### Opting Out

Adometry provides a mechanism to opt out of tracking through the use of Adometry cookies.

You also have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies set by our customers if you prefer. If you are using a public computer or do not otherwise want this information to be stored, you can select the appropriate radio button on the sign-in page, and this cookie will not be used. For further information about disabling cookies you can visit [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/). If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to sign in or use other interactive features of certain web sites and services that depend on cookies.  On mobile platforms, the controls available regarding the use of an anonymous identifier are determined by the mobile platform. You can learn more about our advertising partners, including how to opt-out of interest-based advertising by going to <http://www.aboutads.info/choices> and opting out of the following partners’ interest-based ads:  Google Inc., Bizo.  _Enforcement_ : Adometry regularly reviews compliance with this Privacy Policy and verifies that the policy is accurate, comprehensive for the information intended to be covered, prominently displayed, completely implemented and accessible. We encourage interested persons to raise any concerns using the contact information provided and we will investigate and attempt to resolve any complaints and disputes regarding use and disclosure of personal information. in accordance with the Safe Harbor Principles. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that we cannot resolve with our users directly.

### Safe Harbor

Adometry complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland, and has certified that it adheres to the relevant Safe Harbor Privacy Principles. To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view Adometry’s certification, please visit <http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/>.

### Clear Gifs

Clear gifs (also known as web beacons) are used in combination with cookies to help our customers understand how visitors interact with their websites. A clear gif is typically a transparent graphic image (usually 1 pixel x 1 pixel) that is placed on a site. The use of a clear gif allows the website owner to measure the actions of the visitor opening the page that contains the clear gif. Most of our customers use clear gifs on their websites in connection with our products and services. Because clear gifs are included within the recipe for a web page (just the same as any other content request), you cannot opt out or refuse them. However, where they are used in conjunction with cookies they can be rendered ineffective by either opting out of cookies or by changing the cookie settings in your browser (see above Section titled “Controlling our use of Cookies”). In other instances, such as in the case of emails, clear gifs are not used in conjunction with cookies and if you are unhappy with the use of clear gifs in such manner, then you should not use the website in question.

## Customer Policies

We strongly recommend that our customers, as data controllers (in the EU context), add statements or clauses to their privacy policies specifically describing their use of third party hosted optimization products and services (such as those provided by Adometry) and describing the details of such third party products and services (such as the use of cookies and clear gifs/web beacons). Further, we strongly recommend that each of our customers provide their visitors with information regarding the ability to opt-out of session data aggregation and analysis (see opt out section above). It is very important that you review the respective privacy policy of each customer website that you visit, because such privacy policies govern the use of information on those websites.

## E-Mail Privacy Policy on This Site

Adometry, Inc. will not sell or barter your email address to third parties. Additionally, we will not make your email address available to third parties unless they are serving as a contracted vendor on our behalf to send you the email you explicitly requested, and they have strict privacy and security precautions in place.
