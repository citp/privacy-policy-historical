### 2\. Privacy protection

  * We do not run banner ads, pop-ups, pop-unders, or commercial ads of any forms. 
  * We do not share your information with third parties for marketing purposes. 
  * We do not engage in cross-marketing or link-referral programs with other sites. 
  * We do not employ tracking devices for marketing purposes (cookies, web beacons, single-pixel gifs, etc.). 
  * We do not send you unsolicited communications for marketing purposes. 
  * Your account information is password-protected. 
  * Our Forum uses basic webserver authentication. 
  * ADONVIEW does not knowingly collect any information from persons under the age of 18. If we learn that a posting is by a person under the age of 18, we will remove that post. 
  * ADONVIEW, or ads posted on ADONVIEW, may provide links to third-party websites, which may have different privacy practices. We are not responsible for, nor have any control over, the privacy policies of those third-party websites, and encourage all users to read the privacy policies of each and every website visited. 



### 3\. Data collection

  * We may collect your email address, for purposes such as sending self-publishing and confirmation emails, authenticating user account, providing subscription email services, registering for forums, etc. 
  * We may collect contact information such as name, address, phone number and fax number for billing purposes. 
  * We may collect your phone number for account authentication purposes, and may transmit it to a third-party service for tele-robotic verification. 
  * ADONVIEW does not store credit card information. Credit card transactions are transmitted to a financial gateway, and we endeavor to protect the security of your payment information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. 
  * We may collect personal information if you provide it in feedback or comments, post it on our classifieds or interactive forums, or if you contact us directly. 
  * Our web logs collect standard web log entries for each page served, including your IP address, page URL, and timestamp. Web logs help us to diagnose problems with our server, to administer the ADONVIEW site, and to otherwise provide our service to you.

  * ADONVIEW may also disclose information about its users to the law enforcement officers or others, in the good faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our terms and conditions to respond to claims that any posting or other content violates the rights of third parties; or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of ADONVIEW staff, ADONVIEW users or the general public. 



### 7\. International users

  * By visiting our web site and providing us with data, you acknowledge and agree that due to the international dimension of ADONVIEW, we may use the data collected in the course of our relationship for the purposes identified in this policy or in our other communications with you, including the transmission of information outside your resident jurisdiction.
