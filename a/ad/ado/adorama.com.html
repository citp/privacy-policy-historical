      <p class="prolabheadder"><a name="TypesInformation"></a>1. Types of information 
        we collect: </p>
      <p> There are two types of information that Adorama collects online: (1) 
        personally identifiable information supplied by visitors to our web site, 
        and (2) non-personal information gathered as visitors navigate through 
        the web site. <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Personally Identifiable Information</strong><br>
        Personally identifiable information is information that can be directly 
        associated with a specific person or entity, such as name, address, or 
        email address. Adorama collects personally identifiable information from 
        site visitors in the following instances:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> When you place an order on our site, we require you to provide your 
          name, email address, mailing address, telephone number and credit card 
          information. <br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li> At the time of ordering, you may also choose to register by creating 
          a user name and password. By registering, you create a user profile 
          which allows us to customize your experience on this web site, as well 
          as provide a faster method for you to submit a request for information 
          to www.adorama.com and receive back either the information or products 
          desired.<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li> When you voluntarily provide us with your information via a web form 
          on our web site, or while corresponding with us via email.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><br>
        It is not necessary to provide any personally identifiable information 
        in order to simply browse our web site.</p>
      <p><br>
        <strong>Non-Personal Information</strong><br>
        Adorama routinely gathers non-personal information, including how many 
        people visit this web site, the pages they visit, where they come from, 
        how long they stay, their IP address, and the type of browser they used 
        while visiting. None of this information is used to identify you personally.<br>
        <br>
        Non-personal information is gathered through the use of cookies, web beacons 
        and web server logs.</p>
      <ul>
        <li> A cookie is a small piece of information that a web site sends to 
          a visitor's computer and which is then stored on the visitor's hard 
          drive. <br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li> A Web beacon is an electronic image, also known as a clear GIF or 
          a single-pixel (1x1). Web beacons can recognize certain types of information 
          on a visitor's computer, such as a visitor's cookie number, the time 
          and date of a page view, and a description of the page where the Web 
          beacon is placed. You may render some Web beacons unusable by rejecting 
          their associated cookies.<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li> A web server log is a file where web site activity is stored. Every 
          time a visitor requests a file or web page an entry is made into our 
          server logs. These files include the HTML files and their imbedded graphic 
          images and any other associated files that are transmitted to Web site 
          visitors. Log files can be analyzed and summarized by another program.</li>
      </ul>
      <p> Although Adorama uses web server logs, web beacons, and cookies on this 
        web site, we do not know who any visitor is unless that person specifically 
        tells us.</p>
      <p><a href="#TOP"><img src="/artworks2/Back_to_top.gif" width="74" height="13" border="0"></a><br><br></p> 
      <p class="prolabheadder"><a name="HowWeUseInfo"></a>2. How we use your information </p>
      <p> <strong>Non-Personal Information</strong><br>
        Adorama typically uses the non-personal information we collect in order 
        to better understand how you and other visitors use our web site, for 
        system administration, to confirm that you’ve opened the emails 
        that we send you, and to customize your experience when using this web 
        site. For example, we use cookies to ensure that items added to your shopping 
        cart during one visit are accessible to you on subsequent visits until 
        you either place an order or delete the items from the shopping cart.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Personally Identifiable Information</strong><br>
        Adorama may share your personally identifiable information with trusted 
        third party vendors for the sole purpose of facilitating your order. For 
        example, we provide your name, shipping address, phone number, and order 
        information to our shipping carrier. We also may provide your name, billing 
        address, and credit card information to the credit card processor that 
        facilitates the transaction. Adorama has strict guidelines requiring all 
        third parties to keep any shared personally identifiable information confidential.<br>
        <br>
        Unless otherwise required by law, or if pertinent to a judicial or governmental 
        investigation, or as voluntarily released by you, your personally identifiable 
        information is not shared with other organizations or persons, other than 
        to organizations or persons assisting us in collecting, assembling or 
        processing this information.<br>
        <br>
        In the course of growing or restructuring our business, we may purchase 
        the assets of another company or sell the assets of our company. During 
        these transactions, information about customers is frequently considered 
        a business asset that is the subject of such a purchase or sale. Also, 
        in the unlikely event that Adorama, or substantially all of its assets 
        are either acquired or subject to liquidation in bankruptcy, information 
        may be transferred as well. We will require third parties who obtain access 
        to your information as a result of a transaction to adhere to this privacy 
        policy as a condition to transferring the information to them.</p>

      <p> This web site is designed for those 15 years of age and older. We will 
        not knowingly collect information of any kind from anyone under the age 
        of 13. If we become aware of a visitor under the age of 13 providing information 
        on our site, we will terminate any accounts associated with that visitor 
        and purge our databases of all information provided by that visitor.</p>

      <p class="prolabheadder"> <a name="Accuracy"></a>4. Access, accuracy and 
        opt-out rights</p>
      <p> Adorama will make every effort to provide you with access to your personally 
        identifiable information so that you may review, update or correct that 
        information. To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable 
        steps to verify your identity before enabling you to view your data and/or 
        make corrections. If you have submitted personally identifiable information 
        to Adorama and would like it removed or modified, please contact us at

        efforts to comply with your request.<br>
        <br>
        If you don’t want Adorama to gather non-personal information about 
        you and/or place cookies onto your desktop, you can generally change your 
        cookie and other security settings on your web browser. For more information, 
        please consult your web browser documentation. Please keep in mind that 
        if you choose to prevent Adorama from placing cookies onto your desktop,

        If you have registered on this web site, your personally identifiable 
        information relating to you and your order history are available to you. 
        However, each time you log into your account on this web site, you will 
        be required to provide the password that you created at the time you registered. 
        After providing your password, you can edit or delete your information

        <br>
        We will also provide you the opportunity to opt-out at any time of certain 
        or all contact from Adorama, and we will do everything we can to honor 
        such requests. This choice will generally be offered at the bottom of 
        our on-line or off-line communications to you. If you have any difficulty 
        exercising your choices, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@adorama.com">info@adorama.com</a>,

      <p class="prolabheadder"> <a name="Security"></a>5. Security </p>
      <p> The security of your information is very important to us. Adorama follows 
        generally accepted industry standards to protect the information submitted 
        to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. We use state-of-the-art 
        data encryption technology to protect against loss, misuse or alteration 
        of your user information. Secure Socket Layers (SSLs) encrypt the information 
        sent between your computer and our database. Our ordering system is certified 
        by Verisign, an internet leader in security transactions. In addition, 
        we use Internet fraud screening to protect credit card transactions.<br>
        <br>
        To be sure you're browsing secure pages, check your Web browser's status 
        bar (located at the bottom of the window) for the closed padlock icon. 
        This icon appears in the latest versions of Internet Explorer and Netscape 
        Navigator to tell you that you are viewing a secure web page. Also, all 
        browsers display an "s" after the "http" (https://..) 
        in the Web site address to indicate that you're in a secure environment.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Credit Card Fraud Warranty</strong><br>
        We guarantee that every online transaction you make will be 100% safe. 
        This means you pay nothing if unauthorized charges are made to your card 
        as a result of shopping at our online store. Under the Fair Credit Billing 
        Act, your bank generally cannot hold you liable for more than $50.00 of 
        fraudulent charges. If your bank does hold you liable for any of this 
        $50.00, we will cover the entire liability for you, up to the full $50.00. 
        We will only cover this liability if the unauthorized use of your credit 
        card resulted through no fault of your own from purchases made while using 
        the secure server. In the event of unauthorized use of your credit card, 
        you must notify your credit card provider in accordance with its reporting 
        rules and procedures.<br>
        <br>

      <p class="prolabheadder"><a name="ThirdParty"></a>6. Third party use of 
        information collected on this web site </p>
      <p> The Adorama web site may contain links to other sites. We do not endorse 
        or otherwise accept responsibility for the content or privacy policies 
        of those sites.<br>
        <br>
        Adorama may share your personally identifiable information with trusted 
        third party vendors for the sole purpose of facilitating your order. For 
        example, we provide your name, shipping address, phone number, and order 
        information to our shipping carrier. We also may provide your name, billing 
        address, and credit card information to the credit card processor that 
        facilitates the transaction. We also may grant limited access to your 
        name and email address to the agency that deploys emails and other marketing 
        campaigns on our behalf for the purpose of improving our marketing outreach 
        programs. Adorama has strict guidelines requiring all third parties to 
        keep any shared personally identifiable information confidential.<br>
        <br>
        Adorama may employ additional third parties to provide marketing services 
        on our behalf. With our approval, these third parties may also place “cookies” 
        onto your computer for analysis purposes. These third party companies 
        will have access to the information needed to perform their functions 
        but cannot use that information for any other purpose. These third party 
        companies will only have access to non-personal information about your 
        visit or transaction, such as the URLS which lead you to and around our 
        web site, the pages visited, the product(s) purchased, and the amount 
        spent. These companies will not have access to information that will allow 
        them to personally identify you.</p>
