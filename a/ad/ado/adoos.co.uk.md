    This information is used exclusively to provide Adoos services (for example, to send notifications of new jobs to your e-mail address), and only with your consent. Adoos always watches to make sure that you have the opportunity to refuse these services, as well as edit or delete any personal information provided during the use of these services.
    
    2. Cookie files are files which contain a small amount of data transmitted by a web host to your web browser, which are then stored on your computer's hard disk.
    
    In most cases, these files are used by Adoos to identify you during subsequent Adoos visits, making the interface and site navigation easier for you.
    In other cases, Adoos saves in the cookies anonymous auxiliary information which is in no way tied to your identity.
    You may at any point forbid your web browser from accepting cookies. However, you should take into account that this may cause the incorrect functioning of some Adoos services as described in paragraph 2b above.

    Information from log data is used only for statistical purposes for the improvement and maintenance of Adoos services.
    
    Adoos pages may contain links to other Internet websites, which may in turn collect information of their own, save their own cookie files, etc. We do not control these sites or their privacy policies.
    
    Adoos uses the information that you provide only for the purposes described above. The usage of this information for any other purpose is possible only with your consent, which will be explicitly obtained via your e-mail address or mail message.
