The information collection, use, and dissemination practices of Adonis Golden Ratio This policy applies to Adonis Golden Ratio's collection, use, storage and disclosure of information by Adonis Golden Ratio on its (a) websites, including all its divisions, subsidiaries and related companies (collectively, the "Websites"), (b) on various third party websites, and (c) to Adonis Golden Ratio's other information collection, including the purchase of customer lists from third parties. Adonis Golden Ratio is not responsible for the information collection or privacy practices of third web sites or applications.

## 1\. Collection of Information.

### 1.1 Survey Information.

Adonis Golden Ratio collects information from individuals by various methods, including, but not limited to, when an individual voluntarily completes a Adonis Golden Ratio survey, order form, or a registration pages either online or offline, or by means of online or offline surveys, order forms, or registration pages operated by third parties (collectively, a "Survey"). (As used herein, "online" means using the Internet, including the Websites, and related technologies, and "offline" means by methods other than online, including in person, in the postal mail, using telephones and cell phones, and other similar means.) In the Surveys, Adonis Golden Ratio or a third party (a "Third Party") may ask an individual to provide various information to Adonis Golden Ratio , which may include his or her name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, social security number, employment information, personal and online interests, and such other information as may be requested from time to time (together, "Survey Information"). Adonis Golden Ratio may also collect information concerning an individual from another source and uses that information in combination with information provided from this web site. Completing the Surveys is completely voluntary, and individuals are under no obligation to provide Survey Information to Adonis Golden Ratio or Third Party, but an individual may receive incentives from Adonis Golden Ratio or a Third Party in exchange for providing Survey Information to Adonis Golden Ratio.

### 1.2 Other Information.

Other occasions when Adonis Golden Ratio obtains information from individuals include (1) when an individual is making a claim for a prize or seeking to redeem an incentive offered by Adonis Golden Ratio or by a third party, (2) when an individual requests assistance through Adonis Golden Ratio's customer service department, and (3) when an individual voluntarily subscribes to a Adonis Golden Ratio service or newsletter (together, "Other Information").

### 1.3 Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Info Collected Using Technology.

Adonis Golden Ratio currently uses cookie and web beacon technology to associate certain Internet-related information about an individual with information about the individual in our database. Additionally, Adonis Golden Ratio may use other new and evolving sources of information in the future (together, "Technology Information").

### (a) Cookies.

A cookie is a small amount of data stored on the hard drive of the individual's computer that allows Adonis Golden Ratio to identify the individual with his or her corresponding data that resides in Adonis Golden Ratio's database. You may read more about cookies at http://cookiecentral.com. Individuals who use the Websites need to accept cookies in order to use all of the features and functionality of the Websites.

### (b) Web Beacons.

A web beacon is programming code that can be used to display an image on a web page (by using an programming function -- see http://truste.org for more information), but can also be used to transfer an individual's unique user identification (often in the form of a cookie) to a database and associate the individual with previously acquired information about an individual in a database. This allows Adonis Golden Ratio to track certain web sites an individual visits online. Web beacons are used to determine products or services an individual may be interested in, and to track online behavioral habits for marketing purposes. For example, Adonis Golden Ratio might place, with the consent of a third party website, a web beacon on the third party's website where fishing products are sold. When Bill, an individual listed in Adonis Golden Ratio's database, visits the fishing website, Adonis Golden Ratio receives notice by means of the web beacon that Bill visited the fishing site, and Adonis Golden Ratio would then update Bill's profile with the information that Bill is interested in fishing. Adonis Golden Ratio may thereafter present offers of fishing related products and services to Bill. In addition to using web beacons on web pages, Adonis Golden Ratio also uses web beacons in email messages sent to individuals listed in Adonis Golden Ratio's database.

### (c) New Technology.

The use of technology on the Internet, including cookies and web beacons, is rapidly evolving, as is Adonis Golden Ratio's use of new and evolving technology. As a result, Adonis Golden Ratio strongly encourages individuals to revisit this policy for any updates regarding its use of technology.

Because it does not collect such information, Adonis Golden Ratio has no such information to use or to disclose to third parties. Adonis Golden Ratio has designed this policy in order to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA").
