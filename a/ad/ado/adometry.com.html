<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<h2>Adometry Products and Services Privacy Statement</h2>
Adometry is the leading provider of ad analytics, delivering actionable insight to improve the performance of online advertising. Adometry provides scoring, auditing, verification, and attribution metrics to optimize results and improve return. Formerly known as Click Forensics, Inc., Adometry has been improving online traffic quality for over half a decade. We have created this privacy statement (the "Product Privacy Statement") to demonstrate our commitment to our customers, the privacy of their website visitors, and the right of privacy throughout the Internet. Privacy is of great importance to us. Because we gather important information on behalf of our customers on portions of their websites and/or advertising campaigns, we have established this Product Privacy Statement as a means to communicate our information gathering and dissemination practices.<br>
<h2><br>Customer Data</h2>
We act as a limited agent (and data processor in the EU context) to each of our customers only for the purpose of providing Internet data hosting and optimization products and services, for which summaries and additional details are described within the "Products" portion of this site. Our corporate customers may use information that has been gathered by us on their website(s) and/or ad servers and other information provided to us (by the customer or their trusted partners or agencies) to optimize results of online advertising campaigns. This information may include (but is not limited to) general website traffic patterns, pages visited, referring domains, referring search engines, campaign success rates, visitor attrition rates, and types of product(s) purchased.<br><br>All such information is and will remain customer property, and will be treated by Adometry as proprietary and confidential information of each customer, respectively. As such, and subject to the remainder of this paragraph, Adometry will not disclose such information to any third party, unless specifically and rightfully instructed or directed to do so by the customer. Adometry will not review, share, disclose, distribute, print, or reference any such information except as requested or directed by the customer or as may be required by law. Individual customer records may at times be viewed or accessed only for the purpose of resolving a problem, addressing a support issue, fulfilling a billing requirement, or as may be required by law. Our corporate customers are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of their usernames and passwords to log into their accounts. We may store and process personal information in the United States or any other country in which we maintain facilities.<br>
<h2><br>Cookies</h2>
Cookies are files that Web servers place on an Internet user's computer that are designed to store basic information (such as visitor preferences). Most of our customers use cookies on their websites in connection with their own products and services. This helps our customers to better estimate the number of individual anonymous visitors to their website(s). There are two types of cookies that may be used: session and persistent. Session cookies exist only during a website visitor's online session. They disappear from the visitor's computer when he/she closes the browser software. Persistent cookies remain on the visitor's computer after the browser has been closed.
<h2><br>Controlling Our Use of Cookies</h2>
<h3>Opting Out</h3>
Adometry provides a mechanism to opt out of Adometry services cookie tracking.
<p><iframe src="http://js.dmtry.com/optout/status.html" width="350" height="90" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies set by our customers if you prefer. If you are using a public computer or do not otherwise want this information to be stored, you can select the appropriate radio button on the sign-in page, and this cookie will not be used. For further information about disabling cookies you can visit <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/">www.allaboutcookies.org</a>. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to sign in or use other interactive features of certain web sites and services that depend on cookies.<br><br><em>Enforcement</em>: Adometry uses a self-assessment approach to assure compliance with this privacy policy and periodically verifies that the policy is accurate, comprehensive for the information intended to be covered, prominently displayed, completely implemented and accessible and in conformity with the Safe Harbor Principles. We encourage interested persons to raise any concerns using the contact information provided and we will investigate and attempt to resolve any complaints and disputes regarding use and disclosure of Personal Information in accordance with the Safe Harbor Principles. If a complaint or dispute cannot be resolved through our internal process, we agree to dispute resolution using TRUSTe (<a href="http://www.truste.com">www.truste.com</a>) as a third party resolution provider.<br><br>You may raise your complaint with TRUSTe by <a href="https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request">clicking here</a>, fax to 415-520-3420, or mail to TRUSTe Safe Harbor Compliance Dept., <a href="http://www.truste.com/about-TRUSTe/contact_us">click for mailing address</a>. If you are faxing or mailing TRUSTe to lodge a complaint, you must include the following information: the name of company, the alleged privacy violation, your contact information, and whether you would like the particulars of your complaint shared with the company. For information about TRUSTe or the operation of TRUSTe's dispute resolution process, <a href="https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request">click here</a> or request this information from TRUSTe at any of the addresses listed above. The TRUSTe dispute resolution process shall be conducted in English. For human resources data we have agreed to cooperate with Data Protection Authorities. <br><br>Adometry complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries. Adometry has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement.</p>
<h3>Clear Gifs</h3>
<p>Clear gifs (also known as web beacons) are used in combination with cookies to help our customers understand how visitors interact with their websites. A clear gif is typically a transparent graphic image (usually 1 pixel x 1 pixel) that is placed on a site. The use of a clear gif allows the website owner to measure the actions of the visitor opening the page that contains the clear gif. Most of our customers use clear gifs on their websites in connection with our products and services, for which summaries and additional details are described within the "Products" portions of this site.<br><br>Because clear gifs are included within the recipe for a web page (just the same as any other content request), you cannot opt out or refuse them. However, where they are used in conjunction with cookies they can be rendered ineffective by either opting out of cookies or by changing the cookie settings in your browser (see above Section titled "Controlling our use of Cookies"). In other instances, such as in the case of emails, clear gifs are not used in conjunction with cookies and if you are unhappy with the use of clear gifs in such manner, then you should not use the website in question.</p>
<h2>Customer Policies</h2>
<p>We strongly recommend that our customers, as data controllers (in the EU context), add statements or clauses to their privacy policies specifically describing their use of third party hosted optimization products and services (such as those provided by Adometry) and describing the details of such third party products and services (such as the use of cookies and clear gifs/web beacons). Further, we strongly recommend that each of our customers provide their visitors with information regarding the ability to opt-out of session data aggregation and analysis (see opt out section above).<br><br>It is very important that you review the respective privacy policy of each customer website that you visit, because such privacy policies govern the use of information on those websites.</p>
<h2>E-Mail Privacy Policy on This Site</h2>
<p>Adometry, Inc. will not sell or barter your email address to third parties. Additionally, we will not make your email address available to third parties unless they are serving as a contracted suppression or broadcast vendor on our behalf to send you the email you explicitly requested, and they have strict privacy and security precautions in place.<br><br>In addition, we will only send you Adometry emails related to the specific newsletters and/or topics you signed up for with us. Currently, our newsletter is quarterly. However, we may send you very occasional invitations to participate in research questionnaires, notices to review new whitepapers, or take advantage of special offers with Adometry. The following covers, in further detail, how safe your information is with us.</p>
<h2>Your email address</h2>
<p>We only collect and hold your email address in order to send you the information and services you have requested. You can unsubscribe at any time for any reason quickly and easily through the bottom of any emails you receive from us.<br><br>Adometry does not have "marketing partners" and therefore will not offer the opportunity to sign up for "marketing partner offers." Any and all emails you receive from Adometry will be from Adometry, about Adometry.</p>
<h2>CAN-SPAM Compliance</h2>
<p>To completely opt-out to any email communication at any time, you can send an email to info@adometry.com. This e-mail address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it with "Do Not Email" in the subject line.</p>
<h2>Special Reports and research invitations</h2>
In addition to our regular, Adometry quarterly newsletters, we may occasionally send you Special Reports and research-related invitations that you may find valuable. These are *always* editorial in nature – they are not advertisements or purely commercial. They are also not third-party white papers or other third party content.<br><br>
<h2>Special Offer Blasts</h2>
We will never send you an email blast on behalf of a third party. Occasionally, we'll email you information about Adometry-related services, products and/or material. For example:
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">• You specifically and pro-actively signed up for our Adometry Quarterly Newsletter.</div>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">• You purchased a specific product and we need to communicate to you about that product, your account, opportunities to upgrade, or new features.</div>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">• Or, you specifically signed up on one of our sites or survey forms to be notified via email when a new particular product or product type comes out.</div>
<h2><br>Unsubscribing</h2>
Every email you receive from us will have instructions on how to unsubscribe, usually located at the bottom of the message.
<h2><br>Updates</h2>
In the event that Adometry ever updates its privacy policy, the new information will be posted here.<br>Questions? Concerns? Feel free to contact us at <a href="mailto:info@adometry.com">info@adometry.com</a>This e-mail address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it.
