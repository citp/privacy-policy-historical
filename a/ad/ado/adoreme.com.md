Each time that you use the Services, you signify that you agree to be bound by the Terms and Conditions and this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy you must discontinue using the Website and the Services.

This Privacy Policy addresses the following topics:

  1. Information/Data We Collect and How We Use It
  2. Disclosure of Passive or User-Submitted Data
  3. Communication from Us or from the Website
  4. Choice/Opt-Out/Unsubscribe

We collect two types of data about individuals: (1) technical data which is automatically collected from all visitors to the Website and from all individuals that use the Services (“Passive Data Collection”) and (2) information that you or others voluntarily submit to us (“User-Submitted Information”). 

“Personal Information,” as that term is used in this Privacy Policy, is information that allows the direct identification of an individual, such as a name or email address, and information that is directly combined with such identifying information. Our primary purpose in collecting Personal Information is to provide you with a safe, smooth, efficient, and customized experience. We only collect Personal Information about you that we consider necessary for achieving this purpose.

**Passive Data Collection**

We automatically track certain information based upon your behavior on and use of the Website. We use this information to do internal research on our users’ demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand, protect and serve you and our community.  This information allows us to, among other things, help make Services easier for you to use, help you quickly find information, products, and services, help us create content on this Services that is most relevant to you, and alert you to new information, products, and services that we offer.

_**Mobile Device Information**_

 When you download or use our Adore Me mobile application (“App”), we receive information about your mobile device (but not the native manufacturer unique identifier for your device) for purpose of tracking unique downloads. We register your device, and may use the identifier to send you push notifications about your transactions with our service.

_**Log Files**_

 Like most websites, we automatically receive and record certain information about our users’ behavior on our Website and when using our Services. Our servers automatically gather technical information about our Website traffic and store it in log files. This information includes Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We aggregate this information with other pieces of information to analyze trends, to administer and improve the Services, to track users’ movements around the Website and to make inventory purchasing decisions that will best serve our customer base. Pages of the Website may also use devices that permit us to count users who have visited those pages and for other related website statistics (for example, recording the popularity of certain website content and verifying system and server integrity).

If we directly combine any information gathered through passive means with Personal Information, we treat the combined information as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy. Otherwise, we use information collected by passive means in aggregated forms.

_**Cookies and Clear GIFs**_

 A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping or tracking purposes. A cookie (sometimes referred to as local storage object or LSO) is a data file placed on a device.  Cookies can be created through a variety of web-related protocols and technologies, such as HTTP (sometimes referred to as “browser cookies”), and HTML5. We use cookies and other tracking technologies on the Website and Services. Cookies help us enhance your experience by speeding your navigation through the Services, recognizing you, and tracking your usage of the Website and the Services. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Adore Me only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers or other third-parties.

Cookies are necessary to use certain portions of our Services.  You can remove certain cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" menu. You may also configure your browser to prevent cookies from being set on your computer; however, if you reject cookies your ability to use the Website and Services may be limited and you may not be able to use certain features of the Website.  In particular, cookies are necessary to select and purchase products.

We also employ a software technology called clear gifs, also referred to as action tags, that help manage content on the Website by tracking what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of users.

We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails recipients have opened. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.  If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see “Choice / Opt-out” section of this Privacy Policy.

**Third Party Advertisers**

 We may from time to time use third party advertising companies to help us further enhance our users’ experience and to better tailor our content to our individual customers.  Third party advertising companies may use non-personally identifiable information during your visits to this Website and other web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you.

Adore Me also partners with advertising companies to place our advertising on publisher websites on the Internet. These advertising companies collect anonymous information about your visits to our Website by placing and reading cookies on the device you use to access our web site. The cookies do not collect or use Personal Information. Like the cookies we place and read directly, these tracking technologies are used to analyze user behaviors in the aggregate. They are used to analyze and optimize our App or Website, measure conversion, and tailor content to interests.

 California Business & Professions Code Section 22575(b) (as amended effective January 1, 2014) provides that California residents are entitled to know how we respond to “Do Not Track” browser settings. Our Website is not at this time configured to read or respond to “do not track” settings or signals in your browser headings, which vary by browser provider, because a uniform technological standard has not yet been developed.  We continue to review new technologies and may adopt a standard once one is created. In lieu of a browser-based opt-out solution, you can utilize the Network Advertising Initiative approved methods for placement of “opt-out” cookies described [here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/). Our Website and those of our third party advertisers or other vendors are configured to read and honor these opt-out cookies, so long as they are present on your computer.

Further, while we work hard to ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent “hackers” or other unauthorized persons from illegally accessing or obtaining this information. To minimize the risk to you, we keep Personal Information no longer than necessary for legitimate business purpose or as required by law.

As part of securing personal data stored on our servers, we restrict access to Personal Information to Adore Me employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve the Services. These individuals are bound by strict confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.

If we learn of a security breach, we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. By using the Services or the Website or by providing Personal Information to us, you agree that we can communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues relating to your use of the Services.
