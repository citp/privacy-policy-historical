# Privacy Policy

ADESA is committed to providing you the opportunity for a positive experience during your visit to our website, while respecting and striving to protect your on-line privacy. And because protecting your privacy is very important, we have adopted this policy to safeguard your personal information and protect its confidentiality. We will limit the collection and use of personal information to what is necessary to administer our business, provide you with the highest quality visit, and offer you information we think will be of interest. We will not disclose any individual information to other organizations. 

To facilitate navigation, this site may contain links to other sites. We will make every effort to link only to sites that share our high standards and respect for privacy. However, we are not responsible for the content or the privacy practices employed by organizations sponsoring these other sites. 

**A. Basic Statement:**  
ADESA collects personal information from our visitors on a voluntary basis only. Personal information may include name, title, company, address, phone number, e-mail address, etc. The individual information we collect is used only to facilitate the on-line experience through enhanced navigation or to suggest areas in which we may improve the structure and content of the site. We do not sell, rent or transmit personal information to other organizations.   
**B. Cookie Technology:**  
ADESA employs "cookie" technology to help visitors move faster through the site. When you sign on to our site, we pass a cookie to your computer. A cookie is a string of information that's sent by a Website and stored on the hard drive or temporarily in your computer's memory. This leads to quicker navigation and a generally more positive experience searching for the information you desire.   
**C. Collection and Use:**  
Our web server tracks and collects general information about your visit to our website. We collect these statistics to determine the number of daily visitors to our site, the daily requests for particular files, the types of browsers our visitors use, the visitors' domain names, and countries of origin. This data helps us to customize our website to better meet your on-line needs, so we may request and store the following types of specific information: your name, company name, street address, city, county, state, country, province, telephone numbers and e-mail addresses. This personally identifiable information is only collected when voluntarily submitted by a visitor in one of our on-line information or e-mail correspondence forms.   
**D. Storage and Access:**  
All personal information you provide to ADESA is secured on our server with restricted access. We reserve the right to use agents, who are bound by strict confidentiality guidelines, to perform storage and processing functions. Only designated employees or agents who need to carry out legitimate business functions are permitted to view your personal data. Employees or agents who violate this privacy policy are subject to disciplinary actions, up to and including termination.   
**E. Disclosure:**  
Because ADESA considers the individual information we maintain to be confidential, our policy is to disclose no personal information to third parties unless release is required by law or is pertinent to judicial or government investigations or proceedings. 

We reserve the right to change this policy at any time by notifying visitors of the existence of the new privacy policy.
