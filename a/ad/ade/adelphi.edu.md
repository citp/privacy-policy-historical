# GDPR Privacy Notice | Adelphi University

Adelphi University respects your privacy, but we occasionally will ask you to provide us with some information about you. For example, if you want to come to one of our events, we might ask for your name and your email address. We also record basic information about the use of our networks so that we are better equipped to fix problems.

If we have information about you, we will strive to protect it. Any information you give us will only be used for its intended purpose, and we won’t sell it to others. If we need it for something else, we’ll ask for your consent. 

If you suspect that we have made a mistake, please tell us and we’ll address your concerns. If you believe that we have information that we shouldn’t have, please tell us, and we’ll delete it. We cannot always do that because of other rules and regulations, but if that’s the case, we’ll tell you.

Adelphi University complies with the European General Data Privacy Regulation (GDPR). We are serious about your privacy and cybersecurity. If you have questions, please contact us at [privacy@adelphi.edu](mailto:privacy@adelphi.edu).
