### Privacy and metrocard

Registration of your metrocard requires that some personal information is held by us (The Department for Planning, Transport and Infrastructure).   
If you register a metrocard, the Adelaide Fare Collection System securely stores your personal information. 

This personal information is necessary for the purpose of verifying your identity. This enables us to communicate with you and provide you with access to the full range of metrocard services. 

#### When you validate a registered metrocard

When you validate your metrocard we record the stop, vehicle number, date and time, the service number and fare deducted for the trip. 

We update our relevant databases and store the validation activity for auditing purposes. This information is associated with your customer record, so we can provide you with a record of your travel history.
