# ADEA Privacy Policy

##  ADEA Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** June 2018

The American Dental Education Association (ADEA) respects your privacy and we have developed the following policy to demonstrate our commitment to you. This privacy policy applies to all personal information we collect, including personal information collected via the ADEA website located at www.adea.org (the Site), ADEA programs and services, other websites that link to this policy (also referred to as the Site), web-based applications and surveys. Please note that some other ADEA websites may have unique privacy policies in which case they will link to a different ADEA privacy policy. The purpose of the privacy policy is to describe 1) the types of information collected, 2) how that information is used, and 3) the choices users have about the collection and use of this information.

If you have any questions or concerns about our privacy policy, please send us an email at [privacy@adea.org](mailto:privacy@adea.org) or write us at ADEA, Attn: Web Services, 655 K Street, NW, Suite 800, Washington, DC 20001.

We may make personal information available to them to the extent necessary for them to provide services (e.g., to process a credit card payment, ship you a product). These third-party service providers include website hosting partners and other parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or serving our users. We contractually require these third parties to keep this information confidential.

In addition, we may use and share with others statistics or other aggregated or de-identified (not personally identifiable) information derived from information about you. This type of information includes, but is not limited to, information that we have collected based on web usage data, surveys, or statistical information that we have compiled about our users. 

We may also disclose your personal information in connection with any merger or consolidation with, or sale of assets to a third party.

You may also change your preferences regarding the types of communications you receive from ADEA by emailing us at [membership@adea.org](mailto:membership@adea.org) or, for ADEA members, logging into the ADEA site and clicking on the MyADEA link at the top to update your communications preferences. 

### **_Security_**

Messages that you send to us by email may not be secure. We recommend that you do not send any confidential information to us by email. If you choose to send confidential information to us via email, you accept the risk that a third party may intercept this information.

Our websites may contain links to other sites. Links do not imply endorsement by ADEA. Please be aware that these other sites are not subject to the ADEA privacy policy and we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We recommend that you review the privacy policies of those sites when you visit them. Nonetheless, we seek to provide helpful links and welcome any feedback about these sites.

### **_International Data Transfer_**

We are based in the United States and have members in the United States and Canada. Your personal information will be received and may otherwise be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States or another country that may not provide the same level of protection for personal information as the laws of your home country, and may be available to the government of the United States or such other country under a lawful request or order made in those countries.
