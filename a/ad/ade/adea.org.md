# Privacy Policy

**American Dental Education Association Privacy Policy**

Last Updated July 13, 2006 

The American Dental Education Association ("ADEA") respects your privacy and we have developed the following policy to demonstrate our commitment to you. This privacy policy applies to personally identifiable information we collect on the ADEA website located at www.adea.org (the "Site") and describes the types of information collected, how that information is used, and the choices users have about collection and use of this information. 

If you have any questions or concerns about our privacy policy, please send us an email at membership@adea.org or write us at 1400 K Street, NW, Suite 1100, Washington, DC 20005. 

Information we collect 

Although portions of the Site are available without registration, in order to take advantage of many of our Site’s features, you will be asked to provide personal information. This personal information is provided voluntarily by the user in order to participate or register for a particular product or service available through ADEA, or when you otherwise communicate with us or the Site. We clearly identify data you must provide so we can deliver the services you request. This information may include, but is not limited to the following: 

  * contact information, such as name, postal address, phone number, and email address 
  * background information, such as demographics, employment, memberships, affiliations, special interests, and education 
  * purchase data, including payment information required for purchases 
  * application data required to complete an online dental education application 
  * political advocacy data and interests, such as your congressional district and advocacy expertise 
  * postings to online bulletin boards 
  * survey data collected through voluntary survey responses by users 



In addition, our web servers automatically collect and log web usage data from you when you visit the Site. This information, including your IP address, referring sites, pages viewed, and length of visit, informs us about how visitors use and navigate the Site. 

How we use and share the information collected 

We may combine the personally identifiable information you provide ADEA with other information that is available to us, including information submitted by users to ADEA offline and information collected from other third parties. Subject to the terms below, ADEA does not rent or sell your personally identifiable information to unaffiliated third parties without your consent, but may use and share your information to, among other things: 

  * provide the product, information, or service requested   
carry out an objective authorized by the user or otherwise disclosed to the user at the time the data is collected (e.g., We share applicant data with the dental school programs designated by an applicant)
  * improve the content, navigation, and efficiency of the Site 
  * target, personalize, and develop our products and services to meet your individual interests and needs   
communicate with you (1) through legislative alerts and newsletters, (2) to respond to your inquiries, (3) to disseminate surveys and survey results, and (4) to market ADEA’s products and services and make you aware of other ADEA benefits 
  * create email, listserv, and other member lists to facilitate communication with and between our users 
  * inform representatives of ADEA Institutional Members of members from their school or program 
  * comply with valid legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena, or court order, if we find that a user’s actions violate our policies, or to protect our rights and property 



We may also use third party suppliers and service providers to provide services on behalf of ADEA and to fulfill the products and services offered through our Site. We may make personal information available to them to the extent necessary for them to provide services (e.g., to process a credit card payment or ship you a product). 

In addition, we may use and share with others aggregated or anonymous (not personally identifiable) information that we have collected based on web usage data, surveys, or statistical information that we have compiled about our users. We may disclose your information in connection with any merger or consolidation with, or sale of assets to a third party, provided that the third party agrees to comply with our privacy policy. 

Cookies 

Like most websites, we employ cookies to help users more efficiently use the Site. A cookie is a string of information that is sent by a website and stored on a user’s hard drive. We use cookies to continually enhance your experience, and may use them to store your preferences and to customize content specific to your needs. If you do not want your browser to accept cookies, you can modify the cookie option in your browser’s settings. However, some Site features or services may not function properly or be accessible without cookies. 

Choice 

If you would prefer not to receive marketing or other promotional communications from ADEA, please notify us of your preferences. A number of our products and services allow you make these choices at the time you submit information and allow you to access your profile and change your preferences online. You may also change your preferences regarding the types of communications you receive from ADEA by emailing us at [membership@adea.org. ](mailto:membership@adea.org.)

Security 

ADEA has implemented commercially reasonable technical, administrative, and physical security measures to protect your personally identifiable information from unauthorized access, modification, or use. We periodically review and update security measures in light of current technologies. Please note, that despite our efforts, no security measures are completely secure. 

Children 

The Site is not directed towards children under 13 years of age, nor do we knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13. If you are under 13, please do not submit personally identifiable information to us. 

Links 

Our Site may contain links to other sites. Links do not imply endorsement by ADEA. Please be aware that these other sites are not subject to the ADEA privacy policy and we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We recommend that you review the privacy policies of those sites when you visit them. 

Reviewing and correcting your information 

For a number of our products and services (including online applications and Communities of Interest), you can access and update your personal information directly through your online account. We try to keep information about you accurate and current, but if you find errors or inaccuracies in your information, please let us know. To protect your privacy and security, we may take reasonable steps to verify your identity before we disclose or make any corrections to this information. 

Changes to this privacy policy 

We will occasionally update this privacy policy. When we do, we will also revise the "last updated" date at the top of the privacy policy. For material changes, we will notify you either by email or by placing a prominent notice on our Site. Please check the Site from time to time for the most current version of our privacy policy. Your continued use of the Site after we have notified you of changes as described above constitutes your acceptance of the changes.
