# The University of Adelaide Privacy Regulations

  
The following provides an overview of how your privacy is protected during your visit.

###### Collection of information

Information on this website is gathered in two ways:

  * indirectly through our site's technology; and
  * directly when you provide information to us.



One example of information we collect indirectly from you is through our Internet access logs. When you access this site your Internet address is automatically collected and is placed in our Internet access logs.

One example of information we collect directly from you is through the use of cookies. Cookies are small files of information, which save and retrieve information about your visit to the site. For example, how you entered the site, how you navigated through the site and what information was accessed by you. The cookies we use only identify you as a number. If you do not want information to be gathered on a cookie you may obtain advice from your Internet Service Provider who will tell you how to disable a cookie through the appropriate menu in your browser.

###### Use of information

We analyse information obtained on this website to determine the effectiveness of our site and modify it to improve the service for users. If information we collect from you is used for any other purpose, you will be advised of our intent when we request information from you. You can then abort your request and therefore no information will be collected from you.

###### Protection of information

The University of Adelaide does not sell your information to any third party. The University may share information with a third party, but only if that information is provided directly by you and you have been informed in advance of the information's release.
