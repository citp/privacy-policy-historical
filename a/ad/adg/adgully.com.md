Moreover, the information supplied by you is subject to verification as in many cases where the subscriber has enlisted as a Freelancer, the content delivered by him to the client has to be within the legal framework of the internet subject to the Indian Laws. In some instances, which involve, for example, subscriptions, you may need to provide all the information before the subscription can reach you if we don't know how to contact you.

If you do not want the benefit of cookies, there is a simple process to manually delete your cookies. Please consult your web browser's Help documentation for more information on this process.
