#### Cookies

A cookie is used to store data on a computer's hard drive. Almost all websites utilize cookies to one extent or another. Adgorithms uses it's cookies to provide a service known as Re-targeting. Adgorithms has no access to or control over our partners cookies but requires that each partner only collect non-personal information for the use of serving retargeted ads.

#### Adgorithms use of cookie and non-personal information

Adgorithms technology utilizes cookies in the delivery of advertisements on our network. This form of advertising is called Re-targeting, and it enhances the web surfing experience by showing the users advertisements that are of interest to them. When a user visits one of our advertiser's websites, an Adgorithms pixel on that site sets an Adgorithms cookie on the hard drive of the user. When that user visits one of our partner’s websites, they will identify the cookie on the hard drive of the user and recognize that they previously visited our advertiser's website. The user will then be shown an advertisement from that advertiser. In this instance, Adgorithms will know the user first visited our advertiser's website, and then our partner's website. We will know the user viewed the ad on our partner's website, and whether or not the user clicked on that ad. This type information is what we use in reporting, and in no way can be used to identify who that user is, or any other online activities of the user outside of Adgorithms network. This information is used strictly for reporting purposes and is not tied to any personal information. You are able to Opt-Out of Adgorithms’s services if you do not want to be a part of future reporting or take part in Re-targeting services from Adgorithms - please see below for instructions on how to Opt-Out.
