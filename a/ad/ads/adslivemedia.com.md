# Privacy Policy | AdsLiveMedia

January 2013

ADS Live Media provides an online advertising sale and display service (the “Service”) for Internet website owners (“Publishers”). We enable advertisers to place advertisements via the Service on one or more sites belonging to Publishers. We enable our corporate customers (“Network Operators”) to create and manage networks of Publishers and Advertisers using tools we provide. The Service runs on software developed and hosted by ADS Live Media, its subsidiaries, and third-party contractors.

ADS Live Media recognizes the importance of information privacy. This Privacy Policy describes ADS Live Media’s practices for gathering, storing, using and disseminating information, as well as some of the steps we take to safeguard that information. We may change this policy from time to time. All changes will be posted to this site, and you are encouraged to periodically check back to this site for any changes to the privacy policy.

A. INFORMATION COLLECTION

If you are a Publisher, Advertiser, or Network Operator, you can browse certain areas of the Service without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. Once you give us your personal information, you are not anonymous to us. For example, your user ID is displayed throughout the Service and is therefore available to our employees and contractors. If you choose to provide us with personal information, you consent to the transfer to and storage of that information on servers located in the United States.

If you are a Publisher, Advertiser, or Network Operator, ADS Live Media requires certain information related to your business, your website, and your use of the Service. ADS Live Media will collect and store this information.

To improve and personalize the Service, ADS Live Media may collect information about your business from third parties and provide this information on your behalf. This information may include, but is not limited to the following: third-party counts of monthly page views, visitor composition, and rankings in various indices. ADS Live Media may not provide you the option to turn off the presentation of this information.

ADS Live Media may collect tax information, including Value Added Tax (VAT) or federal tax ID numbers. ADS Live Media will collect information regarding your activities with respect to the Service.
