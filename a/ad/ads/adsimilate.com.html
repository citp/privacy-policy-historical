                        This Privacy Policy applies only to websites that are owned and/or operated by or on behalf of Adsimilate Marketing, Inc., Inc.<br><br>

                        This Privacy Policy explains how we collect and use information about you as you utilize any Adsimilate Marketing, Inc., Inc. services, including the adverting services we provide to businesses that have their own web sites (our "Advertising Network"). Please be advised that our Privacy Policy is subject to change at any time. By using services provided by Adsimilate Marketing, Inc., Inc. you indicate that you agree to the collection and use of your information by Adsimilate Marketing, Inc., Inc. as outlined in this Privacy Policy.<br><br>

                        <b class="subhead">Why Information is collected</b><br>
                        Adsimilate Marketing, Inc., Inc. collects information to improve the services we provide and to present you with information and features that will interest you. We also use your information to measure our success and performance. For example, aggregate information gives us an idea of the number of visitors we attract and how they navigate our site.
                        Personal Information We Collect:
                        
                        Any personal information that is collected by us is provided by you strictly on a voluntary basis. We may receive personal information from you in a number of ways, depending on the Adsimilate Marketing, Inc., Inc. service you are using and your choices while using our services. Depending upon the nature of the service being provided, we may ask you for, and you may choose to send to us, your name, e-mail address, physical address or other personal information necessary to complete a transaction or provide services to you. For example, if you choose to run an advertising or publisher program through Adsimilate Marketing, Inc., Inc., we will need to collect certain personal information about you in connection with administering the program; however, we do not collect any personal information from site users in connection with our activities on sites in our Advertising Network. Wherever we ask you for personal information, we try to include a link to this Privacy Policy for your review.<br><br>

                       <b class="subhead">Use of Personal Information</b><br>
                        As noted above, unless you voluntarily provide personal information for a specific purpose, we do not collect personal information from you. We will never combine any personal information about a user of our site with any aggregate information we collect about that user, whether collected on our site or our Advertising Network. If you choose to provide personal information, we use your personal information to provide you with particular services that you request. For instance, we may use your personal information to contact you about advertising services that you have requested and to provide you with data about your advertising campaign. We may also share your personal information with business partners who provide services you have requested. In these cases, we will provide only the information that is needed to perform the service. If you do not want Adsimilate Marketing, Inc., Inc. to share your information in this way, you can simply choose not to sign up for the service in question. By providing your email address to Adsimilate Marketing, Inc., Inc., you expressly consent to receive emails from us.<br><br>
                        
                        Adsimilate Marketing, Inc. does not sell, trade or rent personal information to other companies. However, we will transfer personal information in connection with a sale or merger of Adsimilate Marketing, Inc., Inc. or the division responsible for the services provided to you.
