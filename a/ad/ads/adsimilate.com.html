              <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
              <p> This Privacy Policy applies only to websites that are owned 
                and/or operated by or on behalf of Adsimilate Marketing, Inc..com, Inc. </p>
              <p> This Privacy Policy explains how we collect and use information 
                about you as you utilize any Adsimilate Marketing, Inc..com, Inc. services, 
                including the adverting services we provide to businesses that 
                have their own web sites (our "Advertising Network"). Please be 
                advised that our Privacy Policy is subject to change at any time. 
                By using services provided by Adsimilate Marketing, Inc..com, Inc. you indicate 
                that you agree to the collection and use of your information by 
                Adsimilate Marketing, Inc..com, Inc. as outlined in this Privacy Policy. </p>
              <h2>Why Information is collected:</h2>
              <p> Adsimilate Marketing, Inc..com, Inc. collects information to improve the 
                services we provide and to present you with information and features 
                that will interest you. We also use your information to measure 
                our success and performance. For example, aggregate information 
                gives us an idea of the number of visitors we attract and how 
                they navigate our site. </p>
              <h2>Personal Information We Collect:</h2>
              <p> Any personal information that is collected by us is provided 
                by you strictly on a voluntary basis. We may receive personal 
                information from you in a number of ways, depending on the Adsimilate Marketing, Inc..com, 
                Inc. service you are using and your choices while using our services. 
                Depending upon the nature of the service being provided, we may 
                ask you for, and you may choose to send to us, your name, e-mail 
                address, physical address or other personal information necessary 
                to complete a transaction or provide services to you. For example, 
                if you choose to run an advertising or publisher program through 
                Adsimilate Marketing, Inc..com, Inc., we will need to collect certain personal 
                information about you in connection with administering the program; 
                however, we do not collect any personal information from site 
                users in connection with our activities on sites in our Advertising 
                Network. Wherever we ask you for personal information, we try 
                to include a link to this Privacy Policy for your review. </p>
              <h2>Use of Personal Information</h2>
              <p> As noted above, unless you voluntarily provide personal information 
                for a specific purpose, we do not collect personal information 
                from you. We will never combine any personal information about 
                a user of our site with any aggregate information we collect about 
                that user, whether collected on our site or our Advertising Network. 
                If you choose to provide personal information, we use your personal 
                information to provide you with particular services that you request. 
                For instance, we may use your personal information to contact 
                you about advertising services that you have requested and to 
                provide you with data about your advertising campaign. We may 
                also share your personal information with business partners who 
                provide services you have requested. In these cases, we will provide 
                only the information that is needed to perform the service. If 
                you do not want Adsimilate Marketing, Inc..com, Inc. to share your information 
                in this way, you can simply choose not to sign up for the service 
                in question. By providing your email address to Adsimilate Marketing, Inc..com, 
                Inc., you expressly consent to receive emails from us. </p>
              <p> Adsimilate Marketing, Inc..com, Inc. does not sell, trade or rent personal 
                information to other companies. However, we will transfer personal 
                information in connection with a sale or merger of Adsimilate Marketing, Inc..com, 
                Inc. or the division responsible for the services provided to 
                you. We may also share your personal information with our technical 
                consultants, third party auditors and other third parties who 
                make our site available, enhance its functionality or provide 
                associated services and/or who deal with you in processing your 
                orders and/or delivering content, samples, products, services 
                and gifts and prizes. These third parties are not allowed to use 
                personal information except for the purposes of providing the 
                applicable services. In addition, we may provide information to 
                law enforcement authorities or pursuant to a court order or to 
                investigate suspected fraud. Our site and services are maintained 
                in the United States of America. By using the site and/or services, 
                you authorize the export of personal information to the USA and 
                its storage and use as specified in this policy. </p>
              <h2>Aggregate Information We Collect and Use</h2>
              <p> In addition to personal information, we may also collect non-personally 
                identifiable information, such as site pages viewed, browser type, 
                computer information, cookies, clickstream data and other information. 
                This aggregate information is analyzed and combined with similar 
                aggregate information of other users and may be collected both 
                on our site and on other sites in our Advertising Network. Such 
                aggregate information is anonymous and does not identify any individual 
                user. We may share aggregate information with our business partners 
                and other third parties. </p>
              <p> "Cookies" are small data files that are sent to your browser 
                and are stored on your hard drive, keeping track of your general 
                activity on a site. When you make subsequent visits to our site 
                or another site on our Advertising Network, your cookie gives 
                us a summary of your preferences and past experiences on the site. 
                This allows us to tailor Adsimilate Marketing, Inc..com, Inc. services to your 
                needs. Your cookie may be altered at different times throughout 
                your visits to a site, and it is updated frequently as you use 
                various Adsimilate Marketing, Inc..com, Inc. features and services. When you

                on the data stored in your cookie. You can and may opt-out and 
                set your browser to reject cookies; however, this may affect some 
                functions of this site and our other services. </p>
              <p> "Clickstream data" is a trail of electronic information that 
                is left at each web site you visit. This information can be collected 
                and stored by a site's server. Clickstream data is used to tell 
                us the type of computer and browsing software you use, the address 
                of the site from which you linked to our site, how much time you 
                spend on each page of our site, how you navigate throughout the 
                site. </p>

                practices that are different from ours. This type of collection 
                or use of information is beyond Adsimilate Marketing, Inc..com, Inc.'s control

                control these sites; we are not responsible or liable for the 
                privacy practices or content of such sites. </p>
