# Privacy Policy | AdsandDeals.com

This Privacy Statement sets out our privacy policies and practices with respect to the collection, use and disclosure of personal information in connection with [www.adsanddeals.com](http://www.adsanddeals.com/) (the "Site"). This Privacy Policy may be updated by us giving reasonable notice of the revised terms by posting on the Site, and this Privacy Policy may be supplemented or modified by agreements entered into between us and you from time to time. 

"personal information" means any information about an identifiable individual, as further defined under applicable laws.

**COLLECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION**

The Site's registration form requires users to give us contact information (such as name address and email address) and demographic information (such as postal code, age, or other information which we may request from time to time) and other information that is used by us to provide services. We use the customer contact information from the registration form to send the user information that he or she has requested regarding the Site or regarding services offered by us.

This Site uses an ad form for customers to place online and/or print ads. One of the express purposes of the Site is to gather contact information provided voluntarily by customers to be published either online or in print, as the case may be, and in connection with items that are for sale by customers. We have no control over who views online or print ads. Contact information provided may be used to contact customers when necessary. Please do not post any personal information on the Site that you expect to keep private. 

We do not store credit card information. Credit card transactions are transmitted to a financial gateway, and we endeavor to protect the security of your payment information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology.

Demographic and profile data is also collected at the Site. We use this data to tailor each visitor's experience at the Site, showing the user content that we think he or she might be interested in, and displaying the content according to the user's preferences.

We may use customer information for additional purposes that may be identified at or before the time that the information is collected. We also use information from customers for accounting and transaction completion purposes.
