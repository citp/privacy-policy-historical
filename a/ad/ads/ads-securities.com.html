                	<p>ADS Securities LLC (we, our or us) is committed to ensuring the privacy of personal data. This policy (Privacy Policy) sets out our information gathering and dissemination practices for the website accessible at&nbsp;<a href="/">www.ads-securities.com</a>&nbsp;(Website).</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to the personally identifiable information we collect from users of the Website (you or your) and contains important information explaining what information we collect, how we may use it and your rights in relation to it. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and made part of the Website’s terms of use at&nbsp;<a href="/">www.ads-securities.com</a>&nbsp;(Terms of Use) and we reserve the right to revise this Privacy Policy at any time by updating this webpage.</p>
<h3><strong>What information we collect about you</strong></h3>
<p>When you use the Website, we may collect, hold, use and disclose certain information about individuals which may constitute personal data, including sensitive data, under the EU Data Protection Directive and implementing laws and other similar laws of the Middle East, including</p>
<ol>
<li>information you enter and post through the Website, if applicable;</li>

<li>certain information about your usage of the Website, which is collected via cookies (see below), including your domain name, IP address, your browser version, your operating system, the URL you came from (including third party URLs), the pages you visit within the Website and the URL to which you go when you leave the Website (including third party URLs).</li>
</ol>
<p>If you use a service provided by a third party, such third party may provide information about you, and possibly the services used, to ADSS.</p>
<p>To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may record and monitor electronic communications to ensure compliance with our legal and regulatory obligations and internal policies and for the purposes outlined below.</p>
<h3><strong>Cookies</strong></h3>
<p>The Website may use cookies to deliver our services and to keep track of your account. A cookie is a small text file stored on your computer to collect and log standard internet data and visitor behaviour information. Cookies may be used to help the Website recognise you as repeat user, facilitate your ongoing access to and use of the Website and allow us to track usage behaviour and compile aggregate data. All of this allows us to make content improvements and provide a better service via the Website.</p>
<p>If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, most browsers contain a function that will allow you to disable the cookie feature. You can also delete cookie files from your computer at your discretion. Disabling the cookie feature on your browser or deleting cookie files from your computer may render you unable to access the Website and may impair your ability to utilise our services. Cookies may also be necessary to provide you with certain features such as customised delivery of information.</p>
<p>We may use cookies to provide our services via the Website, to deliver content specific to your interests, to track visitor use and to compile statistical reports on Website activity.</p>
<h3><strong>Using your information</strong></h3>
<p>We will process any personal data which we obtain from you fairly and lawfully for the following specified purposes only:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>evaluating and processing your application for any services, including conducting relevant background checks and/or other verification activities (which may include disclosure of your information to credit reference agencies and other fraud prevention agencies);</li>
<li>administering our relationship with you, processing your orders and managing your account;</li>
<li>marketing our products or services to you by way of mail, email or other&nbsp; means (whether electronic or otherwise), unless we receive an objection to receiving such information</li>
<li>disclosing, renting or selling aggregated information (on an anonymous basis) regarding customers and Website users to third party advertisers;</li>
<li>to statistically analyse Website usage and trends;</li>
<li>to improve our internal marketing and promotional efforts;</li>
<li>compliance with any legal or regulatory requirement or with any voluntary code of conduct that we elect to adopt; and</li>
<li>for the purpose of, or in connection with, the detection, investigation, and prevention of fraud, intellectual property infringement, breach of any law or regulation or other activity that is illegal or may expose us to legal liability, or in order to protect our rights and property;</li>
</ol>
<p>We may use information that we collect from the Website to personalise your repeat visits to the Website and/or to improve the content and offerings on the Website. We may also evaluate your account activity in order to ensure the integrity of the Website and any use of our services and to identify customers and Website users who may be in breach of the Terms of Use. In some cases, we may use such information to deliver information to you that is targeted to your interests.</p>
<p>Disclosure of Information: We may disclose your personal data to:</p>
<ol>
<li>any member of our group of companies, including our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries, their agents, auditors, service providers, law enforcement or other government or regulatory bodies and their officials or any other person we consider reasonably necessary for the processing purposes above;</li>
<li>to any actual or potential purchaser of our business and their advisers; and</li>
<li>to any third party to whom we have a legal or regulatory right or duty to disclose your personal data.</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>Storage and retention of data</strong></h3>
<p>Any personal data that we collect from you may be transferred to, stored or processed as described above at a destination anywhere in the world (including locations outside the United Arab Emirates). This may include some countries that do not provide the same statutory protection as the EU Data Protection Directive and implementing laws and other similar laws of the Middle East. &nbsp;By submitting any personal data to us, you agree to this transfer, storage or processing.</p>
<h3><strong>Your rights and how to contact us</strong></h3>
<p>Individuals about whom we process personal data may request a copy of the personal data we hold in relation to them.&nbsp; You have the right to ask us to update, amend, correct and/or delete information previously provided to us about you that is wrong.</p>
<p>You may terminate your account and request the removal of certain information about you from our database and we will use our commercially reasonable efforts to do so, subject to the following provisions:&nbsp; We may retain in our files certain information you have requested us to remove in some circumstances, for example, if and to the extent required by applicable law or regulation, in order to resolve future disputes, to troubleshoot problems or to enforce the Terms of Use. If you engage in a transaction on the Website, your transaction details will not be removed.&nbsp; Deleted information may not be completely removed from our databases due to technical constraints and our policy of backing up data. Therefore, you should not expect that all of your information will be completely removed from our databases in response to your requests.</p>
<p>You may contact us to request a change or modification to information previously provided, to request the removal of information from our database or to request not to receive certain communications from us or our Service Partners, or with questions about our Privacy Policy as follows:</p>
