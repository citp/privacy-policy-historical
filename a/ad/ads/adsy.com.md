We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption when collecting, transferring, and handling sensitive data such as credit card information or personal data.

6.4. Controlling Your Personal Information. Adsy.com may, from time to time, make available to users chat rooms, forums, message boards, and other interactive features. You should be aware that when you voluntarily disclose personally identifiable information (e.g. user name, e-mail address) via blog, forums, postings, profiles or other areas of the Website, that information, along with any substantive information disclosed in your communication, can be collected, correlated and used by third parties and may result in unsolicited messages from other posters or third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of Adsy.com. Please do not post any personal information on the Website or in other areas that you expect to keep private.

6.5. Links. For your convenience, we may provide links to certain third party websites or referrals to certain third parties’ products or services.

## 10\. TRANSFERS OUTSIDE EUROPE

Personal data in the European Union is protected by data protection laws but other countries do not necessarily protect your personal data in the same way. Our website and some of our products or services or parts of them may be hosted in the United States and this means that we may transfer any information which is submitted by you through the website, product or service outside the European Economic Area (which means all the EU countries plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein) (“EEA”) to the United States. When you send an email to us, this may also be stored on email servers which are hosted in the United States or outside the EU. We have taken steps to ensure that our hosting provider uses the necessary level of protection for your information but if you do not want your information to be transferred outside the EEA you should not use our website, product or service or contact us via email.

## 11\. NO ERROR-FREE PERFORMANCE

Adsy.com does not guarantee error-free performance under this Privacy Policy. We may not always catch an unintended privacy issue, despite our reasonable efforts to do so. Accordingly, we welcome your feedback regarding any privacy concerns that you may have, including how we can improve this Privacy Policy. We will use reasonable efforts to comply with this Privacy Policy and will take prompt corrective action when we learn of any failure to comply with it.

## 12\. DO NOT TRACK

Because there currently isn't an industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT (Do Not Track) signals, we don't respond to them at this time. We await the result of work by the privacy community and industry to determine when such a response is appropriate and what form it should take.

## 13\. LEGAL NOTICES

This Privacy Policy is subject to the Terms and Conditions, available for review at http://adsy.com/terms-and-conditions/. Our Terms and Conditions take precedence over any conflicting provision in this Privacy Policy.
