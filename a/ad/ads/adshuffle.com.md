Beacons 

AdShuffle uses beacons, which are also commonly referred to as "impression beacons" or "tracking pixels", in combination with cookies to measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. Advertisers may place beacons on their contact form and/or order form "thank you" pages to identify leads and sales as resulting from an advertising campaign. The beacon does NOT collect your name, address, phone number, email address, or any other information that may personally identify you.

Cookies 

AdShuffle uses cookies to measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. Cookies are small text files created and stored on your computer by your web browsing software (i.e. Internet Explorer or Firefox) on behalf of web sites that you visit. While cookies have many applications, we use them only to assign an anonymous and unique ID number to you when you view, click, or interact in some way with one of our client's advertisements. The cookie does NOT include your name, address, phone number, email address, or any other information that may personally identify you.

Internet Protocol Address 

AdShuffle uses Internet protocol (IP) addresses to measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. Through the use of IP mapping technology, we are able to translate your IP address into a geographic location, which may include a close approximation of your Continent, Country, State/Province, City, Postal/Zip Code, Designated Marketing Area, ISP and Current Weather. This technology does NOT provide us with your street address, telephone number, or any other information that may personally locate you.

Mobile Advertising ID 

AdShuffle does not utilize mobile Advertising IDs (AAID/IDFA) at this time. Both Android and iOS provide options for limiting and opt-ing out of such tracking though. Android users can [Opt Out of Interest-Based Ads](https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en) and iOS users can enable [Limit Ad Tracking](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205223) if desired.

Referrer URL 

AdShuffle uses Referrer URLs to measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. By examining the Referrer URL, we are able to determine which web site is displaying one of our client's advertisements. We are also able to extract keywords from STATIC page content, however this is NOT performed on pages which are dynamically generated (i.e. with a query string) or for any pages that exist behind a user-login form so that we avoid extracting any information that may personally identify you.

Third-Party Data 

We receive information about consumers from third parties to enable targeted advertising on the website(s) and application(s) that we support. The collection and use of that data is governed by the privacy policy and legal terms of the data collector and the website using the data; it is not governed by AdShuffle.

User-Agent 

AdShuffle uses User-Agent to determine Device Type (i.e. Desktop, Tablet or Mobile), Browser, Operating System and Language Preferences.

Guidelines 

For guidelines concerning the acceptable use of AdShuffle ad serving technology, including but not limited to activities related to SPAM and spyware, please review our acceptable use policy.
