**Ad2action, Inc. Spamming Policy**

**What is Spamming?**

Spamming is defined as sending an unsolicited e-mail message of any form to someone with whom you don’t have an existing business or personal relationship. It is an attempt to deliver mass commercial emails for the purpose of advertising a service or product. Typically, potential target lists are created by scanning Usenet postings, stealing mailing lists or searching the Web for addresses.

Spamming is a serious problem for Internet users, not only is it a drain on time, but it also uses up your computer’s hardware and bandwidth. Electronic junk mail costs the recipient more time and money than it does the sender. 

Ad2action, Inc. strictly prohibits our users, licensees and affiliates from sending Spam and other forms of Internet abuse to any Landing Page Campaign they generate. This includes, but is not limited to, the sending of "advertising", "junk mail," "chain letters," "pyramid schemes," "surveys", "bulk mail", "contests", or any duplicative or unsolicited messages (commercial or otherwise). 

**Spam Definitions:**

  
1\. Any email message, from a ad2action landing page address (user domain/url) or containing a ad2action.com/ URL in the message body, or containing a link to a ad2action.com landing page within the mail or directed to an ad2action landing page using an i-frame, frameset, or page forward, jump page or another web site addressed to a recipient with whom the initiator does not have an existing business or personal relationship with or is not sent at the request of, or with the express consent of, the recipient or who is not compliant with CANSPAM requirements. ****

2\. Any Usenet newsgroup message, from a ad2action.com address or containing an ad2action.com URL in the message body, posted to Usenet newsgroups that are off-topic (unrelated to the topic of discussion), cross-posted to unrelated newsgroups, or posted in excessive volume. 

3\. Any blog, forum or message board message, from a ad2action.com address or containing a ad2action.com URL in the message body, posted to blogs, forums or message boards that are off-topic (unrelated to the topic of discussion), cross-posted to unrelated message boards, or posted in excessive volume or are direct advertisements in violation with the blog site policies. 

4\. Any instant message, or SMS text message from a ad2action.com campaign address or containing a ad2action.com URL in the message body, sent to chat rooms, or to groups or individuals via Internet Relay Chat or "Instant Messaging" system (such as ICQ or AOL's Instant Messenger) that contain off topic content, sent in excessive volume or containing commercial content to individuals who are not contacts.

5\. Electronic mail messages which are sent unsolicited to an audience unknown to the sender. It is an attempt to deliver a message, over the Internet, to someone who has not given permission to receive it. 

6\. Using mailing lists or services that claim to be “opt-in” but cannot prove that the people have volunteered their permission to receive such emails. 

  
**Enforcement Actions:**

Upon the receipt of a credible complaint as per our requirements, ad2action, Inc. will launch a thorough investigation to verify the reported Spam incident violates our stated policy. If we determine the originator of the Spam is our customer or affiliate and did violate our anti-Spam policy, the customer or affiliate will either be warned or have their account immediately terminated - depending on the severity of the offense.

Customers or affiliates whose accounts have been terminated will be prohibited against using any future ad2action, Inc. services and may be subject to damages and legal action.  Since damages are often difficult to quantify, if actual damages cannot be reasonably calculated then those found to be in violation of this anti Spam policy will be charged $5 for each piece of Spam or unsolicited bulk e-mail transmitted from or otherwise connected with an email account or landing page at ad2action.com, otherwise violators of this policy will owe ad2action Inc. actual damages, to the extent such actual damages can be reasonably calculated.
