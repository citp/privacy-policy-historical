# Ad Muncher - Privacy Policy

We store information about a user under three conditions:

 **During contact with us via email for support enquiries**  
The information stored is simply the users email address (so we can reply) and information about any problems they are experiencing for future reference if required, for example if the problem persisted we would know what we had tried previously.

 **After the registration process has completed**  
The information stored is the user's email address, registration name/code combination, full name, and the date of registration.  This information is stored largely for the purposes of retrieving lost registration codes for users.

 **If a user enters an illegal registration code into Ad Muncher**  
The Ad Muncher program uses a server-based check of its registration code after verifying it mathematically (these happen at different times), if the user is found to be using an illegal registration code the recorded information is the user's IP address and time/date.

The above information will never be used for regular unsolicited emails (for example, newsletters), and very rarely will we ever contact users unsolicited.

 **Policies Regarding Third Parties**  
Information provided to our staff will _not_ be sold, rented or traded to any third party under any conditions.

 **Privacy Policy Changes**  
Any changes to the privacy policy will be posted here.  If you have any further questions about our privacy practices (or anything else) please feel free to [contact us](https://web.archive.org/web/20021206055739id_/http%3A//www.admuncher.com/contact.shtml).
