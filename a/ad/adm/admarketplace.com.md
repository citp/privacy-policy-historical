#### Information Processed on Behalf of Our Partners

adMarketplace is a Data Processor under the GDPR. adMarketplace processes information under the direction of its Partners, our Data Controllers, and has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it processes. 

adMarketplace's network places ads to consumers who visit our Publisher’s websites. We may obtain anonymous information such as visiting a particular website, clicking on a particular ad, general geographic data and browser type, by processing personal data such as cookies, pixels and IP addresses. Our legal basis for processing Personal Data will also be based on your consent through our Partners, where needed to perform a contractual obligation, or prevent malicious or fraudulent traffic. adMarketplace may share aggregate data of consumer behaviors with our Partners under confidentiality agreements. These publishers may use this information to better target advertisements. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect Personal Data from you. 

The use of IP addresses is to ensure ads are running in the allowed geos, to better place ads, and flag fraudulent traffic. Cookies may be used to track how you interact with the advertisement and the publisher website. Pixels may be utilized on advertisers' pages in order to track when a sale is completed to ensure the traffic is not fraudulent, but no information regarding the sale, such as billing or contact information is collected.
