<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<p><strong>This Privacy Policy  is effective as of July 1, 2009<br>
  </strong></p>
  
  <p>AdMeld Inc. ("AdMeld") provides web publishers with a set of  technologies and services designed to help them more effectively monetize  their advertising inventory through ad networks and exchanges. <br><br>

  This Privacy Policy describes AdMeld's  privacy practices as they pertain to  (i) our ad optimization  technology ("Technology"), and (ii) visitors to our corporate website  located at www.admeld.com (our "Site").<br><br>

  If you have any questions about this  Privacy Policy, please feel free to contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@admeld.com">privacy@admeld.com</a>.</p>
  <p><strong>1. Technology Privacy Policy</strong> <br>
    <br>
    <u>Overview of AdMeld's Technology</u> <br>
AdMeld's Technology does not serve ads, it decides which ad  networks or exchanges should serve ads on our publisher customer's websites. Generally,  your may encounter our Technology when you visit our customer's websites and  view a page in which the publisher has enabled our Technology.<br>
<br>
<u>What information is collected?</u> <br>
AdMeld's Technology does not collect Personally Identifiable Information ("PII"). Our Technology does collect and use  Non-PII, including: the IP address used to access the Internet, the type of  browser used, which and how many publisher web pages have been viewed, the date and time an ad was requested, and how  many ads were requested.<br>
<br>
<u>Cookies </u><br>
AdMeld's Technology stores a cookie on your computer hard  drive with Non-PII that it uses to keep track of the number of ads you have  viewed on our customers' websites. This frequency data is stored not in the  cookie itself, but in AdMeld's servers. This data is cleared from our servers every 90 days.  Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can  instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or  prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. We are also working on an <a href="#opt">opt-out program</a> which you can read more about below. <br>
<br>
<u>Ad Tags<br>
</u>AdMeld's customers activate our Technology by placing our ad tags on  their websites. Ad tags usually contain information about the website, section  of the site and size of the ad that AdMeld is optimizing. In some cases, a web  publisher can choose to use our ad tags to pass Non-PII information to networks and exchanges  about you, such as demographic information you have previously volunteered to  the website (for example, during the registration process) so long as the  website has the right to use this information for ad selection. <br>
<u><br>
</u>AdMeld is a technology vendor to our customers and we take all  necessary precautions to avoid receiving PII from our clients. Due to the  nature of the Internet, however, we cannot completely control the type of  information a client may send to AdMeld's servers, or prevent a client from  sending PII. <br>
<br>
<u>Third Party Links and Websites</u> <br>
The ads delivered as a result of our Technology  are served by third parties that may use their own cookies and/or other data  collection tools. In addition, the ads themselves may also contain links to  other websites with their own cookies and/or other data collection tools. AdMeld  is not responsible for the privacy practices, policies or the content of such  third parties and websites. AdMeld encourages everyone interacting with ads  from any source to learn more about the privacy practices of those serving it. AdMeld  has no control over the use of any information by third party and/or websites,  and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose any PII. Similarly, AdMeld  does not have access to, or control of, the cookies and/or other data  collection tools that may be placed on any advertisement by a third-party,  including those of our partners, and this Privacy Policy does not cover the use  of cookies and/or other data collection tools by any third party.<br>
<br>
<u>Storage of Non-PII</u> <br>
We retain the Non-PII collected via our  Technology for up to 90 days in order to ensure that our Technology is  functioning properly. </p>
<p><strong>2. Site Privacy Policy</strong> <br><br>

  The corporate Site is intended primarily to offer information about AdMeld and the services we provide. <br><br>

  <u>Information Collected via the Site</u> <br>

  We collect PII from the Site when you choose to provide it to  us. This includes, but is not limited to: name, postal address,  telephone number, or email address. For example, you may choose to send us PII  about yourself in an email or by completing an online form on this Site. We use  this information only to contact you to respond to your inquiry. Once  collected, we will store your PII for a reasonable time for record keeping  purposes. The information that we store is usually deleted as space requires or  in the normal course of business.<br><br>

  We also collect Non-Personally  Identifiable Information (Non-PII) via the Site. Non-PII cannot be used to  contact any single person or entity and may include your IP address, pages  viewed on this Site, browser type, Internet Service Provider, the time/date of  your visit to this Site, and your computer's operating system (e.g., Mac OSX). AdMeld  uses this information for internal purposes such as to administer the Site,  improve and customize the Site, help AdMeld understand and analyze how the Site  is being used and to track aggregate Site usage.</p>
  <p><u>Cookies and Web Beacons</u> <br>
  We use "cookies" and web  beacons to help us manage this Site. A persistent cookie remains on your hard  drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by  following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file.  Web beacons (also known as "1X1 pixels" or "clear GIFs")  are small strings of code that provide a method for delivering a graphic image  on a web page or in an email message for the purpose of transferring data. For  more information about cookies and web beacons please visit <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/cookies/" target="_blank">http://www.allaboutcookies.org/cookies/</a>.<br><br>

  <u>Third Party Websites</u> <br>
  The Site may contain links to other  websites. Such websites may use cookies and/or other data collection tools. AdMeld  is not responsible for the privacy practices, policies or content of such other  websites. AdMeld encourages everyone to read the posted privacy policies  whenever interacting with any website to learn more about the privacy practices  of that website. AdMeld has no control over the use of information by third  party websites, and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose any  PII to those websites.<br><br>

  <u><a name="opt"></a></u><br>

  <strong>3. Controlling the use of your information</strong> <br><br>

  <u>Opting out</u> <br>
  AdMeld is in the process of  implementing a program that will allow you to opt-out from having AdMeld  collect your Non-PII in connection with our Technology. The opt-out process will  place an opt-out cookie on your computer. The opt-out cookie tells us not to  collect your Non-PII and to avoid writing another cookie to your computer.  Please note that if you delete, block or otherwise restrict cookies, or if you  use a different computer or Internet browser, you may need to renew your  opt-out choice.<br><br>

  <strong>Update:</strong> Our opt-out program will  launch in August 2009—we appreciate your patience while we get it up and running.  If you would like us to notify you when our opt-out  program is available, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@admeld.com">privacy@admeld.com</a>. <br><br>

  <u>Deleting your PII</u> <br>
  Although we don't collect PII via our  Technology, if you'd like us to update, correct, delete or deactivate any PII  that you have provided to us on our corporate Site, please send your request to  us at <a href="mailto:privacy@admeld.com">privacy@admeld.com</a> and we will process your request within a reasonable period of time after  receipt.<br><br>

  <strong>4. General:</strong> <br><br>

  <u>Information Security</u> <br>
  The security of your information is  important to us. We have implemented reasonable security measures to protect  the information in our care, both during transmission and once we receive it.  This includes, but is not limited to the use of encryption. No method of  transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100%  secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable  means to protect your information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.<br>
  <br>
  If you have any questions about our  security practices, please send an email to us at <a href="mailto:privacy@admeld.com">privacy@admeld.com</a>.<u> </u><br><br>

  <u>Information Relating to Children</u> <br>
  Our products and services are designed  for those 18 years of age and older. We do not knowingly collect PII from  anyone under the age of 18. If we are made aware that we have received PII from  someone under 18, we will use reasonable efforts to remove that information  from our records.<br><br>

  <u>Disclosure of Information to Third  Parties</u> <br>
  We do not collect PII via our  Technology, and we do not sell, rent or share PII collected on the Site with  non-affiliated third parties without your consent. <br>
  <br>
  We may share Non-PII collected via our  Technology with publishers and partners. Similarly, we may enhance the Non-PII  collected via our Technology with Non-PII collected from publishers and  partners. This information cannot be used to contact or identify any person  individually.<br>

  We may disclose your information to  third parties when we reasonably believe we are obligated to do so by law, and  in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual  prohibited activities, including but not limited to, fraud and situations  involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person.<br>
  <br>
  Finally, we may transfer information,  including any PII collected via the Site, to a successor entity in connection  with a corporate merger, consolidation, sale of assets, bankruptcy, or other  corporate change.<br><br>

  <u>Changes to this Privacy Policy</u> <br>
  This privacy policy is subject to  change. If we make any material or substantive changes in the way that we use  the PII collected through this Website, we will post a clear and conspicuous  notice of those changes on the Website and in this privacy policy.<br><br>
