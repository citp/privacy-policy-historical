# Privacy Policy for AdMinder.com AdTracking and Guaranteed Traffic

Adminder.com and Adminder.com, LLC take your privacy seriously, and have created this Privacy Policy in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to online privacy. Please read the following to learn more about our information gathering and dissemination practices, and our use of personally identifiable information.

**IP Addresses**

We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our web server, and for the general administration of our website. Your IP address, should you decide to become a registered user of AdMinder, is also used to prevent you from registering twice due to temporary technical problems. Finally, your IP address may also be used to help verify that you are who you say you are.

**Cookies**

Upon your first visit to this web site, a "cookie" is sent to your computer. A cookie is a tiny file that identifies you as a unique user. It stores personal preferences and user data, however, in no way does this tell us who you are. AdMinder.com has two primary uses for its cookies.

First, we use them to track special offers and promotions that are made available to you so that you do not see the same special offer and/or promotion each time you visit our website. Secondly, we also use cookies to track referring web sites.

While both of these activities depend on the use of a "cookie," visitors to this site always have the option of disabling cookies in their web browser. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent.

**Information Gathering**

This web site collects contact information in various ways, including inquiry forms, registration forms, surveys, and contests. The information collected may be used to send the user information about our company, or to get in touch with the user when necessary. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the opt-out/modify section below. Financial information (such as a credit card number) is used to bill the user for products and services. Unique identifiers (such as social security and/or Tax ID numbers) are collected for tax-reporting purposes if applicable.

**Information Dissemination**

None of the information that is collected by this web site is rented, sold, or shared with any 3rd parties for any purpose -- except in the case of unique identifiers (such as social security and Tax Id numbers) which are provided to the IRS for tax-reporting purposes if applicable.

**Security**

This web site has security measures in place to protect against loss, misuse and/or alteration of the information that you provide. When making a purchase from this web site, your personal and financial information (such as your credit card number) are protected by the industry-standard Secure Socket Layer protocol. Furthermore, we have taken every precaution that is technically possible to prevent any unauthorized access to the contents of this web server.

**Opt-Out/Modify**

AdMinder.com provides every user with the opportunity to easily opt-out of receiving future communications from us, change and modify information previously provided, or remove their information from our databases altogether. You may do so in the following ways:

  * Email: [support@adminder.com](mailto:support@adminder.com)
