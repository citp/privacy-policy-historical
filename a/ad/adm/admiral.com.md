# Admiral privacy and security policy

As part of the quote and acceptance process we exchange information with the Claims Underwriting Exchange which holds a record of incidents reported to insurers, which may or may not have given rise to a claim. We do this in order to verify the information provided about you or any individual who is named on the quotation or policy during the quote process.

### Credit reference

When you apply to us to open an account, we make a number of checks to assess your application for credit and verifying identities to prevent and detect crime and money laundering. To obtain this information, we will check the following records about you and anyone else who may also be insured and whose personal details have been provided as part of the insurance application.

  * Our own records.
  * Credit Reference Agency (CRA) records. When we search these records CRAs will place a search footprint on your credit file that may be seen by other lenders. They supply us with both public (including the electoral register), and shared credit and fraud prevention information
  * Fraud Prevention Agency (FPA) Records



We make searches about you at credit reference agencies who will supply us with information, including the Electoral Register and credit information. The agencies will record details of the search whether or not your application proceeds. The searches will not be seen or used by lenders to assess your ability to obtain credit. We may use scoring methods to assess this application and to verify your identity.

Credit searches and other information which is provided to us and/or the credit reference agencies, about you and those with whom you are linked financially, may be used by EUI Limited and other companies if you, or other members of your household, apply for other facilities including insurance applications and claims. This information may also be used for debt tracing and the prevention of money laundering as well as the management of your account. Alternatively, we may ask you to provide physical forms of identification.

We may also make periodic searches at CRAs and FPAs to manage your account with us.

Information on applications will be sent to and recorded by CRAs. When you borrow from us, we will give details of your account(s) and how you manage it/them to CRAs. If you borrow and do not repay in full and on time, CRAs will record the outstanding debt. This information may be supplied to other organisations by CRAs and FPAs to perform similar checks, and to trace your whereabouts and recover debts that you owe. Records remain on file for six years after they are closed, whether settled by you or defaulted.

If you give us false or inaccurate information and we suspect or identify fraud, we will record it and may also pass this information to FPAs and other organisations involved in the prevention of crime and fraud.

If you borrow from us and do not make payments that you owe us, we will trace your whereabouts and recover debts.

Your data may also be used for other purposes for which you give your specific permission or, in very limited circumstances, when required by law or where permitted under the terms of the Data Protection Act 1998.

### How to find out more

This is a condensed guide to the use of your personal information for credit reference purposes. If you would like to read the full details of how your data may be used please phone our Customer Services Department, or write to Us at Pricing Department, Tŷ Admiral, David Street, Cardiff, CF10 2EH.

You can contact the CRAs currently operating in the UK; the information they hold may not be the same so it is worth contacting them all. They will charge you a small statutory fee.

### When you make a claim

If necessary we may also have to investigate your claims and conviction history in the course of administering the claim. You can be assured that we will keep such investigations strictly confidential.

We pass information to the Claims Underwriting and Exchange Register, run by Insurance Database Services (IDS) and, in the case of motor insurance, the Motor Insurance Anti-Fraud and Theft Register, run by the Association of British Insurers (ABI). This helps insurers check information and prevent fraudulent claims. When we deal with your request for insurance we may search these registers. Under the conditions of your policy, you must tell us about any incident (such as an accident or theft) which may give rise to a claim. When you tell us about an incident we will pass information to the Registers.

Information relating to your insurance policy will be added to the Motor Insurance Database ("MID") managed by the Motor Insurers' Bureau ("MIB"). MID and the data stored on it may be used by certain statutory and/or authorised bodies including the Police, the DVLA, the DVANI, the Insurance Fraud Bureau and other bodies permitted by law for purposes not limited to but including:

  * Electronic Licensing
  * Continuous Insurance Enforcement; Law enforcement (prevention, detection, apprehension and or prosecution of offenders)
  * The provision of government services and or other services aimed at reducing the level and incidence of uninsured driving



If you are involved in a road traffic accident (either in the UK, the EEA or certain other territories), insurers and or the MIB may search the MID to obtain relevant information.

Persons (including his or her appointed representatives) pursuing a claim in respect of a road traffic accident (including citizens of other countries) may also obtain relevant information which is held on the MID.

It is vital that the MID holds your correct registration number. If it is incorrectly shown on the MID you are at risk of having your vehicle seized by the Police. You can check that your correct registration number details are shown on the MID at [www.askmid.com](http://www.askmid.com/).

### Fraud prevention and detection

In order to prevent and detect fraud insurers may, at any time share information about you with our other group companies.

If false or inaccurate information is provided and fraud is identified details will be passed to fraud prevention agencies. Law enforcement agencies may access and use this information.

We and other organisations may also access and use this information to prevent fraud and money laundering, for example, when:

  * checking details on applications for credit and credit related or other facilities
  * managing credit and credit related accounts or facilities
  * recovering debt
  * checking details on proposals and claims for all types of Insurance
  * checking details of job applicants and employees



### MyLicence

As part of our fraud prevention and detection measures, we may undertake searches against your (or any person included on the proposal) DLN against details held by the DVLA to confirm your licence status, entitlement and restriction information and endorsement/conviction data. This helps insurers check information to prevent fraud and reduce incidences of negligent misrepresentation and non-disclosure. A search of the DLN with the DVLA should not show a footprint against your (or another relevant person included on the proposal) driving licence.

Please contact us on 0800 052 3144 if you want to receive details of the relevant fraud prevention agencies.

We may exchange your details such as NCB, DLN and Claims records with insurance industry databases for the purpose of validation and financial crime prevention.

We and other organisations may access and use, from other countries, the information recorded by fraud prevention agencies.
