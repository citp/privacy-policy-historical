			or “us”), we know our visitors and advertisers (collectively, “you” or “users”) value their privacy, and we have
			created this privacy policy to ensure that you understand our policies and procedures regarding the types of
			information we collect or that you may provide to us in connection with use of <a href="http://www.admarketplace.net">www.admarketplace.net</a> (the “Site”)
			and our AdMarketplace service (the “Service”) and how we use such information.</p>

			<p style="margin:20px 0px 0px 0px"><span style="font-weight: bold">Personal Information Collection &amp; Usage:</span> AdMarketplace only collects personal information from you when it is
			voluntarily provided by you. Personal information may include name, title, company, email address, physical
			address, telephone number, credit card information and similar information which identifies you. We may use
			this information in a variety of ways.  For example, we may use this information so that you may obtain access
			to advertiser-only portions of the Service and/or to receive AdMarketplace information, products and services.
			In addition, we may share your personal information with our affiliates, technical consultants, third party
			auditors and other third parties who make our Site and Service available, enhance its functionality or provide
			associated services and/or who deal with you in processing your orders and/or deliver the Services or related
			services.  The personal information you provide is considered a company asset and may be included among
			transferred assets if our company or any of its assets are ever acquired by or transferred to a third party or an
			affiliate.</p>

			<p style="margin:20px 0px 0px 0px">From time to time we may supplement personal information you give us with information from other sources, such
			as information validating your address.  Thus, information we obtain through the Site and Service may be
			intermingled with and used in conjunction with information obtained through sources other than the Site or
			Service, including both offline and online sources.</p>

			<p style="margin:20px 0px 0px 0px"><span style="font-weight: bold">Aggregate Information Collection &amp; Usage:</span>
			We may collect information from you in an aggregate, anonymous form, which means that the information will not contain
			nor be linked to any personal information. For instance, we may aggregate data based upon the advertisements you upload
			and deliver through our Service, the Targeting Criteria (described in the <a href="terms.html">Terms and Conditions</a>) you select, the amount
			of money you spend on your account and other campaign or user data.  AdMarketplace uses this information to measure the
			use of our Site and Service, to report to our business partners aggregate statistics regarding use of our Service, to
			improve our Site and Service and for other business purposes.</p>

			<p style="margin:20px 0px 0px 0px">We also reserve the right to access and/or disclose personal information and
			non-personal information we have gathered, as required by courts or administrative agencies and to the extent
			required to permit us to investigate suspected fraud, harassment or other violations of any law, rule or
			regulation, the <a href="terms.html">Terms and Conditions</a>, or the rights of third parties or to investigate any suspected conduct
			which AdMarketplace deems improper. </p>

			<p style="margin:20px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-weight: bold">Clickstream:</span>  As you use the Internet,
			a trail of electronic information is left at each web site you visit. This information, which is sometimes
			referred to as "clickstream data," can be collected and stored by a web site's server. Clickstream data can tell
			us the type of computer and browsing software you use and the address of the web site from which you linked to
			the Site. We may use clickstream data as a form of aggregate information to anonymously determine how much time
			users spend on each page of our Site, how users navigate throughout the Site and how we may tailor our web pages
			to better meet the needs of users. This information may be used to improve our Site and Service or to share with
			business partners. Any collection or use of clickstream data will be anonymous and aggregate, and will not
			contain any personal information.</p>

			<p style="margin:20px 0px 0px 0px;"><span style="font-weight: bold">Cookies:</span> The Site and Service may use
			"cookies" to improve our level of service to our you. Cookies are lines of text that are transmitted to your web
			browser when you click on a web site. Your browser stores the information on your hard drive and when you return
			to that web site later, the cookie is transmitted back to the server that originally sent it to you. Cookies
			provide a way for a server to recall a previous request or previous registration, or to keep track of a
			transaction as it progresses, so that information does not have to be repeated. To be notified when you are about
			to receive a cookie, you can configure your browser to alert you when a web site is attempting to send you a
			cookie and at that time you will have the option of refusing the cookie. </p>

			procedures to safeguard the information we collect. Only those employees and contractors who need access to your
			personal information in order to perform their duties are allowed access to your personal information. However,
			due to the inherent open nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that communications between you and
			AdMarketplace, AdMarketplace and you or AdMarketplace and any business partners will be free from unauthorized

			this risk.</p>
