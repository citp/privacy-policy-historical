<p><strong>Last Updated -- October 30th 2009</strong></p>
<br>
<p>This privacy statement ("Privacy Policy") explains how information is collected and utilized by AdMob Google Inc.
   ("AdMob" or "we", "us", "our") its subsidiaries and affiliated companies. This Privacy Policy applies to the AdMob
   website at www.admob.com, (the "Site") and AdMob's other online services. If you have any concerns about privacy
   on the Site, please send an email to privacy@admob.com and we will try to address it.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>What Personal Information Does AdMob Collect?</strong></p>
<br>

<p>When AdMob uses the term personal information in this policy,
   AdMob is referring to information that specifically identifies an individual
   (such as an individual's name, address, telephone number or e-mail address),
   and information about that individual or such individual’s activities or preferences
   when such information is directly linked to personal information.  Personal
   information does not include aggregate information, which is data we collect
   about the characteristics and activities of users of the Site and AdMob's
   other online services, from which any personal information has been removed.
   This privacy policy in no way limits or restricts our collection of aggregate
   information or of non-personal information.</p>
<p>AdMob collects the following types of information from its Site:</p>
<br>

<p>A) Information That You Provide to Us.</p>
<br>

<ul>
<li>We receive and store personal information you choose to enter on our Site,
    or provide us in any other way, such as by telephone or by electronic mail.
    For example, when you register for our services, we collect personal
    information about you. This information may include your name, address,
    e-mail address, telephone number, and credit card number. We may combine
    the information that you submit on our Site with information about you
    that we receive from other online and offline sources in order to provide
    you with a better experience and to improve the overall quality of AdMob's
    services. In addition, if you voluntarily complete a detailed publisher or
    advertiser questionnaire, we collect personal information about you as part of
    that questionnaire. This information may include your name, address, e-mail
    address, and telephone number, as well as general information about your
    business, if applicable. In general, the more information you feel comfortable
    giving us, the more we can personalize the experience of our services
    to meet your needs.</li>
</ul>

<p>B) Information That We Automatically Collect</p>
<br>

<ul>
<li>AdMob utilizes cookies to automatically collect information about visitors
  to our Site.  Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that reside within your
  browser to enable our computer systems to recognize your browser and to
  tell our systems how and when pages within our Site are visited and by how
  many people. The cookies from our Site do not collect personal information,
  however, we may combine information collected through certain cookies we
  issue on our Site with other personal information that you provide to
  us on the Site. </li>
<li>We may collect information using Web beacons.  Web beacons are electronic
  images used on our Sites or in our emails.   We use web beacons to deliver
  cookies, count visits, understand usage and activity on the Site and
  to tell if an email has been opened and acted upon.  </li>
<li>We automatically receive and store certain other types of information
  whenever you interact with us. For example, our servers track the type
  of Web browser you are using, where you travel within the Site, and the
  page to which you link from the Site. This type of collective data enables
  us to figure out how often customers use parts of the Site, so we can
  make the Site appealing to as many customers as possible.</li>
<li>Many companies offer programs that help you to visit Websites anonymously.
  While AdMob will not be able to provide you with a personalized
  experience if we cannot recognize you, we want you to be aware that
  these programs are available although they may impair the quality of
  your experience on our Site.</li>
</ul>

<p>We also may collect information in connection with our Mobile Services provided
  to publishers and advertisers as described below in the AdMob Mobile Services
  section of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>How Does AdMob Use the Personal Information That it Collects?  </strong></p>
<br>

<p>We use the information we collect to provide our services and to better
  understand what products and services are of interest to our users.
  For example, we may utilize your information to:</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Operate and improve our Site and services;</li>
<li>Respond to your comments and questions and provide customer service;</li>
<li>Provide and deliver products and services and send you related information,
  including confirmations, invoices, technical notices, updates, security alerts,
  and support and administrative messages;</li>
<li>Protect the rights or property of AdMob or our users; and</li>
<li>Communicate with you about promotions, upcoming events, and other news
  about products and services offered by AdMob and our partners.</li>
</ul>

<p>AdMob may store and process personal information in the United States and in other countries. </p>
<br>

<p><strong>Does AdMob Share the Personal Information That it Collects? </strong></p>
<br>

<p>AdMob does not share your personal information except as approved by you or as described below:</p>
<br>

<ul>
<li>With your consent, for example, when you agree to our sharing your information with
  other third parties for their own marketing purposes subject to their separate privacy policies;</li>
<li>Agents and Service Providers: AdMob may engage other companies and individuals to perform services
  on our behalf. Examples of these services include processing credit card payments, sending postal mail
  and e-mail to you, and analyzing data. While these agents and service providers may have access to your
  personal information in connection with the performance of services for AdMob, they may not use such
  information for any purpose other than providing such services to AdMob.</li>

<li>Protection of AdMob and Others: We release account and other personal information when we believe
  that release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our user Agreement; or protect
  the rights, property, or safety of AdMob, our users, or others. This includes exchanging
  information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</li>

<li>Corporate Transfers and Financings:  AdMob may share your personal information in connection
  with any merger, sale of AdMob assets, or a financing or acquisition of all or a portion of our
  business to another company. </li>

  with advertisers, publishers, business partners, sponsors, and other third parties.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How Secure Is the Personal Information That You Provide to AdMob?  </strong></p>
<br>
<p>AdMob takes reasonable measures to protect your personal information in an effort to prevent
  loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.  AdMob cannot,
  however, ensure or warrant the security of any information that AdMob receives.  </p>
<br>

<p><strong>What Information Can You Access and Change?</strong></p>
<br>

<p>You can access or correct certain information about you collected on this Site in the
  Account section of the Site.  You may opt out of receiving promotional emails from AdMob
  by following the instructions in those emails.  If you opt out, we may still send you
  non-promotional emails, such as emails about your accounts or our ongoing business relations.
  You may also send requests about your contact preferences and other changes to your information
  by emailing privacy@admob.com.  </p>
<br>

<p><strong>AdMob Mobile Services </strong></p>
<br>
<p>AdMob provides mobile advertising services ("Mobile Services") to advertisers and publishers.
If you are a publisher using AdMob's Mobile Services, AdMob may access, index, and cache
requests made from your mobile sites, applications and device platforms to our system,
including by automated means. In the course of providing these Mobile Services,
AdMob collects aggregate data from publishers' sites and uses such data for a number of
purposes, including, but not limited to, providing publishers, advertisers and others with
aggregate information about traffic and site usage in our advertising network.</p>
<br>

<p>AdMob also collects certain information about visitors to publishers' sites that
  connect to the AdMob Mobile Services. AdMob will automatically collect and receive
  information about those visitors such as, but not limited to, browser identifiers,
  session information, browser cookies, device type, carrier provider, IP addresses,
  unique device ID, carrier user ID, geo-location information, sites visited and clicks
  on advertisements we display. AdMob may track that information over time and over
  multiple publishers' sites and use non-personally identifiable information collected
  from such visitors to provide reports to advertisers and others and to help us display
  advertisements that may be of interest to your visitors.  In some cases, the mobile
  phone service providers for mobile devices may send visitors' phone numbers to AdMob.
  AdMob uses such information to perform analysis aimed at improving our services and
  technologies and may also use this data to display advertising customized to visitors'
  interests and preferences. AdMob does not use such information for telemarketing, to
  contact any individuals or to share with any third parties for their own use. In
  addition, AdMob may collect personal information directly from customers on behalf
  of advertisers and periodically transfer such information to such advertisers. </p>
<br>


<p><strong>Changes</strong></p>
<br>
<p>We may change this Privacy Policy at any time, at our sole discretion. Use of 
  information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the 
  time such information is used. If we make changes to the Privacy Policy, we will 
  notify you by posting an announcement on the Site so you are always aware of what 
  information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances if any, it is 
  disclosed.  If we make any changes to this Policy, we will change the "Last Updated" 
  date above.</p>
