  * Enable Advertisers to better reach their target audiences; and
  * Enable Publishers to support, grow and monetize their websites through the sale of advertisements.



(collectively referred to as the ‘Services’)  
This Privacy Policy is as per the Indian Information Technology Act, 2000 and the Information Technology (Reasonable security and procedures and sensitive personal data or information) Rules, 2011 prescribed thereunder, (“Applicable Law”) that is intended to provide consumers with clear and complete information about the consumer data and information that we collect in connection with our Services and the way that data and information is stored and used by our Company. 

Information We Collect 

Non-Personal Information Collected by our Services. We deliver advertisements from hundreds of Advertisers across a large number of Publisher websites, which are a part of our ad-network. When you visit one of the Publisher websites in our network, our automated system may collect "click stream data" related to your visit to the website. Click stream data is anonymous and can include information such as your IP address, Operating System details, Browser details, the date and time at which those pages were viewed and interaction with content and advertisements on those Web pages. Technologies used to collect this click stream data, include cookies and Web beacons.   
In order to improve performance, we augment our click stream data with non-personally-identifiable behavioral and demographic data from Publishers and other partners. This anonymous data may include such things as zip code, age, gender and income range but shall not include any kind of Sensitive Personal Data or Information (as defined under Applicable Law), which the Publisher may collect on its website.   
We utilize the non-personal information, described above to better customize the sort of advertisements you see. We also aggregate anonymous cookie data in order to identify large audience segments that assist advertisers in targeting their campaigns to the most relevant Internet audience. We store the information collected in log files, and log files are retained in our systems for a reasonable period of time. Anonymous data stored in our log files, that associates the log data to a particular computer include IP address and cookie ID. We purge the IP address and irreversibly obfuscate the cookie ID from our log files as soon as we believe this information is no longer required by us.
