### AdMeridian.com Data Collection on Behalf of Our Clients

In the course of delivering an ad to you, AdMeridian.com does not collect personally identifiable information about you.

However, AdMeridian.com does collect certain non-personally identifiable information about you, such as your browser type (e.g. Firefox or Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you use (e.g. Macintosh or Windows), and whether you responded to the ad delivered. The non-personally identifiable information that we collect is used for the purpose of targeting ads and measuring the effectiveness of ads on behalf of AdMeridian.com customers. This non-personally identifiable information includes common information found in every communication sent over the Internet. Using this information, AdMeridian.com can infer information such as:

  1. Domain Type; Browser type (e.g., Netscape or Internet Explorer); operating system (e.g., Macintosh or Windows); browser language (e.g., Java or Unix); Internet service provider (e.g., MindSpring or AOL). We may also receive non-personally identifiable data, such as behavioral, contextual or demographics, through partnerships with online and offline 3rd party data providers.



In addition, you should be aware that AdMeridian.com works with ad serving and other companies in connection with the delivery of ads to you, and that such companies may also collect the types of non-personally identifiable information described above when you view an ad.

### About Cookies

Like most Internet sites, AdMeridian.com uses "cookies" to enhance user's experience on the Web. AdMeridian.com cannot use these cookies to personally identify you in any way, and these cookies in no way damage your system or files.

  
**_What are cookies and how do they enhance your Web experience?_**   
An AdMeridian.com cookie is a unique number that is assigned to you the first time we serve you an ad or identify you on a client’s website. This number is stored in a file on your computer and helps us deliver the optimal ad to you. For instance, cookies help AdMeridian.com ensure that you don't repeatedly see the same advertisement. Cookies can also help advertisers measure how you utilize an advertiser's site and the effectiveness of an advertisement. This information can then be used by advertisers to better cater to your needs. In other words, cookies help us deliver to you the types of ads in which you are more interested.

Although AdMeridian.com believes that cookies help enhance your experience on the Web by delivering more relevant messages to you, we do not need cookies to deliver ads to you. If you decline a AdMeridian.com cookie, you will still be able to view ads; however, you may see the same ad repeatedly or be delivered ads that have no relevance to you.

### How long is data stored?

AdMeridian.com sets our cookies to expire after two years and the expiration date updates every time you encounter our server. We retain the web log data for ninety days and aggregations and reports for up to three years.
