# AdReady – Privacy Policy

## Introduction

AdReady, a Division of CPXi, takes your privacy very seriously. This document explains our privacy policy and outlines the main principles behind this policy, as well as education on how to learn more about these topics.

We have three sections of our privacy policy.

  1. The first section applies to consumers (end users) who view ads from our advertising clients that are delivered via the AdReady technology.
  2. The second section applies to our advertising and agency clients and prospective clients who use AdReady’s technology and website.
  3. The third section describes broad policies that apply to both consumers and clients



## 1\. Consumers (End-Users)

### Who AdReady is and What We do

AdReady, a Division of CPXi, is a display advertising technology company that enables advertisers and agencies do run more effective display advertising campaigns. We work with those advertisers and agencies to help them build online campaigns, build advertising creative (display ads) and run reporting and optimization. Our goal is to help them deliver more relevant and cost-effective advertising to online consumers (end-users).

### What Information AdReady Collects

AdReady does not collect personally identifiable information about consumers (end-users) who view or click on the ads that are displayed via our technology. We do collect anonymous information that cannot be used to identify a particular person, and may include IP host address, pages viewed, browser type, Internet browsing and usage habits, advertising interactions, Internet Service Provider, domain name, time/date of visit to Web site, referring URL and operating system. We collect this data via technologies called cookies, pixels and web beacons. We collect this information to improve the advertising services we offer to our advertiser and agency clients and to provide more relevant advertising to consumers.

### Cookies & Web Beacons

We use cookies to help collect the information listed above. Cookies are small text files that contain a string of alphanumeric characters, which are placed on a computer or browser. The AdReady cookie automatically expires 12 months after it is placed. We also use web beacons (aka ‘ClearGif’s’ or ‘1×1 pixels’) to track actions on our advertising clients’ sites. (For more information about cookies and web beacons, visit www.allaboutcookies.org/cookies).

### Where You May See AdReady Advertisements

AdReady helps our advertising clients put their display advertisements across many Internet Web sites. These sites are also called ‘Web Publishers.’ These Web Publishers may also put a cookie on your Web browser to help personalize your experience on their site and also to recognize that there may be a more relevant advertisement available from an AdReady client.  AdReady cannot be responsible for the cookies that may be placed by Web Publishers.

### Third-Party Web Sites

Advertisements from AdReady link to third-party web sites. Those sites may have privacy practices that may differ from those of AdReady. We encourage you to understand those privacy policies and practices. AdReady cannot be responsible for the privacy practices of these web sites.

### Opt-Out and Your Choices

AdReady respects your decision to opt-out of cookie-based tracking. If you wish to opt out of targeted ads based on the AdReady cookie, please [click here](http://www.adready.com/consumer_opt_out).  Our opt-out tool will not opt you out of other parties’ cookies.  You can also visit the Digital Advertising Alliance’s opt-out page to opt-out of other cookies [here](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/). In order to do this, we will put a cookie on your computer that indicates you have opted out. Note, if you change computers, browsers or delete your cookies, you will need to re-opt-out. Also, you will still see advertisements from AdReady clients, but they will be un-personalized.

### Blocking Non-Personal Information Collection

Browsers and third-party software can allow you to block the use of cookies or limit the placement of cookies. In doing this, you may be prevented from being able to participate or experience various services and features which require access to the information provided by the cookies.

## 2\. AdReady Advertising Clients

### Overview

Like most corporate websites, and nearly all advertising agencies, we collect information about clients and prospective clients for one principal reason: it helps us to better serve you. It helps us improve your experience on our websites and assures that we can communicate with you about your account; it better equips us to develop services that cater to your particular needs.  It’s also the best way of ensuring that you get to take advantage of new services and product offerings quickly.

### Types of Information

AdReady gathers two types of information about our corporate website’s users: Personal Information that clients provide through optional, voluntary submissions, such as email and online registration forms to AdReady, and non-personal information that we collect automatically to observe site trends and gain a better understanding of our clients’ experiences with our web site and advertising application.

### Personal Information Collection and Use on www.adready.com

Personal Information means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, your name, work or home address, telephone number, e-mail address, and credit card information such as the credit card number, card verification value, and the billing address. The types and amount of Personal Information collected for these activities will vary depending on the activity. This Personal Information is critical to us in developing services that help you achieve your business objectives, and we may use it to communicate with you about your account or our services. AdReady only collects Personal Information that we consider necessary for providing you with the world class service you expect as an AdReady client.

If you communicate with us through e-mail, regular mail, or the phone, or choose to leave feedback on any of our websites, we may also save that information and use it to improve our customer support and client services, to troubleshoot other problems or resolve disputes, or for other business purposes. If you are referred to us from another company or website, we may receive certain additional information about you from that entity. In addition, we may use your Personal Information to send you special offers or information from our trusted business partners. You may choose to not receive these offers by opting out when you first receive such an offer.

### Non-Personal Information Collection and Use on www.adready.com

We also collect non-personal information, such as aggregated tracking information derived mainly by tallying page views throughout our site. This non-personal Information also covers data collected by our web site cookie on our web site and advertising tool, such as clicks, settings, IP addresses and other usage data. All of this allows us to better tailor the content and settings in our advertising tool to our clients’ individual needs.

### Blocking Non-Personal Information Collection

Browsers and third-party software can allow you to block the use of cookies or limit the placement of cookies. In doing this, you may be prevented from being able to participate or experience various services and features which require access to the information provided by the cookies. Please refer to your browser’s help menu or printed manual for instructions on deleting and managing cookies.

### Our Affiliates, Vendors and Service Providers

We may share Personal Information with our subsidiaries, affiliated companies, or other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of processing Personal Information on our behalf, or performing other business services for us. We ask that all of our service providers use at least the same degree of care in protecting Personal Information as we do, and we provide them with information only to the extent necessary to assist us.

For example, AdReady may store – or have a third-party entity store on AdReady’s behalf – and use your payment information (including credit card information such as the credit card number, card verification value, and the billing address) for processing payments.

We may aggregate Personal Information, and disclose such information to third parties for a variety of reasons, including for advertising, marketing and promotional purposes. However, if we do this, we will aggregate this information and not disclose information in a manner that directly identifies you.

### Other Third Parties

AdReady does not otherwise share Personal Information about site users with third parties unless doing so is appropriate to carry out a user’s request or it believes that doing so is legally required or is in AdReady’s interest to protect its property or other legal rights or the rights or property of others, or necessary for national security, other law enforcement, issues of public importance or safety, or to enforce our Terms and Conditions or other policies.

### Merger, Sale or Bankruptcy

If AdReady should ever file for bankruptcy or have its assets sold to or merge with another entity, information AdReady receives from you from this site is an AdReady asset and may be transferred.

### Protections

AdReady uses reasonable procedural and technical safeguards to protect Personal Information against loss, theft or misuse, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction. No data transmissions over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make reasonable efforts to ensure security on our systems. We use secure server software (SSL) and firewalls to protect your information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed by breach of such firewalls and secure server software.
