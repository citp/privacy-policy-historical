<h2>AdReady Privacy Policy</h2>

<p> At AdReady, we appreciate that our clients' and prospective clients' private information is important. The following
explains our privacy policy and our approach to the collection and use of information from and about you and/or your
company. </p>

<p> Like most corporate websites, and nearly all advertising agencies, we collect information about clients and
prospective clients for one principal reason: it helps us to better serve you. It helps us improve your experience on
our websites and assures that we can communicate with you about your account; it better equips us to develop services
that cater to your particular needs; it helps us provide you with the most targeted advertising programs, and the most
accurate research about the efficacy of these programs. It's also the best way of ensuring that you get to take
advantage of new services, product offerings, and promotions quickly. If you have any questions or concerns about our
use of Personal Information, please don't hesitate to contact us by e-mail at:
<a href="mailto:privacy@adready.com">privacy@adready.com</a>. </p>


<h2>Types of Information</h2>

<p> AdReady gathers two types of information about our website's users: Personal Information that users provide through
optional, voluntary submissions, such as email and online registration forms to AdReady, and non-Personal Information
that we collect automatically to observe site trends and gain a better understanding of our users' experiences. </p>

<p> Personal Information means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited
to, your name, home address, telephone number, e-mail address, and credit card information such as the credit card
number, card verification value, and the billing address. The types and amount of Personal Information collected for
these activities will vary depending on the activity. </p>

<p> Other information we gather includes aggregated tracking information derived mainly by tallying page views
throughout our sites and from cookies and Web beacons on our client's sites. This non-Personal Information also covers
things like click-throughs, IP addresses, and usage data, and it may at times be combined with your Personal
Information. All of this allows us to better tailor our content to our users' individual needs. </p>


<h2>Personal Information Collection and Use</h2>

<p> AdReady only collects Personal Information that we consider necessary for providing you with the world class service
you expect as a AdReady client. In general, you can check out various pages on our websites without telling us who you
are or revealing any identifying Personal Information. If you'd like to view the entire site or sign up for any of our
services, we may require differing degrees of Personal Information about you, your company and its goals, credit,
billing, financial information, and various other types of information. This Personal Information is critical to us in
developing services that help you achieve your business objectives, and we may use it to communicate with you about your
account or our services. </p>

<p> If you communicate with us through e-mail, regular mail, or the phone, or choose to leave feedback on any of our
websites, we may also save that information and use it to improve our customer support and client services, to
troubleshoot other problems or resolve disputes, or for other business purposes. If you are referred to us from another
company or website, we may receive certain additional information about you from that entity. In addition, we may use
your Personal Information to send you special offers or information from our trusted business partners. You may choose
to not receive these offers by opting out when you first receive such an offer. </p>

<h2>Non-Personal Information Collection and Use</h2>

<p> Like most websites, though, we automatically receive and record certain information through the use of various
technologies like "cookies," "web beacons," and "pixel tags." Our clients may use the same technologies on their sites
on our behalf. We use this information to generate reports for ourselves and our clients, observe trends and site
traffic, administer and improve our customer's campaigns and ads, administer our sites and improve their usability, and
to gain a better understanding of your interests. This information may include, by way of example, the URL from which
you just came, the URL to which you next go, your computer browser information, operating system, IP address, and other
information about how you use our site. </p>

<h2>Our Affiliates, Vendors and Service Providers</h2>

<p> We may share Personal Information with our subsidiaries, affiliated companies, or other trusted businesses or
persons for the purpose of processing Personal Information on our behalf, or performing other business services for us.
We ask that all of our service providers use at least the same degree of care in protecting Personal Information as we

<h2>Aggregate Information </h2>

<p> We may aggregate Personal Information, and disclose such information to third parties for a variety of reasons,
including for advertising, marketing and promotional purposes. However, if we do this, we will not disclose information
in a manner that directly identifies you. </p>

<h2>Other Third Parties</h2>

<p> We will not share Personal Information collected on this web site with third parties for their direct marketing
purposes without your consent. In addition, AdReady does not otherwise share Personal Information about site users with
third parties unless doing so is appropriate to carry out a user's request or it reasonably believes that doing so is
legally required or is in AdReady's interest to protect its property or other legal rights or the rights or property of
others, or necessary for national security, other law enforcement, issues of public importance or safety, or to enforce
our Terms and Conditions or other policies. </p>

<h2>Merger, Sale or Bankruptcy </h2>

<p> If AdReady should ever file for bankruptcy or have its assets sold to or merge with another entity, information
AdReady receives from you from this site is a AdReady asset and may be transferred. </p>

<h2>Protections</h2>

<p> AdReady uses reasonable procedural and technical safeguards to protect your Personal Information against loss, theft
or misuse, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction. No data transmissions over the
Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information
you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make reasonable efforts to
ensure security on our systems. We use secure server software (SSL) and firewalls to protect your information from
unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such
information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed by breach of such firewalls and secure server software.
</p>

<h2>Administrative Communications and Notice of Security Breaches </h2>

<p> If AdReady learns of a security systems breach we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take
appropriate protective steps. By using this web site or providing personal information to us you agree that we can
communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy and administrative issues relating to your use of this
site. AdReady may post a notice on our web site if a security breach occurs. If this happens, you will need a web
browser enabling you to view the adready.com web site. AdReady may also send an email to you at the email address you
have provided to us in these circumstances. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of
a security breach in writing. To receive free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from
receiving electronic notice) you should notify us at <a href="mailto:privacy@adready.com">privacy@adready.com</a>.</p>

<h2>International</h2>

<p> Our site is hosted in the United States. If you are visiting from the European Union or other regions with laws
governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that you are transferring your personal
data to the United States which does not have the same data protection laws as the EU and by providing your personal
data you consent to: (1) the use of your personal data for the purposes identified above in accordance with this Privacy
Policy; and (2) the transfer of your personal data to the United States as indicated above. </p>

<h2>Access</h2>

<p> Users have access to their Personal Information and may update their information on the website. </p>

<h2>Policy Updates</h2>

<p> We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy. When we do, we will also revise the "effective date" date on the
Privacy Policy. For changes to this Privacy Policy that may be materially less restrictive on our use or disclosure of
personal information you have provided to us, we will attempt to obtain your consent before implementing the change. We
encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed about how we are protecting the Personal
Information we collect. Your continued use of this web site constitutes your agreement to this Privacy Policy and any
updates. </p>

<h2>Children's Online Privacy</h2>

<p> Consistent with the federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), we will never knowingly
request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without requiring parental consent. Any
