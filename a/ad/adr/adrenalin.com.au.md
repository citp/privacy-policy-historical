In order to provide the best possible service to our customers we record all calls handled by our Customer Experience team for coaching and training purposes. At the beginning of each call you will be given the opportunity to request that your call is not recorded. Call recordings are kept for a short period.

In certain circumstances, such as when you purchase a gift card for another individual, we may also collect the information that you provide to us on that individual (such as their name and email address). In providing us with any personal information, you warrant that you are authorised to provide us with that personal information and that we are able to use that personal information for the purposes as set out in this privacy policy.

We will not generally collect any sensitive information from you, revealing your: race, ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union memberships or details of health or disability which we consider are unnecessary to our function. Exceptions to this include:

(a)           where you have given express consent to us to do so and the information is reasonably necessary for us to carry out our functions or activities;

(b)           the use of this information is required or authorised under Australian law or a court or tribunal order; or

(c)            when the information is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of a legal claim.

We will not collect personal information unless the information is reasonably necessary for, or directly related to one, or more of our functions or activities.  If we are unable to collect personal information we reasonably require, we may not be able to do business with you or the organisation with which you are connected.

**Collection of Website Activity Information (Cookies)**

The Big Red Group collects information about individual users and the activities of Users on the Site. This information is used to assist us in enhancing the functionality of the Site and Services.

Collection of website activity information is conducted via the use of ‘cookies’. In simple terms a cookie is a little piece of information handed to a web browser from a web server that contains information that can be retrieved from the server later. When a User visits the Site the server may attach a cookie to their computer’s memory. The Big Red Group uses cookies to the extent of recognising the User when they visit the Site and pairing that user with an account profile. Personal information can only be used to identify a user’s website activity when that user is logged in to their Big Red Group customer account. Where a user is not logged in, website activity cannot be used to identify users.

Unless you are a User of Big Red Group who is logged in to a Big Red Group account at the time, this information is not linked to any personal information that the user may provide and cannot be used to identify users. A User may configure their computer so that it disables cookies or does not accept them.

We may also store your website activity in cookies which may be used by third party vendors, including Google, to serve ads based on your behaviour on our website. You may opt out of Google's use of cookies by visiting the Google advertising opt-out page.

(c)            enhancing functionality of the Site and Services when a User is logged in (for example, personalised recommendations and submission of customer feedback).

For the purposes of providing you with our services, we may disclose your information to third parties such as our service providers and suppliers. Any such disclosure will be done in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy. We take reasonable steps to ensure that these organisations are bound by privacy obligations in relation to the protection of your personal information.

We may also share information with third parties for the purposes of joint promotions or data analytics. Where we share information for the purposes of data analytics, this information will be appropriately de-identified so that it is not personal information and you will not be personally identifiable.

We will not disclose personal information to any third party other than as set out above or elsewhere in this Privacy Policy. In order to deliver the services that we provide to you, we may disclose your personal information to other organisations, only in relation to providing our services to you.

We may disclose certain information about you including your personal information to our related bodies corporate.

In the event of a security incident involving unauthorised access, use or disclosure of personal information where a third party with whom we share personal information is involved, we will seek to work cooperatively with them to protect the personal information we have shared with them.
