**Collection of personal information by Adrenalin**   
The personal information we collect and store will depend on what products and services you request from us. This includes (but is not limited to) information provided when requesting an adventure booking, gift voucher, gear and/or membership. Our sites registration form requests users’ [which includes third party personal information where applicable collected as described below] to give us contact and profile information such as name, email address, phone number, mailing address, age, medical conditions and dietary requirements.  Some of the requested information is required in order to receive the Adrenalin product or service; other information is optional.  
 **  
Where your personal information is stored**   
Where we store your personal information depends on what products and services you have requested from Adrenalin. Data is stored in our CRM for the use of processing transactions, providing order confirmations and dispatching products. Information provided in customer feedback forms is also stored on this system. We also maintain an email database for subscribers to our monthly e-newsletters.  
 **  
Ways we use data**   
We collect your personal information so that we can use it for our functions and services. This may include, but is not limited to:

  * processing your orders including bookings, gift vouchers, gear and membership.
  * providing confirmation of your adventure booking and advise of any changes or additional information.
  * sending out feedback and surveys and addressing any issues or complaints.
  * answering any queries about Adrenalin and its products and services.
  * sending targeted advertising and promotions that allow us to provide our service;
  * sending special deals, promotions and offers based on users interests plus other news on Adrenalin including updates of new, or enhanced services.
  * confirming receipt of profile changes.
  * serving ads, promotions and special offers on Facebook. Any personal information provided to Facebook will be "hashed", a process that summarises text into a short fingerprint that cannot be decrypted and does not allow the original information to be recovered later by decryption.
