        <p>
            <strong>Personal Information.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Adfusion is not designed to collect
            any personally identifiable information about you, either via our website or Adfusion
            advertisements placed on publishing partners. Although the Adfusion website may
            include a page for businesses to contact us about advertising opportunities, this
            page is not intended for use by individual consumers. Providing such contact information
            is purely voluntary and is not necessary to view any article on this Site. We use

            certain non-personal information from your computer. This information is collected
            from your computer’s web browser and may include information such as the following
            (“non-personal information”):<br>
            <br>
            -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the type of web browser software you use (for example, Internet
            Explorer)<br>
            -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the name of the IP Address and/or domain from which you access
            the Internet (for example, Yahoo.com)<br>
            -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the date and time you access our websites, as well as which pages
            were viewed<br>
            <br>
            Adfusion retains certain information, such as IP addresses, for a short period to
            aid in the targeting of ads by location and for fraud detection and prevention.
            <br>

                better target advertisements to people across the different websites they visit.
                We will use non-personal information to help us make our websites more useful to
                visitors and for other business purposes. We may use information from cookies to
                deliver content that you may find more interesting based upon the articles you have
                viewed in the past. We may prepare reports and other materials using non-personal
                information. We may share and use non-personal information without restriction because
                it does not identify who you are.<br>

                cookie” on your computer, which will prevent your anonymous data from being matched
                to any particular machine. If you opt-out, you will continue to receive ads from
                Adfusion; however, it will prevent us delivering ads tailored to your preferences
                and usage and may prevent us from controlling the frequency with which you may view
                particular advertisements. You may opt-out of cookies used for data collection and
                targeting from Adfusion. Be advised that if you change computers or browsers, delete
                your cookies, or use multiple computers or browsers, you will need to repeat this
                process for each computer and each browser. In order to opt-out, follow the instructions
