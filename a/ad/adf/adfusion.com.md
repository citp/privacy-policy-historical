# Privacy

**Welcome.**   At ARAnet, Inc, the company that operates DreamPlanGo.com, we are committed to protecting the online privacy of visitors to our websites. This Policy applies only to the information collected through DreamPlanGo.com. The purpose of this Policy is to inform you about the types of information we gather about you when you visit our websites, how we may use that information, and how we disclose it to third parties. Your use of this website is also subject to our Terms and Conditions. 

**Changes to this Policy** We may revise or update this Policy at any time. If we make material changes, we will post the revised Policy on the Web Site and update its "last updated" date. We encourage you to check this Policy whenever you visit the Web Site to see if it has been updated since your last visit. 

**Site Not Intended for Children.**   Our website is intended for a general audience and is not intended for use by children without their parent's or guardian’s supervision. We ask that anyone under the age of 18 not submit any personal information through our websites. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 18. 

## Scope of this Policy

This Policy distinguishes between personally identifiable information, which we refer to as "personal information," and "aggregate information" and other forms of non-personally identifiable information. 

  * Personal information as used herein means information that personally identifies you, such as your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card or other account number, and other information that is linked to personal information about you.
  * Aggregate information is aggregated information from which we have removed individual identities or other personal information, or information that we collect about the Web Site or about a group or category of products, services or customers that does not identify you personally. Aggregate data helps us understand trends and our users' needs so that we can better consider new features or otherwise tailor our Web Site.



This policy applies to personal information collected by us on the Web Site. This policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate information. 

## How We Collect Personal Information

  * We may collect certain information that you voluntarily provide to us when you use the Web Site. You may provide personal information to us at various locations on the Web Site. For example, we may collect your name, billing and shipping address, email address, telephone number, and credit card account number when you register and set up an account, subscribe to a newsletter or other publication, or purchase products or services on the Web Site. Personal information may also be collected if you provide such information in connection with participating in discussion forums, blogs, social networking services, or other interactive services on the Web Site. In addition, we may collect personal information you provide in connection with sending us emails or other communication through the Web Site or your participation in or response to surveys, sweepstakes, contests, games, promotional offers, and other activities on the Web Site. We may also collect other information about you that we may associate with your personal information such as your interests, preferences and demographics. For example, we may collect information about your interests in certain lifestyle topics. We collect this personal information for example, when you order a product, enter a contest or sweepstakes, request a catalog, or register for a mailing list.
  * We, our related web hosting providers, and our advertisers and ad serving and tracking companies sometimes utilize "cookie" technology on the Web Sites. Cookies are bits of data stored on your hard drive that contain no personally identifying information but which help enhance your Web-browsing experience. Not all Web browsers accept cookies, and those that do usually provide a preference or setting that allows you to refuse and remove most types of browser cookies. If your browser does not accept cookies, you may still enjoy the Web Site.
  * Web Beacons. We may use, and may permit third parties to use, "Web beacons" (also known as pixel tags, clear GIFs and web bugs) on the Web Site and in email communications we send. We use Web beacons to monitor the effectiveness of advertising, to track aggregate Web Site usage, and for other lawful purposes. These web beacons do not collect personal information about you on the Web Site.
  * Automatically collected information. We collect into our log files certain standard information from your web browser—such as your IP address, browser type and language, screen size and the time of your visit—when you visit the Web Site. This information is used by us to analyze trends, administer the Web Site, and gather broad information for aggregate use. We may aggregate some or all of the information we collect from our log files to information stored on a cookie in your computer. We also collect information about keyword searches performed by visitors on the Web Site. We do not collect your name or email address as a result of using a search feature. We may keep logs of all words searched to help us learn what kinds of information visitors to the Website are seeking, and to improve our service to visitors.
