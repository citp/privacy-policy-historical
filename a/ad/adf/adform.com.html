								<h3>
	General Practice</h3>
<p>
	Adform does not collect personally identifiable data from your visit to its domains, including but not limited to www.adform.com, test.adform.com, test.adform.dk and track.adform.net, other than information that you voluntarily supply. By using the Contact Us form or any other publicly available contact channel, you agree that your contact details are correct and rightfully yours. They will be used solely by Adform to respond to your query.</p>
<p>
	With online privacy as its primary concern, Adform continues to support initiatives for self-regulation and laws throughout its markets, such as the regulations of the World Wide Web (W3) group, <a href="http://www.w3.org/P3P/">Privacy Preferences Projects (P3P)</a>, <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com/good-practice-principles">Internet Advertising Bureau (IAB) Good Practice Principles for Online Behavioural Advertising (OBA)</a> or the European Union e-Privacy Directive.</p>
<h3>
	Advertising, Content Serving and Web Analytics Technology</h3>
<p>
	Adform’s technology is used by its customers—advertising agencies, advertisers and publishers—to create and deliver rich and diverse online marketing campaigns using modern technology and innovative tools. Adform supports strict online privacy and security standards and has implemented several techniques to monitor advertising material for potentially unsafe content and unlawful privacy breaches. Adform continuously educates advertisers, agencies and partners to ensure that these parties are aware of and vigilant in preventing any security or privacy breaches that could affect you, media sites or other parties.</p>
<p>
	Adform’s technology allows advertisers to collect and store non-identifying data about Internet users and use them for analysis and online behavioural advertisements. As a result, such advertisements offer an enriched online experience and deliver advertisement content that is likely to be more interesting and relevant to Internet users.</p>
<h3>
	Data Collection</h3>
<p>
	Adform’s advertising technology is used on many websites to gather statistics about visitors and collect information used to decide which ads to display, such as showing similar products to those a visitor has looked at before. Adform uses a cookie mechanism for this purpose, but only on an anonymous basis. This means that Adform stores no personal information such as email addresses, names or addresses in the cookie or in the cookie-based profile.</p>
<p>
	A cookie is a small text file that can be stored on a computer when, with a browser, a user views advertisements or web sites of one of Adform’s clients. The cookie does not collect names, addresses, telephone numbers, email addresses, or anything that personally identifies the user. Instead the cookie contains:</p>
<ul class="checkedList">
	<li>
		a random identification number,</li>
	<li>
		opt-out or opt-in choice options, or</li>
	<li>
		information about campaign/advertisement activity on an advertiser’s site.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Using the cookies’ random identification numbers, Adform collects and stores in the cookie-based profiles anonymous information such as:</p>
<ul class="checkedList">
	<li>
		operating system,</li>
	<li>
		browser version,</li>
	<li>
		geographic location,</li>
	<li>
		URLs on which Adform displays advertisements, or</li>
	<li>
		facts about interactions with advertisements (such as number of clicks or views).</li>
</ul>
<h3>
	Usage of Collected Data for Advertisements</h3>
<p>
	The collected data can be used in four different ways for online behavioural advertisements. They can be used for the following tasks:</p>
<ul class="checkedList">
	<li>
		displaying ads in a sequence,</li>
	<li>
		displaying particular products in response to interest,</li>
	<li>
		displaying ads based on statistical probabilities, or</li>
	<li>
		deciding if an ad should be shown based on responses to the above techniques.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<strong>Display ads in a sequence</strong></p>
<p>
	First, ads can be shown in a sequence by using a cookie with a random identification number. By remembering which ads have been shown to each number, Adform offers advertisers the possibility to only show the same ad a specific number of times, before showing other or no ads.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Display particular products in response to interest</strong></p>
<p>
	Based on the random identification number in the cookie, Adform for a certain period stores the information that interest was shown in a particular product or advertiser in terms of, for example, a click, visit, mouse-over, search or similar interaction tracked by the advertiser. Based on this information, the advertiser can create ads that display the same or similar products of possible interest. Therefore, an ad on the same browser with the same random identification number can be used to display more products that are relevant. This technology is sometimes used on the advertiser’s web site to recommend other products.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Display ads based on statistical probabilities</strong></p>
<p>
	Adform uses data based on thousands of users that respond to ads and products to show the viewer particular products or ads. This means that actions such as clicking on an ad or visiting an advertiser’s web site are anonymously aggregated and used to select the ads to show you and other users. Therefore, if cookies with similar characteristics to that of a given viewer indicate interest in an advertisement, then it is very likely that this advertisement will appear. For example, if visitors browsing on an iPad on a Formula 1 site show strong interest in an advertisement for a new iPad subscription to <em>Motor Magazine</em>, then other users on iPads visiting the same Formula 1 site are very likely to be shown that particular advertisement.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Deciding if an ad should be shown based on responses to the above techniques</strong></p>
<p>
	All the above techniques can be used not only to decide what ad to show, but also whether to show it. Through real-time-bidding or similar technologies, advertisers can use the above technologies for deciding who it is relevant to display their ads for and not showing it to others.When using the collected data for advertising purposes, Adform conforms to all applicable laws as well as standards such as <a href="http://iabeurope.eu/news/self-regulation-framework.aspx">Self-regulation Framework for Online Behavioural Advertising (OBA)</a>, released by <a href="http://iabeurope.eu/">IAB Europe</a>, which allows consumers to opt out of behaviour tracking by our technology. Accordingly, Adform does not target sensitive segments of the audience, such as children under 12 or others considered sensitive by the IAB Europe Self-regulation Framework for OBA.</p>
<h3>
	Data Collection on Behalf of Third Parties</h3>
<p>
	Adform does not allow collection or storage of any type of sensitive personal data. Data that are not sensitive but can be used to identify an individual, such as addresses or telephone numbers, are also not collected or stored unless provided voluntarily by an individual Internet user. Any such information is only available for use by the particular advertiser to whom the individual has supplied his or her data. Advertisers are limited by contract to use these data solely for the purposes, identified in the advertisement, of providing Internet users with requested products, services or information as established in that advertiser’s privacy policy.</p>
<p>
	Although it is permitted, Adform does not encourage customers to use its technology for collection or storage of personal identification data. In all such cases, Adform provides only secure data storage and access to the data control services with no other use of those data. Adform does not assume responsibility for the advertisers’ use of these voluntarily supplied data. Adform does not distribute this information to any party other than those indicated in the advertising agreement.</p>
<h3>
	Links to Other Sites</h3>
<p>
	Ads served by Adform usually link to other web sites, which may have privacy assurance practices that differ from ours. Adform does not control and cannot be held responsible for the content of these web sites. To make sure your privacy is protected, please consult the respective privacy policy of the web site you are visiting.</p>
<h3>
	Data Security and Protection</h3>
<p>
	Adform implements reasonable security measures to protect all data collected and used by Adform technology. At every step, Adform adapts all relevant security and safety practices, and employs modern security hardware and software provided by recognized world-leading manufacturers. Physical environment security is also ensured; thus, Adform solutions are hosted and data are stored only in Tier 3 or Tier 4 data centres, classified according to official data centre classification.</p>
<h3>
	Adform allows Internet users to opt out of:</h3>
<ul class="checkedList">
	<li>
		cookie-based targeted advertisements using Adform technology for online behavioural advertisements (OBAs),</li>
	<li>
		tracking of visits across domains of different media or advertisers’ sites through Adform technology,</li>
	<li>
		any type of cookie-based tracking by third-party technology through Adform.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	The opt-out process erases all previously collected data and places an alternative Adform cookie into the Internet user’s browser with special indication of an “opt-out” choice and with no other data. The cookie applies to the specific computer and browser only.</p>
<p>
	If an Internet user wishes to opt out on other browsers or computers, he or she must repeat the process. Please also note that if all cookies are erased from the computer, the opt-out cookie is also erased and the process must be repeated.</p>
<p>
	When a user opts out, Adform will no longer:</p>
<ul class="checkedList">
	<li>
		identify the user by the unique identifier normally stored in the Adform ad-serving cookie. Users therefore in many cases receive the same ad repeatedly because rotations of ads are based on the unique user identifier,</li>
	<li>
		display personalized ads based on user interests,</li>
	<li>
		collect any data about the user’s interactions with online advertisement and online experience on the web sites,</li>
	<li>
		facilitate similar actions or collection of information for such purposes by other targeting systems used together with Adform.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
	Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>
	Adform reserves the right to modify this privacy policy partially or fully at any time without notice. Adform ensures that privacy practices described in this privacy policy are up to date and reflect current ad-serving and data collection mechanisms employed by the Adform platform.</p>
