					<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
					<page><p><strong>This Privacy Policy was last modified and is effective as of July 25, 2008 <br>AD COUNCIL PRIVACY POLICY<br><br>THIS IS OUR OFFICIAL PRIVACY POLICY, WHICH IS PART OF OUR <a href="default.aspx?id=124">TERMS OF USE</a> AND FORMS A PART OF YOUR LEGAL AGREEMENT WITH US. PLEASE READ IT CAREFULLY SINCE IT DESCRIBES THE TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT, HOW WE COLLECT AND USE INFORMATION, THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH WE DISCLOSE OR SHARE INFORMATION AND HOW YOU CAN ACCESS, UPDATE OR DELETE CERTAIN INFORMATION WE HAVE COLLECTED ABOUT YOU.</strong></p><p>Any terms not defined in this Privacy Policy are defined in our <a href="default.aspx?id=124">Terms of Use</a>. </p><p><strong>INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE COLLECT IT</strong></p><p>When you access or visit any of our Websites, we and our operational service providers and others who host our Websites often use technology that can recognize, collect and/or transmit information that is associated with you, but which do not personally identify you. Although the term “cookie” specifically refers to a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes, we will use the term “cookie” to refer generically to any technology that can recognize, collect and/or transmit information about your visits to our Websites. This type of information includes such data as the Internet or web domain that referred you, the type of operating system and browser you are using, the date and time of your visit, data relating to activities on our Websites (e.g., so-called ‘clickstream’ data) and other technological attributes about your visit to our Websites. This information is used to analyze trends, administer our Websites, track user movements on our Websites, gather aggregate demographic information about visitors so we can continually improve our Websites. </p><p>Cookies also allow our Websites to recognize a users’ computer or access device each time it is used to visit a particular Website and cookies can keep count of how often you return. Cookies can also track how you use our Websites, your preferences for features and functions and, for Websites that have registration or similar features, cookies can store information such as your user name and password so you don’t have to re-enter them each time you return to visit. Cookies don’t personally identify you or any particular user or individual. </p><p>You can disable or turn the cookie feature off by changing the settings on your Internet browser and you can also change the settings to stop your browser from automatically accepting cookies. Although changing these settings may not affect your ability to browse, it may affect your ability to use certain features and functions of our Websites and it may also require you to re-enter certain information each time you visit or attempt to use our Websites. You should consult the operating instructions that apply to your browser to determine how to best configure your browser settings for your needs.</p><p><strong>PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong></p><p>We use the term “Personal Information” to refer to any information you provide in connection with your use of any of our Websites by which you can be personally identified. Personal Information may include such things as your name, street address, telephone number, date of birth, e-mail address and any other information which might reasonably be used to identify you.

You may also email us with a question or for more information and we will use your contact information (which includes Personal Information such as an email address) to help us respond and for customer service purposes.

If you provide or submit your Personal Information to any of our Websites, we will always give you the right to review, update and/or delete your Personal Information, subject to our obligations to comply with legal, regulatory our internal audit and record-keeping requirements. </p><p>In addition to this Privacy Policy, each of our Websites that ask you to submit or provide Personal Information, will have additional disclosures and information (“Supplemental Privacy Policies”) that describe how that Website collects, uses, shares and maintains your Personal Information and each of those Supplemental Privacy Policies are incorporated and form a part of this Privacy Policy and our <a href="default.aspx?id=124">Terms of Use</a> when you use that Website and provide or submit Personal Information. </p><p><strong>SPONSORS, ADVERTISERS AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES</strong></p><p>Our Websites may contain or display information from our sponsors, advertisers, operational service providers (see Disclosure to Third Parties below) or others (each, a “Third Party”) that offer to make information, goods or services available, provide opportunities to participate in promotions or engage in activities or that link or redirect your browser to other websites, materials or organizations.
