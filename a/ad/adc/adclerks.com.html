		<h1>Data protection &amp; privacy policy</h1>
		<p>Welcome to AdClerks' privacy policy. AdClerks respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal data.</p>
		<p>Last modified: May 2018</p>
		<hr>
		
		<p><b>BY USING THIS WEBSITE YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE TO ALL OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS CONTAINED IN THIS POLICY.</b></p>
		<hr>
		
		
		<h3>Introduction</h3>
		<p>
			AdClerks cares about your privacy. For this reason, we collect and use personal data only as it might be needed for 
			us to deliver to you our website platform (the "Website") and services (collectively, our "Services").
			The Services are operated by Publicity Clerks Ltd (the "Company", "we" or "us") for users of the Services ("You").
		</p>
		
		<p>
			We have developed this Policy in order for you to understand how we collect, use, communicate, and disclose and make use of personal information. 
			It also describes options we provide for you to access, update or otherwise take control of your personal data that we process.
			The following outlines our privacy policy.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			If at any time you have questions about our practices or any of your rights described below, you may reach our Data Protection Officer ("DPO") 
			and our dedicated team by contacting us at support@adclerks.com. 
			This Email inbox is actively monitored and managed so that we can deliver an experience that you can confidently trust.
		</p>
		
		
		
		<br><br>
		
		
		
		<h2>Who are we?</h2>
		<p>
			AdClerks is run by Publicity Clerks Ltd, a business registered in England with company number 10224325. Our office address is Suite 240 50, Eastcastle Street, London, United Kingdom, W1W 8EA.
		</p>
		
		
		
		<br><br>
		
		
		
		<h2>What information do we collect?</h2>
		<p>
			When you interact with us through the Services, we may collect information from you, as further described below:
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>a. Information you provide:</b> We collect information from you when you voluntarily provide such information, such as when you register for access 
			to the Services or use certain Services. Information we collect may include but not be limited to username, real name, email address, mobile phone number, 
			and any other content you upload to our Website.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>b. Automatically collected information:</b> When you interact with us through the Services, we receive and store certain information such as an IP address, 
			device ID, and your activities within the Services. Logging when you access the Services and from where, allows us to better understand our users and keep your account safe.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>c. Aggregated information:</b> In an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of the Services, we may conduct research on our customer 
			demographics, interests and behaviour based on the information collected. We may also disclose aggregated and anonymized user statistics in order to describe 
			our services to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>d. Cookies:</b> Like almost all online websites we employ cookies and similar technologies to keep track of your local device's settings and which account you 
			are logged into. Cookies are small pieces of data that websites and services can set on your browser or device that can be read at a later date. In addition 
			to Cookies we may also use web beacons and single pixel gifs to log Email opens.<br>
			See our <a href="cookie-policy">Cookies Policy</a> for more information.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>e. Cookies (third party):</b> We use third party web site analytic tools such as Google Analytics on our Website that employ cookies to collect certain information 
			concerning your use of our Services. However, you can disable cookies by changing your browser settings. Further information about the procedure to follow in order 
			to disable cookies can be found on your Internet browser provider's website 
			via your help screen.<br>
			We have specifically instructed Google to not share your information with their third parties.<br>
			We use IP Anonymization on Google Analytics.<br>
			See our <a href="cookie-policy">Cookies Policy</a> for more information.
		</p>
		
		
		
		<br><br>
		
		
		
		<h2>Why do we process your personal data &amp; how will it be used</h2>
		<p>
			We need to process your personal data for delivering, improving, updating, and enhancing the Services we provide to you.<br>
			We strongly believe in both minimising the data we collect and limiting its use and purpose to only that (1) for which we have been given permission, (2) as necessary 
			to deliver the Services you purchase or interact with, or (3) as we might be required or permitted for legal compliance or other lawful purposes. 
		</p>
		<p>
			We use the information you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If you provide information for a certain reason, we may use the information in connection with the reason for which it was provided.
		</p>
		
		
		
		<br><br>
		
		
		
		<h2>Our legal basis for processing your personal data.</h2>
		<p>
			<b>a. Contractual necessity - Providing you with our Services:</b> We handle personal data on this basis to create your account and provide our Services.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>b. Legitimate interests:</b> We process your personal data on the basis of legitimate interests in ways that are not overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and
			freedoms of individuals. Including: 			
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Providing a safe and secure Website</li>
			<li>Marketing - sending Emails to inform you of features or offers</li>
			<li>Account security - sending SMS two factor verification text messages</li>
			<li>Protecting our users, servers, and services</li>
			<li>Analysing and improving our Services to you</li>
			<li>Processing legal requirements</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			<b>c. Consent:</b> Handling data freely given by clear affirmative action. You have a right to withdraw consent, which must be brought to our attention.
		</p>
		
		
		
		<br><br>
		
		
		
		<h2>Our disclosure of your information</h2>
		<p>
			We will never disclose your information unlawfully. AdClerks is not in the business of selling your data. There are however some circumstances in 
			which we may share your information with certain third parties, as set forth below:
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>a. Business transfers:</b> As our business grows we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of our take over, merger, corporate sale, reorganization, 
			bankruptcy or similar, your information may be part of the transferred assets.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>b. Legal requirements:</b> We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with 
			a legal obligation, (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of the Company or Related Companies, (iii) protect the personal safety of users of the Services 
			or the public, or (iv) protect against legal liability.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>c. Google Analytics:</b> We utilize Google Analytics for website visitor tracking and analysis. <br>We have specifically instructed Google to not share your information with their third parties.<br>
			We use <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2763052?hl=en" target="_blank">IP Anonymization</a> on Google Analytics.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>d. Trusted third parties:</b> See below "Sharing your personal data with trusted third parties".

			data for any purpose other than as they have been specifically contracted for (or without your consent).
