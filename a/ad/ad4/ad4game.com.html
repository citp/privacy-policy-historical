                <h3>Advertising</h3>

                <p>
                    Ads appearing on our network may be delivered to you by advertising partners, who may set cookies.
                    These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online
                    advertisement and to compile non personally identifiable information about you or others who use
                    your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted
                    advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This privacy policy does not cover
                    the use of cookies by any advertisers. Ad4Game fully complies and adheres to the principles of DAA
                    (Digital Advertising Alliance) / NAI (Network Advertising Initiative) and we simply never store any
                    personal information when showing our ads to any visitors. This explains why we do not offer you an
                    opt-out link.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of other websites or our advertising
                    partners. Please check their privacy policies before you submit any personal data to such websites
                    or advertising partners.
                </p>

                <h3>Your Access and Amendment Rights</h3>

                <p>
                    You have the right, subject to certain exemptions, to obtain a copy of any personal data which we
                    hold about you (for which we may charge you a small fee of €6.35) and to have inaccuracies in the
                    information corrected. If you wish to avail of any of these rights, please write to us at
                    support@ad4game.com.

                <h3>Changes to this privacy policy</h3>

                <p>
                    Ad4Game has the discretion to update this privacy policy at any time. When we do, we will post a
                    notification on the main page of our Site and revise the updated date at the bottom of this page. We
                    encourage you to frequently check this page for any changes to stay informed about how we are
                    helping to protect the personal information we collect. You acknowledge and agree that it is your
