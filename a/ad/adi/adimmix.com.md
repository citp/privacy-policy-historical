# Privacy Policy | ADimmiX

We understand how important the handling of your personal identifiable information (PII) is. In

order to safely control this data, ADimmiX complies with all appropriate data protection legislation and this includes the UK Data Protection Act 1998. By visiting any of ADimmiX websites, you agree and consent to the methods detailed in this policy.

What information do we collect?

We do not collect PII without your prior consent and this information is only ever used in the way that you instruct us to use it.

ADimmiX does not monitor, store or attempt to identify the name, e-mail address, home or office address of any person as a result of submitting a search query. In this respect a search is entirely anonymous. Because of this, we automatically comply with the rules set out in the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).

ADimmiX collects non-identifying information when you visit any of our sites. This information is stored in a log file and includes IP address, browser type, the date and time of your visit, the date and time of your query and one or more cookies. This information is only ever used to improve your service, develop new functionality and ensure that our services operate correctly.

ADimmiX advertising services require user registration. This includes supplying PII (including name, e- mail address and a login for your account) and we use that information to create your account and give you access to our services. We may also request credit card or other payment details in order for you to pay for services.

If you refuse to supply information essential to operating any of ADimmiX products or services then we will not be able to offer you these services.

Cookies

A cookie is a small file that can be sent to your computer when you visit a website. Cookies contain a small amount of data that can be used to store a variety of information. ADimmiX only uses cookies to store preferences that you set when you use ADimmiX services. These preferences include keeping track of your choice of language when you log in to the website and being able to show the views and reports that you used last time you were logged in.

Browsers are generally setup to accept cookies by default. You have the ability to refuse or accept cookies in any manner that you wish. To change these settings please refer to the help associated with your browser. Please note that certain products or services may not function correctly without cookies.

How we use your information

ADimmiX will never sell or rent your PII to other companies or individuals. We will only share this information in the following circumstances:

You have given us permission to do so.

It is necessary to do so in order to complete a transaction relating to a ADimmiX product or service eg to process a credit card transaction. These trusted partners agree to handle your information according to strict best practice guidelines set out by ADimmiX and this Privacy Policy.

It is necessary to do so in order to comply by the rules set out in this Privacy Policy. For example, if we need to check your details against the mail preference service.

It is required by law through a subpoena, search warrant or other legal process. In order to protect ADimmiX, its users or the public this may be carried out without your consent.

At present ADimmiX operates a soft opt-in policy and send e-mails to anyone who has bought products or services from ADimmiX. These e-mails will only ever relate to products and services similar to those you have already purchased. You can unsubscribe or opt-out from receiving these e-mails at any

time by sending an e-mail to [support@adimmix.com](mailto:support@adimmix.com).

We may share combined search information with other users, eg: The most popular search this month was “Loans”.

Our commitment to data security

The security of your data is extremely important to us. We take appropriate measures to ensure that your data is protected against unauthorised access, modification or deletion. We also review these measures on a regular basis to ensure they remain effective.

Data quality and access

It is important to us that your data is accurate. If you wish to view or change any of the data that we hold for you then please e-mail [support@adimmix.com](mailto:support@adimmix.com). Please supply your full name and send from the e-mail address that we have on file at ADimmiX. We will then send you instructions on how to correct or delete your information.

Changes to this policy

We have a variety of procedures in place to ensure that we are aware when new legislation or guidelines are introduced. Our legal team will always make certain that we follow these implicitly.

Who do I contact if I require further information?

We will always be open and honest in our privacy policies and believe this is the best way to create a trusted relationship with you. If you require any more information, please contact us by email at [privacy@advertise.ADimmiX.com](mailto:privacy@advertise.mirago.com).
