          If you register to buy or sell domains/sites using IIPMN.Com's Network, we collect 
          and store information that specifically identifies You or Your account 
          ("Personally Identifiable Information"). At this time, the required 
          information is: Your first name, last name, User ID, password, country, 
          full billing address (for address verification purposes), phone number, 
          and email address. Other information requested on our registration page, 
          such as Company information, is optional at this time but will help 
          us to tailor the Site for You and deliver personalized information to 
          You.</font> </p> 
	    <p><font size="2"><b>Online Surveys and Contests.</b> Occasionally 
          IIPMN.Com will conduct an online user survey to collect information about 
          our User's likes and dislikes. These surveys are optional. Similarly, 
          we offer contests to qualifying User's in which we may ask for contact 
          and demographic information. </font> </p> 
	 <p><font size="2"><b>The IIPMN.Com Payment System. </b> For some
		services, IIPMN.Com offers a payment system that allows the user to pay with a
		credit card (the "Payment System"). If you make use of this service, IIPMN.Com will
		collect your credit card number and will use that information to perform the
		billing operation for services rendered. EXAMPLE: Placing a domain name on
		auction (Gold &amp; Silver). At this time there are NO recurring charges at
		IIPMN.Com. Each payment will be a one time transaction. EXAMPLE: If you place 3
		domains on auction, you will have three (3) separate payment
		transactions.</font> </p>

          IIPMN.Com uses cookies. As an automatic process, our web server software

          Information, among other things, to anticipate and resolve problems

          IIPMN.Com provides access to chat rooms, forums, and/or message boards. 
          Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas 
          becomes public information. You should exercise caution when disclosing 
          your personal information. ONLY give out information that you want others 
          to share, period. In the Domain Name chat room, a chat log is kept of ALL posts 
          that are made. This log is used to resolve disputes, and claims of abuse/misconduct 
          in the rooms to provide a more secure and safe community. IIPMN.Com also 
          periodically monitors these outlets of communication for misconduct,
