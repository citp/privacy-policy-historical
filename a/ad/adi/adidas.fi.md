###   
2.1 Data collected through your interaction with us

Various technologies may be used on our websites and our (mobile) applications in order to improve them, make them more user-friendly, effective and secure. Such technologies may lead to data being collected automatically by us or by third parties on behalf of us. Examples of such technologies are cookies, flash cookies and web analytics.

####

#### _2.1.2 What you should know about cookies_

#### First of all… what are cookies?

Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer or mobile device. For this section, we conveniently use "cookies" as an umbrella term for techniques such as cookies, Flash cookies, web beacons and JavaScript. They don’t take much space and they will be removed automatically when expired. Some cookies expire at the end of your internet session, while others will be saved for a limited amount of time.

####   
Secondly… why do we use cookies?

adidas uses cookies to ensure your visit to our website is as pleasant as possible. There are different types of cookies with different uses. Some are there just to allow you to browse the website and see certain features. Some give us an idea on your browsing experience, i.e. when you have trouble finding what you are looking for, so we can improve and make your future visit as pleasant as possible.

####   
Next… what are the different cookie types we use?

The most important cookies are the **required cookies**. They are essential and help you to navigate on the website and to use basic features. Then there are **functionality cookies** that enable you to save your shopping bag, create a wish list and to save your shipping details for a quicker checkout. The **performance cookies** we use to improve our website. We also like to show you relevant offers. To manage this we collect browsing data. **Interaction cookies** are used for you to interact with social media or to submit reviews. **Targeting cookies**. These cookies capture your preferences in order to show you relevant ads outside adidas sites. Below you see a more elaborate overview of the types of cookies we are using:

  1. REQUIRED COOKIES  
are essential and help you navigate, move around on the website and see certain features. I.e. these cookies make sure your basket is saved during all the steps of your checkout process.

##   
7\. Protection of children’s personal data

The protection of children’s personal data is extremely important. adidas understands that it has a responsibility to protect the privacy of children and has no intention of collecting the data of children under the age of 13. We encourage parents and other guardians to surf the Internet together with their children and enjoy the internet in a responsible manner.

If a child under the age of 16 attempts to register himself or herself, he or she is initially asked to provide the information as described in the above section entitled “What personal data is collected”. In addition, he or she is asked for consent from the parent/guardian to the registration. The data submitted by and collected about the child during the course of his or her visit (e.g. via cookies) may be used as described above.

If a child under the age of 13 attempts to submit a registration application, this will be rejected with the notification that applications from children under the age of 13 are not accepted. For that reason, we ask parents and other guardians to check on and monitor their children’s Internet usage in order to protect them.

##   
8\. Social Networks

Our website and (mobile) applications provide you with Social Plug-ins from various social networks. If you choose to interact with a social network, your activity on our website or via our (mobile) applications will also be made available to social networks such as Facebook and Twitter. 

If you are logged in on one of these social networks during your visit to one of our websites or (mobile) applications, the social network might add this information to your profile. If you are interacting with one of the Social Plug-ins, this information will be transferred to the social network. In case you do not wish such a data transfer, please log off on your social network before you enter one of our websites or (mobile) applications. 

We cannot influence this data collection and data transfer via the Social Plug-ins. Please read the privacy policies of those social networks for detailed information about the collection and transfer of personal data, what rights you have and how you can achieve satisfactory privacy settings.

If you use those (mobile) applications, they may receive information about your actual location (such as GPS signals sent by a mobile device) or information that can be used to approximate a location. You can generally enable or disable your location services in your device or browser settings. 

We use the Google Maps service or the Bing Maps service to assist you in finding the next adidas store. To facilitate this, we load an image from Google Maps or Bing Maps, saving the route data and map image on our server.

##   
10\. Web analytics by Coremetrics

The web analytic services on our website and (mobile) applications are provided by Coremetrics (www.coremetrics.com). This means that when you visit our website or (mobile) applications, a cookie by Coremetrics will be stored on your computer or mobile device, except when your browser settings do not allow for such cookies (see section 2.1.2). 

This further means that when you visit our website or (mobile) application, the web analytics data described above in chapter 2 – including the “click-stream data”, the data from “web beacons and tracking links” and information stored in Coremetrics’ cookies – will be sent to Coremetrics for analysis for and on behalf of adidas. Please note that if you have created an online profile at our website or (mobile) application and if you are logged on in this profile, a unique number identifying this profile is also being sent to Coremetrics in order to be able to match the web analytics data to this profile. 

Coremetrics acts as an agent to adidas, which means that adidas solely determines the purposes for which the data is being used and that Coremetrics will not disclose the information to any third parties (except when required to do so by law or court order). In privacy terms, this means that adidas is the “controller” and Coremetrics the “processor”. You can find out more about the relationships between adidas and Coremetrics in the Coremetric’s privacy policy under “Privacy Policy for Our Provision of Services” at <http://www.coremetrics.com/company/privacy.php#services>.

If you do not wish information about your behaviour at our website or (mobile) application being collected and assessed by Coremetrics, you can apply for a visitor opt-out. This means that Coremetrics will, depending on the type of opt-out you choose, either anonymise the information it collects (but keeps collecting the data) or stop collecting information about your visit at all. This visitor opt-out requires you to accept a cookie being stored on your computer by Coremetrics. You can apply for the visitor opt-out on the link in the privacy policy section of the Coremetrics website.

##   
11\. Re-targeting Technologies

Our website and (mobile) application use re-targeting technologies. This enables us to show our visitors, who were already interested in our shop and our products, advertisements from us on partner websites. We believe that the display of a personalised, interest-based advertising is more interesting for our customers than advertising that does not have a personal connection.

We also work with other companies who use tracking technologies to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet. These companies may collect information about your visits to our websites or (mobile) applications and your interaction with our communications, including advertising.

Re-targeting technologies analyse your cookies and display advertisement based on your past surfing behaviour. For further information on cookies, please refer to section 2 of this privacy policy.
