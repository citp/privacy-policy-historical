Providing this information is strictly voluntary and you will not be subject to any adverse action or treatment if you choose not to provide this information. 

#### Use of Cookies

Adicio uses "cookies" to help personalize and maximize your online experience and time online. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard drive by a Web page server. Cookies are not used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to your computer, and can only be read by a Web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. 

One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize Adicio pages, or register for services, a cookie helps us to recall your specific information (such as user name, password and preferences). Because of our use of cookies, we can deliver faster and more accurate results and a more personalized site experience. When you return to the Adicio site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the features that you customized. We also use cookies to track click streams and for load balancing. 

You may have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline all cookies if you prefer. Alternatively, you may be able to modify your browser setting to notify you each time a cookie is tendered and permit you to accept or decline cookies on an individual basis. If you choose to decline cookies, however, that may hinder performance and negatively impact your experience on the Adicio Web site. To protect your privacy, be sure to close your browser completely after you have finished conducting business with a website that does use cookies.

Adicio Web pages may contain electronic images known as Web beacons, which are hidden graphics or java script that allow us to count users who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services. Web beacons are not used to access your personally identifiable information on Adicio; they are a technique we use to compile aggregated statistics about our Web site usage 

Web beacons collect only a limited set of information including a cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on which the Web beacon resides.

  * The date and time
  * The originating IP address
  * The type of browser and operating system used (if provided by the browser)
  * The URL of the referring page (if provided by the browser)
  * The object requested

Any other visitors to Adicio.com should refer to the On-Line Privacy Policy which covers non-ASP Adicio, Inc.com website use. [http://www.adicio.com/privacy_non_asp](http://www.adicio.com/privacy_non_asp/)

Adicio, Inc. abides by the EU Safe Harbor framework as set forth by the Department of Commerce regarding collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union. As such we operate as a data processor for our hosted recruitment software customers. Our hosted recruitment software customers fill the role of data controller. Individual users involved in recruitment activities usually interact directly with Adicio, Inc.'s customers rather than with Adicio, Inc. Adicio, Inc. provides its customers the option of disclosing their relationship with us by providing notice to individual employees and candidates of the customer about the Adicio, Inc. technology that they use. Adicio, Inc. maintains only that information related to the candidate recruitment process, which our customers' have asked us to process. This ASP Privacy Policy does not reflect the privacy practices of Adicio, Inc.'s customers and Adicio, Inc. is not responsible for its customers' privacy policies or practices. Adicio, Inc. does not review, comment upon or monitor its customers' compliance with their respective privacy policies, nor does Adicio, Inc. review its customer instructions to determine whether they are in compliance with or conflict with the terms of a customer's published privacy policy. 

**1.** Notice/Use of Information

 Because it supplies a hosted system, Adicio, Inc. operates as a data processor for our recruitment software customers. Our hosted recruitment software customers fill the role of data collector. Individual users involved in recruitment activities usually interact directly with Adicio, Inc.'s customers rather than with Adicio, Inc. Adicio, Inc. provides its customers with the option of disclosing their relationship with us by providing notice to individual employees and candidates of the customer about the Adicio, Inc. technology that they use. Adicio, Inc. maintains only that information related to the candidate recruitment process, which our customers have asked us to process. It is the Adicio, Inc. customer's responsibility to ensure that the data the customer collects can be legally collected in the country of origin. The Adicio, Inc. customer is responsible to give its employees and candidates for employment the appropriate level of notification that Personal Information is being collected and maintained. Adicio, Inc. does collect aggregate and demographic data, which is not associated with an individual candidate's Personal Information, and that may be used for statistical analysis and training purposes. 

**2.** Notification of Changes/Choice

 We will maintain information in accordance with this ASP Privacy Policy. If we decide to change this Policy, we will post the changes on this page so that our recruitment software customers or their candidates for employment are always aware of what information we process, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use Personal Information in a different manner, we will notify our recruitment process customers by way of email or by posting a notice on our website for at least 30 days prior to the change in use. Customers, in turn, are responsible for notifying candidates and providing them a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. 

**3.** Onward Transfer

 We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples may include customer service; resume processing, and data storage. If we disclose information of our customers or job candidates to a third party that is acting as our agent or on our behalf, we will ensure that the third party has agreed to abide by the Safe Harbor principles or is subject to the Data Directive, or can otherwise assure adequate protection of such information. We may seek to assure adequate protection, for example, by entering into written agreements with third parties requiring such parties to provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by the Safe Harbor and/or the Data Directive. 

**4.** Data Integrity

 Adicio, Inc. will use Personal Information only in ways compatible with the purpose for which it was collected or subsequently authorized by our customers. Adicio, Inc. will take reasonable steps to ensure that Personal Information is relevant for its intended use, accurate and complete. 

**5.** Security

In the event of such an inadvertent disclosure, Adicio, Inc. will take all commercially reasonable steps to limit and remedy the disclosure. However, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat those procedures or use your personal information for improper purposes. 

**6.** Access/Correction

 In most cases, when Adicio, Inc. collects Personal Information we do so on behalf of another company (as an agent or data processor). To request access to or correction of this information, please contact the company to which you provided it. Adicio, Inc. technology allows its recruitment software customer's access to all of the information processed on their behalf and allows for the processing of any requested corrections to such information.
