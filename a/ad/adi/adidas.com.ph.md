They don’t take much space and they will be removed automatically when expired. Some cookies expire at the end of your session, while others will be saved for a certain amount of time.

## **WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT COOKIE TYPES WE USE?**

There are different types of cookies with different uses. Some are there just to allow you to browse the website and see certain features. Some give us an idea on your browsing experience, i.e. when you have trouble finding what you are looking for, so we can improve and make your future visit as pleasant as possible. 

  
Cookies set by adidas are called "first party cookies".  Cookies set by parties other than us are called "third-party cookies".  Third-party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g. like advertising, interactive content and analytics).  The parties that set these third-party cookies can recognise your computer or mobile both when it visits the website in question and when it visits certain other websites.  We use first party and third-party cookies for several reasons.

## **WHY DO WE USE COOKIES?**

**2\. FUNCTIONALITY AND ANALYTICS COOKIES**

can give you an even smoother customer experience (e.g. these cookies help you to save and remind you about your shopping bag and enable you to create a wish list). These cookies allow us to analyse site usage so we can measure and improve performance. These cookies may be placed by us or a third party on our behalf (see our cookie opt-out tool) and are stored for the duration of your browsing session.

**3\. ADVERTISING AND SOCIAL MEDIA COOKIES**

will remember your product and buying preferences or assist marketing efforts in other ways. These cookies enable us to share data, such as what you like, with our advertisers, so the advertisement you see can be more relevant to your preferences (sometimes referred to as "targeting cookies").

  
They help us to understand shopping behaviour of visitors. This enables us to keep improving our website, so shopping becomes easier and more pleasant, and to improve the marketing messages we send to our customers (sometimes referred to as "performance cookies").

  
They are used for you to express your opinion. These cookies will enable you to like or recommend us on social media and to chat with our service agents. But you can also advise our other (potential) customers by rating and reviewing our products (sometimes referred to as "interaction cookies").
