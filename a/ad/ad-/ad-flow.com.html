              Privacy Policy</span><br>
              Suite 66 strongly believes in a consumer's right to privacy. All web  user data collected by Suite 66 as part of the ad serving process is  not personally identifiable (browser type, for example) and is used in  aggregate form. Suite 66 does not conduct individual web user  "profiling". </p>
              <strong class="body_copy_large_bold">Cookies:</strong>
              <p class="body_copy">Remote "cookies" on web user computers and server databases at Suite  66 facilities are used to store information. A cookie is a piece of  data placed on the Web User's hard drive by our servers. Cookies are  used to improve the experience web users have when they see web  advertisements. Cookies are not viruses and cannot erase your hard  drive or otherwise damage your computer. Usage of a cookie is in no way  linked to any personally identifiable information.</p>
              <p class="body_copy">Cookies are used to ensure that when a web user clicks on an ad,  they are sent to the correct click-through destination. They are also  used by our reporting system to estimate the total reach of an ad  campaign, as well as frequency of display. This allows advertisers to  determine with greater accuracy the composition of the audience they  reach. Cookies are also used to sequence the delivery of a series of  ads to a web browser, and to limit the number of times a web browser  receives any one advertisement. Web Users have the option of blocking  the use of cookies by changing a setting in their browser. Please see  your browser supplier's website for details on how to do this.</p>
              <strong class="body_copy_large_bold">Information Collection and Use:</strong>
              <p class="body_copy">As with all web content delivery systems, Suite 66 records  information about the interaction between a web user's browser and our  servers. Those interactions include ad content (banner) delivery,  counting click-throughs on an ad, and tracking webpage views after a  click-through. Browsers typically provide the browser version, the  operating system, and the IP address of the computer in use. This  non-personally identifiable information is collected from web users to  assist in the proper function of our service as well as the targeting  of advertisements from our customers and the reporting of aggregate  data to both advertisers and publishers. Suite 66 does not collect,  use, sell, or purchase web user information that is personally  identifiable. .</p>
              <strong class="body_copy_large_bold">Third Party Advertising:</strong>
              <p class="body_copy">Suite 66 may use other third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit one of our website. These companies may use information (including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you. While Suite 66 will make a best effort to eliminate or minimize the usage of your information by these companies, please use discretion when giving your information to any advertisements.</p>
			  <strong class="body_copy_large_bold">Information Sharing:</strong>
              <p class="body_copy">Web user information (all of which is non-personally identifiable)  is shared with our advertisers and publishers in aggregate fashion.  This means, for example, that of the millions of web users we deliver  banners to each month, an advertiser will know what percentage of those  users viewed their advertisement with a certain browser. The sharing of  this information is essential to providing the services we offer. Suite  66 may augment web user information with additional non-personally  identifiable information, such as an IP address to 5-digit postal code  cross reference to aid in local targeting of advertising. IP addresses  are not linked to personally identifiable information by Suite 66.</p>
              <strong class="body_copy_large_bold">Consumer Choice and Access:</strong>
              <p class="body_copy">Since Suite 66 does not collect personally identifying information (such as your full name, email address, mailing address, telephone number, or credit card number) we do not maintain a process for an individual to review and/or request changes to his or her personally identifying information.</p>
