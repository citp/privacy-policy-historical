**Privacy and Data Protection Information**

Pursuant to the GDPR and the German privacy and data protection legislation, Adx Holdings Limited (www.adx-pro.com/privacy) hereby explains its current Privacy and Data Protection Policies.

If you would like to get any further information about these policies, or if you think we may have personal information about you that is relevant in terms of data protection, please contact our external data protection officer at privacy@adx-pro.com.

 **General Information**

ADX PRO treats the protection of your personal data with high priority and vows to fully comply with the applicable legislation and directives as set forth by the European Union and the Federal Republic of Germany. 

This Privacy and Data Protection Information explains why and how accessing our website www.adx-pro.com becomes relevant in terms of personal data processing, storage and use, and we also indicate how this applies to other websites linking to our website. 

This document further indicates what we do to protect your personal data when you are using our website.

 **Personal Data**

Personal Data allow for identification of natural persons. Name, address, email, and similar information qualify as personal data. 

Accessing and using our website is possible without sharing fully or in part your personal information with us or any other third party.

If you decide to use our contact fields or use the email links to submit information on our website, we will receive personal information, which is the information that you share in our contact fields or by sending us an email. 

Your decision to submit this information is understood as an intrinsic part of contacting us, for we wouldn’t be able to get back to you without your personal information. 

If you contact us through this website, you will be in control of the information that you submit and decide to share.

 **Data Processing as part of using our website**

As any other website, ADX PRO has a website that is hosted on a webserver, and in order to be able to provide the site to users, this server collects information, processes the same and logs it. 

This information is provided by your webbrowser, and it will be:

-The browser type that you are using including the version

-The operating system on which your browser is running

-The referrer URL, which indicates the website that you came from to access ours

-The user IP, i.e. the hostname of the user

-The time and date of the server call

-The type of request

The data is stored by our host and we can access the information, e.g. to understand technical problems. 

However, we do not combine this information or process it in combination with any other data. 

The information will be erased completely after 31 days. 

The logfiles on our server primarily serve the purpose to identify causes of technical problems and, even more, to prevent and protect against criminal activity as well as to help official authorities identify perpetrators.

 **Processing personal data from this website**

If you choose to contact us, we will process your personal data only to answer your request. 

We will receive your submitted information by email and may forward this information internally to the staff member in charge of the topic you are contacting us about.

 **Forwarding of personal information to third parties**

We will not forward your personal information to third parties unless this is relevant to answering your request or if legally permitted or required. 

If we forward personal data to third parties, this will be handled according to the legal requirements for this process. 

The data that we share will only be the minimal data needed to achieve the target for which we are contacting the third party.

 **Your right to information and to delete personal data**

If you would like to understand which of your personal data we may have stored or if you would like to understand how this data is being processed in our company, please contact us.
