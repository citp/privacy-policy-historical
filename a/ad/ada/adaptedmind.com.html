AdaptedMind is strongly committed to protecting your privacy and the personal information that you may provide as you access and use the materials on AdaptedMind.com (the "Site"), including the subscription pages of the Site. In this written Privacy Policy, AdaptedMind.com describes the scope and breadth of our commitment to privacy. AdaptedMind.com may, in its discretion, amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any material changes to our policy will be reflected on this page, so that you remain informed about the information we collect and how we use it. By exploring and using this Site, and by submitting information as you use this Site, you agree to GloWorld's use of such information as described herein. This Site may contain links to external sites, which sites are not governed by this privacy policy, and Glo does not take responsibility for the privacy practices of any third party sites to which we link. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any such sites before you submit information there.</p>

			  <p><strong>Information That We Collect, and How We Use It</strong><br> 
			    AdaptedMind.com collects information from our users when they create their account for this Site, when they request copies of publications, seek additional information regarding our services or employment opportunities, or register for conferences and other GloWorld-sponsored events. Some of our Site's registration, enrollment, account setup and other forms may ask users to give us contact information, unique personal identifiers, financial information, subject areas of interest and/or demographic information. We may use this data to tailor the visitor's experience at our Site. We sometimes aggregate demographic information, and the types of systems and browsers of users for internal purposes, so that we may better understand the user population of our Site, identify subject areas of interest, and determine whether the Site is designed to work with the computer settings of a majority of our visitors. GloWorld also may conduct user surveys on the Web, which usually are intended to provide GloWorld with information on a number of areas, such as user identity, user viewing habits, whether or not users found what they were searching for, whether the Site content is relevant to user needs, and the like. GloWorld uses the information gathered from such surveys to improve our web content, navigation, and overall visitor experience.</p> 
			  <p>&nbsp;</p> 
			  <p>Any personal information that you provide, such as your name, address, e-mail address, phone number, subject areas of interest, etc., allows AdaptedMind.com to inform you about updates to the service and to notify you about other products and services offered by AdaptedMind.com that may be of interest to you. We will not sell, share, or rent or otherwise make available any of that information to other parties, except that we may disclose the information to third parties who perform services on our behalf in connection with the Site and have a need to access the information in connection with those services. In addition, GloWorld may disclose contact information for you in response to inquiries by bona-fide rights owners in connection with allegations of infringement of copyright or other proprietary rights arising from information that you have posted on the Site or otherwise provided to GloWorld.

Individual performance information can be used for site features personal to the related parent account and their students and/or for internal business metric purposes.
