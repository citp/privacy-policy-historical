We may use this data to tailor the visitor's experience at our Site. We sometimes aggregate demographic information, and the types of systems and browsers of users for internal purposes, so that we may better understand the user population of our Site, identify subject areas of interest, and determine whether the Site is designed to work with the computer settings of a majority of our visitors. GloWorld also may conduct user surveys on the Web, which usually are intended to provide GloWorld with information on a number of areas, such as user identity, user viewing habits, whether or not users found what they were searching for, whether the Site content is relevant to user needs, and the like. GloWorld uses the information gathered from such surveys to improve our web content, navigation, and overall visitor experience.</p>
