			<p>The Adam4Adam Privacy Policy may be found below. Your use of the Adam4Adam Site and services constitutes your acceptance of the terms and conditions of the Adam4Adam Privacy Policy, of our recently updated <a href="http://www.adam4adam.com/?section=20&amp;view[20]=6">User Agreement</a> and of the Adam4Adam <a href="http://www.adam4adam.com/?section=20&amp;view[20]=5">Community Guidelines</a>. You are responsible for reviewing and becoming familiar with all of these terms. </p>
<p><b>Adam4Adam Privacy Policy </b><br>
    <br>
  A4A Network Inc. has created this privacy policy because we value our members and recognize their right to keep personal information private. This statement discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for the World Wide Web site located at www.Adam4Adam.com (the "Adam4Adam Site"). We believe very strongly that private information should remain private. We'd like to hear your feedback about this statement. If you have comments or questions, please <a href="http://www.adam4adam.com/?section=20&amp;&amp;view[20]=2">Contact Us</a>.
<br><br>
Except as otherwise expressly discussed in this Privacy Policy, this document only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. To the extent that you disclose your information to other parties, whether they are other members of the Site or other sites throughout the Internet, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the personal information you disclose to them. 

</p><p><b>ADAM4ADAM GATHERS THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION: </b>
</p><p><b>Cookies </b><br>
  Our Web site sets cookies to administer our site, to gather broad demographic information, to deliver content requested by you or specific to your interests, to customize our Web site for you, and to save your username and city so that you don't have to enter it each time you visit.
</p><p>A cookie is a small line of data that is stored on your hard drive. Some cookies are only stored for the duration of a single browser session; others persist across sessions. We only save your password and member name if you tell us to do so; your password is encrypted, stored on your computer and transferred over the Internet in an encrypted format. Keep in mind that anyone using your Web browser would be able to access the Adam4Adam Site as you if you choose to store your member name and password. Adam4Adam's Web servers also set session ID cookies that are used to allow our servers to deliver information you request (e.g., search results). Members who do not want to receive cookies can instruct their Web browsers to refuse them; however, doing so may prevent most parts of Adam4Adam's site from working (e.g., anything that requires login, including member chat, etc). While cookies set by Adam4Adam may be used to collect personally identifiable information and can be traced to an individual user, this personally identifiable information is used only for internal purposes.
</p><p><b>Registration Form </b><br>
  Membership on the Adam4Adam Site is completely optional. Adam4Adam's registration form requires users to give their email address. On our join form, required fields are marked. 
Adam4Adam will never share e-mail addresses with third party organizations without your express permission. 
</p><p><b>Control of Your Password</b><br>
<b>Do not disclose</b> your password to any third parties nor share it with any third parties. If you lose control of your password, you may lose control over your personal information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately change your password. To change your password you can do so at any time through the MY ACCOUNT page then click <a href="http://www.adam4adam.com/?section=61">Change Password</a>.

</p><p><b>Order Forms </b><br>
  When purchasing products or services on the Adam4Adam site, you're asked for credit card, billing, and shipping information. This information is transmitted using a secure, encrypted form. You can see that the transaction is secure from the fact that the URL begins with the secure address https:// and we ensure encryption through the use of standard SSL encryption technologies. 
</p><p>This credit card information is gathered to bill customers for services purchased. Only billing vendors have access to financial information and only for the purpose of billing customers. At times Adam4Adam may refer users to other Web sites to purchase products or services. User activity on those sites is covered by the privacy policies on those sites.
<!-- <p><b>Online Surveys </b><br>
  At times Adam4Adam may run online surveys asking for specific contact or demographic information. These surveys are always optional. At times Adam4Adam may share both the results of, and individual entries in, surveys with the sponsors of the survey. Results of surveys may be shared with partners and advertisers on an aggregate basis.
<p><b>Contests </b><br>
  At times Adam4Adam may run contests on the Site where we ask for contact or demographic information. These contests are always optional. At times Adam4Adam may share both the results of, and individual entries in, contests with the sponsors of the contests. Results of contests may be shared with partners and advertisers on an aggregate basis. -->
</p><p><b>Community Tools </b><br>
  Adam4Adam provides many venues for member interaction and community. In some cases use of such tools (e.g., chat rooms) may reveal a user's member name or e-mail address and may permit users to publish certain personal information on the Adam4Adam Site. In all cases, users affirmatively choose to expose or place this information in public areas (e.g. profile page) of the Adam4Adam Site, and thereby agree that such information may be viewed by or forwarded to anyone. Users who do not want this information to be publicly available should not post in public areas of the Adam4Adam Site. 

</p><p><b>Adam4Adam Profiles and ProAds</b><br>
  Adam4Adam permits users to submit adult-oriented personal information for use in the Adam4Adam Profile and ProAd services. This information is also stored for the purposes of member self-publishing and interaction and to customize the user's Adam4Adam site experience. By registering for Adam4Adam Profiles or ProAd and submitting your user information, you understand that the information provided in the profie or ProAd, including your photograph, may be forwarded by members to other members and to persons who are not members.  Adam4Adam will not knowingly collect Profile or ProAd information from those under the age of 18. 
</p><p><b>Member Feedback </b><br>
  Adam4Adam stores feedback members send to us. This feedback is used to administer and refine the Adam4Adam Site and associated services and at times may be shared with Adam4Adam partners either in aggregate form or individually with specific identifying characteristics about the Member (e.g., e-mail address or name) removed.
</p><p><b>IP Addresses </b><br>
  Adam4Adam tracks individual IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our service, to administer our site and to gather broad demographic information. User IP address information is used only for our internal purposes. 

</p><p><b>ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURE SCENARIOS </b><br>
  Notwithstanding anything else in this policy, Adam4Adam may also disclose personal and aggregate information when required by a valid legal mechanism such as a search warrant, subpoena, or court order, or when we deem it necessary, in our sole discretion, to protect our rights and the safety of others, or our members, employees, or properties.
</p><p>Adam4Adam believes that members' private communications in chat rooms, e-mail, and instant message-like conversations should generally remain confidential. Adam4Adam does not disclose private communications unless ordered to do so through a valid legal mechanism such as a search warrant, subpoena, or court order, to protect the company's rights and property, or during emergencies when we believe safety is at risk. Please remember that what you write or post in public areas such as chat rooms and message boards is available to all Adam4Adam members, and in many cases other visitors to the Adam4Adam site. Also keep in mind that Adam4Adam is not responsible for what other users may do with private communications you've had with them. While chat and instant message-like conversations pass through Adam4Adam's servers, we do not store logs of these conversations.
</p><p>Adam4Adam reserves the right to share some or all of your personal information with its parent company, subsidiaries, joint ventures or other companies under common control with Adam4Adam, in which case Adam4Adam will require such entities to honor this privacy policy. If Adam4Adam is acquired by another company, that company will obtain the member information collected by Adam4Adam and will assume the rights and obligations set forth in this privacy policy regarding that information.
</p><p><b>OFF-SITE LINKS </b><br>
  Adam4Adam provides links to other sites. Adam4Adam is not responsible for the privacy practices or contents of these other sites.
<!-- </p><p><b>SYNDICATED ADAM4ADAM CONTENT </b><br>
Adam4Adam may syndicate its content to and distribute its content through other sites on the Internet. Although you may see the Adam4Adam logo on such other sites, your activity on such other sites is governed by the privacy statement on the site you are visiting.  -->
</p><p><b>OPT-OUT </b><br>
  Our site provides users the opportunity upon registration to opt out of receiving communications from us and from our partners, affiliates, and advertisers. These options are available during registration, and through the notification setting on the <a href="http://www.adam4adam.com/?section=35">MY ACCOUNT</a> page. Please note that even if you have chosen to opt out of receiving communications from us, we reserve the right to contact you by e-mail about material changes to this privacy policy or the Adam4Adam User Agreement.
