# Privacy Policy | Anxiety and Depression Association of America, ADAA

We are committed to protecting your privacy.

To make your experience at our website more convenient, we gather information from you. We maintain the privacy of your information using security technologies and adhere to policies that prevent unauthorized use of your personal information.

### What personal information do we collect, and how is it used?

We collect information on which portions of our website our visitors access or visit. We also collect information volunteered by visitors, such as e-newsletter registration or requests for information. Any personal information we collect is used for internal review and is either discarded or used by us to contact consumers for purposes such as those described below. We keep confidential all personal information entered during registration.

When we do collect personally identifiable information, it is always voluntarily submitted by you (e.g., when you fill out the registration page or send us feedback). The information collected is used to send our users e-mail reminders and other information we think will be of interest. If, for any reason, you would like to be removed from our e-mail list, you can unsubscribe by visiting the registration section of our website and clicking the unsubscribe button, or you can opt-out of future mailings by stating this desire in a reply to any e-mail we send you.

We may also monitor and track information such as the member-usage patterns of our website. We compile this information into a statistical aggregate that we use, together with your personal information, for internal business and administrative purposes, including improving our website, our operations, and our client service.

### Protecting your privacy

As part of our commitment to ensuring the privacy of our users, we do not sell or exchange names or any other personally identifiable information about our online network members with, for example, mass marketers. We keep confidential any personal information entered during registration, although we may share aggregate information about website usage and traffic patterns, stripped of any personally identifiable information, to third parties to comply with various reporting obligations and for business or marketing purposes. We may also share limited personally identifiable information with third parties on a confidential basis to enable a third party to perform certain tasks, such as maintain an e-mail list or send e-mail alerts and newsletters, on our behalf.

### Use of cookies

Cookies are pieces of information that are stored on your computer and are used for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies to make visiting and using our website easier. Cookies can help us see which parts of our website are the most or least popular and they provide direction to improve our users' online experience.

### Links to other sites

This website provides links to other websites. While we make efforts to choose our links carefully, we cannot take any responsibility for the content of linked websites or for the privacy policies of any linked websites. Because we do not control these websites, we encourage you to review the privacy policies posted on these third-party websites prior to any use.
