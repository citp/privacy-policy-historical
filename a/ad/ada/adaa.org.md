Specifically, we may use your personal information:

We keep all information you provide confidential to ADAA, with the exception of event registration information as provided above. As part of our commitment to ensuring the privacy of our users, we do not sell or exchange names or any other personally identifiable information about our users and members with, for example, mass marketers. We keep confidential any personal information entered during registration, although we may share aggregate information about website usage and traffic patterns, stripped of any personally identifiable information, to third parties to comply with various reporting obligations and for business or marketing purposes. We may also share limited personally identifiable information with third parties on a confidential basis to enable a third party to perform certain tasks, such as maintain an e-mail list or send e-mail alerts and newsletters, on our behalf. When we do so, we use reasonable efforts to assure that they comply with our privacy policy and applicable laws.

### **Mailing Lists and Newsletters**

We use your personal information to send you e-newsletters and program updates. These include helpful resources, articles, stories from our communities, fundraising initiatives, new webinars, blog posts and treatment/research news from the ADAA professional community. You may subscribe to email and newsletter lists in various places on our site and, in some cases,  you will be subscribed to email lists based on other activities, such as membership or event registration. 

We may use a third-party provider to deliver our email content. We gather statistics around email opening and clicks using industry standard technologies to help us monitor and improve our e-newsletter and to improve on our communications marketing approaches to better suit your needs.

For more information on our current third-party service provider, please see [Constant Contact's privacy notice](https://www.constantcontact.com/legal/privacy-statement). Your email address will be stored in Constant Contact's database for as long as we continue to use their services for email marketing or until you specifically request removal from the list. You are legally entitled to inform us at any time if you no longer wish to receive these newsletters and may do so by emailing us at [information@adaa.org ](mailto:information@adaa.org)or you may [unsubscribe](https://www.constantcontact.com/legal/privacy-statement#choice) yourself). We do not rent or trade email lists with other organizations and businesses. 

We will not, without your expressed consent, provide your personal information to any third parties for the purpose of direct marketing.
