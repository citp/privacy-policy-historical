#### Cookies:

A cookie is a small text file that certain Web sites write to your computer's hard drive when you visit such sites. A cookie file can contain information, such as a user identification code, that the site uses to track the pages you have visited, but the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. If your browser is configured to accept cookies, our site and/or our server provider, WebSideStory will write one to your hard drive. We may collect personally identifiable information from your web sessions by using cookies, to determine, for example, user traffic patterns, and the effectiveness of our navigational structure. 

We also use pixels, or transparent GIF files, provided by our service provider, WebSideStory, to report activity on our site. These files enable our service provider to recognize a cookie on your web browser, which in turn enables us to learn which pages are the most effective.
