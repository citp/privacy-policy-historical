# Privacy Policy | ADAPT Network

ADAPT Network (https://www.adaptnetwork.com) is governed by the following privacy policy.

We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it. The purpose of this privacy policy is to inform you what personal data we may collect and how it may be used.

## What is personal data?

Personal data is as defined in the General Data Protection Regulation 2018 and any successor legislation. This includes any information which, either alone or in combination with other information we hold about you, identifies you as an individual, including, for example, your name, postal address, email address and telephone number.

## We collect personal data for the following purposes and using the following services:

###  __Analytics

Like many websites, we use Google Analytics and other providers to monitor traffic to our website and analyse our audience. These services use IP addresses and other information from cookies to tell us, for example, the number of page views, number of users, what browsers users are using and location data of users. This statistical information allows us to understand our audiences, develop and customise our website and services, maximise compatibility for most of our users, and determine how much to charge for advertising.

More information about how Google Analytics uses this data can be found [here](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites).

For information about how you can opt-out of Google Analytics tracking, see our “consent for cookies” section below.

###  __Comments

We use Disqus to run the comments system on our website. When you leave a comment on our website we collect the data shown in the comments form. If you have a Disqus account, you can adjust and delete this information at any time from your [Disqus account dashboard](https://disqus.com/). Disqus may use your IP address and other information from cookies to personalise ads served within the comments section of our website.

More information about how Disqus uses this data and how you can opt-out of Disqus tracking can be found [here](https://disqus.com/data-sharing-settings/).

###  __Newsletters

When you sign up to one of our newsletters we collect and store the data shown in the signup form. This includes your name and email address. We use this information to send you our email updates and newsletters.

We use MailChimp to manage our email lists and to deliver our email updates and newsletters. Please refer to [MailChimp’s privacy policy](https://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/) for further information.

The newsletters sent may contain tracking pixels. The pixel is embedded in emails and allows an analysis of the success of online marketing campaigns. Because of these tracking pixels, we may see if and when you open an email and which links within the email you click. We use this information to adapt the content of future newsletters to the interests of the user.

To unsubscribe from one of our newsletters, please click the unsubscribe link at the bottom of the email.

###  __Contact and other forms

When you fill out and submit a contact form or another type of form, e.g. to enter a competition or to purchase a product, on our website, we collect the data shown in the form. This will normally include information about yourself (such as your name or date of birth) and contact details (such as your address, email address or telephone number). We use this data to reply to contact messages, facilitate competitions and to deliver items or services that you have purchased.

###  __Social widgets

Our social widgets use cookies to monitor and analyse when and where our content is shared on social media. We use Po.st to provide this service.

More information about how Po.st uses this data can be found [here](https://www.rhythmone.com/privacy-policy).

###  __Advertising

We show you ads on our website so that we can keep it free-of-charge to use. Cookies help to make these ads relevant and interesting to you. If you do not allow cookies, you will still see ads; just less personalised to you.

Ads on our website are served by a number of third-party providers, including Double Click (Google) and other vendors who have signed up to the IAB Transparency and Consent Framework.

These providers will drop their own cookies on our website which allows them to deliver ads and make ads more relevant to you (e.g. if you use our website from outside the UK, you may get ads from your local country). Cookies are also used to monitor the performance and effectiveness of the ad served. Some of our providers may use other third parties to perform this monitoring function.

Find out more information about our providers below:

Double Click – [adssettings.google.com](https://adssettings.google.com/)

Multiple vendors on the IAB Framework, including AppNexus, Open X, Index Exchange – [advertisingconsent.eu/transparency-consent-framework-global-vendor-list](http://advertisingconsent.eu/transparency-consent-framework-global-vendor-list/)

For information about how you can opt-out of third-party advertising cookies, see our “consent for cookies” section below.

Affiliate Program Participation – At ADAPT Network, we pride ourselves on our independent gear and product reviews. When you buy products we write about (or make purchases after clicking on a product we’ve reviewed), we may earn an affiliate commission that helps pay for our work. If you click on a link for an affiliate partnership, a cookie will be placed on your browser to track any sales for purposes of commissions. It is our goal to make the buying experience as seamless as possible, so we’ll be choosing affiliate partners on a case-by-case basis as we uncover the best deals and prioritise the most straightforward shopping experience. That said, there is no guarantee any link represents the current best price for a product.

## Who we share your data with

If you enter a competition or purchase a product from us, we may share your details with partners and suppliers for the purposes of delivering the competition prize or purchased product to you on our behalf (for example, the use of a courier to deliver products to you). When we use third party service providers, we only share the personal data that allows them to provide their services to us or to facilitate them providing their services to you.

We never share personal information without your consent. We never sell, distribute or lease your personal information to third parties.

Please see the Terms & Conditions of the particular competition/promotion for full details.
