Effective Date of Current Privacy Policy: December 2006

We Share Your Concerns About Safeguarding Personal Information

  


PHE, Inc. is the parent company of Adam & Eve. PHE, Inc. (referred to later as "PHE," "AdamEve.com," "we," "us") fully understands the need to protect your personal information while online and has developed this policy as a means to provide you with the utmost privacy possible. This Privacy Policy (referred to later as "Policy") describes our practices regarding the collection and use of information throughout our website, located at www.adameve.com (referred to later as the "Site"). By using the Site or obtaining any product or service through this Site, you agree the limited collection and use of information as outlined in this Policy. If you do not agree to this Policy, please do not use the Site.

We may from time to time update this Policy to reflect changing technology and other factors. We will notify you of changes to the Policy by posting the updated Policy on this page. We ask that you bookmark and periodically review this page to ensure that you remain familiar with the most current version of the Policy. You can determine when this Policy was last revised by checking the "Effective Date of Current Policy" legend at the top of the Policy.

  
  
AdamEve.com collects two basic types of information during your visits to our Site.

First, we collect non-personally identifiable information. This is general information that cannot be traced to individuals and contains no personalized data, think of it as a simple census form. When visitors come to our Site, we collect and aggregate information indicating, among other things, which pages of the Site were visited, the order in which they were visited and which links on the site were clicked by visitors. Collecting such information involves logging the IP addresses, operating system and browser software used by each visitor to the Site. Although such information is not personally identifiable, it may be possible to determine from an IP address a visitor’s Internet Service Provider and the general geographic location of the visitor’s point of connectivity. We then use this information in making modifications and improvements to the site to provide you the user with both a smoother and more efficient shopping experience. 

We also use non-invasive "cookies" and other tracking technologies to collect non-personally identifiable information which we then use to provide you with an easier shopping experience. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser. These cookies do not track other websites you might visit and they do not plant malware on your computer. Our non-invasive cookies simply make it possible for us to recognize your browser once you visit our Site. By doing this, we can personalize your return visits and save you time during checkout. Your browser must be set to accept cookies in order for you to enjoy the benefits of being a registered user of the Site. If you are uncomfortable with the cookies on your computer, you can always remove them by accessing the options menu of your browser. Please refer to your browser’s help menu for more specific directions if needed.

Second, we collect personally identifiable information as needed to provide you with requested services and to process any order you might place. In general, our Site uses an order form, a registration form and a catalog request form so that you can request information, products and services from us. These forms require that you provide us with personally identifiable information, such as your name, email address, physical address, telephone number, and credit card number, to receive the requested service. 

Further, when you use the Site to purchase a product or service as a gift, we will collect from you personally identifiable information regarding the gift recipient or potential gift recipient so that we can deliver the gift to them if requested.

Please take some time to familiarize yourself with the different ways that Adameve.com uses the information that we gather. Keep in mind that, while we encourage all third parties involved in running our business to adhere to our policies regarding the privacy of our visitors and to handle personally identifiable information in a responsible manner, we cannot and do not assume any responsibility for any actions or omissions of third parties, including the manner in which they use information received either from Adameve.com or independently.

Adameve.com uses non-personally identifiable information, such as your IP address and the pages that you visit on our Site, to help diagnose problems with our servers and to administer our Site and improve Site-related services and features. Your IP address and other non-personally identifiable information also may be used to gather broad demographic information and to recognize customer traffic patterns and Site usage trends. This information aids us in merchandising and in developing the design and layout of the Site.

We also might share aggregated statistical data and other non-personally identifiable information with our current and potential business partners, and with our service providers to help them provide similar services.

Adameve.com uses personally identifiable information collected from you to complete transactions initiated by you, particularly the sale and delivery of products and services. Your personally identifiable information is also used to get in touch with you when necessary regarding questions about any order you might place. We may also use personally identifiable information to contact you to make sure you are satisfied with our goods and services or to find out how we can serve you better. Your decision to participate in any survey or questionnaire about this is completely voluntary. Further, we may use personally identifiable information to conduct in-depth marketing research regarding our customers and potential customers.

Financial information (credit card numbers, credit card expiration dates, billing address, and so forth) is used solely to bill you for products and services and we make every effort to keep your information secure from theft or fraud.

You may, from time to time, receive information from us regarding new features, new products and services and special offers we think you'll find valuable. Also, while we won't share your email address with other companies, we may rent, sell or exchange your postal mailing address and information about your transactions with businesses that we believe to be reputable and that can provide you with offers and information that we think will be of interest to you. If you'd like to opt out of receiving future mailings from Adameve.com, or if you would like to opt out of Adameve.com providing your postal mailing address to third parties, please follow the procedure outlined in the Choice/Opt-out section below.

Adameve.com also may use your personally identifiable information to "pre-populate" forms that are used by the Site to facilitate transactions with us and save you from entering every data field on the checkout.

Special instances when we might use personally identifiable information are discussed below.

As noted above, we collect personally identifiable information regarding gift recipients and people to whom you may wish to give gifts in the future. This is done in order to accommodate proper gift delivery to such recipients and remind you of upcoming gift-giving occasions. We do not sell or rent any personally identifiable information that you provide to us regarding such persons, but gift recipients may, from time to time, receive offers from us via postal mailings regarding new features, new products and services and special offers we think they will find of interest. Also we may send marketing offers via postal mailings to gift recipients on behalf of ourselves and our business partners. In connection with such offers, we allow gift recipients to opt out of receiving future marketing-related postal mailings from us, as discussed in the section below.

This site is secure from others stealing your creditcard information. Your credit card and personal information are code-encrypted for security. 

  * How can you tell if the order is secure? 

It's easy. Check the on-line ordering form before submitting sensitive information. 

If you use a Netscape browser,look at the bottom left-hand corner of the screen for a little key icon (examples: Mac/ PC). If the key is solid, not broken, your order information is secure. If it's broken, you are on a page that is not secure and you should not enter sensitive information on that page. 

For Internet Explorer users, a small padlock appears in the lower right-hand corner of the web browser window (examples: Mac/ PC). If the padlock is locked, not open, your order information issecure. If it's open, then you are on a page that is not secure, and you shouldn't enter sensitive information on that page. 

There's a couple of other ways for you to check and see if the information you're about to transfer is on a secure connection. Make sure and look for the Paymentech seal (right) on our checkout pages. While you can't click on it here, clicking on it before sending your credit card information will show you Paymentech's guarantee that your information will be secure. 

Another option to test the security of your browseris to right-click (Windows), or click and hold (Macintosh), and select Properties (Internet Explorer) or "View Info"(Netscape) to see more information about the page and its security. Click here to see an example from Internet Explorer as to what you should look for to verify that a page is secure. 

Remember this: pages which do not ask you to enter and send information will likely not be secure, so be sure you are on an 'order information' page before checking. It's alwaysa good idea to check for the whole key or closed padlock before you hit the button on the screen that says 'send' or 'submit.' 

  * Shopping On The Internet: Fact & Fantasy 

Shop with confidence. Your personal information will not be read by anyone else. 

For many customers, one of the greatest fears about shopping on the Internet is having your credit card number stolen and credit rating ruined with unauthorized purchases. 

This fear is a myth. 

Shopping directly on the Internet is a new way ofdoing business. It's easy to fear the unknown, especially when it comes to your money. 

But how about these situations? 

    1. A crook finds credit card receipt carbons in astore trash can, uses the numbers and then sells them to another crook, who uses the numbers and resells them to another crook who resells them. 
    2. You hand your credit card to a waiter in a restaurant, who then leaves with it to prepare your bill. Or is he calling in his order to another catalog company? 
    3. You dial up your cellular or cordless phone to order shoes from a catalog, and your next door neighbor picks up your information on her baby monitor? 

All of the above (and other scenarios) happen everyday. They illustrate a point. All the talk about 'Internet security' is blown out of proportion. How often do you hear about the anxiety of using your credit card in a restaurant? Or about the danger of allowing a hotel front-desk clerk to confirm your room? 

  * Why all the fuss about the security risks of shopping on the Internet?

As far as we know, not a single dollar has been lost to electronic theft of a credit card over the Internet. Compare that with the millions lost every year just in conventional credit card fraud, and you'll wonder what all the fuss is about. 




> When you shop on-line with a merchant who offers a Secure Server, all the information you give (name, address,credit card number) is encrypted. That means your information goes out as code. If a hacker could get it, it would likely be gibberish. Your credit card never leaves your hand, it is never picked up by monitors or scanners, and receipts are never found in a trash can.

  * Why should you practice safe sex? 

Safe sex is about saving your life, or the life of your partner. 

Because of AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome), everyone should know about safer sex. HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus -- the precursor to the AIDS virus) can infect anyone, regardless of sexual orientation, sex, age, race, or economic class. While the occurrence of AIDS is much higher in some groups than in others, it is not WHO you are that can give you AIDS, but what you DO.

Safe Sex Is:

\- Total abstinence from sex with other people.   
\- A monogamous relationship.   
\- The use of condoms. 

If you say:

'I only intend to sleep with healthy people so I don't need to use condoms.' 

You should know:

You can't tell just by looking at somebody whether they have HIV or any other sexually transmitted disease. It can be unwise to believe everything that a new partner says about their sex life. One doesn't know whether one is infected unless they had an HIV test more than 3 months ago and have not had sex, or have practiced safer sex since. (Don't forget the risks from sharing needles as well.) 

If you say:

'When I've been drinking I can't be bothered using condoms.'

You should know:

Drinking or not, you can still carry condoms with you. Certainly it is more difficult to think logically when you've been drinking. Keep in mind: 'Only have sex using condoms.' 

If you say:

'I hate condoms. I lose my hard-on when I use them.'

You should know:

This is a common fear for many men. How about finding time to practice on your own with condoms, and try different varieties to find one that suits you? Some other good ideas worth trying are putting on the condom with the help of your partner. 

If you say:

'It feels wrong to be using them with my partner. It's too late to start now.'

You should know:

It's never too late to start using condoms, and safe sex is one way to show that you care about each other.
