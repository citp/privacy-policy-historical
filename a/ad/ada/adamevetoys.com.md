## Safeguarding Your Personal Privacy

Adam & Eve takes your personal privacy extremely seriously. Our company was founded to help protect your privacy, and we’ve gone to court on multiple occasions to defend that right.

We take extra care to safeguard your privacy from the second you land on our homepage to the moment your order arrives at your front door. Here’s just a few of our special measures:

**The Strongest Possible Computer Defenses**  
Adam and Eve has comprehensive, companywide standards for maintaining the privacy and safety of your personal and billing information. While we can’t go into explicit details, our safeguards include multi-layered firewalls and virus scans, secured servers, mandatory password changes, and the very latest in computer encryption.

**Anonymous Shipping**  
All of our products are shipped as anonymously as possible. Depending on your order, you might receive a plain brown box or a tan business envelope lined with bubble wrap. Because Adam & Eve is a very recognized name, we use an alias on the return address label to protect your privacy.

**Discreet Billing**  
Our efforts to ensure your privacy even extends to your credit card statement. Our name will never appear in your billing statement. Instead, your order will be listed simply as Adam Mail.

## Adam & Eve’s Privacy Policy

Effective Date of Current Policy: December 2006

PHE, Inc. is the parent company of Adam & Eve. PHE, Inc. (referred to later as "PHE," "AdamEve.com," "we," "us") fully understands the need to protect your personal information while online and has developed this policy as a means to provide you with the utmost privacy possible. This Privacy Policy (referred to later as "Policy") describes our practices regarding the collection and use of information throughout our website, located at www.adameve.com (referred to later as the "Site"). By using the Site or obtaining any product or service through this Site, you agree the limited collection and use of information as outlined in this Policy. If you do not agree to this Policy, please do not use the Site.

We may from time to time update this Policy to reflect changing technology and other factors. We will notify you of changes to the Policy by posting the updated Policy on this page. We ask that you bookmark and periodically review this page to ensure that you remain familiar with the most current version of the Policy. You can determine when this Policy was last revised by checking the "Effective Date of Current Policy" legend at the top of the Policy.

**AdamEve.com collects two basic types of information during your visits to our Site.**

First, we collect non-personally identifiable information. This is general information that cannot be traced to individuals and contains no personalized data, think of it as a simple census form. When visitors come to our Site, we collect and aggregate information indicating, among other things, which pages of the Site were visited, the order in which they were visited and which links on the site were clicked by visitors. Collecting such information involves logging the IP addresses, operating system and browser software used by each visitor to the Site. Although such information is not personally identifiable, it may be possible to determine from an IP address a visitor’s Internet Service Provider and the general geographic location of the visitor’s point of connectivity. We then use this information in making modifications and improvements to the site to provide you the user with both a smoother and more efficient shopping experience.

We also use non-invasive "cookies" and other tracking technologies to collect non-personally identifiable information which we then use to provide you with an easier shopping experience. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser. These cookies do not track other websites you might visit and they do not plant malware on your computer. Our non-invasive cookies simply make it possible for us to recognize your browser once you visit our Site. By doing this, we can personalize your return visits and save you time during checkout. Your browser must be set to accept cookies in order for you to enjoy the benefits of being a registered user of the Site. If you are uncomfortable with the cookies on your computer, you can always remove them by accessing the options menu of your browser. Please refer to your browser’s help menu for more specific directions if needed.

Second, we collect personally identifiable information as needed to provide you with requested services and to process any order you might place. In general, our Site uses an order form, a registration form and a catalog request form so that you can request information, products and services from us. These forms require that you provide us with personally identifiable information, such as your name, email address, physical address, telephone number, and credit card number, to receive the requested service.

Further, when you use the Site to purchase a product or service as a gift, we will collect from you personally identifiable information regarding the gift recipient or potential gift recipient so that we can deliver the gift to them if requested.

Please take some time to familiarize yourself with the different ways that Adameve.com uses the information that we gather. Keep in mind that, while we encourage all third parties involved in running our business to adhere to our policies regarding the privacy of our visitors and to handle personally identifiable information in a responsible manner, we cannot and do not assume any responsibility for any actions or omissions of third parties, including the manner in which they use information received either from Adameve.com or independently.

**Non-personally identifiable information**

Adameve.com uses non-personally identifiable information, such as your IP address and the pages that you visit on our Site, to help diagnose problems with our servers and to administer our Site and improve Site-related services and features. Your IP address and other non-personally identifiable information also may be used to gather broad demographic information and to recognize customer traffic patterns and Site usage trends. This information aids us in merchandising and in developing the design and layout of the Site.

We also might share aggregated statistical data and other non-personally identifiable information with our current and potential business partners, and with our service providers to help them provide similar services.

**Personally identifiable information**

Adameve.com uses personally identifiable information collected from you to complete transactions initiated by you, particularly the sale and delivery of products and services. Your personally identifiable information is also used to get in touch with you when necessary regarding questions about any order you might place. We may also use personally identifiable information to contact you to make sure you are satisfied with our goods and services or to find out how we can serve you better. Your decision to participate in any survey or questionnaire about this is completely voluntary. Further, we may use personally identifiable information to conduct in-depth marketing research regarding our customers and potential customers.

Financial information (credit card numbers, credit card expiration dates, billing address, and so forth) is used solely to bill you for products and services and we make every effort to keep your information secure from theft or fraud.

You may, from time to time, receive information from us regarding new features, new products and services and special offers we think you'll find valuable. Also, while we won't share your email address with other companies, we may rent, sell or exchange your postal mailing address and information about your transactions with businesses that we believe to be reputable and that can provide you with offers and information that we think will be of interest to you. If you'd like to opt out of receiving future mailings from Adameve.com, or if you would like to opt out of Adameve.com providing your postal mailing address to third parties, please follow the procedure outlined in the Choice/Opt-out section below.

Adameve.com also may use your personally identifiable information to "pre-populate" forms that are used by the Site to facilitate transactions with us and save you from entering every data field on the checkout.

Special instances when we might use personally identifiable information are discussed below.

**Gift Recipients**

As noted above, we collect personally identifiable information regarding gift recipients and people to whom you may wish to give gifts in the future. This is done in order to accommodate proper gift delivery to such recipients and remind you of upcoming gift-giving occasions. We do not sell or rent any personally identifiable information that you provide to us regarding such persons, but gift recipients may, from time to time, receive offers from us via postal mailings regarding new features, new products and services and special offers we think they will find of interest. Also we may send marketing offers via postal mailings to gift recipients on behalf of ourselves and our business partners. In connection with such offers, we allow gift recipients to opt out of receiving future marketing-related postal mailings from us, as discussed in the section below.

**Service Providers**

We work with third parties who provide services, including but not limited to website hosting, order processing and fulfillment, credit card clearance, e-commerce affiliation, data analysis, emailing and other services of an administrative nature. Personally identifiable information, including financial information, is shared with such third parties for the purpose of providing such services and is limited to the intended purpose only.

Further, we may use selected reputable third parties for marketing, targeting and analysis purposes. Some of these third parties may be given access to some, or all, of the information that you provide to us and may use cookies or other tracking technologies in connection with providing their services. To the extent that we provide your personally identifiable information to such third parties, we restrict their ability to use such information for their own marketing purposes to the best of our abilities; however, we cannot be responsible for the privacy policies or practices of such third parties. One of these service providers is Coremetrics; for more information regarding Coremetrics’ privacy practices, [click here](http://www.coremetrics.com/company/privacy.php).

We do not disclose an individual customer's personally identifiable information to third parties for third-party direct marketing purposes if we have received and processed a request from that customer not to have his or her personal information shared for this purpose. You may submit this type of opt-out request by email or to the following mailing address: Customer Service, Adam & Eve., PO Box 800, Carrboro, NC 27510.

## Making Sure Your Order is Secure

Adam & Eve’s computer experts make every possible effort to protect your credit card information and personal data by following the some of the strictest security standards in the industry to prevent hacking. All of your credit card and personal information is code-encrypted using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. SSL works by creating a secure link between your computer and ours so only Adam & Eve can decode your personal information.

As an extra level of security, Adam & Eve employs outside companies, such as VeriSign and TrustWave, to regularly test our site and examine our security policies to make sure we’re doing all we can to protect your personal information.

There are several things you can do to ensure you have a safe and secure connection. The easiest thing to do is simply check the address bar of your internet browser.

Internet Explorer users should look for a lock next to the web page address. If the lock is closed, then the site is secure and safe. If the lock is open, then the page is not secure and you should not enter any sensitive information.

Chrome users need to check for a lock next to the web page address. If the lock is green, then the site is safe. If the lock is red, then it is not secure.

Firefox users can look at the icon next to the web page address. If the icon is blue, then the site is safe. If there is no color, then the site is not secure. You can also click on the icon for additional information on the security of the site.

If you’re still worried about the security of the site, there are a few other steps you can take. Look for the Paymentech seal on our checkout pages. You can click on the seal for Paymentech’s guarantee that your information will be secure. Another option is to check the actual address of the site. Secure web pages should begin “https:” while non-secure sites use a regular “http:”
