**Last Updated: 05/9/2017**

Adaptive Insights, Inc., (“Adaptive”, “Adaptive Insights”) has created this Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) to describe how we collect, use and disclose the information that we obtain from our users through the Adaptive Insights website(s) (the “Site”), [www.adaptiveinsights.com](http://www.adaptiveinsights.com/), and the data we collect through the services we provide (“Services”) to our customers (“Customers”), for which we are the data processor. This Policy also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information and how you can access and update this information. By visiting the Site and using any Adaptive Services, you signify your explicit consent to the terms and conditions of this Policy.

The use of information collected through our Services shall be limited to the purpose of providing the specific Service for which the Customers have engaged Adaptive Insights.

 **APEC Participation**

The Adaptive Insights privacy practices, described in this Policy, comply with the APEC Cross Border Privacy Rules System. The APEC CBPR system provides a framework for organizations to ensure protection of personal information transferred among participating APEC economies. More information about the APEC framework can be found [here](http://www.apec.org/Groups/Committee-on-Trade-and-Investment/~/media/Files/Groups/ECSG/CBPR/CBPR-PoliciesRulesGuidelines.ashx). The APEC certification does not apply to instances where we process data on behalf of clients for their benefit, such as when we act as a data processor.

 **EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield**

Adaptive Insights and its UK subsidiary company, Adaptive Insights Limited, participate in and have certified their compliance with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. Adaptive Insights is committed to subjecting all personal data received from European Union (EU) member countries and Switzerland, respectively, in reliance on each Privacy Shield Framework, to the Framework’s applicable Principles.

Adaptive Insights is responsible for the processing of personal data it receives, under each Privacy Shield Framework, and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. Adaptive Insights complies with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of personal data from the EU and Switzerland, including the onward transfer liability provisions.

With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Frameworks, Adaptive Insights is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain situations, Adaptive Insights may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
