# Privacy Statement

Privacy Statement 

Our Privacy Statement explains how we manage information obtained from you. Throughout this document, we have highlighted various terms and linked them to our Glossary or the relevant section of this website.

**Licensed Content**  
Our content is licensed to other organizations that make our content available to consumers. We are firmly committed to respecting the privacy of individuals, andany information that we gather is protected from misappropriation and misuse.

We collect certain types of user data, including anonymous aggregate data and anonymous individual data. Aggregate data describes all user data as a whole, rather than the data of specific individuals. Collected data may include topics that people view, browsers they used, time and length content is used, health risk assessment data, and similar types of data. This data may be used by us or our customers to understand what health information is used most frequently and how users are accessing the information.

In addition, some organizations that license our content provide login accounts to secure, personalized websites. We may provide these organizations with data that is specific to an individual login account, although we do not store personally identifiable information ourselves (such as names and phone numbers) and have no way of knowing who an individual user is. Consumers should review the privacy policies of the organizations from which they access our content to see how individual data may be used. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of organizations that have licensed our information.

**Opt-in**  
We may receive Personal Identifiable Information (PII) via forms located on thisweb site, or through purchasing a product through our online store.

This action may result in being contacted by someone in our sales, editorial or support teams.

Please select the "Contact A.D.A.M." link to find an alternative way to contact us.

We receive potential client PII via forms located on thisweb site. By using these forms you hereby agree to this privacy policy and "Opt- In", providing us with PII. Upon form completion, after clicking the “send” or “submit” button, your PII is sent to an A.D.A.M. Sales, Editorial or support associate via unsecured e-mail. We do not collect or ask for any specific information that warrants increased security and/or encryption. Contact and product information is collected to assist our professionals in informing potential clients of our product offerings. If the user is not interested in submitting information via the provided web form, they may contact us via regular mail, phone or fax.

The request and PII is reviewed and qualified. The PII is entered into either the Editorial Comments database that assists us in reviewing past or present comments or through a secure, third party application (Sales Contact Database) designed to track potential, current and past sales clients.

Using the A.D.A.M. Online Store, PII is submitted through placing an order, or a request more information. PII is submitted by the end user through the online form to process the order, is encrypted and sent to our third party vendor that processes the credit card, secures the payment and notifies us that the transaction was successful or denied. If successful, our secure order tracking system displays the order to select accounting, shipping personnel and select managers. The shipping associate fulfills the order for shipment, selects a shipping company (UPS, FedEx, or DHL), shipping method and securely submits the necessary information needed to ship the order.

We do not knowingly collect personal information from any person under the age of 13. We are committed to protecting the privacy of children, and this website is not designed or intended for children under the age of 13.
