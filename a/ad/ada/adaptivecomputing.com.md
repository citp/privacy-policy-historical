**How does Adaptive Computing collect personal information online?**  
Adaptive Computing collects personal information online through Web sites and other online resources. Adaptive Computing also offers online resources in collaboration with other online service providers, from which Adaptive Computing may receive personal information about users of such resources. These online collaborations are governed by agreements that require personal information to be protected appropriately. Individuals may access many parts of our Web sites and online resources without disclosing any personal information. There are two methods that Adaptive Computing uses to collect personal information online:

**1\. Information that you provide:** Adaptive Computing collects personal information and other data that you may enter into forms or data fields on our Web sites or online resources. Such information may include, but not be limited to, contact information (such as your name, postal address, e-mail address, telephone number, user ID and password), date of birth, professional credentials, experiences, activities, skills, preferences, hobbies and interests. 

**3\. Information collected from your computer or other electronic device:**

We collect information about your computer or other electronic device when you visit our Web sites and use our online resources. This information may include your Internet Protocol (IP) address, domain name, browser type, date and time of your request and information provided by tracking technologies, such as _cookies_ and _single-pixel tags._ If you use a mobile device to access our web sites and online resources, we also may collect information about your device, such as your device ID and device type, as well as usage information about your device and your use of our mobile Web sites and other mobile resources.

Our Web sites and other online resources use tracking technologies to provide additional functionality that enables you to use these resources more effectively. Adaptive Computing uses tracking technologies in ways that do not identify you personally, such as to track accurately numbers of users or referring sites or advertisements to our online resources, or to remember whether you have identified yourself as a health care professional or a resident of a particular country. Adaptive Computing may use other companies to deliver e-mail communications on our behalf or to place Adaptive Computing advertisements on other web sites. Adaptive Computing does not control the tracking technologies used by these other companies. If you want to limit anonymous data collection through tracking technologies, please refer to your _choices_ as described below.

In some cases, Adaptive Computing may use tracking technologies in ways that identify you personally, but only after you have entered personal information into a form or data field on our Web sites, or where we have registered you to use our online resources by providing a user ID and password based on information validated through other offline interactions with you. We may use tracking technologies to remember your personal preferences and selections, such as personal information that you have entered into data fields on our Web sites, answers that you have provided in response to our surveys, sections of our Web sites that you visit frequently, or to confirm whether you have read or clicked on certain e-mail communications we send to you so that we can make our communications more useful and interesting to you. 

You may choose whether or not you want Adaptive Computing to use tracking technologies to remember you when you visit our web sites, and/or to provide additional personalized services to you. If you want to limit data collection through tracking technologies, please refer to your _choices_ as described below.
