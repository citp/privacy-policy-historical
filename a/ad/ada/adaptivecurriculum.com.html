        <h2>WHAT INFORMATION IS COLLECTED</h2>
        <p>We consider the following to be examples of  personally-identifying information: they include but are not limited to your  first and last name, email address, home address, phone number, work number,  work address and certain other information to the extent they are linked with  your personally-identifying information.</p>
        <p> The information we learn from users helps us personalize and continually  improve your experience at <a href="http://www.adaptivecurriculum.com">www.adaptivecurriculum.com</a> in furtherance of serving the user's needs and our legitimate  business purposes. (For example, when the user requests a free trial, demo, or makes  an online purchase or enrolls in a marketing promotion, we need to retain  certain personally-identifying information on the Site in order to respond to  their request). A user's personally-identifying information may be used by our  company to help us improve the website, and also for our company's marketing  and promotional purposes. We receive and store any information you enter on  this Site or give us for these purpose only and not in any other way. You can  choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to  take advantage of many of our features. We use the information that you provide  for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing features for you,  and communicating with you. Except as specifically stated herein, our policy is  not to share this information with third parties, but we may share this  information with other companies within Sebit, LLC. We will never sell this  information to third-party marketing companies.</p>
        <h2>INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE</h2>
        <p>Information collected through this Site may be  supplied to affiliates of Sebit, LLC, and other companies and organizations who  perform work for us under contract or sell products or services that complement  our products and services. We also may disclose personally identifiable  information in the following situations: (a) in response to a subpoena, court  order or legal process, to the extent permitted and required by law; (b) to  protect user security or the security of other persons, consistent with  applicable laws; (c) in connection with a sale, joint venture or other transfer  to some or all of the assets of Sebit, LLC; or (d) in order to enforce the  Site's Terms of Use. We otherwise exercise commercially reasonable care to not  otherwise share or disclose the names of users or any personally identifiable  information with third parties, except with the prior approval of the user.</p>
        <h3> SPECIAL NOTICE TO PARENTS  AND CHILDREN</h3>
        <p> PARENTS: We encourage parents and guardians to  spend time online with their Children (Children 12 and under) and to  participate in the activities that may be offered on this Site. No  personally-identifying information should be submitted to or posted on this  Site by Children without the consent of their parent or guardian. We encourage  parents to monitor their Children's online use, and to help us protect their  privacy by instructing them never to provide personally-identifying information  on this Site or any other website without permission. We are also prohibited by  law from conditioning a Child's participation in any activity on this website  on the Child disclosing more personally-identifying information than is  reasonably necessary to participate in such activity.</p>
        <p> CHILDREN: Please do not give your full name,  email address, home address, telephone number or any other  personally-identifying information that would enable someone to contact you  either online or offline, without first asking your parent or guardian and  teacher for permission.</p>
        <p> We do not knowingly collect personally-identifying information from Children on  this Site either directly or passively except when a Child may voluntarily  submit such information through (i) a "<a href="mailto:info@adaptivecurriculum.com" target="_self">Contact Us</a>" link on a Child's area of this website or (ii) a public  posting area, if such feature is available. If a Child e-mails us via a "<a href="mailto:info@adaptivecurriculum.com">Contact  Us</a>" link on any child  directed area of this Site and we can identify the sender as a Child, any  personally-identifying information submitted will only be used to respond on a  one-time basis to such Child and will thereafter be deleted from our records.  In addition, if we have actual knowledge that a Child is sending or posting  personally-identifying information on any area of this Site, we will use  commercially reasonable efforts to delete such personally-identifying  information before it is made public. We will never request  personally-identifying information from a Child in any of our public postings  areas. Please note that any online store that may be accessed from the Site is  intended for parents, teachers and other adult purchasers over the age of 18  and requires the submission of personally-identifiable information to fulfill  and service any transactions.</p>
        <p> We may disclose a Child's personally-identifying information in special cases  when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to  identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing  injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) our  rights or property, other users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such  activities. We may also disclose a Child's personally-identifying information  when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.</p>
        <h3> PUBLIC POSTINGS</h3>
        <p> Users and especially Children should note that  any personally-identifying information that is voluntarily posted to any public  area of this website may always be collected and used by others. While we  monitor such posting areas from time to time and will use commercially  reasonable efforts to delete a Child's personally-identifying information prior  to posting, we strongly encourage Children not to post such information.</p>
