                <p>ADYOULIKE specializes in the diffusion (creation, programming) of native advertising respecting your user journey. You consume the content that you have come to look for before viewing the advertisement (remuneration source of the publisher sites) that is integrated in your navigation or in the contextual flow of the publisher site. Thus by the view of the advertisement, you allow the publisher site to be paid and to continue to present you with quality content.</p>

                <h3>WHY DO WE TARGET YOU?</h3>
                <h4>// Target</h4>
                <p>Our goal is to provide personalized, contextualized, targeted advertising based on the data collected and your recent browsing behavior while respecting your anonymity. Advertising is an integral part of your navigation, allowing you to discover advertising offers, products, videos, images, websites, like any other web content.</p>

                <h3>CONSENT OF THE USER</h3>
                <p>When consulting the ADYOULIKE website or the websites of its advertising partners, an information banner on these sites informs you of the deposit of advertising cookies and asks you to consent to them.
However, if you want ADYOULIKE to no longer drop an advertising cookie on the browser you are currently using, you can disable them here. This will prevent ADYOULIKE from collecting anonymous data but will not interrupt the ad serving.</p>
