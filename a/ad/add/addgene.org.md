Addgene collects the following types of information from you:

  * “Personal Information” - this can include your name, organization, email address, mailing address, principal investigator, field of study and phone number (optional).
  * “Technical Information” - this is non-personally identifiable information related to your interactions with our website, which can include internet domain and host names; Internet protocol addresses (“IP”) addresses; browser software and operating system types; dates and times; frequency and length of page visits, and site navigation. For purposes of this policy, this does **not** include scientific data relating to plasmids you may deposit with Addgene.
  * “Financial Information” - this can include purchase order and credit card* numbers.



*For security purposes, Addgene does not process nor store your credit card information. It never touches our servers and so is never seen by us. Instead, we use a payment gateway service called USAePay, a Level-1 PCI compliant company. [ Visit USAePay’s page](https://usaepay.info/about/security) for more information about service and security.

When you are requesting materials through Addgene, you will be prompted for your payment information. You can choose to pay by credit card or purchase order.

If you choose to pay by purchase order, you will enter in that information at “checkout.” If you choose to submit payment information later, we will follow up with you via email to obtain that information.




## Why does Addgene need that information?

  1. ### Why does Addgene need your Personal Information?

With regards to Personal Information collected during account creation, Addgene needs that information because it is necessary:

    1. to create the contract (the material transfer agreement) that governs the sharing of materials between your organization and the sharing organization(s). [View a template of one such contract here](https://media.addgene.org/cms/filer_public/60/0f/600f7aae-78c3-4970-a4b2-f3a7b5e28661/sample_request_mta_implementing_letter.pdf);

    2. to comply with legal obligations to which Addgene is subject, including our inability to ship to certain countries, entities and individuals pursuant to U.S. export control regulations; our inability to distribute materials to industry organizations pursuant to our contractual obligations; and our obligation to track, record and report material distributions to the applicable material rights holders; and

    3. to perform / carry out our mission as a nonprofit repository that helps scientists around the world by, amongst other things, serving as an archive for their scientific research materials, data, protocols and other research information.

With regards to Personal Information collected for specific purposes, such as our newsletter, ebooks, and blogs, we use this information:

    1. to enforce our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms-of-use/), with respect to your communications on our Site;

    2. to provide you with your requested access of the service (i.e., the newsletter, ebook); and

    3. to pursue our mission-based interests of developing educational and technical resources for specific scientific fields and users.

  2. ### Why does Addgene need Technical Information?

The Technical Information that we collect when you visit our website is necessary to support many of its basic features such as logged-in sessions. We also may occasionally use the Technical Information in the aggregate with similar information from other users in order to help us evaluate users’ experiences and improve our website.

  3. ### Why does Addgene need Financial Information?

We need payment assurance for the materials that you have requested. This can be in the form of verification from our payment gateway service or a verifiable, purchase order number. [Our Standard Terms of Purchase can be found here.](https://web.archive.org/shopping/terms-of-purchase/)




## How does Addgene use (or “process”) that information?

  1. ### How does Addgene process Personal Information?

Addgene processes Personal Information collected at account creation as follows:

    1. Contracts (Material Transfer Agreements “MTA”) \- The contractual components needed to execute an MTA between organizations sharing materials are the names of the scientists sharing materials, the names of the organizations, the names of the principal investigators (i.e., the heads of the labs in which materials are used/originate) (if different from the sharing scientists), and the addresses of the labs and organizations. 

    2. Export Controls \- Addgene checks your name, organization and country against various export control lists, provided by the U.S. government, to determine whether we can conduct business with you. 

    3. Contractual Restrictions \- Many of the materials deposited with Addgene may only be distributed to academic, nonprofit, research organizations. This is why we need to know what type of organization you are registering. 

    4. Records and Reporting \- Because Addgene facilitates the sharing of materials between organizations, these organizations rely on Addgene (via contract) to track, record and report materials and executed material transfer agreements on their behalf. Records of all material transfers are available to the sharing organizations’ administrative offices via their accounts and email; and reports of material transfers are delivered to the sharing organizations’ administrators’ emails. Additionally, Addgene tracks, records and reports your specific lab’s material transfers. These records are available in your Addgene account and reports are mailed to your email at a daily, monthly or yearly frequency of your choosing. 

    5. Archival and Scientific Purposes \- Since its inception, Addgene has been [dedicated](https://web.archive.org/mission/) to helping scientists share their materials. We are accomplishing this by operating a nonprofit, materials repository on behalf of the global, research community. Scientists looking to store, archive or share their materials can do so by depositing their materials with us ([see here for benefits of depositing](https://web.archive.org/deposit/)). Scientists looking for certain materials discussed in a publication or by the depositing scientist at a conference, for example, can search our database by the publication, scientist name or material characteristics. 

Addgene processes Personal Information collected for specific purposes as follows:

    1. Site Enforcement \- In the event that you choose to engage in inappropriate conduct on our Site, as discussed in our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms-of-use/), we will restrict, block or ban your access as we deem appropriate. 

    2. Access/Deliverables \- We will use your email address to send you notices of blog updates, electronic ebook copies and subsequent updates, newsletters etc., if you have chosen to opt-in to receive them. 

    3. Content Creation \- We will use your title and field of study, in an aggregated manner, to determine what type of content interests our users and the type of users we should be gearing content toward. 

  2. ### How does Addgene process Technical Information?

For information on how Addgene processes Technical Information, please see our Cookies Policy in response 2b.

  3. ### How does Addgene process Financial Information?

_Assuming that you have placed your order directly on Addgene’s website_ , Addgene can use your purchase order number to look up your order if/when you contact us. We will also use it to recoup payment from your organization.

Once we have payment assurance, this information is then processed through our financial accounting software, Celigo and Netsuite.




## Who else has access to that information?

  1. ### Who else has access to your Personal Information?

Pursuant to Addgene’s contractual and legal obligations, material transfer agreements and reports will be provided to your respective organizations, i.e., those sharing and receiving material. Additionally, reports of your specific materials-sharing activity will be provided to you and those whom you may designate.

Regarding physical delivery, Addgene’s couriers and other delivery agents, including USPS, FedEx, UPS, and World Courier, will have access to your name, organization and mailing address for the purposes of delivering any materials that you have requested. Additionally, Addgene works with local partners and distributors to help us facilitate the execution of material transfer agreements, the delivery of materials and the help of customer support. To the extent that your Personal Information is needed to execute contracts and deliver materials, our local partners and distributors will have access to that limited information. LGC Limited, in the UK, assists us in our customer support and outreach efforts. Beijing Zhongyuan (China), Summit Pharma. (Japan) and LeeHyo (Korea) each help us facilitate the execution of material transfer agreements and the delivery of materials in their respective countries.

However, neither Hubspot nor Zendesk engages those lists or widgets directly.

## How does Addgene protect that information?

We take the security of your personal information very seriously. Our website protects your personal information during transfer using encryption technologies such as Transport Level Security (TLS) and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). After transfer, your personal information is stored in a secure database with limited access. Addgene uses the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud to host our website and databases. AWS’ highly secure data centers provide multiple levels of security assurances. [ To learn more about AWS cloud security, please click here.](https://aws.amazon.com/security/)

After placing an order with us, your payment information, such as full credit card number or purchase order number, is no longer available on our website. Even users with your password cannot access this information.

**Some services, such as Addgene’s blog and help center are hosted through third party services. For more information about these services, see our Cookies Policy in response 2b.

## How long does Addgene need that information?

Pursuant to Addgene’s contractual obligations and Document Retention policies, any Personal Information that is collected for the purposes of executing a contract or fulfilling a legal obligation to which Addgene is subject to, will be held for the length of the contract or seven (7) years. Information collected for archival purposes in the interest of the scientific community will be retained and displayed indefinitely, unless you ask that it be removed. Addgene will strive to only collect that information needed for the preceding purposes. Any other information collected for any other purpose will be retained until such time that said other purpose is fulfilled or abandoned.

## What controls do Addgene’s users have in that information?

With regards to Personal Information collected during account creation, users can log into their accounts to update/correct their emails, organization, and reporting preferences. Users can also contact Addgene directly to update/correct any information that they have given to us. However, they are not permitted to affect change to any terms that are used for contractual purposes, without the express authorization of their organization. Similarly, because of the contractual obligations associated with the type of information collected, users can **only** request to deactivate their accounts. Deactivation will prohibit future sharing of materials by the user as well as stop the reports the user receives. Nonetheless, Addgene’s contractual obligations will remain to the respective organizations.

With regards to Personal Information collected for specific purposes, such as our newsletter, ebooks, and blogs, users can opt-out and remove themselves directly from many of these purposes by clicking “unsubscribe” from the respective newsletter, blog update, etc. Alternatively, users can, at any time, contact us directly at [blog@addgene.org](mailto:blog@addgene.org) or [help@addgene.org](mailto:help@addgene.org) to tell us specifically what things they would like to continue or discontinue. Addgene will also, upon request, provide the user with the information collected in a portable format.

With regards to Technical Information collected via cookies when you visit our website, you are free to remove these cookies at any time by deleting them in your browser as applicable. [ Please click here to learn more about cookies](https://www.aboutcookies.org/), including how to control, disable or delete them.
