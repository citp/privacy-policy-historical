### HOW WE COLLECT INFORMATION

  


#### How We Collect Information Directly

  
You can browse and read most of the NHM Platform without creating an account or revealing any personal information. On certain occasions when you interact with the NHM Platform, you may submit information such as your name and login information, email address, mailing address, phone number, comments, photos and videos, payment information when you make a purchase, and transaction information. Users may submit information of their own accord, or be asked to do so to participate in certain activities, such as: 

  * Registering as a site member
  * Signing up for free newsletter
  * Requesting a free download
  * Registering for free webinar
  * Posting an article comment
  * Contributing in discussion forums
  * Sharing a photo
  * Entering a sweepstakes or contest



NHM and the NHM Platform are based in the United States. If you voluntarily visit our Websites and provide personal information to us while located or residing in a country outside the United States, you understand that you are voluntarily agreeing to the use and processing of such information as provided in this Privacy Policy, including transfer of your information to the United States, a jurisdiction which may not offer the same framework for the protection of personal information as the jurisdiction in which you are located.

#### How We Use Cookies to Collect Some Information Automatically

NHM uses cookies and other tagging or tracking technologies that interact with your browser to increase our digital functionality and offer responsive elements based on your and other users’ actions (e.g., to store your preferences, password, or saved articles).

When you use the NHM Platform, we may automatically recognize information such as the following:

  * _Device Information:_ We may collect certain information about the device you use to access the Services, including but not limited to IP addresses for your devices, unique device identifiers, browser types and browser language. 
  * _User History:_ We may log certain usage information about your use of the Services, which may include a history of the pages you view. If you download and use any software application on your device, the log files will automatically be collected by the application and sent to our servers when your device syncs up for the latest content available.
  * _Mobile/Location Information:_ We may collect additional information from you if you access the Services through a mobile device, for example your unique device identifier, device’s operating system, mobile carrier, or location when you opt in for us to do so. However, the degree to which your location can be identified depends on the device you are using (e.g. laptop, smartphone, tablet) and how you are connected to the internet (e.g. via cable broadband connection, Wi-Fi, etc.). If you enable location services for the Services, we may collect regional location data periodically as you use or leave open the Services. We may also collect your location information from your IP address or zip code. We may also use location data internally or in conjunction with our third-party service providers to customize your experience and provide offers that may be relevant to you. Depending on the platform you use to access the Services (e.g., Apple™ iOS, Google™ Android, Windows, etc.) you may be able to control from within the settings on your wireless device whether location data is collected.



Some of the third-party service providers for the NHM Platform (e.g., analytics) may also use their own tracking technologies on our digital properties to help us run and optimize our platforms and serve advertising to you. These third parties may collect information about your online activities over time and across the NYPR Platform and other online properties.

#### Turning Off Tracking Technologies

You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a persistent or session cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off such cookies through your browser settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser’s Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies. Cookie management tools provided by your browser may not disable HTML5 storage. To learn more about HTML5 storage, see our Cookies Notice. It is important to remember that many of NHM’s services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled. For example, NHM needs first-party cookies to log you in to the Services that require registration. In that case, you may set your browser to block third-party cookies and allow NHM’s first-party cookies only.

#### Google Analytics

Google is one of the companies that we use to serve advertising and perform analytics on some of the Services. When you access the Services, our third-party vendors, including Google, use third-party cookies (such as the Google DoubleClick cookie) to serve you ads based on your previous visit to our Websites and other websites. To learn about Google Analytics’ currently available opt-outs for the Web, go to <https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/>. To learn more about how Google uses cookies in advertising, you can visit the [Google Advertising Privacy & Terms policy](https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads).

#### “Do Not Track” Signals

Some third-party browsers provide “do not track” machine readable signals for websites which are automatically applied by default and therefore do not necessarily reflect our visitor’s choice as to whether they wish to receive advertisements tailored to their interests. As a result, at this time, NHM does not respond to browser “do not track” signals or other similar mechanisms. Go to [http://www.networkadvertising.org](http://www.networkadvertising.org/) or [http://www.aboutads.info](http://www.aboutads.info/) if you wish to learn more about your options to not accept tracking cookies for the purpose of receiving targeted interest-based advertisements. Please note that the opt out is cookie-based and will only affect the specific computer and browser on which the opt-out is applied.

### HOW WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SECURE

To help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of information, we have put in place appropriate technical, organizational, physical, electronic, and managerial procedures designed to protect the information under our control. We use third-party hosting providers that use specific security measures such as network intrusion protection, automated https, and secure datacenters. The measures we and our hosting providers use are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal information. However, despite our efforts, no system can completely guaranty that there will never be unauthorized access to your personal information.
