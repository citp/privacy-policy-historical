**Introduction**

The integrity of individuals is an important factor for Addiliate. Addiliate is a 100% subsidary of Clicktron S.L. ([www.clicktronmedia.com](http://www.clicktronmedia.com/)). Clicktron S.L. and Addiliate will herein after be referred to as “Addiliate”. Addiliate's advertisers, publishers, media agencies and other customers (hereafter the "Client/Clients") that from time to time provide Addiliate with personal data, as well as web surfers whose digital data is processed by Addiliate as part of its provision of services to it's Clients (hereafter the "User/Users"), must be able to trust that data is processed by Addiliate in accordance with applicable privacy laws and regulations. 

This Privacy Policy was created in order for Clients and Users to better understand how information relating to them is processed by Addiliate. The Privacy Policy is not exhaustive, but contains certain fundamental privacy principles applied by Addiliate. 

  * Part 1 of the Privacy Policy contains Addiliate's general privacy principles with regard to its processing of personal data provided by Clients, Users or other individuals.
  * Part 2 of the Privacy Policy contains information regarding Addiliate's processing of digital information about Users in relation to Addiliate's Interest Based Advertising and possible Retargeting activities. It also contains requirements on publishers with whom we have contracted to serve Interest Based Advertising, Retargeting and other marketing services, to notify Users about Addiliate's services on their websites.



This Privacy Policy was last revised on October 11, 2011. Addiliate may at any time and without notice change it, e.g. to keep it compliant with applicable laws. You should therefore read this Privacy Policy each time you intend to provide Addiliate with personal data.

The fundamental integrity principle underlying all Addiliate's processing of digital data relating to Users, is that such data shall be anonymous. Therefore, we do not store IP addresses on the cookie of a User, only a unique randomly generated ID that does not allow Addiliate to trace the User; we do not have, and will not initiate, any co-operation with Internet Service Providers in order to trace the identities of Users. The data stored on the cookie is limited to information collected at the User's visits to websites belonging to Addiliate's Advertising Network. A User's cookie can only be viewed by Addiliate when the User visits a website that belongs to our Advertising Network. If the cookie is deleted by the User, all profile data is removed. In addition, note that you are always able to prevent cookies from any website from being installed on your computer by readjusting your browser settings.

Addiliate will use the User data in order to better target advertisements on behalf of our Clients, to provide aggregated non-personal reporting to our Clients, and to improve our advertising systems and products. The data may be combined with other anonymous information collected from other sources so that we may better serve Users with offers that may be of interest to them. 

**Security**

Addiliate is dedicated to maintain the security of all its data and to prevent unauthorized access through the implementation of appropriate technical and organizational measures, as far as is reasonably possible.
