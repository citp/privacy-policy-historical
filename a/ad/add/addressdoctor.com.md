# Informatica Privacy Policy | Informatica

**Last Updated** : August 12, 2019

This Privacy Policy explains how Informatica LLC, Informatica Ireland EMEA UC and their respective subsidiaries (“Informatica”) collect, use and share your information. This Privacy Policy applies to information we collect when you use our websites, mobile applications and other online products and services (collectively, the “Services”) or when you otherwise interact with us, including when you attend events hosted or attended by Informatica, contact us for customer support or visit our premises, facilities or offices (collectively, our “facilities”). Please note that third parties host the e-commerce platforms of our Services that accept payment cards: Digital River, Inc. (Informatica Marketplace), Zuora, Inc. (Informatica Cloud Express), and Cornerstone OnDemand, Inc. (Informatica Education Services). As a result, any information you provide in connection with a purchase made via the Services will be collected by these third parties and governed by the third parties’ separate privacy policies. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the information processed by Informatica about its employees or job applicants, which is governed by a separate personnel privacy notice. It also does not apply to information processed by Informatica on behalf of its customers via the Services, as further described in Informatica’s data processing agreement available on the Informatica Legal Information Website at <https://www.informatica.com/content/dam/informatica-com/en/docs/legal/online-data-processing-agreement.pdf>.

We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as by adding a statement to our website homepages or sending you an email notification) or otherwise seek additional consent in accordance with applicable law. We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you access the Services to stay informed about our information practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy.

_Transfer of Information_

Informatica processes information in the United States and other countries. Accordingly, we and our service providers may transfer your information to, or store or access it in, jurisdictions that may not provide equivalent levels of data protection as your home jurisdiction. We will take steps to ensure that your personal data receives an adequate level of protection in the jurisdictions in which we process it. For instance, data transferred from the European Economic Area (“EEA”) to Informatica LLC and its subsidiaries in the United States will be processed pursuant to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield (see below for more details). In other cases, we will use European Commission-approved Standard Contractual Clauses to ensure an adequate level of protection for data originating from the EEA. Copies of the Standard Contractual Clauses we use to facilitate the transfer of data outside the EEA are available [here](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32004D0915) and [here](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32010D0087).

_Individuals in the European Economic Area_

If we collect your personal data while you are located in the EEA, you have certain rights and protections under the law regarding the processing of this personal data. Please see the sections below for more details.

_Controllers.  _

Informatica Ireland EMEA UC and Informatica LLC are co-controllers of the personal data collected about you.

_Legal Basis for Processing_

When we process this personal data we will only do so in the following situations:

  * We need to use your personal data to perform our responsibilities under our contract with you (e.g., processing payments for and providing our services you have requested).
  * We have a legitimate interest in processing your personal data. For example, we process the personal data we collect from you to send you marketing communications, to communicate with you about changes to our Services, to enhance the safety and security of our facilities, and to provide, secure, and improve our Services.
  * If we request your consent to a specific processing activity, and you provide your consent in the manner indicated.
  * In some cases, processing will be necessary for compliance with a legal obligation, such as response to legal process requests.



_Data Retention_

We store this personal data for as long as is necessary for the purposes for which we originally collected it. We may retain certain information for legitimate business purposes or as required by law.

_Data Subject Requests_

If you are in the EEA, you have the right to access personal data we hold about you and to ask that your personal data be corrected. In certain cases, you may also have the right to request that we erase data we are processing or to restrict or object to certain of our processing activities. You may also have the right to request that we provide the personal data you have provided us in a portable form for transmission to another controller’s service. If you would like to exercise any of these rights, you may contact us as indicated in the “Contact Us” section below.

_Questions or Complaints_

If you are in the EEA and have a concern about our processing of personal data that we are not able to resolve, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the data protection authority where you reside. For contact details of your local Data Protection Authority, please see: <https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en>.

_EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework_

Informatica LLC and its US subsidiaries adhere in their processing of personal data received from the EEA (“EU Data”) to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework Principles established by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the European Commission (the “Principles”). For more information about the Principles, please visit the Department of Commerce’s [Privacy Shield website](https://www.privacyshield.gov/). 

Please direct any inquiries or complaints regarding our compliance with the Principles to the point of contact listed in the “Contact Us” section below. If Informatica does not resolve your complaint, you may submit your complaint free of charge for resolution to JAMS, Informatica’s designated independent Privacy Shield dispute resolution provider, at <https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield>. Under certain conditions specified by the Principles, you may also be able to invoke binding arbitration to resolve your complaint. Informatica is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission. If Informatica shares EU Data with a third-party service provider that processes the data solely on Informatica’s behalf, then Informatica may be held liable for that third party’s processing of EU Data in violation of the Principles, unless Informatica can prove that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
