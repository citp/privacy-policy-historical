<p>You will be notified if and when your information is being collected by any outside parties, other than those mentioned in our Privacy Policy. We do this so you can make an informed choice as to whether or not you should proceed with services that require an outside party.</p>

<h2>Links</h2>
<p>This website contains links to other websites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other websites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our website to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personal information. Our Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by us.</p>


<h2>Security</h2>
<p>We take every normal precaution to protect your personal information. When you submit sensitive information via our website or other communication, your information is protected both online and off-line. We protect your account information by placing it on the secure portion of our website. That is why you enter your unique User Name and Password each time you access your account.</p>
<p>After placing an order with us, your payment information, such as full credit card or purchase order number, is no longer available on our website. Even users with your password cannot access this information.</p>
<p>When our registration form asks you to enter non-public information, that information is encrypted and protected with the Secure Sockets Layer ("SSL") protocol, a leading encryption technology. While you are on a secure page, such as our registration form, the lock icon on the bottom of web browsers, such as Netscape navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer, activates, as opposed to unlocking or opening, when "surfing". SSL works like this: information that you enter becomes a string of unrecognizable numbers before entering the Internet. When your encrypted data reaches Addgene, its server decodes the information and stores it in its database. Both our server and your Internet browser understand the mathematical formulas used to turn your personal data into numeric code and back again. Therefore, every time you enter information and every time saved information is accessed from our database, the information is encrypted before it travels onto the Internet. Each time you log on to our website, our server and your Internet browser agree on a random number ("customer session I.D."), which serves as the "decoding key" while you are logged into our website. The random number generated depends on the level of encryption your browser supports.</p>
<p>When Addgene's registration form asks customers to enter non-public information, that information is encrypted and is protected with the Secure Sockets Layer SSL protocol, the leading encryption technology. While customers are on a secure page, such as Addgene's registration form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers, such as Netscape navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer, becomes activated, as opposed to unlocked, or open, when "surfing". SSL works like this: information that customers enter becomes a string of unrecognizable numbers before entering the Internet. When customers' encrypted data reaches Addgene, its server decodes the information and stores it in its database. Both Addgene's server and the browser customers use to navigate the Web understand the mathematical formulas used to turn customers' personal data into numeric code and then back again. So every time customers enter information and every time saved information is accessed from Addgene's database, it gets encrypted before it travels onto the Internet. Each time customers log on to the Addgene site, its server and customers' Web browser agree on a random number (customer session I.D.) which serves as the 'decoding key' while customers are logged into the site. What that random number could be depends on the level of encryption customers' browser supports.</p>


<h2>Notification of Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>We may, from time to time, choose to change our Privacy Policy. Any changes will be posted to this page. If the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice, which may include notifications on our homepages, through email, and/or other places we deem appropriate. We want you to always be aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.</p>
<p>If, however, we were going to use your personally identifiable information in a manner not discussed or contemplated above, we will notify you via email. You will have a choice as to whether or not we use your information in this different manner. However, if you have opted out of all communications from us, or deleted/deactivated your account, then you will not be contacted, and your personal information will be not used in this new manner.</p>
