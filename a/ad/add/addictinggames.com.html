Your user information helps us tailor the content, services, goods and advertising to your current and future needs. For this reason, we may ask you to register or to provide personal information when you post high scores, write reviews, download free software, enter a contest, order products, subscribe to a newsletter and/or visit certain areas of an Atom Entertainment site. If you choose not to register you may not have access to areas that require personal identification.

                                        If you register with Atom Entertainment Sites or purchase products from us, from time to time we may e-mail you with messages about our services or third party products and services we believe may be of interest to you, such as new products, features, services, special offers and updated information. The newsletters may contain code that enables our database to track your usage of the newsletters, including whether the email was opened and/or what links (if any) were clicked. We will combine that information with other information we have about you and may use that information to improve your site experience and/or provide customized e-mail communications to you. In addition, if you register with an Atom Entertainment site or purchase products you may automatically receive emails confirming your registration and/or purchase and providing you with necessary information relating to the access or use of your registration and/or purchase. With the exception of the emails described in the preceding sentence which are necessary to provide customer support and deliver products and services to you, you may opt-out of receiving email from us as described below under "<b>What are my options to control the use of my personally identifiable information?</b>".

                                        When you register, Atom Entertainment asks for your e-mail address, a user selected user name, and other information. Once you are a registered user you can update your profile and may be able to provide additional preferential information (e.g. a member name, a nickname, and certain user preferences).

                                        Atom Entertainment also uses an order form for users to request information, products and services. For that order form, we collect a user's contact information (e-mail address) and necessary financial information to process the order (i.e. credit card number). Contact information from the order (including email) is used to deliver digital products and information from Atom Entertainment. Atom Entertainment may use third parties to accept and process orders and credit card purchases for merchandise and products, including software. Atom Entertainment currently uses the services of Custom CD to fulfill orders for games on tangible media for Shockwave.com, iPay for credit card processing for Shockwave.com and Shockwave.com Unlimited, and Navio for credit card and direct carrier billing in the Shockwave Mobile Store. Custom CD collects information from consumers solely to process orders for games on CDs and send them to the designated recipient.   Custom CD does not sell or rent this information, and will only share it as stated in its Privacy Policy. For more information in Navio's use of your information, please read their Privacy Policy [<a href="http://customcd.us/privacy_policy.html" target="_blank">http://customcd.us/privacy_policy.html</a>]. iPAY collects information from consumers solely to process payment transactions on behalf of its merchants and will only share consumer information with the merchant who originated the transaction, vendors, processors, banking institutions, and credit card associations as necessary to process payment transactions. iPAY does not sell or rent this information, and will only share it as stated in its Privacy Policy.

                                        We use an outside company, Falk NA, to serve advertisements on our site. In the process of serving advertisements, Falk NA places a Falk NA cookie in your browser's cookie file and may use information (excluding your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other Web sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you. By delivering ads on the Atom Entertainment Sites, Falk NA is able to record what ads a user -- identified by the unique cookie -- has seen, and what Atom Entertainment site pages the user was viewing when the ads were delivered. This Web usage information is combined with other ad delivery information Falk NA has (e.g., what type of operating system your computer uses) collected from your visits to Atom Entertainment Sites and other sites not affiliated with Atom Entertainment. This non-personally identifiable information is used as part of the ad serving process for reporting and to select and direct the ads you see online at Atom Entertainment Sites and other sites not affiliated with Atom Entertainment. Unlike the cookies Atom Entertainment uses in other parts of our site, cookies received with banner ads are collected by Falk NA and we do not have access to this information. Additionally, some ads served by Falk NA are generated by third party ad serving systems that also may place a cookie or transparent GIF file on your browser to provide web usage information to those third parties.

                                        The Atom Entertainment Sites are general audience sites and are not directed to children under the age of 13. Atom Entertainment assumes products purchased through credit card means are purchased by adults. Atom Entertainment respects the privacy of parents and children and is committed to complying with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). On those areas of the Sites that ask for age, Atom Entertainment does not collect personal information from individuals who identify themselves as under the age of 13 except in those limited circumstances where Atom Entertainment believes that such collection is permitted under COPPA.

These tools can also prevent children from otherwise disclosing online their name, address and other personal information without parental permission.
