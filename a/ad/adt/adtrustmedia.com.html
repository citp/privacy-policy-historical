			<div class="heading">AdTrustMedia, LLC Privacy Policy</div>
			
			<p>AdTrustMedia, LLC respects your privacy. We strive to use information to provide the

				electronically may be considered personal information.

				configuration details, IP addresses are automatically retrieved in webserver logs
				when the configuration files are accessed due to the nature of the webserver
				function. These webserver logs are deleted periodically.

				functionality of our products, AdTrustMedia may also collect computer
				identification; installed product version(s) and product identification; information
