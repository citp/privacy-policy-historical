### Information collected and what it is used for

Auto Trader may collect the following information about you:

  * Information you provide when you place an advertisement on the Website



As part of the advert placement process we will collect your name, email address and telephone number. We will also collect your postcode in order to provide a positioning of each vehicle within our database, this allows potential buyers to locate vehicles for sale within a set radius of a chosen location. 

If your advert expires we will use your details to contact you via phone or e mail to give you the option to rebook your advert.

We use certain features to protect the privacy of our customers when they are communicating via phone or email. We recommend that all customers placing an advert select Telesafe at the point of entering their phone number. Telesafe enables you to keep your telephone number private by providing you with a substitute telephone number to use in your advert. Telesafe automatically applies unless you opt out at the time you place your advert. Please be aware that if you opt out, your personal telephone number will be visible within your advert. 

We supply a customer to customer e mail solution that allows people who are viewing your advert to contact you through a link on your advert without seeing your email address. We use this to strip out any potentially harmful or spurious links that may expose you to fraudulent activity. This email solution is not optional.

You will also be required to supply payment details and the vehicle registration number of the vehicle you wish to sell. Payment Card information is collected over a secure connection and all payment transactions will be encrypted. Payment Card information is used solely for the purpose of processing payment for your advert. Auto Trader retains no record of Payment Card details. 

Where advertising packages include additional benefits to be provided by third parties, we may pass your details on to these third parties to enable them to provide those benefits, provided that you have selected to opt in to receive information from third parties.
