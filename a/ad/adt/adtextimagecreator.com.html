        <p align="left"> Khancepts, LLC takes pride in creating richer, deeper  interactive experiences that combines original, independent and user-generated  content. <br>
          This privacy policy applies to the U.S.  operations of all brands and services within the Khancepts, LLC family of  companies.</p>
        <p align="left"><strong>Overall privacy statement</strong></p>
        <p align="left"> We take your privacy seriously. Because we gather certain types of information  about our users, we want to help you understand the terms and conditions  surrounding the collection and use of that information. This privacy statement  discloses the types of information we gather, how we use it, and how to correct  or change it. These privacy practices apply to the Web site that you were  viewing when you clicked through to this policy, which is operated directly by  us, by our partner, or by our affiliate. </p>
        <p align="left"><strong>1. What information does Khancepts.com  collect?</strong> </p>
        <p align="left"> Our primary goal in collecting  personal information is to provide you with the best and most useful content  and services. Several of the services and features that we offer on our sites  require you to provide us with information as a condition of usage. These  include access to subscription-only areas, the ability to post opinions or  other content, participation in sweepstakes or contests, subscriptions to print  magazines and email newsletters and participation in message boards. <br>
          We collect personally identifiable  information, such as your name, email address, postal address, phone number,  mobile number and credit card information when you provide it to us. From time  to time, we may also collect other sensitive information such as your job  title, gender, username and password. We may also receive information about you  from other sources and add it to the information you provided to us. <br>
          Once you register with one of our Khancepts  sites you are no longer anonymous to us. </p>
        <p align="left"><strong>2. What is Khancepts.com practice  regarding cookies?</strong> </p>
        <p align="left"> Your Internet browser has a feature  called cookies, which stores small amounts of data on your computer about your  visit to any of our sites. You do not need to have cookies turned on to visit  most of our sites, although active participation in certain areas of our sites  may require cookies. Cookies alone tell us nothing about who you are unless you  specifically give us personally identifiable information, in which case we use  the information to enhance your services in the ways described below. By  adjusting your settings on your browser, you may elect not to allow cookies to  be collected. <br>
          We also use technologies, including  electronic images known as Web bugs-sometimes called transparent GIFs, clear  GIFs, or beacons-that allow us to track general user-traffic patterns. We also  automatically receive and record information from our servers and from your  browser, including your IP address, the time of your visit to pages on our  site, and information about pages you visited. Unless you have registered for  one of our products or services, the information we gather through the use of  tracking technologies cannot be matched with any personally identifiable  information about you. <br>
          We use cookies and tracking  technologies in a variety of ways, including: </p>
        <div align="left">
          <ol>
            <li>Keeping count of return visits to  our site or our advertisers' or partners' sites; </li>
            <li>Accumulating and reporting  anonymous, aggregate (data collected in mass), statistical information on  Web-site and advertisement usage; </li>
            <li>Determining which features our  overall user population likes best; </li>
            <li>Saving your password so you don't  have to re-enter it each time you visit our sites; </li>
            <li>Displaying the most appropriate  advertising or content based on your interests. </li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <p align="left">We allow other companies that are  presenting advertisements on our sites and, sometimes, in our newsletters to  use tracking technology on your computer. We do not give any personally  identifiable information to them as part of this relationship. Unless you visit  the Web site of these companies and provide them with personally identifiable  information about yourself, these tracking technologies tell those advertisers  nothing about who you are. Our advertisers' use of tracking technology is  subject to their own privacy policies. </p>
        <p align="left"><strong>3. How does Khancepts.com use the  information?</strong> </p>
        <p align="left"> We use the information we gather for  four general purposes: </p>
        <div align="left">
          <ol>
            <li>To customize the advertising and the  content you see; </li>
            <li>To enhance the user experience in  our network of sites. We use tracking information to determine how well each  page performs overall based on aggregate user demographics and traffic patterns  to those pages. This helps us continue to build a better service for you; </li>
            <li>To fulfill your requests for certain  products and services, such as sending out electronic newsletters and enabling  you to participate in paid services, polls, contests, and message boards; </li>
            <li>To send you information you agreed  to receive about topics we think will be of interest to you. </li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <p align="left"><strong>4.&nbsp; How does Khancepts.com  share the information? </strong></p>
        <p align="left"><strong><em>Personally identifiable information</em></strong></p>
        <p align="left">We will make your personally  identifiable information available to other companies or people when: </p>
        <div align="left">
          <ol>
            <li>You have elected to allow us to  share that information at the time that you registered with us or provided us  the information, or through a subsequent affirmative election through our  website. </li>
            <li>You volunteer information or create  a public profile in the course of your participation in our community features  such as forums, user opinions and reviews, chat rooms, photo sharing or other  forms of public communication and interaction. </li>
            <li>You use cobranded services (i.e.,  sites or services that we offer to you in connection with a partner, who is  identified on the site). When you use a cobranded service within our network of  sites, you grant us permission to pass your registration information back to  that service partner. Their use of your information is subject to their  applicable privacy policies. </li>
            <li>We hire third-party vendors to  provide specialized services such as customer support; email message  deployment; suppression, merge and de-duplication services; data processing;  and special products or services that you have requested. These companies are  only allowed to use the information in order to help us fulfill our services to  you. We do not provide your information to these companies for their own,  permanent use. </li>
            <li>You unsubscribe for a mailing that  we send to you on behalf of a third party. We may share your removal  instruction with the third party so that it may be added to that person's list  of people to whom they may not send emails. </li>
            <li>You are the winner of a contest or a  sweepstakes that is co-sponsored with a third party and that third party needs  your information in order to manage the prize fulfillment process. </li>
            <li>When required by law, such as when  we respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process. </li>
            <li>We believe that your actions violate  applicable laws, Khancepts, LLC Terms of Use, or any usage guidelines for  specific products or services, or threaten the rights, property, or safety of  our company, our users, or others. </li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <p align="left"><strong><em>Aggregate information</em></strong> </p>
        <p align="left"> We aggregate personally identifiable  information and disclose such information in a non-personally identifiable  manner to advertisers and other third parties for marketing, promotional, and  other purposes. We do not disclose to these entities any information that could  be used to identify you personally. </p>
        <p align="left"><strong><em>Third Party Services</em></strong> </p>
        <p align="left"> Companies that use our services may  enter account data for third-party services. This information is necessarily  passed on to those third parties when their ordering system is accessed. Those  users may also enter data about their customer orders. This information is  shared only in aggregate form with third parties. </p>
        <p align="left"><strong><em>Business transfers</em></strong> </p>
        <p align="left"> We are always seeking to improve our  network of Web sites and our business. In accomplishing these objectives, we  may buy or sell a company, or one or more of the companies in our corporate  family may merge with or be acquired by another company. If we sell a business,  we may transfer some or all of your information as a part of the sale in order  that the service being provided to you may continue or for other business  purposes. </p>
        <p align="left"><strong>5. What are my options?</strong> </p>
        <p align="left"> Users who would rather not provide  any of the user data requested by our registration process do not need to  register with us. You can still view much of the content and use many of the  services offered by our sites without registering. </p>
        <p align="left"> We also give users the following options: </p>
        <div align="left">
          <ol>
            <li>Opting not to receive our electronic  newsletters or those of third parties when registering. Users who opt in may  remove themselves from mailing lists at any time through the  subscription-management pages or by following the instructions at the end of  the e-mail they received from us; </li>
            <li>Opting not to provide certain  personal information when registering for a site, provided, however, that you  may not be able to use some of our products or services without providing us  with certain information. </li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <p align="left"><strong>6. How can I review and update my personally identifiable  information? </strong></p>
        <p align="left"> You can review, correct, or change  the information collected during registration for any of our sites. The  instructions for doing this can be found in our member-services areas. Users  may change information at any time and as often as necessary. Users who are  experiencing problems with our services or who have questions about how our  services work can contact us using e-mail addresses at the bottom of this page. </p>
        <p align="left"><strong>7. How will I know if the privacy  policy is changed?</strong> </p>
        <p align="left"> Any modifications to our privacy  practices will be reflected first within this area of our network of Web sites.  If there is a material change in our privacy practices, we will indicate on our  sites that our privacy practices have changed and provide a link to the new  privacy statement. If we are going to be using the information collected from  users in a manner materially different from that stated at the time of  collection, we will send affected users written notice of the change by e-mail.</p>
        <p align="left"><strong>8. Privacy of children</strong> </p>
        <p align="left"> None of the sites within our network  is directed to children under the age of 13. We operate our network of sites in  compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act and do not permit  registration by, and will not knowingly collect or use personally identifiable  information from, anyone under 13 years of age. This requirement is clearly  posted during the registration process. </p>
        <p align="left"><strong>Questions, Comments</strong> </p>
        <p align="left"> Questions regarding this privacy  statement or any other aspects of our network of Web sites should be sent to  our Legal Department at 300 Park    Avenue, Birmingham, MI 48009.  We read every message submitted and try to reply promptly to every one. We may  also file your comments to improve the site, or review and discard the  information. </p>
