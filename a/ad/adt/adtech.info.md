ADTECH never collects person-related data about users without their explicit approval. This relates to such information as names, addresses, e-mail addresses or telephone numbers. At present there are no independent bodies that oversee this process. 

Advertising is the vitalsource of finance for a very large number of Internet companies and premium content providers. When an Ad is requested, the ad server receives information from the user's browser which influences which ad is sent back. The registration, collection and use of such information are subject to stringent data protection regulations. 

ADTECH uses cookies to store the following non-person-related data: 

\- Browser type (such as Internet Explorer 5.0)  
\- Operating system (such as Macintosh)  
\- Date and time at which a specific banner was delivered

This data allows us to measure the delivery of banners and to report the results to our customers. This data also includes such information as the number of clicks on a banner or how often a specific banner has been delivered to an individual user. We sometimes aggregate the data acquired in the individual networks internally for statistical purposes. 

ADTECH respects the user's wish for anonymity and avoiding cookies. For this, click on the button [**"Ad Cookie Opt-out"**](http://adserver.adtech.de/setoptoutcookie/?page=http://glb.adtechus.com/setoptoutcookie/?page=http://adserverwc.adtechus.com/setoptoutcookie/?page=http://adserverec.adtechus.com/setoptoutcookie/?page=http://ad.us-ec.adtechus.com/setoptoutcookie/?page=http://www.adtech.info/cookieoptout-success/) . The ADTECH-Adserver will then no longer place cookies on your computer.

ADTECH considers it its duty to be in a continual dialogue with the German data protection authorities.
