##### Use of Tracking Technologies 

We use cookies, pixel tags, server logs, and other Internet technologies to collect information about you and your use of this Site, and we may additionally collect data about your visits to other websites. These technologies do not provide us with your personal information, but they do allow us to track and record your activities on this Site and other websites. In addition to information collected by us, we may allow our related companies or other third parties to use cookies and web beacons to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to this Site.

A “cookie” is a small computer file that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit this Site again (or certain other cooperating websites), the cookie allows us to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. A pixel tag (also known as a “web beacon”) is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking a user’s activity on websites, or when emails are opened or accessed, and is often used in combination with cookies. To learn more about the details, you may visit [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/) and/or other resources. 

##### Your Privacy Options

  * __Decline or Block Cookies and Pixel Tags.__ You can modify the security settings on your computer device and reset your browser to approve or reject a cookie on a case-by-case basis, block cookies from certain sites, or even refuse all cookies. Similarly, you can disable pixel tags by changing your browser settings to omit images and disable Javascript, or use commercial software packages that can omit pixel tags and most advertisements. Please be aware, however, if you “turn off,” purge or disable cookies or pixel tags, you may not be able to use all of the features, functions or services available on this Site.
  * __Opt Out of Interest-Based Advertising.__ CDK supports the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising, which means that you have options and choices about our collection and use of your data for online interest-based advertising. For more information about interest-based information tracking and to manage interest-based advertising categories, or opt out of all categories, from CDK, visit <http://www.aboutads.info/choices/>. Please note that if you choose to opt out of having your information used to deliver advertisements tailored to your interests, you will continue to see advertisements delivered by CDK, but these advertisements may not be as relevant to you.
