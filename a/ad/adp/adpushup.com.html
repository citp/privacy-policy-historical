By publishing your results on the AdPushup Service, you agree that you have obtained all necessary consents to make such information public and that doing so will not violate any laws.

Non-personally identifiable information may be stored indefinitely.<br>
<br>
Instances where we are required to share your information: AdPushup will disclose your information where required to do so by law or subpoena or if we reasonably believe that such action is necessary to (a) comply with the law and the reasonable requests of law enforcement; (b) to enforce our <a href="tos.php">Terms of Service</a> or to protect the security or integrity of our Service; and/or (c) to exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of AdPushup, our Users or others.<br>

AdPushup may transfer information that we collect about you, including personal information, to affiliated entities, or to other third parties across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world.

AdPushup is concerned with protecting your privacy and data, but we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to AdPushup or guarantee that your information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our industry standard physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number or log in credentials) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can contact us at legal@adpushup.com.<br>
<br>

We use an outside help platform, and a credit card processing company to bill you if you purchase services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any other purposes.<br>
<br><br>

<h3>6. Compromise of Personal Information</h3>

In the event that personal information is compromised as a result of a breach of security, AdPushup will promptly notify those persons whose personal information has been compromised, in accordance with the notification procedures set forth in this Privacy Policy, or as otherwise required by applicable law.<br>
<br><br>

<h3>7. Your Choices About Your Information</h3>

You can review, correct, update or delete inaccuracies to the information about you that AdPushup keeps on file by logging into your account to update your password and billing information. Alternately, you can contact us directly at legal@adpushup.com. We will respond to your request to access within 30 days.<br>
<br>

We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.<br>
<br><br>

<h3>8. Children's Privacy</h3>

Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, AdPushup does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13. If you are under 13, please do not send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address. No one under age 13 is allowed to access or use the Service or to provide any personal information to AdPushup. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at legal@adpushup.com.<br>
<br><br>

<h3>9. Notification Procedures</h3>

It is our policy to provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business related purposes, to you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through conspicuous posting of such notice on the Service, as determined by AdPushup in its sole discretion. We reserve the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to you, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification as described in this Privacy Policy.<br>
<br><br>

<h3>10. Links to Other Web Sites</h3>

We are not responsible for the practices employed by websites or services linked to or from the Service, including the information or content contained therein. Please remember that when you use a link to go from the Service to another website, our Privacy Policy does not apply to third-party websites or services. Your browsing and interaction on any third-party website or service, including those that have a link or advertisement on our website, are subject to that third party’s own rules and policies.<br>
<br>
