# Privacy Policy - Adpixo

## Advertising

Advertising keeps AdPixo and many of the websites and services you use free of charge. We work hard to make sure that ads are safe, unobtrusive, and as relevant as possible. For example, We terminate the accounts of hundreds of thousands of publishers and advertisers that violate our policies each year – including ads containing malware, ads for counterfeit goods, or ads that attempt to misuse your personal information.

AdPixo does not collect any personally identifying user-level information.

AdPixo collects information about consumers' activities on certain websites in order to deliver targeted advertisements.

AdPixo's contextual targeting services solely rely on cookie-level tracking containing no personally identifying information.

When users visit a page in the AdPixo network, one or more cookies - a small file containing a string of characters - are set to the computer that uniquely identifies the users browser.

AdPixo uses cookies to improve the quality of the targeting service by storing anonymous activity data and tracking user trends, such as how people search and browse. Users can reset their browsers to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.

AdPixo will not collect or use any user-level personally identifiable information without prior consent from its clients.

AdPixo encourages and promotes business practices that protect and honour the privacy of users.
