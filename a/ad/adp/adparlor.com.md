# AdParlor - Privacy Policy

**ADPARLOR PRIVACY POLICY**

**Effective January 1, 2014**

**This Policy may change from time to time.   Please check back for updates.**

Adparlor (“AdParlor”, “we”, or “us”) respects and protects the privacy of consumers.  This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes what information we collect, how we use that information, and some of your privacy rights regarding that information. 

**Collection of Information and Your Privacy Rights**

_What information we collect and how we collect it._

AdParlor does not collect or retain the following consumer information: name, race, religion, sexual orientation, health, social security number (or other government issued identifying number), insurance plan number, financial account number, information relaying precise, real-time location data (eg, through GPS or other location-based services), or information about past, present or future health or medical condition.  Occasionally, AdParlor may receive consumer information, such as email addresses, from its advertising clients in connection with specific advertising campaigns.

AdParlor collects user submitted information such as name, email and password data to authenticate users, authenticate its commercial users, (AdParlor accounts and account services are available only to advertisers; they are not available to consumers), and to send notifications to those users relating to the AdParlor service. This information is not shared to anyone and is used by AdParlor so we can customize your experience and protect the security of your account.  
We may also use a user's email address to send updates, a newsletter or news regarding   
Adparlor’s services.

AdParlor logs IP address, date/time stamp, aggregate user data, and browser type, from users and visitors to the site.  This data is used to manage the website, track usage and improve the website services.  This non-personally-identifiable information may be shared with third-parties to provide more relevant services and advertisements to AdParlor’s account holders.  User IP addresses are recorded for security and monitoring purposes.

We may use cookies when you use our services.  In addition, AdParlor uses cookies in connection with consumers visiting the web pages of social media sites where we provide services to our account holders; however, the data we collect in connection with consumers is used solely for tracking clicks and conversions – and is not used for any cross-site data collection or tracking. Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer's hard drive by our servers to identify your computer to our servers. You can also disable cookies or otherwise manage them through tools provided with your browser software and with third-party software packages, or not use the features that require cookies.

Adparlor and/or its partners reserve their rights to use cookies to track individual responses or views of advertisements, and use this information to help predict what other advertisements may be of interest to consumers and enable the receipt of customized advertisements or content. These cookies contain no personally identifiable information. The cookies may reflect de-identified demographic or other data linked to data you voluntarily have submitted to us, such as your email address, that we may share with any third party, solely in hashed, non-human readable form. To learn about how you can opt-out of the receipt of cookies, please visit _<http://www.aboutads.info/choices>_ and to learn more about cookies in general, please visit [http://www.cookiecentral.com](http://www.cookiecentral.com/).  AdParlor does not have a mechanism or process to respond to any “do not track” signals which a web browser may send or receive, other than as expressly described in this Privacy Policy.

We do not knowingly collect information about minors under the age of 18.  MINORS UNDER THE AGE OF 18 SHOULD NOT PROVIDE OR SUBMIT ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION, INCLUDING THEIR EMAIL ADDRESS, TO ADPARLOR.  If Adparlor is notified it has information about a minor under the age of 18, that information will be promptly deleted from our database.  Minors are not permitted to open accounts with Adparlor.

**Use of Information and User Data**

_How we use and share the information we collect._

Except as otherwise described in this privacy statement, AdParlor will not disclose personal information to any third party unless we believe that disclosure is necessary: (1) to conform to legal requirements or to respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other legal process received by AdParlor, whether or not a response is required by applicable law; (2) to enforce the AdParlor Terms of Use Agreement or to protect our rights; or (3) to protect the safety of members of the public and users of the service.

AdParlor reserves the right to transfer personal information to a successor in interest that acquires rights to that information as a result of the sale of AdParlor or substantially all of its assets to that successor in interest. For more information see the "Changes in Our Privacy Policy" section below. 

_How we store and protect the information we receive._

AdParlor user accounts are secured by user-created passwords and AdParlor takes certain precautions to ensure that user account information is kept private. We use reasonable measures to protect user information that is stored within our database, and we restrict access to member information to those employees who need access to perform their job functions, such as our customer service personnel and technical staff. Please note that we cannot guarantee the absolute security of member account information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of member information at any time. For any additional information about the security measures we use on AdParlor, please contact us at [privacy at adparlor.com](mailto:privacy@adparlor.com).
