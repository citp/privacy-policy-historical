Privacy Policy  
**  
  
---  
  
 **adpasar** privacy policy is detailed below, and we ask you to read them thoroughly. We are constantly improving the tools & services you can use to better manage information that you provide to us. Kindly refer to this policy document from time to time to get updated.  
  
 **Policy Coverage**  
  
  
This policy applies to this site only and our partners & affiliates have their own privacy policy statements, which we encourage you to read whenever you visit & use their sites or services. When we talk about "adpasar" or "we" in this policy, we are referring to this site itself as well as the company that wholly own and run the site.  
  
 ** Useful Definitions**  
  
  
"Personally identifiable information" is information such as your name, birth date, e-mail address, mailing address or some other details that can potentially be used to uniquely identify you as an individual.

Anonymous Information is not personally identifiable information. Anonymous information is information about how you use or iterate with our site (such as sections or pages visited and search keywords used when searching). Anonymous information may include the domain names and/or I.P. addresses (as explained in greater detail below) of browsers that visit our site, time of day the site was visited, and other non-personally identifiable information. Anonymous information is information that is not directly linked to a specific individual but helps to characterize the usage pattern and improve our services.

The next sections will elaborate on how we collect and make use of anonymous information and personally identifiable information.  
  
 **Collection and Usage of Personally Identifiable Information**  
  
 _  
Signing up as new member_

Firstly, we want to assure you that you can visit our site and use many of our available services without informing who you are or revealing any personally identifiable information about yourself to us. **_It is only during registration to become a member will you be requested to provide us with personally identifiable information._**

While most of our tools & services do not require any form of account registration, we do require registration for the use of certain critical services, such as participating in the online auction, making a purchase, or submitting new listings. During this sign-up process, we require you to fill up certain fields, offer optional fields for you to complete, and request you to choose a desired username and password for your own protection. For example, we may ask for contact information (such as full name, email address, and postal code). We will manage and use this contact details in several ways: 

  * to welcome you as the new member of our community & marketplace 

  * to keep you updated about new features and services available through adpasar

  * to share limited details within the close circle of our affiliates and partners




We will save your settings or preferences indicated to us during sign-up and whatever changes that you make thereafter. We promise to respect your preference indicated to us at all time.

 _Lucky draw & Contests_

To bring you more benefit by using our site, we may from time to time organize contests on our site in which we require participants to provide certain contact information, such as their email addresses and mailing addresses). If you participate in these events, your contact information will be used to reach you in connection with the events and the prize to be won. We may also use the collected contact information to send you information about our services, as well as offers tailored to your interests by our affiliates, premium advertisers, and sponsors. You may choose to opt-out of receiving such mailings at any time.

  
  
 **Sharing Limited Contact Information Between Users**  
  
To ensure smooth transactions between our members, it is the adpasar policy for members to supply us with a valid contact information at all time. It is also very important for you to be responsive and follow up on the trading transactions done on our site. In the event that your primary contact information is outdated or invalid, or you have failed to respond to member's request to complete a transaction, or in such cases deemed appropriate by us, we may release your secondary contact detail such as phone number to the member who has entered into a trade transaction with you via our system.

Please be assured that only minimum contact information is required (ie. phone number) in this scenario in order to re-establish communication between you and the other member so that pending transaction can be resumed.  
  
 **Sharing Personally Identifiable Information with 3rd Parties**  
  
  
To deliver advertising & promotion to you that most closely matches your interests, we share your personal information with carefully selected companies with whom we have relationships and trust. Our partners and affiliates who receive information from us have the right to use the data we provide them (sometimes, in connection with other details they may already have gathered about you), but are generally prohibited from sharing this information with other companies or people externally. 

**PLEASE ALSO NOTE:** In certain special cases & scenarios, we may have to disclose your personally identifiable information when we have strong reason to believe that disclosing this piece of information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to you, or otherwise injuring or interfering with our rights, property, personnel, services or operations, or to other adpasar users, or anyone else who could be harmed by such activities. We may also disclose your personally identifiable information when we believe the law requires it or in response to demand by law enforcement authorities in connection with a criminal investigation, or civil or administrative authorities in connection with a civil case or investigation.

If you ever have any questions about whether certain information, content or services pertain to us, or are "powered by" one of our partners, please contact us to verify.

In addition to finding co-branded Web pages, you may also find direct links on adpasar to the sites offered by third parties. Some of these sites are authorized to use our brand and/or logo. Again, you should make every effort to carefully read these third party privacy policies, and make an informed decision on your own as to whether or not to continue using their sites based upon these sites' privacy practices, at your own discretion. It is important to note that no third-party sites are covered by this Privacy Policy.

 **VERY IMPORTANT:** If you ever feel that a site using the adpasar brand and/or logo has not posted an acceptable privacy policy, or is not following the privacy policy it has posted, please inform us promptly. We will forward complaints to the appropriate third parties to ensure that your concerns are adequately handled. Of course, if any of these third party companies does not have a privacy policy that is acceptable to you, you should refrain from providing information until your concerns have been satisfactorily addressed.
