The opt-in subscribe form collects certain information you voluntarily choose to share with Jobs2Web, such as your name, email address, and phone number ("Personally Identifiable Information" or "PII").  You may always choose not to provide such Personally Identifiable Information; however, this may limit Jobs2Webâ€™s ability to provide you with a specific service or particular content.  Jobs2Web may also collect other data, which may include Personally Identifiable Information.

Jobs2Web works with employers and other companies ("Clients") to provide the Jobs2Web Service.  Information about your use of the Service and visits to the Site may be used by Jobs2Web and Clients.  Your Personally Identifiable Information is only shared with the specific Client for which you visited and to which you subscribed.

We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information.
