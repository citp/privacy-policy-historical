# ADP - Privacy

## Application of this Policy 

Automatic Data Processing Limited ABN 70 003 924 945 (ADP) is committed to complying with the requirements of the Privacy Act 1988 as amended from time to time ("Act"). The core requirements of the Act are set out in the National Privacy Principles ("NPPs"). The NPPs set out how an organisation such as ADP should collect, use, keep, secure, and disclose personal information. The NPPs also give individuals a right to know what information an organisation holds about him or her, and a right to correct it if it is wrong. 

ADP's Australian Privacy Statement sets out ADP's policy in Australia for handling personal information collected when dealing with its clients and business partners. 

From time to time, ADP may change its privacy statement. For example, as ADP updates and improves its service, new features might require modifications to the statement ADP may publish these changes on its websites at www.adppayroll.com.au and www.payline.com.au 

## What personal information does ADP collect? 

"Personal Information" is any information or opinion from which an individual's identity can be ascertained. ADP collects only the information necessary to provide its services. ADP generally collects personal information such as an individual's name, address, e-mail address, user ID, banking details, date of birth, payroll details, and employment-related information such as salary details, superannuation contributions, Tax File Number, and PAYG withholding tax. 

In most situations, ADP collects personal information about an individual directly from the ADP client who is employing the individual. Where ADP is provided with personal information by its clients, it relies on its clients having obtained the consent of the individual for the collection, use, and disclosure of his or her personal information to and by ADP. It also relies on its client's drawing the points set out in this statement to the individual's attention.

  * advising clients of functions and product launches

## Disclosure of personal information 

ADP, in using personal information for the above purposes, might need to disclose personal information to various organisations and/or parties, such as the Australian Taxation Office, banking/financial institutions, superannuation authorities, health insurance organisations, contracted service providers, business partners, and related companies of ADP. 

In some instances, ADP may need to disclose personal information to organisations and/or parties in a foreign country where, for example, this disclosure (or transfer) of personal information is necessary for the conclusion or performance of contracted services in the interests of individuals, between ADP and its clients. 

ADP may also disclose information in special cases when ADP believes, in good faith, that such action is reasonably necessary, for example: (a) to conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process; (b) to protect and defend ADP's rights or property; (c) to enforce ADP's contractual arrangements; or (d) to protect the interests of ADP's clients or others.

Internally, ADP restricts access to personal information to employees or parties who need access to the information in order to do their jobs. These employees or parties are limited in number, and are committed to maintaining confidentiality. 

ADP will review security arrangements from time to time, as it deems appropriate.
