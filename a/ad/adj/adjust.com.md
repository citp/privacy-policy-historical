We process the data upon instructions from our Customers and do not have any kind of direct relationship with the You as the End User.

Customers who have [child-directed apps](https://www.adjust.com/terms/#child-directed) must choose the appropriate product settings and must not share any personal data with Partners or any third parties. Customers must agree to the section in our Terms and Conditions accordingly.

Our SDK and APIs (collectively the “adjust technology”) may process some of the following data from You as the End User:

  * Anonymized (hashed) IP address
  * Mobile identifiers such as the ID for Advertising for iOS (IDFA), Google Advertising ID or similar mobile identifiers
