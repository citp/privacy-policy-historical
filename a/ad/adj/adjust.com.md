### 2\. Collection and Use of Data via adjust’s technology

adjust provides mobile analytics and attribution services to mobile app providers. In connection with these services, we may collect, process and use certain non-personal data from the users of these mobile apps, as further described hereafter.

Clients who have [child-directed apps](https://web.archive.org/terms/#child-directed) must choose the appropriate product settings and must not share any personal data with Partners or any third parties. Clients must agree to the section in our Terms and Conditions accordingly.

Collection and use of non-personal data

Our technology may collect some of the following non-personal data: 

  * Anonymized (hashed) IP address
  * Anonymous identifiers such as the ID for Advertising for iOS (IDFA), Google Advertising ID or similar identifiers
  * Installation and first opening of an app on your mobile device
  * User interactions within an app (e.g. in-app purchases, registration)
  * Information regarding which advertisements the user has seen or clicked on



adjust uses the collected data for providing mobile analytics and attribution services to its customers, and thereby allows its customers to track marketing performance, to match users to their campaigns and to understand how they engage with the customer’s app. Furthermore, adjust enables its customers to track the user’s interactions in their apps in real time in order to see how their users engage over their full lifetime. The collected non-personal data is therefore used in order to analyze the performance of marketing campaigns and to provide performance reports to adjust’s customers. adjust does not combine the collected non-personal data with any other data that would enable adjust to personally identify the user.

### Opt-Out

Any information collected via the adjust technology is owned and controlled by the individual customer who has implemented the adjust technology into their mobile app. It is not technically possible for us to disable tracking for an individual user. Users who want to opt out of being tracked by a particular publisher, ad network, or by an advertiser’s ads therefore must contact these companies directly to opt out.
