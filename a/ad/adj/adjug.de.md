# Privacy Policy - IgnitionOne

**LAST UPDATED: **July 27, 2015****

IgnitionOne, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary Netmining LLC (collectively, “IgnitionOne” “Netmining” or “we”) offers a suite of digital marketing services under the brand names IgnitionOne, Netmining and AppAudience and select partners offer those services under the brand name APX Programmatic.  Our digital marketing services are designed to help online advertisers generate a higher return on their marketing and media buying investment. In the course of providing services to our customers, IgnitionOne may collect, use, and disclose information. We have three primary lines of business: 1) behavioral advertising services (“Behavioral Advertising Services”), 2) optimization and analytics services we provide on behalf of our customers (“Optimization and Analytics Services”), and 3) data management platform services (“Data Management Platform Services”) we provide for our customers through the IgnitionOne data management platform (“IgnitionOne DMP”). Behavioral Advertising Services, Optimization and Analytics Services and IgnitionOne DMP are collectively, the “Services”. This Privacy Policy does not address the collection, use or disclosure of information by any other means; if you wish to understand our practices with respect to information we collect via our websites, please review our [IgnitionOne General Privacy Policy](http://www.ignitionone.com/?page_id=149). We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy. You can determine when this Privacy Policy was last revised by referring to the “LAST UPDATED” legend at the top of this page.

IgnitionOne is a member of the [Network Advertising Initiative](http://www.networkadvertising.org/) (“NAI”), which is a cooperative of online marketing and analytics companies committed to building consumer awareness and establishing responsible business and data management practices and standards. IgnitionOne complies with the [2015 NAI Code of Conduct](http://www.networkadvertising.org/code-enforcement/code), the cross-industry Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising as managed by the [Digital Advertising Alliance](http://www.aboutads.info/) (“DAA”) as well as the [Digital Advertising Alliance EU](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/) (“eDAA”) and the [Digital Advertising Alliance Canada](http://youradchoices.ca/) (“DAAC”).

**1.) The Services We Provide at IgnitionOne**

**Behavioral Advertising Services**. We operate an online advertising service that helps advertisers customize, target and report on the advertisements we purchase on their behalf across third party websites and mobile applications. While purchasing these ads across third party websites and mobile apps, we collect information about the sites that you and others may visit, and the searches that you and others may conduct while online in order to serve advertisements that we believe are more relevant to your interests. Where we can reasonably infer that a particular computer and mobile device belong to the same user or household, we may extend our Behavioral Advertising Services and our advertising campaigns across those devices. We also work with third-party data companies that help us tailor ads. If you want to opt-out from having your information used for our Behavioral Advertising Services, please visit the section of this policy entitled “Opt-out Choice” located below.

**Optimization and Analytics Services.**  We also provide many of our customers with Optimization and Analytics Service, which help those customers (which are generally brands and other companies seeking to advertise online) manage their digital advertising programs. For example, we may help these businesses customize your experience when you visit their website, generate leads and manage their keyword search advertising programs. Where we can reasonably infer that a particular computer and mobile device belong to the same user or household, we may extend our Optimization and Analytics Services and our advertising campaigns across those devices. Because we undertake these activities on behalf of our customers, you should also consult our customers’ privacy policies to learn more about their practices.

**Data Management Platform Services.**  We provide our customers with Data Management Platform Services via the IgnitionOne DMP, including email delivery and attribution, database management and mobile messaging services. We store Personal Information such as name, email address and telephone number in the IgnitionOne DMP but ensure that any Personal Information from the DMP is appropriately safeguarded and segregated from data collected pursuant to our Behavioral Advertising Services as mandated by the NAI and other industry self-regulatory codes. We follow the law and applicable industry self-regulatory codes with respect to processing data within the IgnitionOne DMP. In providing the Data Management Platform Services, IgnitionOne acts as a service provider for our customers and processes data under the specific instructions of those customers. Our customers, not IgnitionOne, own the data stored in the IgnitionOne DMP. As such, the use of the data contained in the IgnitionOne DMP is subject to the privacy policies of our customers. If you want to opt-out from receiving certain marketing messages via the IgnitionOne DMP, please visit the section of this policy entitled “Opt-out Choice” located below.

**2.) The Information We Collect And How it is Used**

Non-Personal Information is information that does not reveal your specific identity. We and our third party service providers may collect Non-Personal Information from you in the course of providing the Services to our customers, including by placing cookies and using other tracking technologies such as “pixel tags,” “web beacons” or “clear GIFs.” Where we serve ads into mobile applications, we may collect precise location information (e.g., lat/long) of your device and we may utilize the advertising ID offered by the mobile operating system providers.

Our Behavioral Advertising Services allow our advertisers to show you advertisements that are selected for you based on your past behavior on websites and mobile devices where we purchase advertisements on behalf of our customers. When you use one of the third-party mobile applications or visit a web page on one of the third-party websites where we purchase ads, we will serve advertisements that are tailored to your interests based upon information stored in our systems. We also collect data that allows us to infer that two devices (e.g., a laptop computer and a mobile phone) are likely to be part of the same household. We collect information such as the URLs you visit, your browser type, your operating system, the date and time of your request and the duration of your visit to each page, and certain commercially viable keywords pertaining to the searches you conduct. As discussed above, when we provide Optimization and Analytics Services to our customers, we also collect information about your activities on our customers’ websites. The data contained in the IgnitionOne DMP is subject to the privacy policies of our customers. We generally keep the information we collect pursuant to our Behavioral Advertising Services separate from the information we collect pursuant to our Optimization and Analytics Services.

**IP Addresses.**  We collect IP Addresses pursuant to the Services. Your IP Address is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). Collecting IP Addresses is standard practice on the Internet and is done automatically by many websites. We use IP addresses for purposes such as guessing your geographic location, providing our customers with geographic-specific reporting, helping diagnose server problems, and administering the Services. Please note that we treat IP Addresses, server log files, computer IDs and related information as Non-Personal Information, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law.

**Personal Information.**  Is information that identifies you as an individual, such as your name, email address, postal address, telephone number and/or fax number. We do not collect Personal Information through the Behavioral Advertising Services and we do not merge or let our affiliates, customers or other third parties merge Personal Information with the Non Personal Information we use for our Behavioral Advertising Services.

We collect Personal Information as part of our Optimization and Analytics Services and our Data Management Platform Services. For example, we may collect names, email addresses and postal addresses as part of an online lead generation campaign or an email marketing campaign on behalf of one of our customers. We don’t make independent use of such data, we use that information only as directed by our client, and ensure that this information is appropriately safeguarded and segregated from data collected pursuant to our Behavioral Advertising Services.

**3.) Your Opt-out Choices**

**Opt-Out Choice Mechanism.**  You can opt-out of our Behavioral Advertising Services as follows:

  * You can visit the IgnitionOne / Netmining opt-out page at <https://ione.netmng.com/optout.php>[ ](https://ione.netmng.com/optout.php)and follow the instructions.  
You can visit the self-regulatory program opt-out pages at <http://www.aboutads.info/choices/>or<http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp>[ ](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp)for the U.S., <http://www.youronlinechoices.com/> for the EU and<http://youradchoices.ca/> choices for Canada. If you select the “opt out” button there for IgnitionOne / Netmining, we will delete your existing netmng.com or IgnitionOne.com online behavioral advertising cookie(s) and try to place a new cookie that instructs us not to track your future activities for the purposes of serving online behavioral advertising when we detect that cookie. If your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit our opt-out page, we cannot set our no-track cookie. Also, if you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different computer or change web browsers, you will need to opt-out again.  
• Many of the advertisements we deliver via the Services will contain the advertising option Icon, a symbol that we license from the [Digital Advertising Alliance](http://www.aboutads.info/). If you click onto the advertising option icon, you will see more information about behavioral advertising, including a mechanism that enables you to opt-out from IgnitionOne / Netmining and other DAA member companies.
