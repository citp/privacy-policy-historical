<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>    
<h3>Overview</h3>
Adblade.com and its network of owned and partnered publishers
("Adblade") places importance on the privacy of our clients
and their businesses. We adhere to the policies regarding privacy and
security outlined below. If you have any questions, comments or
concerns, please do not hesitate to contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@adblade.com">privacy@adblade.com</a>
Please familiarize yourself with the policies that are applicable to
you. 
<br><br><br>
<h2>Adblade Privacy Policy</h2>
<h3>Adblade Advertisers </h3>
If an individual or business chooses to sign up as an advertiser
on the Adblade Premium Advertising Network, they are explicitly
agreeing to the use of information they provide as described below.
The nature of this technology means that advertisers who do not agree
with this policy cannot use the Adblade Premium Advertising Network,
advertising interface or measurement tools. The Terms and Conditions
that they agree to during registration allow Adblade to update the
terms of this privacy policy at any time and without notice. It is an
Advertiser's responsibility to review this privacy policy prior to
logging in. Use of Adblade is conditioned on advertiser’s
acceptance without modification of the terms, conditions, and notices
contained herein. Use of the Adblade Premium Advertising Network
constitutes your agreement to all such terms, conditions, and
notices. 
<br>
Personal information
provided by an advertiser will be combined with information about its
purchasing patterns of Adblade's products and services, performance
of its advertisements, and all other information provided by the
advertiser.  Adblade regularly shares this information with key
partners on an individual basis. Furthermore, Adblade and its
partners may use this information to contact the advertiser about
additional products and services.
<br>
An advertiser has
the right to terminate their relationship with Adblade in accordance
with the terms and conditions set forth in the advertiser's contract
with Adblade. However, all information captured about the advertiser
will remain the property of Adblade indefinitely.
<br><br><br>

<h2>Adblade AdNetwork Privacy Policy</h2>
<h3>Ad Serving</h3>
Adblade partners with numerous companies to provide online
advertisements to "End Users" which are human users across
various websites on the internet. As an End User browses the web, he
or she may visit web-pages that include references to Adblade's
advertising service. When this happens, an End User's browser may
request advertisements from Adblade's system. <br>When Adblade
receives these requests, we may record information about this
interaction (as well as any further interaction with our
advertisements such as clicks, mouse movements, etc.) including the
End User's IP address and time of request, information about the
general geographical location from which an End User is viewing an
advertisement and other information made available by the
browser.<br><br>Additionally, Adblade employs small text files stored
on your web browser (otherwise known as cookies) for the purpose of
better tailoring advertisements to an End User's preferences over
time. These cookies may include a unique anonymous identifier along
with information about the particular types of content in which the
End User has shown interest. <br><br>On occasion, partner sites,
vendors or internally run surveys may provide us with additional
information about End Users. In these situations, all information is
kept entirely anonymous and does not include any type of personally
identifiable information. Adblade only accepts this information from
organizations with clearly available and visible privacy policies.
<br><br>Adblade does not sell information it collects about End
Users. However, Adblade may share data about aggregate usage
statistics with the public or other businesses with whom we work.
<br><br>The capture, storage and analysis of information are solely
for the purposes of ensuring a positive End User experience,
eliminating fraudulent activity, and system administration.

<h3>Organizations We Work With</h3>
Adblade provides access to organizations we work with on
Adblade's Premium Advertising Network to manage their own advertising
networks. Those relationships are managed under contracts between
Adblade and the respective partners. The campaign management tools
which Adblade provides to many of its partners allow each such
partner to view all relevant information of Adblade's advertisers
whose ads are being displayed on that partner's site. Such
information includes bidding data, spend data, topics and placements
viewed and purchased.
<br><br><br>

<h2>General PrivacyPolicy</h2>
<h3>Adblade Targeted Advertising and How to Opt-out</h3>
"Cookies" are small data files that are sent to your
browser and are stored on your hard drive, keeping track of your
general activity on a site. When you make subsequent visits to our
site or another site on our Advertising Network, your cookie gives us
a summary of your preferences and past experiences on the site. This
allows us to tailor Adblade services to your needs. Your cookie may
be altered at different times throughout your visits to a site, and
it is updated frequently as you use various Adblade features and
services.  We keep different data for different lengths of time. 
Include/Exclude Segment Categories (1 year). Ad Clicker (5 years).
Conversion Cookie (1 month). Frequency Cap (varies by advertiser).
Impression/Click Validator (Immediate).  All server data is kept for
2 years and contains no personally identifiable information.  All
data is deleted at the end of relevant period.<br><br>Every time you
use Adblade services, our server may deliver certain customized
information to you based on the data stored in your cookie. You may
opt-out of our cookie-based targeted advertising.  <a href="/doc/opt-out-in"><u>Click
here</u></a>
to view/change your preferences for the Adblade Targeted Advertising
program. Adblade shall retain data collected and used for these
activities only as long as necessary to fulfill a legitimate business
need, or as required by law. We comply with the <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/os/2009/02/P085400behavadreport.pdf"><u>FTC
Online Behavioral Advertising Principles</u></a>.<br><br>We
may use third party advertising technology providers to serve
advertisements and provide other services on this site and in
connection with our Advertising Network. These services may include
the use of web beacons, web bugs, action tags and third party cookies
which read our cookies, or visa-versa, or involve the use of
anonymous supplemental information (described below). To opt-out of
certain behavior targeting programs not associated with Adblade,
<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp"><u>click
here</u></a>
for the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) opt-out
tool.<br><br>"Clickstream data" is a trail of electronic
information that is left at each web site you visit. This information
can be collected and stored by a site's server. We may, for example,
use clickstream data to tell us the type of computer and browsing
software you use, the address of the site from which you encountered
Adblade Advertisements, how much time you spend on each page of our
site, how you navigate throughout the site and how we may tailor our
web pages to better meet the needs of our users.  To
opt out of the Adblade Targeting Program, your browser must be set to
accept cookies. &nbsp;If you clear your browser's cookies, you may
need to opt out again.

<h3>Data Security</h3>
We have implemented reasonable security measures to protect the
information in our care, both during transmission and once we receive
it. This includes, but is not limited to, the use of firewalls and
encryption. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of
electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use
commercially acceptable means to protect your information, we cannot
guarantee its absolute security.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
Adblade works hard to respect the privacy of its users. Unless
required otherwise by applicable law or legal process, Adblade will
operate entirely within the policies described above. If you have any
questions or concerns regarding this policy, please feel free to
contact <a href="mailto:privacy@adblade.com"><u>privacy@Adblade.com</u></a>
<br><br>
Adblade reserves the
right to change this policy at any time due to changes in applicable
laws, Adblade's business needs or otherwise. Use of Adblade.com and
the advertising network of owned and partnered websites which utilize
Adblade's services constitute agreement with the terms of this policy
as may be amended by Adblade from time to time. <br><br>
