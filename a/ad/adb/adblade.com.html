          <br>
          Adblade.com and its network of owned and partnered  facebook applications ("Adblade") places importance on the privacy of  our clients and their businesses. We adhere to the policies regarding privacy  and security outlined below. If you have any questions, comments or concerns,  please do not hesitate to contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@adblade.com" target="_blank">privacy@Adblade.com</a>.  Please familiarize yourself with the below sections that are applicable to you. <br>
          <br>
          <strong>Ad Serving</strong> <br>
          <br>
          Adblade partners with numerous companies to provide online  advertisements to "End Users" which are human users of Facebook.com  and various websites on the internet. As an End User browses the web, he or she  may visit web-pages that include references to Adblade's advertising service.  When this happens, an End User's browser may request advertisements from Adblade's  system. <br>
      When Adblade receives these requests, we may record  information about this interaction (as well as any further interaction with our  advertisements such as clicks, mouse movements, etc.) including the End User's  IP address and time of request, information about the general geographical  location from which an End User is viewing an advertisement, Information passed  from a Facebook application through Facebook's open API and other information  made available by the browser.<br>
          </span><span class="style11"><br>
        Additionally, Adblade employs small text files stored on  your web browser (otherwise known as cookies) for the purpose of better  tailoring advertisements to an End User's preferences over time. These cookies  may include a unique anonymous identifier along with information about the  particular types of content in which the End User has shown interest. <br>
        <br>
        On occasion, partner sites, vendors or internally run  surveys may provide us with additional information about End Users. In these  situations, all information is kept entirely anonymous and does not include any  type of personally identifiable information. Adblade only accepts this  information from organizations with clearly available and visible privacy  policies. <br>
        <br>
        Adblade does not sell information it collects about End  Users. However, Adblade may share data about aggregate usage statistics with  the public or other businesses with whom we work. <br>
        <br>
        Because Adblade takes privacy seriously, End Users can opt  out of being identified individually on our network. If an End User chooses to  opt out of individual identification within the Adblade network, Adblade will  set a small cookie for the sole purpose ensuring that such End User is no  longer tracked individually. This cookie will last for one year as long as the  End User does not delete cookies or change computers.&nbsp; If an End User  deletes its cookies after opting out, he or she will need to opt out again by  clicking the link in this paragraph. End Users also have the option, at any  time, to set their browser to not accept cookies from Adblade. In these  situations Adblade's system will still provide advertisements to the End User.  Please note, however, that these advertisements may be less relevant to such  End User's interests. <br>
        <br>
        The capture, storage and analysis of information are  solely for the purposes of ensuring a positive End User experience, eliminating  fraudulent activity, and system administration. <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Adblade Advertisers</strong> <br>
        <br>
        If an advertiser chooses to sign-up to Adblade's Facebook  advertising network, they are explicitly agreeing to the use of information  they provide as described below. The nature of this technology means that  advertisers who do not agree with this policy cannot use Adblade's Facebook advertising  network, advertising interface or measurement tools.&nbsp; The Terms and  Conditions that they agree to during registration allow Adblade to update the  terms of this privacy policy at any time and without notice. It is an  Advertiser's responsibility to review this privacy policy prior to logging in.  Use of Adblade is conditioned on your acceptance without modification of the  terms, conditions, and notices contained herein. Your use of the Adblade  constitutes your agreement to all such terms, conditions, and notices. <br>
        Personal information provided by an advertiser will be  combined with information about its purchasing patterns of Adblade's products  and services, its use of Adblade's Facebook API, performance of its  advertisements, and all other information provided by the advertiser. This  information will be used to improve the applications provided to advertisers,  improve the relevancy of ad results and any other use deemed helpful to the Adblade  enterprise. Adblade regularly shares this information with key partners on an  individual basis. Furthermore, Adblade and its partners may use this  information to contact the advertiser about additional products and services. <br>
        An advertiser has the right to terminate their  relationship with Adblade in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth  in the advertiser's contract with Adblade. However, all information captured  about the advertiser will remain the property of Adblade indefinitely.<br> 
        <br>
        <strong>Organizations We Work  With</strong> <br>
        <br>
        Adblade provides access to organizations we work with on Adblade's  Facebook advertising network to manage their own advertising networks. Those  relationships are managed under contracts between Adblade and the respective  partners. The campaign management tools which Adblade provides to many of its partners  allow each such partner to view all relevant information of Adblade's Facebook  advertisers whose ads are being displayed on that partner's site. Such  information includes bidding data, spend data, topics and placements viewed and  purchased, and the advertiser's contact information. <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Conclusion</strong> <br>
        <br>
        Adblade works hard to respect the privacy of its users.  Unless required otherwise by applicable law or legal process, Adblade will  operate entirely within the policies described above. If you have any questions  or concerns regarding this policy, please feel free to contact <a href="mailto:privacy@adblade.com">privacy@Adblade.com</a> </span></p>
