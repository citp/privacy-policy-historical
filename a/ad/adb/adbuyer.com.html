                                        <p>In the course of delivering an ad to you, AdBuyer.com does not collect personally identifiable information about you. In other words, we do not collect information, such as your name, address, phone number, or email address. However, AdBuyer.com does collect certain non-personally identifiable information about you, such as your browser type (e.g. Firefox or Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you use (e.g. Macintosh or Windows), and whether you responded to the ad delivered.  The non-personally identifiable information that we collect is used for the purpose of targeting ads and measuring the effectiveness of ads on behalf of AdBuyer.com customers. This non-personally identifiable information includes common information found in every communication sent over the Internet. Using this information, AdBuyer.com can infer information such as:</p>
                                        <ol>
                                      <li>Domain Type; Browser type (e.g., Netscape or Internet Explorer); operating system (e.g., Macintosh or Windows); browser language (e.g., Java or Unix); Internet service provider (e.g., MindSpring or AOL). We may also receive non-personally identifiable data, such as behavioral, contextual or demographics, through partnerships with online and offline 3rd party data providers.</li></ol>
                                      <p>In addition, you should be aware that AdBuyer.com works with ad serving and other companies in connection with the delivery of ads to you, and that such companies may also collect the types of non-personally identifiable information described above when you view an ad.</p>

                                        <p><strong>About Cookies</strong></p>
                                      <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                      <p>Like most Internet sites, AdBuyer.com uses "cookies" to enhance user's experience on the Web. AdBuyer.com cannot use these cookies to personally identify you in any way, and these cookies in no way damage your system or files.</p>
                                      <p><br>
                                          <strong><em>What are cookies and  how do they enhance your Web experience?</em></strong> <br>
                                      An AdBuyer.com cookie is a unique number that is assigned to you the first time we serve you an ad or identify you on a client’s
                                      website. This number is stored in a file on your computer and helps us deliver the optimal ad to you. For instance, cookies help
                                      AdBuyer.com ensure that you don't repeatedly see the same advertisement. Cookies can also help advertisers measure how you utilize
                                      an advertiser's site and the effectiveness of an advertisement. This information can then be used by advertisers to better cater to
                                      your needs. In other words, cookies help us deliver to you the types of ads in which you are more interested.</p>
                                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                      <p>Although AdBuyer.com believes that cookies help enhance your experience on the Web by delivering more relevant messages to you,
                                      we do not need cookies to deliver ads to you. If you decline a AdBuyer.com cookie, you will still be able to view ads; however,
                                      you may see the same ad repeatedly or be delivered ads that have no relevance to you.</p>
                                      <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                      <p><strong>How long is data stored?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
                                      <p>AdBuyer.com sets our cookies to expire after two years and the expiration date updates every time you encounter our server. 
                                      We retain the web log data for ninety days and aggregations and reports for up to three years.</p>

<p><strong>About Pixels </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pixels (also known as web beacons) are  used in combination with cookies to help web publishers understand how visitors  interact with their web sites. A pixel is a transparent graphic image that is  placed on a site. The use of a pixel allows a web site to measure the actions  of the visitor opening the page that contains the pixel. AdBuyer.com may  utilize clear gifs to measure visitor behavior, to help us improve visitor  experience, and to manage Site content.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>AdBuyer.com Data Collection for our Corporate Site</strong></p>
<br>
<p>
AdBuyer.com may ask for personally identifiable information (“PII”), such as your name, address or email address, when you register for certain
AdBuyer.com services that require registration and a password. We will use your PII to provide you with the service(s) you have registered for.
If you provide PII to make an inquiry about our products or services, we will use that PII to respond to your inquiry. Similarly,
if you are an existing customer with questions, concerns or technical support questions, we will use your PII to respond to such questions 
and concerns. We may send you emails describing our then-existing services or notifying you of enhancements or new services we are providing. 
To opt-out of such emails, you may email us at <a href="mailto:accounts@AdBuyer.com">accounts@AdBuyer.com</a>. We store PII on our servers in the United States. Such information is usually
deleted as space requires or in the normal course of business. To update your information, please send an email to <a href="mailto:accounts@AdBuyer.com">accounts@AdBuyer.com</a>.
</p>
<br>
<p>
AdBuyer.com also uses non-personally identifiable information from our Web site log files to determine how you found out about us, what your
interests are regarding our services, and how to further improve our site and our services.

<p>AdBuyer.com may publish or otherwise disclose anonymous, aggregate or summary information regarding our Site visitors and campaigns run on behalf of our 
clients. AdBuyer.com may also share non-personally identifiable end user level data collected in connection with certain advertising campaigns with the 
advertiser client of AdBuyer.com that is responsible for running such ad campaigns.   Those are the two general ways in which we disclose information 
regarding our clients and end users in the normal course of our business.   However in certain, unusual circumstances, we may disclose the information
we have collected from end users and our clients (whether PII or non-PII), such as when we deem it necessary to protect the legal rights of AdBuyer.com 
or its employees, agents and contractors; protect the safety and security of visitors to our Site; protect against fraud; or to comply with the law or
legal process. If AdBuyer.com sells all or part of its business or makes a sale or transfer of assets or is otherwise involved in a merger or business
transfer, we may also transfer user or client information to a third party as part of that transaction.</p>

<p>AdBuyer.com uses industry standard measures to safeguard data in our possession against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure or modification.
No transmission of data over the Internet, however, is guaranteed to be completely secure. It may be possible for third parties not under the control of

From time to time AdBuyer.com may revise this Privacy Policy. If we make revisions that change the way we collect or use PII those changes will be posted
in this Privacy Policy and the effective date will be noted at the beginning of the Policy. Therefore, you should review it periodically so that you are
