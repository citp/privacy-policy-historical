<p>In compliance with Art. 5 (b) <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>, we collect and process your personal data for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and do not further process your data in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes.</p>

We mainly collect and process such data to prevent security attacks and are thus able to provide our services to you in a secure and data-efficient manner.</li>

<li>We send emergency notifications in order to inform you about urgent issues in connection with our products.</li>

<h5 id="update-checks">Extension update checks</h5>
<p>Your browser periodically checks for updates of all your extensions, including Adblock Plus. Some general information - browser version, extension version, operating system, date of last update and your IP address - are transmitted during an update check. Updates for Adblock Plus for Android and Internet Explorer are handled by the Adblock Plus website and the data transmitted is subject to <a href="https://adblockplus.org/privacy#logs">the Adblock Plus Privacy Policy</a>. Updates to Adblock Plus for Firefox are handled by the Mozilla website and are subject to the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/privacy/">Mozilla's Privacy Policy</a>.

<h5 id="subscription-downloads">Subscription downloads</h5>
<p>If you add filter subscriptions to your Adblock Plus installation, the subscription will be requested to regularly retrieve updates. Every update results in the hosting website receiving your IP address as well as some general information like your Adblock Plus version, browser and browser version.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if a subscription download fails on several consecutive occasions, the updated address of the filter list is requested from the AdblockPlus.org domain. The data transmitted includes the Adblock Plus version, subscription address and any information about the error encountered. This data is used to identify issues that have not been reported by subscription maintainers and is subject to this <a href="https://adblockplus.org/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

Parameter values are removed from all transmitted addresses to avoid unintentionally leaking private information.</p>
<p>You can  voluntarily:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide your email address in order for us to request more information from you or to update you on the issue.</li>

<p>The processed reports can only be accessed by an individual who knows their unique ID. These IDs are only shared with:</p>
<ol>
<li>Maintainers of the filter subscriptions mentioned in the report, as EasyList authors, who are not employed at eyeo.</li>
<li>Certain members of eyeo’s filter list team. eyeo will use the reports for troubleshooting and support monitoring purposes only.</li>
</ol>
<h5 id="emergency-notification">Emergency notification</h5>
<p>Adblock Plus contains an emergency notification mechanism that allows it to notify users about important issues affecting their Adblock Plus installation. This feature requires all Adblock Plus installations to query an address in the AdblockPlus.org domain regularly to retrieve the list of active notifications. This request makes your IP address visible to the website and also sends some general information like your Adblock Plus version, browser, browser version and the number of previous Adblock Plus downloads (the download number is limited to four, and will be displayed as 4+ after reaching this number). This data allows serving different notifications to different clients and is subject to this <a href="https://adblockplus.org/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
<h5 id="further-requests">Further requests</h5>
<p>Adblock Plus may make further requests to AdblockPlus.org as required. For example, a documentation link is clicked or the full list of filter subscriptions needs to be downloaded. These requests are subject to this <a href="https://adblockplus.org/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
<h5 id="data-retention">Data retention</h5>
<p>Data related to subscription downloads, extension update checks, emergency notifications, Issue Reporter data (as well as the full reports and their associated data) are automatically removed after 30 days. Only a subset of the data will be kept longer. This includes only the country code of users filing an issue (extracted from the IP address) for analytic purposes, which is stored separately from the full reports and cannot be connected to an individual after deletion of the full reports.</p>
<p>Adblock Plus stores some data in <a href="http://support.mozilla.com/kb/Profiles">the Firefox profile</a> on your computer. Adblock Plus never transmits this data to any servers, but other extensions and services, such as <a href="https://mozilla.com/privacy-policy/">Firefox Sync</a>, may do so. Most of the data (your preferences, filter subscriptions and custom filters) is unobjectionable privacy-wise. However, filter hit statistics and recent issue reports could be used to reconstruct your browsing history. Adblock Plus treats this information identically to how history data is treated by the browser; this data isn't stored if you are using <a href="http://support.mozilla.com/kb/Private+Browsing">private browsing mode</a> and is removed if you choose to clear your browsing history.</p>
<h4 id="adblock-browser-android">Adblock Browser for Android</h4>
<p>Adblock Browser for Android is based on Mozilla's Firefox browser.

<h6 id="retention-crash-reports">Data retention:</h6>
<p>All reports stored on our servers are removed after 30 days.</p>
<h4 id="collection-processing-of-websites">Collection and processing on our websites</h4>
<p>When using our websites, as AdblockPlus.org and AdblockBrowser.org (Websites), we automatically collect the following data in order to provide you with our services, and for security reasons:</p>
<h5 id="auto-collected-info">Automatically collected information</h5>
<h6 id="website-logs">Website logs</h6>
<p>All requests to our Websites are recorded in the website logs. Data stored includes your IP address (solely for the purpose of IT security and only accessible by eyeo's IT Security team), the time at which the request was made, the web address accessed, the browser identifier and the referring page. This data (IP address only aggregated via hashing with a daily changing salt) is used to generate usage statistics as well as to investigate potential security issues and forum or blog spam. Detailed logs are retained for a period of 30 days, after which only the aggregated usage statistics that cannot be connected to a single user remain. Everything else is deleted.</p>
<h6 id="retention-website-requests">Data retention</h6>
<p>The request to our Websites, including your IP address, is stored when you create a forum post, submit a contact form, or add a blog comment. This allows administrators to effectively address spam content and security breaches. All stored requests are deleted after 30 days.</p>
<h6 id="cookies">Cookies</h6>
<p>Several areas of our Websites use cookies to recognize signed-in users or to store settings. Cookies are small files that are stored on your computer with the help of your internet browser. Cookies are not evaluated in any other manner and are never used to track Website visitors. If you do not want to enable cookies, you can opt against using them by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser. Please note that the efficiency and range of eyeo's services may be restricted as a result.</p>
<h6 id="google-analytics">Google Analytics</h6>

<h6 id="adblock-ai">At adblock.ai</h6>
<p>On our website, adblock.ai, we automatically collect the following information:</p>
<p id="facebook-messenger-integration"><strong>Facebook Messenger integration</strong></p>
<p>We have embedded the Facebook Messenger functionality, owned by Facebook, Inc., into the adblock.ai website to enable you to submit screenshots to our bot (“Adblock AI”) via Messenger, without having to access the Facebook website. Please note that Messenger is hosted by Facebook. We have disabled the function that would otherwise send personal data to Facebook when you access our website; however, when you click on the button to help train Adblock AI with your screenshots (“START NOW”) you will activate Messenger. Only then will some personal data, including IP address, be transferred to Facebook. For more information, please review Facebook's <a href="https://facebook.com/privacy/explanation">Privacy Policy</a>. <strong>If you do not want to transfer data to Facebook, please do not click on the button to send information to Adblock AI through Facebook Messenger.</strong></p>
<h5 id="voluntary-info">Information you give to us on a voluntary basis</h5>
<p>The Adblock Plus <a href="https://adblockplus.org/forum/">forum</a> and <a href="https://adblockplus.org/blog/">blog</a> are both publicly available to all visitors. If you write a post or comment, we collect and process personal data as follows:</p>
<h6 id="forum-registration">Forum registration</h6>
<p>We use personal data you entered during forum registration to form the user's public profile, which is visible to other forum visitors for the purpose that users can associate forum posts with a particular person.</p>
<p>Passwords and email addresses will not be visible to other forum visitors.</p>
<ul>
<li>Passwords go through one-way encryption before they are stored on the server.</li>
<li>Email addresses are only displayed in the public profile if explicitly agreed to. By default, they are only used for the sending of notifications to which you subscribed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Registration is not required to read articles in the forum and you can delete your account at any time.</p>
<h6 id="blog-comments">Blog comments</h6>
<p>When you add a comment on the Adblock Plus <a href="https://adblockplus.org/blog/">blog</a>, you can optionally specify an email address. Unlike the other fields, the email address is never displayed to other visitors and is only used to notify the comment author about replies to their comments, if any.</p>
<h6 id="email-collection">Email collection</h6>
<p>Some of eyeo's Websites host product campaigns that rely on email collection. For example, you can request a link by email to install Adblock Browser on your mobile device. We do not use third parties to manage these campaigns. Instead, data that you submit is handled in-house (i.e. turned into an email or used to send the email). We will never share or sell your email address, or any other information collected, to any third parties.</p>
<h6 id="retention-communications">Email collection</h6>
<p>Data provided by you in connection with our blog and our forum will be retained for the same time as the comment and / or your account exists.</p>
<p>In general, we do not store your email address unless it’s specifically required to execute the related campaign (i.e. email signups for a newsletter or signing up to get notified about a product launch). In cases where we do store your email address, we only store it for the length of time that is needed to execute the campaign (i.e. once you’ve been notified of the launch).</p>
