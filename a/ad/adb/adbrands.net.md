**Information Automatically Logged  **

The Adbrands.net web server automatically collects information about which pages are visited and the IP address or domain name of visitors, and information about where the user has come from. We use this data to ensure that the site's contents are relevant to users, for internal review and for audits of visitor traffic. We do not hold any information that personally identifies any visitor. Usage logs are periodically deleted. 

**Cookies**

Adbrands.net's internal ad server uses cookies to make sure you don't see the same ad repeatedly. We also use an outside ad company, Burst Media, to display ads on our site. These ads may contain cookies, which are collected by our ad company. We do not have access to this information.

**Registration Forms**

The subscriber registration form requires users to give us contact information (like their name, email, and postal code) and unique identifiers (like a username and password). Contact information is used if we need to get in touch with customers. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. Unique identifiers are collected from subscribers to verify their identity when logging into the system. The financial information (for example credit card details) that is collected on the registration form is held within the secure server of our transaction agents, Netbanx Ltd, part of the [NetInvest Group](http://www.netinvest.co.uk/). We do not have access to this information, we will not renew subscriptions without the specific instruction of each subscriber.
