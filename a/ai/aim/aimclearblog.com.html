								<p>This Privacy Policy applies to the website you are currently viewing and informs you what information is collected and used on this website and your rights to access, see and use information on the website. By visiting or using aimClear’s website, you consent to the data collection and use practices described in this policy. The mere act of visiting the website, even without reading the subject legal document, will be viewed as acceptance of the terms contained in that document.</p>
<h3>1. COLLECTION OF INFORMATION</h3>
<p>A. Purpose. Users can access limited features of this website without disclosing personal information. In order to access the entire website, users must register for an account, which will provide the registrant with full access to the website, including access to the website’s blogs that may exist.</p>
<p>B. Information Sought During Registration. During the account registration process, you will be asked to submit personal information, including your proper name and at least one active e-mail address. At this time, you will also have the opportunity to subscribe to any and all website newsletters aimClear may offer regarding aimClear’s product news, services and special offers or events. Registrants can also unsubscribe to these newsletters at any time by updating registration account information online.</p>
<p>C. Information Sought During Website Sweepstakes or Contests. When the website offers sweepstakes or contests, personal information is collected with the sole purpose of notifying you if you win the sweepstakes or contest.</p>
<p>D. Automatically Collected Information. Information concerning your computer hardware and software is automatically collected. This information may include: your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring website addresses. aimClear uses this information to maintain the quality of its service and to provide general statistics about website visitors.</p>
<p>E. Storage and Transfer of Personally Identifiable Information. aimClear may store and process in the United States or any other country in which aimClear or its affiliates, subsidiaries, or agents maintain facilities. By using aimClear’s websites, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country.</p>
<h3>2. USE OF AND SHARING OF INFORMATION</h3>
<p>aimClear collects and uses your personal information in order to operate the web sites and to provide its online and electronic services. The collection of your e-mail address, name and address during account registration enables aimClear to send you any requested newsletter(s) or to send you any requested mailings or offers. Information concerning your geographical location is used to determine if aimClear should provide regionalized information to its customers. When you voluntarily enter a sweepstakes or contest, we request your e-mail address and other contact information in order to be able to contact you in the event you are a winner of the sweepstakes or contest. Except as otherwise stated below, the personal information you provide on this site will not be shared with any third-parties, although aimClear reserves the right to share such information with its affiliates and subsidiaries without your permission.</p>
<p>aimClear sometimes hires other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, such as sending newsletters, providing customer service, and performing statistical analysis of our services. We will only provide those companies with the information that they need to provide us with such services, and we prohibit them from using that information for any other purpose.</p>
<p>aimClear’s websites reserve the right to disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on aimClear or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of aimClear or one of aimClear’s websites; and, (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of aimClear, its websites, or the public.</p>
<p>aimClear provides links to send e-mail messages to this website for your convenience and your e-mail address is used so that this website may reply to your inquiry. aimClear tracks the pages on this website that our customers visit in order to determine which areas of the site are the most popular. This data is used to deliver customized content and advertising within the website to customers whose behavior indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area.</p>
<h3>3. INFORMATION FROM OTHER SOURCES</h3>
<p>We sometimes supplement the information that we receive that has been outlined in this Policy with information from other sources and companies. Such outside information includes updated delivery and address information from carriers or third parties, which enables us to correct our records and deliver your next purchase from this website or future communications more easily; account information, purchase or redemption information, and page-view information from some merchants with which we operate co-branded businesses or for which we provide technical, fulfillment, advertising, or other services; search term and search result information from some searches conducted through the Web search features; search results and links, including paid listings (such as Sponsored Links from Google); and credit history information from credit bureaus, which we use to help prevent and detect fraud and to offer certain credit or financial services to some customers.</p>
<h3>4. INFORMATION SECURITY</h3>
<p>aimClear’s sites secure the e-mail address you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. If you choose to create a profile on aimClear’s websites or if you choose to register for an account, you will be required to select a password. This password can be changed at any time after you first log into the service by using your current password. You must keep your password confidential and you must not share this information with anyone. If you share a computer with anyone, you should always log out of the website before leaving it to prevent access to your information from subsequent users of that computer.</p>
