When you register for an event or access certain content, you will be reminded your data may be shared with named third parties. We may also share your details under special circumstances such as when we believe in good faith that it is required by law. **How long we keep your personal information** We keep your personal information in line with our data-retention policy. This means that we will remove data which we have collected directly from you from our systems if: (i) you are not subscribed to any of our email updates or other services; _and_ (ii) we haven’t had any direct contact with you for more than 36 months. (This period typifies the maximum length of time that a contract could be in discussion / negotiation with us). For personal data provided to us, if any, by your company and / or any of our clients, we may be governed by individual data retention agreements with your company / the client. In certain circumstances, we have a statutory obligation to keep your personal information for a set period of time, and we will retain it accordingly. We may retain financial information needed for auditing purposes for up to seven years or otherwise as required by law.  

#### **How to keep your personal information up-to-date**

We want your personal information to be accurate and up to date. You may ask us to correct or remove inaccurate information. Please email amendments to [ **privacy@AIMGroup.com**](mailto:privacy@AIMGroup.com). We will contact you to verify your identity and, once confirmed, make the changes.  

#### **How you can find out about the information we hold about you**

You have the right to request a copy of the information that we hold about you. If you would like a copy of some or all of your personal information, please email [privacy@aimgroup.com](mailto:privacy@aimgroup.com) or write to us at the address above.

  * give you a description of it
  * tell you why we are holding it
  * tell you who it could be shared with
  * provide you with a concise and clear copy of the information



#### **Our legal basis for processing your personal information**

Much of our processing will be under the basis of “contractual obligation.” In other words, we need and use your personal information to provide services you or your company have requested from us or have contracted us to provide. However, when we communicate with you regarding products and services you may be interested in receiving from us or from current or potential partners, our basis for processing is our legitimate interest. As we are communicating with you in the context of your corporate activity and identity and not in relation to your private life, we believe this is reasonable and fair in the context of our audience. Of course, you always have the option to object, unsubscribe from our communications, and / or have your details removed as detailed below.  

#### **Asking us to suppress or remove your personal information**

If you do not want to receive information from us in the future you can quickly ask us to stop emailing you by clicking the unsubscribe link you will find on many of our service and marketing e-mails or by sending your details to [ **privacy@AIM Group.com**](mailto:privacy@dataiq.co.uk). If, additionally, you want us to remove your information entirely (and assuming we have no other obligation to keep it) please let us know and we will do this – but we would encourage you to let us continue using it for suppression purposes only, i.e. as a record that you do not want to receive further information from us.  

#### **What to do if you have a complaint**

If you have a complaint about our handling of your data, send it to [**privacy@AIMGroup.com**](mailto:privacy@AIMGroup.com) and we will deal with your request promptly. If you are not satisfied with the way your complaint was handled, you can refer your complaint to the relevant data protection regulator in your country or elsewhere in the world.  

#### **Links to other websites**

Our website may link to other websites. This privacy policy only applies to this website and the data AIM Group holds on you in its systems, so when you visit other websites, you should read their privacy policies.  

#### **Sale of business**

If this business is sold or integrated with another business your details may be disclosed to our advisers and any prospective purchasers’ advisers and will be passed on to the new owners of the business. It is therefore intended that any consents given above or on the relevant pages will benefit any purchaser of our business.  

#### **Your use of our services**

Please be sure you are aware of these policy terms while you use our site. If our terms change, the new terms will be shown on this page, and we may place notices on other pages of the website to make you may be aware of the information we collect and how we use it.
