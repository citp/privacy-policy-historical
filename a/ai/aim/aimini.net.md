Your trust is extremely important to us and we make every effort necessary to protect your privacy. aimini.net strives to offer its visitors the many advantages of Internet technology and to provide an interactive and personalized experience. We may use Personally Identifiable Information (your name, e-mail address, street address, telephone number) subject to the terms of this privacy policy. Please note this policy applies only to information collected by aimini.net online and does not impact information collected or used by aimini.net or its affiliates through other means.

**How we gather information from users.**

How we collect and store information depends on the page you are visiting, the activities in which you elect to participate and the services provided. You can visit many pages on our site without providing any information. Other pages may prompt you to provide information, such as when you register for access to portions of our site, sign up for membership. You may also provide information when you participate in sweepstakes and contests, voting and polling activities and other interactive areas of our site.

Like most Web sites, aimini.net also collects information automatically and through the use of electronic tools that may be transparent to our visitors. For example, we may log the referrer of URL, but aimini.net does not utilize cookies on this site. In certain cases, you can choose not to provide us with information, for example by setting your browser to blocking referrer of URL, but doing so may limit your ability to access certain portions of the site or may require you to re-enter your user name and password. Additionally we may not be able to customize the site's features according to your preferences.

**What we do with the information we collect.**

We will use your information only as permitted by law. Aggregated Information (information that does not personally identify you) may be used in many ways. As one example, we may combine information about your usage patterns with similar information obtained from other users to learn which pages are visited most or what features are most attractive. Aggregated Information may occasionally be shared with our advertisers and business partners, but cannot be used to contact you individually.

Personally Identifiable Information collected by aimini.net may also be used for other purposes including but not limited to site administration and troubleshooting. Certain third parties who provide technical support for the operation of our site may access such information.

As we continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner with other companies or businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets. We may also disclose your information in response to a court order, at other times when we believe we are reasonably required to do so by law, in connection with the collection of amounts you may owe to us, and/or whenever we deem it appropriate or necessary to give such information to law enforcement authorities. Please note we may not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in such cases.

**Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements.**

aimini.net expects its partners, advertisers and third-party affiliates to respect the privacy of our users. However, third parties, including our partners, advertisers, affiliates and other content providers accessible through our site, may have their own privacy and data collection policies and practices. For example, during your visit to our site you may link to, or view as part of a frame on a aimini.net page, certain content that is actually created or hosted by a third party. Also, through aimini.net you may be introduced to, or be able to access, information, Web sites, advertisements, features, contests or sweepstakes offered by other parties. aimini.net is not responsible for the actions or policies of such third parties. You should check the applicable privacy policies of those third parties when providing information on a feature or page operated by a third party.

While on our site, our advertisers, promotional partners or other third parties may use cookies or other technology to attempt to identify some of your preferences or retrieve information about you. For example, some of our advertising is served by third parties and may include cookies that enable the advertiser to determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before. Through features available on our site, third parties may use cookies or other technology to gather information. aimini.net does not control the use of this technology or the resulting information and is not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties.

**Children.**

aimini.net does not knowingly collect or solicit Personally Identifiable Information from or about children under 13 except as permitted by law. If we discover we have received any information from a child under 13 in violation of this policy, we will delete that information immediately. If you believe aimini.net has any information from or about anyone under 13, please contact our [guard](mailto:guard@aimini.net).

**Changes to this policy.**

aimini.net reserves the right to change this policy at any time. Please check this page periodically for changes. Your continued use of our site following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes. Information collected prior to the time any change is posted will be used according to the rules and laws that applied at the time the information was collected.
