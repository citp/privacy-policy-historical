**Special Notice to Parents, Teachers and Children**

**Parents and Teachers:  **When using this Service, we encourage parents, guardians and teachers to spend time with their children, especially if the child is 12 and under (“Child” or “Children”). We will never request personally identifiable information from a Child in any of our public postings areas. We will not require a Child to disclose more personally identifiable information than is reasonably necessary to participate in any online activity. WE ASK PARENTS TO HELP US PROTECT THEIR CHILDREN’S PRIVACY BY INSTRUCTING THEM NEVER TO PROVIDE PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION ON THIS SERVICE OR ANY OTHER SITE WITHOUT FIRST GETTING PARENTAL/GUARDIAN OR TEACHER PERMISSION.

**Children:** Please do not give your full name, email address, home address, telephone number or any other personally identifiable information that would enable someone to contact you either online or offline, without first asking your parent/guardian or teacher for permission.

We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from Children either directly or passively except when a Child voluntarily submits such information through a “Contact Us“ link or a public posting area within the Service, if such feature is available. If a Child emails us via a “Contact Us“ link on any child-directed area of this Site and we can identify the sender as a Child, any personally identifiable information submitted will only be used to respond on a one-time basis to such Child. In addition, if we have actual knowledge that a Child is sending or posting personally identifiable information on any area of the Service, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to delete such personally identifiable information as soon as practicable.

## Cookies and Other Technology Used to Collect Information

Cookies are small text files that we transfer to your hardware, through your web browser or app, to (a) speed your navigation on the Service, (b) recognize you and your access privileges, (c) track your usage and preferences of the Service, (d) detect the existence of any cookies previously set by our server, and (e) identify certain information on how and when you accessed the Service such as type of browser, operating system, domain names, IP addresses and the like. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on’s settings or visiting the website of its manufacturer. However, cookies allow you to take full advantage of this Service (disabling cookies may prevent proper functioning of certain parts of the Service), and we recommend that you leave them turned on.

Pearson may also use single pixels images, web beacons and other similar technology (collectively “Beacons”) to (a) track your usage of the Service, (b) track response rates to certain activities and promotions within the Service and in marketing campaigns, and (c) identify certain information on how and when you accessed the Service such as type of browser, operating system, domain names, IP addresses and the like.

**Sharing of Non-Personally Identifying Information with Third Parties**

Pearson may share with third parties (including advertising companies and networks) any anonymized information collected through the Service, including those collected through the use of cookies and Beacons technology. In such instance, we do NOT provide such third parties with any personally identifiable information about you or any other users of the Service.

BY USING THE SERVICE, YOU AGREE THAT PEARSON MAY USE, LICENSE AND OTHERWISE DISTRIBUTE ANY SUCH NON-PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION (ANONYMIZED DATA) AVAILABLE ON THIS SERVICE, WHETHER COLLECTED BY PEARSON OR A THIRD PARTY, TO ASSIST IN MARKET EVALUATION, PRODUCT ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT, EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH, AND FOR OTHER MARKETING AND COMMERCIAL PURPOSES AS REASONABLY DETERMINED BY PEARSON.

**IP Addresses** An IP address is a number that is assigned automatically to your computer whenever you use the World Wide Web. Web servers – the big computers that “serve up” Web pages – automatically identify your computer by its IP address. Pearson collects IP addresses for system administration; to report aggregate information to our advertisers, sponsors, and partners; and to audit the use of our Service.When visitors request pages from Pearson sites, our servers log the guests’ IP addresses. We typically do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means that a visitor’s session will be logged, but the visitor remains anonymous to us. We can and will use IP addresses to identify a visitor if any of the circumstances mentioned in the above section titled “Sharing Of Personally Identifying Information With Third Parties” occurs.

**Do Not Track**

This Service does not respond to your browser’s (or app’s) “do-not-track” signals or comparable signals or mechanisms. Please check our Privacy Statement frequently as this may change in the future.

**Third-Party Promotional Activities**

Within the Service, Pearson may offer contests, sweepstakes or promotions that are sponsored by third-party advertisers or sponsors. These third parties may obtain personally identifiable information that users voluntarily submit while participating in the activity. Pearson does not control the third parties’ use of such information so you should read their privacy policy before participating in such activities.

**Links to Third-Party Sites**

Links from the Service can take you to other Pearson sites – School, Higher Education, Professional, Global, among others – as well as to third-party sites and resources (collectively, “Other Sites”). The information practices of such Other Sites are not covered by this Privacy Statement or any other policies or terms of this Service. Please make sure to review such Other Site’s terms of use and privacy policies prior to interacting with such sites.

**Public Forums**

Pearson may make chat rooms, forums, message boards, web pages, and/or public spaces available to its users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas may become public information but, regardless, may be available to other users of the Service and may be used by Pearson. Consequently, you should carefully consider whether to disclose your personal information in such public areas.

Pearson has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. Essentially, we encrypt all transmission of sensitive data and secure all of our repositories of data. When you use your credit card to shop at Pearson, your transaction is secure. For the purposes of handling credit card transactions, we have contracted with a PCI DSS compliant ecommerce partner. Our servers use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), an advanced encryption technology that works with most major browsers. This technology safeguards your personal information and privacy. However, you should understand that “perfect security” is never guaranteed.

**Nature of Data on the Internet**.

Due to the complexity and open nature of the Internet, there is always a risk that information collected by and/or displayed on the Service may be compromised or accessed notwithstanding the implementation of reasonable data security measures by Pearson. To mitigate such risks, you should (a) use secure usernames and passwords and carefully protect them from disclosure; and (b) implement updated internet security and virus protection software on your computer system. Should you suspect that your computer’s security has been compromised or that your username or password may have been have been accessed by a third party, please contact us immediately and request to have your password changed.

SUBJECT TO APPLICABLE LAW, IF YOU RESIDE IN THE EUROPEAN UNION, CANADA OR OTHER JURISDICTION WITH SIMILAR DATA TRANSFER REGULATIONS, BY ACCEPTING THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, YOU EXPLICITLY CONSENT THAT THE PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE MAY BE TRANSFERRED AND STORED IN COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE EU, CANADA OR YOUR RESIDENT JURISDICTION, INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES, IN CONNECTION WITH THE TERMS OF USE, THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT, AND IN ORDER TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO YOU.
