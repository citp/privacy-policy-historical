# AIG Privacy

**Last Revised: March 26, 2007**

This website, located at [www.aig.com](http://www.aig.com/) (the “Website”), provides customers with a gateway to services offered by American International Group, Inc. (“AIG”) and its subsidiaries and affiliates (individually, an “AIG Company” and collectively “AIG Companies”, “we” or “us”). Our address is AIG Corporate eBusiness, c/o AIG.com General Counsel, 70 Pine Street, 34th Floor, New York, NY 10270. Our data collection and use policies with respect to visitors to the Website are set forth in this statement (“Policy”). By using this Website, you signify your acceptance of this Policy.

**What is “personally identifiable information”?**

When reviewing this Policy you should understand that when we use the term “personally identifiable information” we mean any information that can be used to identify or contact a specific individual, such as a name, address, telephone number or e-mail address. When we refer to “aggregate information” we mean information that does not allow us to identify or contact a specific individual such as demographic information, purchase categories (e.g., life insurance), or visitors using a particular browser to access the Website. 

**What types of personally identifiable information do AIG and the AIG Companies collect on the Website?**

We collect various types of personally identifiable information from visitors to the Website. For instance, visitors may choose to become a member of the Website (“Member”) in order to receive special e-mail offers and promotions available only to Members. To become a Member, visitors are required to sign up by providing their e-mail address, and other contact and product-related questions we may ask from time to time, such as name and whether they currently have AIG insurance.   
AIG and the AIG Companies also collect information through the AIG InfoExchange. When you submit questions or comments through the AIG InfoExchange, we may collect such personally identifiable information as first name, last name, e-mail address, telephone number, policy number and the question or comment.   


**Do AIG and the AIG Companies collect any other information about visitors to the Website?**

We constantly seek to maintain the integrity of, and make improvements to, the Website. As part of these efforts, we collect and analyze certain aggregate information about how visitors use the Website, as stated below. 

When you visit our Website, we may collect various types of technical data including (but not limited to) domain and/or Web browser information. This data is gathered using cookies and other similar technologies. Cookies are small pieces of information that our server places on a visitor’s computer hard drive to enable that person to more easily communicate and interact with the Website and to provide us with important information on how visitors use the Website. This Website uses cookies to allow you to select a preferred location view and default home page view and to let you access recently visited links (such as products, services, and individual AIG Company pages) more easily. Many Web browsers are automatically set to accept cookies. You may change your browser settings to either reject cookies or notify you when a cookie is about to be placed on your computer. Please note, however, that rejecting cookies while visiting the Website may result in certain parts of the Website not operating correctly or as efficiently as if they were allowed. You will not be able to access a preferred location view, a customized default home page view or your recently visited links.

In addition, we may use a service that collects data remotely by using so-called "pixel tags," "web beacons," "clear GIFs" or similar means (collectively, "Pixel Tags") embedded in the Website’s content. A Pixel Tag is an electronic image, often a single-pixel (1x1), that is ordinarily not visible to Website visitors and may be associated with cookies on the visitors’ hard drives. The data we collect includes which operating system and browser you use, how you navigate to and through our site, and how long you stay on our web pages. This information is anonymous and does not include your name, e-mail address or any other contact information.   
Please note that certain aggregate information may be linked with personally identifiable information. Any such linked information will be treated as personally identifiable information for the purposes of this Policy as long as it is so linked.

**What do AIG and the AIG Companies do with personally identifiable information collected on the Website?**

We will use personally identifiable information provided by visitors to fulfill the purpose for which such information was provided, as described in this Policy, or as disclosed at the time the visitor information is requested.

We use the information submitted via the AIG InfoExchange to respond to your inquiry. If your inquiry might appropriately be answered by a particular AIG Company, it may be forwarded to that company. That AIG Company will use the information to respond to your inquiry. Neither AIG nor any AIG Company will use the information submitted to the AIG InfoExchange for marketing purposes, nor share it with any third party for marketing purposes, unless you consent to this use. We also may use the information submitted to ask you follow-up questions about which products you have purchased or are considering purchasing, in order to improve our services and better understand your needs. 

AIG (and in the event information has been forwarded to an AIG Company, such AIG Company) may store the information you submit via the AIG InfoExchange for such period of time as may be necessary, in its discretion, to resolve your inquiry.

We may also offer visitors the opportunity to receive special promotions. If a visitor elects to receive such offers by becoming a Member, we will use the information provided by that visitor to send those offers.

**Can I “opt out” of receiving e-mail promotions from AIG?**

If you change your mind about receiving promotional e-mails or electronic newsletters, you may choose not to receive such communications from us by: (1) following the “unsubscribe” instructions in the specific e-mail from which you wish to opt-out or (2) sending an e-mail to reply@aig.com, specifying the particular e-mails list(s) from which you wish to be removed. We will respond to a request made pursuant to these methods as promptly as practicable. Even if you elect to stop receiving promotional e-mails from us, the AIG Companies may still contact you to tell you important information about the Website or us. 

**Do AIG and the AIG Companies share personally identifiable information with other companies?**

We will not intentionally share your personally identifiable information with unaffiliated entities except: (1) as described in this Policy or as disclosed at the time your personally identifiable information is provided; or (2) with your consent.

AIG Companies work with third parties who provide services to them and we may share your personally identifiable information with third parties, including without limitation: website hosting or information technology consulting services, marketing and promotion services, newsletters, data analysis, legal services, accounting services, and other administrative and back-up and security services. 

We may also disclose personally identifiable information in order to: (1) comply with applicable laws; (2) respond to governmental inquiries or requests; (3) comply with valid legal process; (4) protect the rights, privacy, safety or property of AIG, the AIG Companies, Website visitors or the public; (5) permit us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain; and (6) enforce our Terms of Use.

In the event there is a change in the corporate structure of AIG and the AIG Companies such as, but not limited to, merger, consolidation, sale, liquidation or transfer of substantial assets, AIG and the AIG Companies may, in their sole discretion, transfer, sell or assign information collected on and through this Website, including without limitation, personally identifiable information concerning visitors, to one or more affiliated or unaffiliated third parties.

**What do AIG and the AIG Companies do with aggregate information collected on the Website?**

Because aggregate information collected on the Website does not personally identify you, we may use aggregate information for any purpose, and share aggregate information with third parties for any purpose. 

We share the information gathered using cookies, Pixel Tags and other similar technologies with other AIG companies and with our third party vendor, WebSideStory. WebSideStory gives us reports of this aggregated data. We use this data to improve our site by responding to our users' interests and providing more relevant and useful information. For example, we use aggregate information collected on the Website to evaluate how the Website is being used. In addition, we may collect and analyze information about how many visitors arrived at certain pages of the Website, how long they stayed on those pages, and where they went afterwards. This information allows us to determine which pages might be the most interesting to and popular with visitors and enables us to provide visitors with a better and richer experience on the Website. For example, we may use certain aggregate information to improve the performance of our Website, and to customize the content and layout of our Website pages for you.

In addition, we may share statistical information derived from the information submitted via the AIG InfoExchange with third parties; however, such statistical information is not associated with any individual in a personally identifiable manner.

**If I link to another site and provide information to that site, how will that information be handled?  
**

This Website may contain links to other websites. The operator of such other website (whether AIG, an AIG Company or a third party) may collect information about you, including through cookies or other technologies. If you link to another site, you will leave this Website and this Policy will not apply to your use of and activity on those other sites.

If you provide personally identifiable information through any such site, your transaction will occur on that site (not the Website) and the personally identifiable information you provide will be collected by, and controlled by the privacy policy of, that site’s operator. Links on the Website to other websites are provided only as a convenience, and the inclusion of such links does not imply endorsement of the linked site. We encourage you to read the legal notices posted on those sites, including their privacy policies. We shall have no responsibility or liability for your visitation to, and the data collection and use practices of, such other sites. This Privacy Statement applies solely to online information collection and use practices in connection with this Website; it does not apply to any practices conducted offline or in connection with other websites owned or operated by AIG, any AIG Company or any third parties.

**How do AIG and the AIG Companies protect the information I provide to the Website?  
**

We take reasonable precautions to safeguard the personally identifiable information transmitted between visitors and the Website and the personally identifiable information stored on our servers. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, although we strive to protect your personally identifiable information, we cannot ensure the security of any information you transmit to us through or in connection with the Website. No method of transmitting or storing data is completely secure. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure, you must immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us at [reply@aig.com](mailto:%20reply@aig.com).

In the unlikely event that we believe that the security of your personally identifiable information in our possession or control may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you of that development. If a notification is appropriate, we would endeavor to do so as promptly as possible under the circumstances, and, to the extent we have your e-mail address, we may notify you by e-mail.

**Where will AIG and the AIG Companies store and maintain information about me?**

We maintain this Website in the United States. By providing personally identifiable information and other information to this Website, you understand and consent to the collection, use, processing and transfer of such information to the United States and other countries or territories, which may not offer the same level of data protection as the country where you reside, in accordance with the terms of this Policy.

**Can AIG and the AIG Companies change this Policy?  
**

Yes. We reserve the right to change this Policy in order to address future developments of AIG and the AIG Companies, the Website or changes in industry or legal trends. Depending on the nature of the change, we will either: (1) announce the change on the home page of the Website or (2) take such other action as we deem appropriate under the circumstances, including without limitation, posting the revised draft of this Policy on the Website. You can determine when this Policy was last revised by referring to the "Last Revised" legend at the top of this page. Any changes to this Policy will become effective upon posting of the revised Policy on the Internet, accessible through the Website. By continuing to use the Website following such changes, you will be deemed to have agreed to such changes. If you do not agree with the terms of this Policy, as it may be amended from time to time, in whole or part, please do not continue using this Website. If you have any questions or comments about this Policy, please feel free to contact us at [reply@aig.com](mailto:%20reply@aig.com).
