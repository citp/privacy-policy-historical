# Privacy Policy - AirTran Airways

AirTran Airways understands that you may have concerns about your privacy, and we want to assure you that we handle your personal information confidentially.

### What information do you gather during the booking process? How do you use it?

When you purchase tickets on our web site, we gather only the information necessary to complete the transaction. This includes:

  * Passenger names (first, middle and last)
  * Purchaser name 
  * Contact address 
  * Billing address 
  * Phone number 
  * Fax number (optional)
  * Email address 
  * Credit card number and expiration date



Beginning August 15, 2009, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) requires us to also collect gender and date of birth from each passenger when booking flights.

This information is used for the purpose of completing your reservation, emailing a confirmation to you, and providing the air travel services you have purchased from us. In addition, select passenger information is sent to the TSA to comply with Secure Flight program regulations and used in connection with AirTran Airways’ fraud management program.

During your purchase, we also give you the option to sign up for our Net Escapes and A-Savers email programs (see below for more details), as well as our A+ Rewards frequent flyer program, if you are not already a member.

Once inflight, AirTran Airways representatives may collect credit card information to enable inflight purchases.
