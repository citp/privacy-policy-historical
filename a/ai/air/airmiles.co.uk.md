We take great care to protect your personal information. You can read more about how we do this in our [Security Policy](https://www.avios.com/gb/en_gb/about-us/online-security?from=privacy-policy). Here are some things you can do to keep your information secure.

**Keep your booking reference confidential**

When you make a booking, you will be given a booking reference (also known as a PNR or Passenger Name Record). This will appear on the email confirmation or ticket of each person in your booking. You should keep your booking reference confidential always.Giving your booking reference to others allows them to access your booking details.If you are travelling with others and would not like your individual booking details to be accessible by them, you may prefer each person to make separate bookings.

**Be aware of and protect yourself against Internet fraud and “Phishing”**

There is a fraud practice known as "Phishing" which is the illegal gathering of personal information by deception.
