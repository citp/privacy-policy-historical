<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Information About Others</span>.&nbsp; You will have the opportunity to provide contact information for other people through our Web site.

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Information from Other Sources</span>.&nbsp; We also may periodically obtain both personal and non-personal information about you from affiliated entities, business partners and other independent third-party sources and add it to other information about you.&nbsp; For example, if you visit Airfarewatchdog by “clicking-through” from a site operated by one of our business partners, and you have registered with that partner, then information about you that you have provided to that partner may be shared with us.&nbsp; Examples of other information we may receive include contact information and demographic information.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Automatic Information</span>.&nbsp; We automatically collect some information about your computer when you visit Airfarewatchdog.&nbsp; For example, we will collect session data, including your IP address, Web browser software, and referring Web site.&nbsp; We also may collect information about your online activity, such as content viewed and pages visited.&nbsp; One of our goals in collecting this automatic information is to help us understand the interests of our users and customize your user experience.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cookies and Other Web Technologies</span>. Cookies are small data text files and can be stored on your computer’s hard drive (if your Web browser permits).&nbsp; Airfarewatchdog.com and its affiliated websites use cookies for the following general purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>To help us recognize your browser as a      previous visitor and save and remember any preferences that may have been      set while your browser was visiting our site.&nbsp; For example, if you register on our site, we may use      cookies to remember your registration information, so you do not need to      log into our site each time you visit.&nbsp; We also may record your password in a cookie, if you      checked the box entitled "Save this password for automatic      sign-in."&nbsp; Please note      that member IDs, passwords, and any other account-related data included in      such cookies are encrypted for security purposes.</li>
<li>To help us customize the content, website      experience, and advertisements provided to you on our websites and on      other websites across the Internet.&nbsp;      For example, when you access a web page, a cookie is automatically      set by us, our service providers, or our partners to recognize your      browser as you navigate on the Internet and to present you with      information and advertising based on your apparent interests.&nbsp; See <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Display of Advertising/Your      Choices</span> <a href="#_msocom_1">[A1]</a>&nbsp;for more      information about our online advertising practices and your choices.&nbsp; </li>
<li>To help measure and research the effectiveness      of website features and offerings, advertisements, and e-mail      communications (by determining which e-mails you open and act upon).&nbsp; </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers should tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable most types of cookies.&nbsp; Please note that if you refuse to accept cookies, you may not be able to access many of the travel tools offered on our sites.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our sites also may use Web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags or Web bugs), which are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, that are placed in the code of a Web page.&nbsp; We use Web beacons to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our sites to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our site from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party Web site, and to improve site performance.&nbsp; We also may allow our service providers to use Web beacons to help us understand which emails have been opened by recipients and to track the visitor traffic and actions on our site.&nbsp; This helps us measure the effectiveness of our content and other offerings.</p>

<p>Please note that we do not have access to or control over cookies or other technologies these third parties may use to collect information about your interests, and the information practices of these third parties are not covered by this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; Some of these companies are members of the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/">Network Advertising Initiative</a>, which offers a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies.&nbsp; To learn more, please click <span style="text-decoration: underline;">here</span>.&nbsp;</p>

</ul>
<p>We also may share your information:</p>
<ul>
<li>In      response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process; to establish      or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as      otherwise required by law.&nbsp; In      such cases we reserve the right to raise or waive any legal objection or      right available to us. </li>
<li>When      we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding      illegal or suspected illegal activities; to protect and defend the rights,      property, or safety of Airfarewatchdog, our customers, or others; and in      connection with our Terms of Service and other agreements.&nbsp; </li>
<li>In      connection with a corporate transaction, such as a divestiture, merger,      consolidation, or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy. </li>
