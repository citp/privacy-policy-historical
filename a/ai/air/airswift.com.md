    * We will only use your personal information for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If we need to use your personal information for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.
    * Please note that we may process your personal information without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.
    * ”Special categories” of particularly sensitive personal information require higher levels of protection. We need to have further justification for collecting, storing and using this type of personal information. We may process special categories of personal information in the following circumstances:

      * where it is needed to assess your working capacity on health grounds, subject to appropriate confidentiality safeguards.
    * Less commonly, we may process this type of information where it is needed in relation to legal claims or where it is needed to protect your interests (or someone else’s interests) and you are not capable of giving your consent, or where you have already made the information public.
    * We will use your personal information in the following special categories in the following ways:

In limited circumstances, we may approach you for your written consent to allow us to process certain particularly sensitive data. If we do so, we will provide you with full details of the information that we would like and the reason we need it, so that you can carefully consider whether you wish to consent. You should be aware that it is not a condition of your contract with us that you agree to any request for consent from us.
    * Where you have given us your consent to use your personal information in a particular manner, you have the right to withdraw this consent at any time, which you may do by contacting us as described in paragraph 8.

    * You will not be subject to decisions that will have a significant impact on you based solely on automated decision-making, unless we have a lawful basis for doing so and we have notified you.

      * request correction of the personal information that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected;
      * request the erasure of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it.
