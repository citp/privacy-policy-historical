**AIRSTREAM, INC. WEBSITE PRIVACY POLICY**

We recognize the importance of protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy applies to information Airstream, Inc. obtains from and about individuals interacting with Airstream, Inc. via the website(s) it operates (the “Website”). This Privacy Policy is designed to assist you in understanding how we collect, use and safeguard the personal information you provide to us and to assist you in making informed decisions when using our Website or otherwise.

**TYPES OF INFORMATION AIRSTREAM, INC. MAY COLLECT OR TRACK**

**Personal Information.** Personal information is information, which can be used to specifically identify you. We collect personal information when you submit it to us. For example, we collect personal information when you communicate with us, when you submit content to the Website, when you indicate an interest in our products, and when you purchase or register our products. We may also lawfully obtain information from other companies within the Thor Industries, Inc. corporate family and from third party sources, such as independent dealers, Airstream, Inc. licensees, Airstream, Inc.’s vendors, and other companies which provide lists of potential customers.

The personal information collected by Airstream, Inc. may include:

  1. Your name, address, e-mail address, social media addresses, telephone number and other contact information;
  2. Your Social Security Number;
  3. Your billing information, including your credit card number, cardholder name, expiration date, and billing address;
  4. Information concerning AIRSTREAM products you have purchased, including sales records, Vehicle Identification Numbers, make, model, selling dealer, service history and information obtained during product registration);
  5. Information concerning AIRSTREAM products in which you may be interested in purchasing or have purchased in the past;
  6. Content you submit to Airstream, Inc. via any AIRSTREAM-related Website, solicitation, promotion, or contest, including messages, essays, statements, photographs and videos; and
  7. Information accessed from social media providers, if you make use of any Website social media features, in accordance with the social media providers’ policies.



**Other Non-Personal Information.** We may also gather non-personal information that does not personally identify you. This information may include general demographic information, automatically-collected session information (such as your browser and information collected by cookies and related technologies), and compiled data.

Like many other commercial websites, our Website uses “cookies” and web server log files to collect information about how our Website is used. Information gathered through cookies and web server logs may include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at our Website, and the websites visited just before and just after our Website.

A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier. When you visit our Website, our site’s computer asks your computer for permission to store this file in a part of your hard drive specifically designated for cookies. Any website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser’s preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites. Browsers are usually set to accept cookies. However, if you would prefer not to receive cookies, you may alter the configuration of your browser to refuse cookies. If you choose to have your browser refuse cookies, it is possible that some areas of our Website will not function as effectively when viewed by the users. A cookie cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive.

We also work with third-parties to provide us with analyses of the usage and browsing patterns of visitors to our Website by tracking non-personally identifiable information about our visitors and customers. We also use similar technology to serve online advertising promoting products which our visitors and customers may be interested. These third parties include Google Analytics and Facebook. These services are cookie-based and do not collect personal information. Each third party is subject to its own privacy policy.

Through our Website, we may also collect non-personal information about the device you use to access the Website, your IP addresses, geo-location information, and unique device identifiers. While we may log your IP address for systems administration and troubleshooting purposes, we do not use your IP address to track your session, nor do we associate your IP address to anything personally identifiable.

**“DO NOT TRACK” SIGNALS**

Airstream, Inc.’s Website honors “do not track” signals.

**CALIFORNIA ONLINE PRIVACY PROTECTION ACT**

Our Website does not track your personal information over time or track personally-identifiable browsing history over other sites. Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, we do not permit third parties to gather your personally identifiable information over time and/or across different websites when using our Website. Our Website may, however, either directly or through a third party service provider, track non-personal data or browsing history over time through the use of an anonymous unique identifier.

**CALIFORNIA PRIVACY DISCLOSURES**

California residents may request Airstream to provide information concerning the manner in which Airstream shares certain categories of your personal information with third parties for direct marketing activities by third parties. The information may be presented in a standardized format not specific to you individually. The information will include: (1) the categories of information Airstream disclosed to third parties during the preceding calendar year for the purpose of direct marketing by the third party; and (2) the names and addresses of third parties to which Airstream provided such information, or, if the nature of the business of a third party cannot be discerned from the name, then examples of the products or services marketed.
