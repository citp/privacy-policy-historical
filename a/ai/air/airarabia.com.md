# Privacy policy | Air Arabia

Air Arabia is committed to protecting the privacy of information you provide us on this website and takes its responsibilities regarding the security of customer information very seriously.

Air Arabia PJSC is a company registered in Sharjah, United Arab Emirates with registration No. 39511. This Privacy Policy covers the airarabia.com website and our other Mediums, the Air Arabia airline operations and our Air Rewards loyalty program, and explains how we use personal information that we may obtain about you.

We are part of a corporate group of companies (“Air Arabia Group”), which includes Air Arabia Maroc (a company registered in Morocco with registration no 192327 and registered office at 4 Rue Carthage, Quartier les Iris, Casablanca, Morocco), Air Arabia Egypt (a company registered in Egypt with registration no 7095 and registered office at 56 Kamal Al Din Salah, Smouha, Alexandria, Egypt), Air Arabia Jordan (a company registered in Jordan with registration no 10269 and registered office at 47 Shaker Bin Zaid Street, Shemissani, Amman, Jordan) and their associated brands and/or companies from time to time.

Where you refuse to provide mandatory travel information or allow us to disclose it to required governmental agencies and as otherwise required, we will not be able to transport you.

This Privacy Policy applies even if you have booked flights via a third party (such as a travel agent or holiday company), as this Privacy Policy forms part of your [Conditions of Carriage](https://web.archive.org/conditions-carriage) and your contract with us for the travel and/or those products or services.

 **4.   Sensitive personal data**

Sensitive personal data includes data about an individual's health and religion and other categories of personal data which are closely protected. We do not generally collect this information from you (or those you are booking for), but where we do, we seek to minimize the collection and use of it.

Where you have notified us of a health issue that you or someone in your booking:

  * may require medical permission to fly, or special conditions or assistance whilst travelling (for example oxygen);
  * is pregnant; or
  * requires special assistance either on our planes, at destinations or activities or at airports,



You agree that you have voluntarily provided that information to us and that you consent (and those you are booking for consent) for us to use that information to provide you with these products or services and/or determine your fitness to avail yourself of our products or services.  
Where your religion or health status could be inferred from meal preferences, we will not link this information or use it in any other way other than to fulfil your meal request.

In each case, you specifically consent (on your behalf and on behalf of those you are booking for) that we can use your sensitive personal data and transfer outside your local country to anywhere in the world where you are travelling or have travelled from or where we provide products or services from (or the Air Arabia Group or our service providers do or your travel agent does) (see " **Disclosing your personal information** " below).

If you do not allow us to process any sensitive personal data, this may mean we are unable to provide all or parts of the services you have requested from us. Please be aware that in such circumstances you will not be entitled to cancel or obtain a refund of any price you have paid.

We may collect your email address and / or phone number for boarding pass delivery during online check-in and to provide relevant information for your booking. In some countries we also need to collect your nationality and other information for tax purposes. When you visit our Mediums, we may retain some of the above information to assess the reasons in case of incomplete booking, such as lost internet connection and to support you with completing the bookings.

(d) when you are making payment we will collect different information depending on the payment method. For example for credit card payments we will collect - credit cardholder name, card number, expiry date and CVC code. You may also choose to store your credit card details with us for future use. However, we do not store your CVC/CVV code (the security code on the back of a credit card); and

or

(b)    If you make or manage a booking for or on behalf of another person who has allowed you to do so. We need to know the names of all passengers travelling. If you are booking a flight on behalf of someone else (whether adult or a child), you must obtain their consent to use their personal information, including their sensitive personal data as described above. We proceed on the basis that you have obtained these consents. Where required by local laws, we would advise you to keep a record of their agreement and provide them with a copy of, or link to, this policy. This is especially the case if you provide us with sensitive information about them (e.g. a reference to an illness or health condition).

You may also provide information about others for purposes such as referring a friend to use so we can offer them our products or services. You must contact only those individuals via our Mediums who you know would be happy to hear from you and you must not use our products or services to send unsolicited 'spam' messages.
