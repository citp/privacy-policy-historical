Privacy & Security   
  
  
We want you to feel safe and secure booking your travel with us online. For this reason, we use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to encrypt your credit card and other sensitive information when you make reservations. The process of encryption prevents unauthorized individuals from viewing your information as it is securely transmitted over the Internet. Once received, your credit card information is not transmitted over the Internet again.

**We are very concerned about protecting the privacy of our members.**

Any personal data collected from you is used to enhance or fulfill your request for promotional services or for securing a reservation with third party vendors such as airlines, hotels or car rental agencies. We will not modify, copy, distribute, transmit, license, sell or redistribute any of your personal profile information. 

We are an active member of the American Society of Travel Agents and the International Air Transport Association, and upholds the policies and consumer rights outlined by these organizations.
