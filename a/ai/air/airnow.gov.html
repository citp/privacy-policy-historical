<h2 id="privacy">Privacy</h2>
<p><a name="rights"></a><strong>Your Rights under the Privacy Act</strong>: The <a href="http://www.epa.gov/privacy/">Privacy Act of 1974</a> protects the personal information the federal government keeps on you in “systems of records (SOR)” (information an agency controls that can be retrieved by name or some other personal identifier). The Privacy Act regulates how the government can disclose, share, provide access to, and maintain the personal information that it collects. Not all information collected online is covered by the Privacy Act.</p>

<p>The Act’s major provisions require agencies to:</p>
<ul>
<li> publish a Privacy Act Notice in the Federal Register explaining the existence, character and uses of a new or revised SOR; </li>
<li> keep information about you accurate, relevant, timely, and complete to assure fairness in dealing with you; and </li>
<li> allow you to, upon request, access and review your information held in a SOR and request amendment of the information if you disagree with it. </li>
</ul>

<p>Your viewing of EPA’s website  does not result in the collection of any personal information that is contained  in a Privacy Act System of Records as defined by the Privacy Act. Information concerning the Privacy Act can be found at: <a href="http://www.epa.gov/privacy/">epa.gov/privacy</a>.</p>

<p id="kids" name="kids"><strong>Children’s Privacy</strong>: Some EPA Web pages provide content to children. It is EPA policy, in compliance with the requirements of the <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/ogc/coppa1.htm">Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)</a>, to collect no information online about or from children under the age of 13 except when it is needed to identify a submission or to answer a question. Any such instances where information is collected on Web pages for children will be clearly marked. Unless required by law or EPA obtains parental permission in writing, the information will not be used for other purposes or shared with third parties, nor will personally identifying information be published on the EPA website. When EPA offices identify the work product of a child under thirteen on the EPA public access website, only the first name, age, and home state of the child will be stated (e.g., Mike, age 7, Kentucky) unless the parent makes a hardcopy request to have additional information posted.  <a href="http://www.epa.gov/irmpoli8/policies/2182p.pdf">More information about EPA's Children's Privacy Policy (PDF)</a> (5 pp, 72K, <a href=" http://www.epa.gov/epahome/pdf.html ">About PDF</a>).</p>

<p>We want to inform you that, for each HTTP request (which is what your Web browser generates when you request a page or part of a page from a website) received; we collect and store only the following information, in what is called a log file: </p>

<ul>
<li> the date and time</li>
<li> the originating Internet Protocol (IP) address  (this address can refer to a specific computer; more frequently, commercial Internet providers use a temporary IPA which does not link to a specific computer)</li>
<li> the type of browser and operating system used (if provided by the browser) </li>
<li> the URL of the referring page (if provided by the browser)</li>
<li> the object requested </li>
<li> completion status of the request </li>
<li> pages visited </li>
</ul>

<p>We use the information that we automatically collect to measure the number of visitors to the different areas of our sites, and to help us make our pages more useful to visitors. This includes analyzing these logs periodically to determine the traffic through our servers, the number of pages served, and the level of demand for pages and topics of interest. </p>

They can serve several functions, depending upon how they are designed:</p>

<ul>
  <li> they allow the website to identify you as a previous visitor each time you access a site;</li>
<li> they track what information you view at a site (important to commercial sites trying to determine your buying preferences); </li>
<li> in the more advanced cases they track your movements through many websites but not the whole Web; </li>
<li> businesses use them for customer convenience to allow them to produce a list of items to buy and pay for them all at one time and to garner information about what individuals are buying at their sites;</li>
<li> advertisers use them to determine the effectiveness of their marketing and offer insights into consumer preferences and tastes by collecting data from many websites; and </li>
<li> they can be used to help a website tailor screens for each customer's preference. </li>
</ul>

<p>Some EPA pages have "session cookies," to facilitate use of that particular page. These disappear when the Web user terminates a Web session and closes the browser.  EPA also permits the use of persistent cookies for the collection of Web metrics; however, EPA does not collect any personally identifiable information about visitors to our Web pages.  All EPA pages using persistent cookies link to the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/epahome/cookies.html">EPA Persistent Cookie Notice</a>, which details the types of information collected and how to opt-out by changing the cookie settings in your browsers.</p>
<p>If you are concerned about the potential use of the information gathered from your computer by cookies, you can set your browser to prompt you before it accepts a cookie. Most Internet browsers have settings that let you identify and/or reject cookies. </p>
