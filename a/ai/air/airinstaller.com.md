#### Privacy

Air Installer™ is dedicated to protecting our user's privacy. We've built this privacy portal in order to educate our consumers and advertisers on what information we collect and also how it is used and stored.

##### Information We Collect

  * IP Address
  * Machine ID
  * Language



##### How We Use Your Information

  * **IP Address** \- we use your IP address to tailor the in-path install offers to your geographic location. Some of our advertisers only want USA installs of their software, therefore we only show users in the USA those offers.
  * **Machine ID** \- your computer has a "machine id" which is tracked to make sure we do not show you in-path ads for the same product twice.
  * **Language** \- if you're computer is using an English based keyboard, we're not going to show French software ads!



We may use cookies to track your browsing activity across our web properties and software. This is only used in aggregate format (non personally identifiable) for analytics purposes, or to improve our websites.

We will never ask for your name, email, address, or ANY other personal information. We don't need this information, we don't want this information, and advise you to never enter such information online unless you're familiar with the company and using a secure connection.
