## 2\. How we use cookies and similar technology

When you use our website, we may collect tracking information such as your browser type, operating system, internet service provider, and the web pages you visit on our website. Air China uses a variety of technologies to access such information including cookies and web beacons to enhance the functionality and usability of our website. This is to ensure that our website, products and services better serve your needs. In addition, we use such information to confirm that visitors are eligible to make service requests and to aggregate website activity data.

(1) Cookie

A cookie is a text-based file that is transmitted by a website to a cookie folder on your computer’s hard drive. This allows the site to remember your identity. Typically, a cookie file contains the name of the domain it is in, the “life cycle” of cookie and a unique value that is randomly generated. This website uses two types of cookies, one is a temporary cookie, which is kept in the browser’s folder while you are browsing the website; the other is a persistent cookie, which is kept in the browser. Most browsers allow visitors to control whether they accept or reject cookies and notify visitors each time they send a cookie. You can choose to reject cookies by adjusting your browser’s settings, but for Air China’s site and other large websites that use cookies, this will limit the use of the site’s features. For more information on cookies, please visit www.allaboutcookies.org.

(2) Web Beacon

When a user opens a web page containing a web beacon, the web beacon records the user's basic operation along with cookies. When a user's browser requests information from a website in this way, it can also collect simple information such as the IP address of your computer, the time and content, the browser the user is using, and the cookies previously set by the server. This information is available to any web server you visit. Web beacons do not reveal any "extra" information. They are just a simple way to collect the simplest statistics and manage cookies. Web beacons can be disabled (the same way you disable cookies).

## 3\. How we share, transfer, and publicly disclose your personal information

(1) Sharing

We will not share your personal information with any company, organization or individual other than Air China, unless

2\. Sharing under statutory circumstances: We may share your personal information in accordance with laws and regulations, litigation dispute resolution needs, or in accordance with the requirements of administrative and judicial authorities.

3\. API/Advanced Passenger Information: An increasing number of countries require incoming airlines to provide passenger information prior to landing. Generally speaking, such laws and regulations require airlines to provide information including passenger identifications and travel documents (passports and visas). Airlines must collect such data before the aircraft takes off. This collection process is increasingly completed through the technology called machine-readable zone (MRZ) used in new travel documents. Such data is collected solely for the purpose of informing authorities of the destination country, and the airline will not use such data beyond this purpose and will not retain such data after the end of your trip.

4\. Sharing with Authorised Partners: For the purposes stated in this Privacy Policy, some of our services will be provided by us and our Authorised Partners. We may share some of your personal information with our partners to provide better customer service and user experience. For example, when you redeem your miles, we must share your personal information with the logistics service provider to arrange delivery or arrange for a partner to provide the service. We will only share your personal information for legitimate, necessary and specific purposes, and will only share the personal information necessary to provide the service. Our partners are not authorised to use shared personal information for other purposes unrelated to the product or service.

Currently, our Authorised Partners include the following types:

(1) Authorised partners in advertising and analytics services: We will not use your personally identifiable information (information that identifies you, such as your name or email address, which can be used to contact you or identify you) to provide advertising and analytics services, unless we have your permission. We provide these partners with information about their advertising coverage and effectiveness, without revealing your personally identifiable information, or we may aggregate such information so that it does not identify you personally. For example, we will only inform the advertisers given that they agree to abide by our advertising guidelines as to how effective their advertisements are, how many people have seen their ads or installed apps after seeing them, or provide the partners with statistics that won’t identify our customers (e.g. “male, 25-29 years old, in Beijing”) to help them gain a general understanding of audience or customers.

(2) Suppliers, service providers and other partners. We send information to IT vendors, air carriers, land transport operators, frequent flyer program and non-aviation partners who support our business, and other companies involved in providing customer service or fulfilling customer needs including technical support, customer service, payment assistance, mileage accumulation and redemption, merchandise delivery, mail delivery, membership card production and mailing.

We will sign strict confidentiality agreements with companies, organizations and individuals with whom we share personal information, and require them to process personal information, including personally sensitive information, in accordance with our instructions, this Privacy Policy and any other relevant confidentiality and security measures.

2\. In the event of a merger, acquisition or bankruptcy liquidation of the service provider, or other circumstances involving mergers, acquisitions or bankruptcy liquidation, if a personal information transfer is involved, we will require the new company or organization holding your personal information to continue to be bound by this Policy, otherwise we will require the company, organization and individual to obtain your consent again.

Subject to laws and regulations, when we receive the above request for disclosure, we will require legal documents, such as subpoenas or investigation letters, to be issued. We firmly believe that the information required to be provided should be as transparent as possible to the extent permitted by law. All requests are carefully reviewed to ensure they exposition is limited to data that is required for law enforcement and only that which is necessary for specific investigation purposes.

(4) Exceptions to requiring prior authorisation of consent, sharing, transfer, and public disclosure of personal information

In the following cases, sharing, transferring, and publicly disclosing your personal information does not require prior authorisation from you:

  1. Where the information is relevant to national security and national defence security;

The purpose of processing such personal information is detailed in “1. How we collect and use your personal information” as described in the first clause of this Policy. Additionally, your information may be processed by Air China employees working outside of your country. Our service providers are also involved in the processing of such information. Together with Air China, our service providers provide network reservation engine services, computer reservation system services, online payment management services and email services.

Air China will take all necessary and reasonable measures to ensure that your personal information is always safe. We will transfer your personal information in accordance with all relevant legal requirements. For example, we will seek your consent when necessary to transfer personal information across borders, or implement security measures such as data de-identification prior to cross-border data transfer. The transfer of personal data from EU/EEA to third countries without an adequacy decision by European Commision requires the standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission, mechanisms such as appropriate privacy protection certificates, or binding company rules.
