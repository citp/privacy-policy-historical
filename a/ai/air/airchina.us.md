## Where We Transfer and Store Your Data

The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"), and this destination, which includes the People’s Republic of China, may not offer the same level of privacy and personal data protections as are provided in the EEA.   Your data may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for companies ** ** within the Air China group or for one of our third party suppliers. These staff may be engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your booking, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. The purposes of the processing of your data are as set out in the first paragraph of “How Your Information Will Be Used”. Those processing the data include service providers working with Air China providing internet booking engine services, computer reservation system services, online payment management services, and email services.

In accordance with the provisions of Article 26 (1) of Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (the Directive), a transfer of personal data to a country outside the EEA which does not ensure an adequate level of protection within the meaning of Article 25 (2) of such Directive may take place on the condition that the data subject has given his consent unambiguously to the proposed transfer. In this respect, by providing your data, you agree to the transfer, storing or processing of your personal data as described herein. Please indicate your consent to your data being transferred to a country outside of the EEA by ticking the relevant box situated on the form on which we collect your data.

However, please be aware that these web sites may be owned and run by other companies and organizations. Air China does not endorse any such web sites and we are not responsible for the information, material, products or services contained on or accessible through those web sites.

## Cookies And Web Beacons

A cookie is a text-only string of information that a web site transfers to the cookie file of the browser on your computer's hard disk so that theweb site can remember who you are. Cookies will typically contain the name of the domain from which the cookie has come, the "lifetime" of the cookie, and a value, usually a randomly generated unique number. Two types of cookies are used on this web site - session cookies, which are temporary cookies that remain in the cookie file of your browser until you leave the site, and persistent cookies, which remain in the cookie file of your browser for much longer (though how long will depend on the lifetime of the specific cookie). Most browsers have options that allow the visitor to control whether the browser will accept cookies, reject cookies, or notify the visitor each time a cookie is sent. You may elect to reject cookies by adjusting your browser's settings, but doing so will limit the range of features available to the visitor on our site and most other major web sites that use cookies. To find out more information about cookies, please visit www.allaboutcookies.org.

Web beacons are used in conjunction with cookies to record the simple actions of the user opening the page that contains the beacon. When a user's browser requests information from a web site in this way certain simple information can also be gathered, such as: the IP address of your computer; time the material was viewed; the type of browser that retrieved the image; and the existence of cookies previously set by that server. This is information that is available to any web server you visit. Web beacons do not give any "extra" information away. They are simply a convenient way of gathering the simplest of statistics and managing cookies.  Web beacons may be disabled [in the same way as you disable cookies.]

## API (Advance Passenger Information)

A growing number of destination countries oblige the airlines that fly to them to transmit passenger data before an aircraft lands in one of them. Usually, these legal regulations encompass the transmission of data on the passengers' identity and travel documents (passport, visa).

As a rule, an airline does not have these data, so it must collect them shortly before an aircraft departs, which increasingly is being done by means of the so-called 'machine-readable zone' in the new travel documents. If we are requested to transmit your passenger data to foreign authorities other than the United States or Canada, we will obtain your consent before doing so.

Collection of the data is done solely for immediate transmission to the authorities of the destination country.

## Data Security

Air China takes your data security very seriously. In addition to complying with all applicable data security regulations, to ensure the highest possible security for the transmission of your data between your web browser and our internet system we use the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encrypting technology. SSL is an industry standard way to send personal information over the Internet. It enables an encrypted communication respectively transfer of documents via the internet between web browser and web server. The URL of a web site with SSL connection to your browser starts with https://. SSL is fast, secure, and it ensures that your personal information will not be read by anyone else.

## Your rights

If you are an existing Air China customer, we will only contact you by e-mail with materials about products or services similar to those which have been previously provided to you (unless you consent to receiving e-mails about other products or services by ticking the relevant box situated on the form when we collect your data).

If you have explicitly consented through our web site, we will, from time to time, use your data to deliver by e-mail materials about selected third parties, including Air China ancillary travel and promotion partners, which may be of interest to you.

You have the right to ask us not to process your data for marketing purposes. You can exercise your right to prevent such processing by informing us through the opt-out boxes on the forms we use to collect your data or at any time after this by e-mailing at customer_relaitons@airchina.com.

For the avoidance of doubt, you may at any time object to our use of your data by sending an email to customer_relaitons@airchina.com.

If you are a new customer, and where we permit certain third parties to use your data, we (or they) will contact you by e-mail only if you have consented to this. We (or they) will contact you for the purposes of informing you about our (their) company news, products and services.
