**Your Permission: Permission for data collection and processing.**

International data transfers. Your personal information may be collected, processed and stored by IQAir or its service providers in the countries where our servers reside. If you are using IQAir AirVisual products and services in the European Economic Area or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from other countries’ data laws, you agree to the transfer of your personal data to the countries where IQAir operates.

**How does IQAir use the information it collects?**

We use this information to provide, develop and improve IQAir AirVisual products and services, including to make assessments and recommendations about products and safety.

We use industry-standard methods to keep this information safe and secure while it is transmitted over your home network and through the Internet to our servers. Depending on your location and type of data, IQAir may process your personal information on servers that are not in your home country. In general for purposes of applicable law (e.g. GDPR), IQAir is a controller of the information collected in connection with the Products and Services. Our legal basis for processing information: If European data protection law applies to the processing of your information, we process your information for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, based on the following legal grounds:

When we’re providing a product or service.

We process your data to provide and support a product or service that you’ve asked for under a contract.

When we’re pursuing legitimate interests.

We process your information for our legitimate interests while applying appropriate safeguards that protect your privacy. This means that we process your information for things like:

· offering and improving IQAir AirVisual products and services

· developing new products and features

· understanding how people use our products and services

· sending you direct marketing and other communications from IQAir

· protecting against harm to the rights, property and safety of IQAir, our users, and the public

· detecting, preventing or otherwise addressing fraud, abuse, security or technical issues with our services

· maintaining and improving the integrity of our computing systems, and protecting our users’ data security

The following are the limited situations where we may share personal information:

_With your permission:_ We may share personal information when we have your permission. One example of this would be if you invite another user to share access to Products on your account as an additional authorised user. Another example of this would be if you publicly publish a Product’s air quality data, such as publishing an air monitor as a validated outdoor station.

_For troubleshooting:_ To help solve any of your problems related to IQAir AirVisual products and services, IQAir employees can access certain limited information about you or your account to the extent that this enables the troubleshooting purpose.

_As part of business transitions:_ Upon the sale or transfer of the company and/or all or part of its assets, your personal information may be among the items transferred. We will request the data acquirer to treat our data under the privacy policy in place at the time of its collection.

If you select an outside party for the purchase, or service of your IQAir AirVisual device and share your personal information, we cannot control the collection, storage or sharing of information collected by that party. For example, if you buy an IQAir AirVisual monitor from a retailer, the retailer may collect personal information as part of the transaction.

In addition, you may object to IQAir’s processing of your personal information at any time. However, doing so may impact your use of the products and services of IQAir.
