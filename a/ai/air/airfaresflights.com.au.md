This information is collected in a database and used--in an aggregated, anonymous manner--in our internal analysis of traffic patterns within our Web site. This information is automatically logged by most Web sites. 

** Use of Information **

Our primary goal in collecting user information is to enhance your experience on our Web site. We achieve this goal by, among other things, providing interactive communications such as our electronic newsletters to the e-mail address that you provide to us, and developing future editorial content based on your interests. To develop content targeted to your interests, we use aggregated user information to determine which areas of our Web site users prefer based upon traffic to those areas.

These parties, as well as advertisers who contract directly with a third-party service to serve their advertisements, may set their own cookies. 

However, it should be noted that AirfaresFlights.com.au does not, and will not share any personally identifiable information with advertisers that is provided by the user as part of the 'hot deals newsletter' or 'refer a friend' forms.

Please be aware that AirfaresFlights.com.au sponsors, advertisers or Web sites that have links on our site may collect personally identifiable information about you. The information practices of those parties and Web sites linked to AirfaresFlights.com.au are not covered by this privacy statement.
