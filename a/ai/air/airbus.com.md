# Privacy policy

**1\. Privacy Statement**

Airbus appreciates your interest in its products and services and your visit to our web site. Your privacy is important to us and we want you to feel comfortable visiting our site. The protection of your privacy in the processing of your personal data is an important concern to which we pay special attention during our business processes. Personal data collected during visits to our web site are processed by us according to the legal provisions valid for the countries in which the web sites are maintained. In addition, our Corporate Policy for Personal Data Protection covers also the processing of Customer and Partner Data which is applicable company-wide for Airbus. The Airbus web site may include, however, links to other web sites which are not covered by this privacy statement.

Airbus respects your privacy and your personal data.

**2\. Collection and processing of personal data**

When you visit our web site, our web server automatically records your IP address, the web site from which you visit us, the web pages you actually visit and the date and length of your visit. Personal data is only stored if volunteered by you, for example in the context of a registration, a survey, a competition or in execution of a contract.

You do not have to give us any personal information in order to perform job searches. Nevertheless, to apply or register in the eRecruiting@Airbus tool, you will have to type your personal username/email address and a password.

In some areas of the eRecruiting@Airbus tool, it is required that you provide personal data, including your name, address, e-mail address and telephone number.

From these your identity as an Airbus employee, if so, is discernible for the aim of identity proofing.

If you use the eRecruiting@Airbus tool to build a CV to put in the jobseekers’ CVs database, then you will be providing the HR Department with personal data which will be used in accordance with this Statement. We strongly suggest that your CV should not contain data relating to your (i) racial or ethnic origin (ii) political beliefs (iii) philosophical or religious beliefs (iv) membership of a trade union or political party (v) physical or mental health (vi) sexual life or (vii) the commission of criminal offences or proceedings. If your CV does contain such data, then you agree that we may retain this information and use it in accordance with this Statement.

**3\. Use and Disclosure of Personal Data and Purpose Specification**

Airbus will use your personal data for the sole purpose of technical administration of the web site, customer administration, product surveys and marketing, only to the extent necessary in each specific case. We will only disclose your data to governmental authorities in cases where it is required by law. Our employees, agencies, and retailers are obliged by us to respect confidentiality.

Airbus uses the information gathered on the web application eRecruiting@Airbus, whether personal, demographic, collective or technical, for the purposes of administering and managing your registration, responding to any queries you may have, operating and improving the website, fostering a positive user experience and delivering the products and services that we offer to jobseekers and hiring managers.

If you have so agreed when registering, or subsequently, or if permitted by applicable law, we may use your contact information in order to send you e-mail or other communications regarding updates on the website, such as new opportunities and additional listings which may be of interest to you.

**4\. Disclosure of information to others than the HR Department**

We disclose to HR operators or line managers your personal information, combined personal and demographic information, as set forth below.

We may disclose such information to the involved parties if you consent to such disclosure, either because you are considered for a vacancy you have applied for, or because you made your CV available to be contacted for job opportunities. You may make your CV unavailable again at any time.

We may disclose such information if legally required to do so, if requested to do so by a governmental entity or regulatory authority or if we believe in good faith that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal processes; (b) prevent a crime or protect national security; or (c) protect the personal safety of users or the public.

**5\. CVs**

Since eRecruiting@Airbus is a career site within Airbus' perimeter, we provide you with the option of putting your CV in the database. There are two ways of doing this:

You can store your CV in the eRecruiting@Airbus database, but not allow it to be searchable by potential employers. Not allowing your CV to be available means that you can use it to apply for jobs online, but recruiters will not have access to search for it through the CV database.

If you allow your CV to be available, then all HR parties with access to the search function in the CV database will have access to your CV. You can also allow your CV to be available but remove your contact details. However, you should be aware that in this situation if you have a rare skill, it may still be possible for a recruiter to identify you even without your contact details being included. If you are worried about being identified, you should not include specific skills or details by which you could be identified.

Airbus is committed to limiting the access to the searchable CV database only to Airbus Human Resources professionals involved in recruitment activities. You may remove your CV from the eRecruiting@Airbus searchable database at any time. However, recruiters and operators who have access to the database may have retained a copy of your CV in their own files: in this case these recruiters and operators are directly responsible for treating the copy of your CV in compliance with the Airbus Data Protection Policy.

If you provide us with details of a referee, it is your responsibility to ensure that the person is aware that you have forwarded his/her details and has consented in writing for you to do so.

**6\. Updating or deleting your information**

You may review, correct, update or change your CV at any time. Simply log into your eRecruiting@Airbus account, go to your CV, review it and, if you wish, edit it with the options provided.

If you wish to delete your information in the eRecruiting@Airbus tool at any time, please contact us at erecruiting@airbus.com. An e-mail will be sent to you to confirm that your information has been deleted.

If you wish to revoke your consent to this Privacy Statement, please contact us at erecruiting@airbus.com. However, please note that if you do withdraw your consent, you may not be able to use the relevant services and your account profile information will be deleted.

Since Airbus believes that managing your career is a life-long process, we retain all the information we gather about you in an effort to make your repeat use with us more efficient, practical and relevant until you change or remove your personal data as detailed above.

**7\. Freedom of Choice**
