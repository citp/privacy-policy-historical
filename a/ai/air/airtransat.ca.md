# Privacy Policy | Air Transat

Review our privacy policy to see how Transat protects your personal information.

##  Transat's Privacy Policy

Air Transat and its affiliated companies (“Transat”) are committed to protecting the privacy of your personal information and have taken measures to ensure the privacy and confidentiality of that information. Our commitment to safeguarding your privacy is reflected in our Transat’s privacy policy (the “Policy”). We have developed this policy and related procedures to comply with the _Personal Information Protection and Electronic Document Act_. We invite you to consult our Policy below for more information and details.

Transat is responsible for personal information it holds or has under its control, including personal information it passes to others with your permission. Our privacy officer will receive and respond to your enquiries and complaints regarding the protection and privacy of your personal information, and will deal with requests for access to your information.

If you have given us your consent, we may forward your name, coordinates, profile and travel preferences to _ **other divisions and members of Transat**_ (collectively, “Transat”) and to service providers specializing in data processing in order to contact you, via any and all means, with respect to our travel services (including to conduct surveys) and / or to send you personalized offers on our products and **Transat** products.

For all bookings, your name and booking details will be forwarded to our travel suppliers (airlines, hotels, cruise companies, incoming tour operators, car rental companies…) in order to finalize your booking and enable you to fully enjoy your trip.

###  1 - The importance of the right to privacy.

Transat takes the privacy rights of individuals very seriously and, in this respect, takes all measures possible to ensure the protection of the personal information that we collect in providing our services. Transat may be required to exchange personal information with third parties on individuals for the purpose of administering customer accounts and files. Transat and such third parties may also exchange information on individuals that is not of a sensitive nature regarding their preferences for the purpose of offering and providing quality benefits, products, goods, and services in an efficient manner. Nevertheless, Transat will not collect, use, or disclose any personal information on an individual without his or her consent, unless compelled to do so by statute or regulation. In this regard, our primary concern is the trust that individuals place in our safeguarding the privacy of their personal information.

The purpose of this Policy is to outline our commitment regarding the protection of privacy as well as the rules we intend to follow when we collect, retain, use, or disclose personal information.

Our Policy has been formulated to satisfy and indeed, even to exceed the requirements of privacy legislation in force in Canada, specifically the _Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act_ , S.C. 2000, c. 5, various provincial laws regarding privacy protection, the Principles set out in the National Standard of Canada for the Protection of Personal Information (CAN/CSA-Q830-96), as well as any applicable regulations (hereinafter the “Law”). We also undertake to constantly re-assess our rules of practice and our procedures in this area and to take into account the comments of any individuals.

In order to better understand and meet the expectations of individuals regarding the protection of personal information, Transat has designated a member of senior management to act as Director, Protection of Personal Information (hereinafter “the Director”). Any person may contact the Director in order to share comments, request access to any personal information that we may have on him or her, request that corrections be made to the information, or to file a complaint. The Director shall conduct a consistent review of Transat practices and procedures to ensure compliance with this Policy and to meet customer expectations in this respect.
