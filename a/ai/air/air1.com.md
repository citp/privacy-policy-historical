# Air1 Privacy Policy - Air1 - Positive Hits

Air1 is committed to safeguarding individual and corporate privacy on our website; we operate under a strict set of privacy principles:

## Information We Collect and Receive

Air1 collects and retains information about you and your device when you visit or give us information through the Air1 website.

## Non-Personally Identifiable Information

When your computer or mobile device contacts our web servers, we collect usage information about how our visitors use and navigate the Air1 website. An anonymous profile is established based on your visit and information such as the frequency and length of your visit, browser type, referrer data identifying the web page visited prior and subsequent to visiting the web site, and your IP address. No personally identifiable information is collected without your voluntarily providing it to us. 

## Personally Identifiable Information

We collect personal information from you, such as your name, mailing address, phone number, and email address only if you voluntarily provide it to us. Once you voluntarily provide Air1 with personal information through our website, any previous anonymous profile associated with your IP address is updated with your personal information, including email address, and your email becomes the primary identifier for your profile. 

## How We Use Your Information

The information we collect is used to improve your Air1 experience. Visitors are provided services tailored especially for them, or to inform them about new features or services. Occasionally, Air1 conducts user surveys to better target the music we play.

While Air1 uses third party vendors to communicate with you, your information, including your email address, will not be sold, shared or disclosed with any third party outside of the Air1 family unless otherwise noted in a specific consent or other entry, or as necessary to provide communications from Air1 through third party vendors. Air1 employs strict security measures to safeguard online transactions, and personal information is stored in a secured database and always sent via an encrypted channel.
