Privacy Notice and Terms

Air recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of all information provided by any user of AirVPN (collectively or individually "User(s)").

Usage of AirVPN is subject to the terms of this Privacy Notice.

Although the Air servers may be located in various European Union countries, all those servers and all data collected by those servers are subject to this "AirVPN Privacy Notice and Terms" and are compliant to the standards and requirements set by Directives 95/46/EC ("Data Protection"), 2002/58/EC ("privacy on electronic communications") and the best practices recommended by the EU Art. 29 Working Party and the EDPS (European Data Protection Supervisor).

Servers located outside the European Union will treat users data with the same (or higher) level of privacy and data protection, never with a lower level of privacy and data protection. AirVPN will not use or locate servers in countries which have laws which would force Air to violate the aforementioned European Union directives. Anyway, in case of jurisdictional conflicts, Air will not recognize extra-UE competence and will respond only to European Union laws.

Air servers and software procedures acquire only personal data which are strictly necessary for the technical functioning of the service, for example IP address. These data are not collected to identify, through elaboration or any other technique, users' personal identities. These data are not transmitted to third parties. 

Pressure from private actors to obtain any data (including but not limited to IP address of users) is an illegal act and Air, in order to protect its business and the users' privacy, reserves the right to inform the competent authorities and prosecute the private entities responsible for such illegal acts.

Data transmission is performed between Air servers network exclusively in order to erogate efficiently the AirVPN service. Data are deleted as soon as they are no more necessary for such purposes. During their transmission between servers, data are securely encrypted. Under no circumstance data are kept outside the European Union. Due to the nature of the Internet routing, although improbable it is not impossible that thosa data, exchanged by AirVPN servers located in geographically distant places, may transit outside EU borders; this is not a privacy issue since data are heavily encrypted since when they leave one of the AirVPN server and as long as they arrive to the final destination AirVPN server.

Data are aggregated in anonymous form for statistical reports on servers usage, CPU stress, technical issues, in order to improve the service, fix bugs and as a countermeasure against net attacks.

When users connect to AirVPN Virtual Private Network, no cookies are stored on their system. On the contrary, when users access AirVPN website (for example to enter the forum) cookies are stored on their systems in order to make access to such additional services possible. Cookies are stored only for technical reasons and can be deleted anytime by the user. Cookies are specifically meant for technical help. Under no circumstance does Air use cookies to track and/or profile users.

Users are free to send their personal information to the intermediary societies (e.g. PayPal, Moneybookers) which perform physical payment in order to access AirVPN services. Failure to do so might prevent access to AirVPN commercial services; however, those information are not under Air control.

Users may optionally, explicitly and voluntarily send their e-mail address to receive technical assistance. E-mail addresses are stored in Air servers for assistance purposes as long as the user subscription expires or the user requests deletion. E-mail addresses are not used by Air to identify or collect any other information about the users.

Users have the right to ask for information about their data and to ask for deletion of any data pertaining to them with a simple written request by e-mail to: info (at) airvpn (dot) org.

Data are treated with automatic systems for the time being necessary to erogate the service. Security measures are taken to protect data leakage, illegal use of data, unauthorized access to data.

Responsible of data treatment is:
