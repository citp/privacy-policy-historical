• With Travel Service Providers, such as hotels, airlines, car rental companies, and cruise lines, that fulfill your travel reservations. We do not share your email address with Travel Service Providers unless it is needed to fulfill your reservation, and we restrict the use of this information to that purpose.

• To third parties providing services or functions on our behalf, including credit card processing, marketing, advertising, distribution of surveys or sweepstakes programs, and fraud prevention. These third parties have access to and may collect Personal Data only as needed to perform their functions and are not permitted to share or use the Personal Data for any other purpose. They are also required to follow the same data security practices that we ourselves adhere to.   
• Business partners with whom we may jointly offer products or services, or whose products or services may be offered on our website, may receive your Personal Data in connection with offering those products or services.   
• If you are referred to our Web Site by another websites by, for example, clicking a link on that other website, we may share some of your Personal Data with that other website. You are encouraged to review the privacy policies of any website that referred you here.

• Our business is constantly changing, and as part of that process, we may sell or buy other companies. Personal Data may be transferred as part of these transactions. It is also possible that all or some of our assets may be acquired by another company, whether by merger, sale of assets or otherwise, and Personal Data may be transferred as part of such a transaction. • In order to comply with applicable laws and other requirements, we reserve the right to release Personal Data, including whenever we believe that disclosure is necessary to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on Airfasttickets.

##### **COOKIES POLICY**

##### **What Are Cookies?**

##### We use cookies on our Web Site to create the most secure and effective website possible for our customers. Among other things, cookies allow you to log on to our booking platform, choose log-in preferences, apply for products and services online and use online tools. Cookies are small bits of code, usually stored on a user’s computer hard drive or device, which enable a web site to “personalize” itself for each user by remembering information about the user’s visit to the web site. Cookies have many benefits to enhance your experience on our Web Site.

##### **How Are Cookies Used?**

##### Cookies are used for a variety of reasons, such as to safeguard your privacy when browsing the Web Site. They allow you to use functions such as secure online applications. If you leave a secure session window open, cookies will enhance your security by prompting you to end, and/or automatically ending, your secure session. Cookies can also allow us to tailor the content of our Web Site to suit your interests. For example, instead of displaying promotional messages about products you already have, they let us show you other services in which you may be interested. Finally, we use “analytics” cookies to help us make our Web Site better for those who visit it regularly. Cookies help us work out what users like and don't like, and how we can improve things for you.

##### **Working With Third Parties.**

##### No third party has access to the information we collect through the cookies, and we only use cookies from third parties in order to provide our customers with our products and services. The only time cookies would enable us to share your information is when you have given us express consent to pass it on to a trusted third party.   
We may, however, share Web Site usage information about visitors to our Web Sites with these third parties for the purpose of managing and targeting advertisements and for market research analysis on our Web Site and other web sites. For these purposes, we and our third-party advertising companies may place pixel tags (also called clear gifs) on some of the pages you visit on our Web Site. We will then use the non-personally identifiable information that is collected using these pixel tags to serve you relevant advertisements when you are visiting other web sites on the Internet. These advertisements may be targeted to specific searches you conducted on the Web Site during earlier browsing sessions. If you do not want to receive these advertisements, marketing material or other offers, please send us an email at info@airfasttickets.com.

##### **Managing Your Cookies.**

##### The browsers of most computers, smartphones and other web-enabled devices are typically set up to accept cookies. If you wish to amend your cookie preferences for this Web Site or any other web sites, you can do this through your browser settings. Your browser’s “help” function will tell you how to do this. However, please remember that cookies are often used to enable and improve certain functions on our Web Site. If you choose to switch certain cookies off, it is likely to affect how our Web Site works.   
If you have any questions about the use of cookies, please contact us at info@airfasttickets.com.

##### **MARKETING MATERIAL AND ADVERTISEMENTS**

##### Unless you tell us that you do not want to receive these offers, Airfasttickets or those companies with which we have a commercial relationship, may occasionally send advertisements, marketing material or other offers that we think might be of interest to you. If you do not want to receive these advertisements, marketing material or other offers, please send us an email at info@airfasttickets.com.

##### **NOTICES AND FEEDBACK AND OPTING-OUT**

##### From time to time, we may contact you to request feedback on your experience using the Web Site, to assist us in improving the Web Site, or to offer special savings or promotions to you, as a Web Site user. If you would prefer not to receive notices of special savings or promotions, you may simply opt-out from receiving them by sending us an email at info@airfasttickets.com.

##### **EXTERNAL LINKS**

##### When we include links to other websites, please bear in mind they will have their own privacy and cookie policies that will govern the use of any information you submit. We recommend you read their policies as we are not responsible or liable for their privacy practices.

##### **SOCIAL MEDIA**
