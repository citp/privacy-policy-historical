Last Updated: April 16, 2018 

Thank you for using Airbnb! 

This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, process, and disclose your information, including personal information, in conjunction with your access to and use of the Airbnb Platform and the Payment Services. 

If you see an undefined term in this Privacy Policy (such as “Listing” or “Airbnb Platform”), it has the same definition as in our [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/terms). 

When this policy mentions “Airbnb,” “we,” “us,” or “our,” it refers to the Airbnb company that is responsible for your information under this Privacy Policy (the “ **Data Controller** ”). 

  * If your Country of Residence is the United States, the Data Controller is Airbnb, Inc. 
  * If your Country of Residence is outside of the United States, the People’s Republic of China which for purposes of this Privacy Policy does not include Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan (“ **China** ”) and Japan, the Data Controller is Airbnb Ireland UC (“ **Airbnb Ireland** ”). 
  * If your Country of Residence is China, the Data Controller is Airbnb Internet (Beijing) Co., Ltd. (“ **Airbnb China** ”), except where you book a Host Service located outside of China or create a Listing located outside of China, in which case the Data Controller is Airbnb Ireland for that transaction. 
  * If your Country of Residence is Japan, the Data Controller is Airbnb Global Services Limited (“ **Airbnb GSL** ”), except where you book a Host Service located outside of Japan or create a Listing located outside of Japan, in which case the Data Controller is Airbnb Ireland for that transaction. Additionally, if you reside in Japan, Airbnb Ireland will be the Data Controller for all bookings confirmed prior to June 13, 2018 at 3PM UTC. 



This Privacy Policy also applies to the Payment Services provided to you by Airbnb Payments pursuant to the [Payments Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/terms/payments_terms) (“ **Payments Terms** ”). When using the Payment Services, you will be also providing your information, including personal information, to one or more Airbnb Payments entities, which will also be the Data Controller (the " **Payments Data Controller** ") of your information related to the Payment Services, generally depending on your Country of Residence.

  * If your Country of Residence is the United States, the Payments Data Controller is Airbnb Payments, Inc. (a subsidiary of Airbnb, Inc.).
  * If your Country of Residence is China the Payments Data Controller is Airbnb China, except where you book a Host Service located outside of China or create a Listing located outside of China, or book a Host Service in China with a Host who is not a resident of China, in which case the Payments Data Controller is Airbnb Payments UK.

If you change your Country of Residence, the Data Controller and/or Payments Data Controller will be determined by your new Country of Residence as specified above, from the date on which your Country of Residence changes. To this end the Data Controller and/or Payment Data Controller that originally collected your personal information will need to transfer such personal information to the new applicable Data Controller and/or Payments Data Controller due to the fact that such transfer is necessary for the performance of the contractual relationship with you.

Please see Section 10 for contact details of the Data Controllers and Payment Data Controllers listed above.

While you may disable the usage of cookies through your browser settings, the Airbnb Platform currently does not respond to a “Do Not Track” signal in the HTTP header from your browser or mobile application due to lack of standardization regarding how that signal should be interpreted. For more information on our use of these technologies, see our [Cookie Policy](https://web.archive.org/terms/cookie_policy).

  * **Third Party Services.** If you link, connect, or login to your Airbnb Account with a third party service (e.g. Google, Facebook, WeChat), the third party service may send us information such as your registration and profile information from that service.

  * **Other Sources.** To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may receive additional information about you, such as demographic data or fraud detection information, from third party service providers and/or partners, and combine it with information we have about you. For example, we may receive background check results (with your consent where required) or fraud warnings from service providers like identity verification services for our fraud prevention and risk assessment efforts.

Hosts may need to use third party services available through the Airbnb Platform to assist with managing their Accommodation or providing additional services requested by you, such as cleaning services or lock providers. Hosts may use features on the Airbnb Platform to share information about the Guest (like check-in and check-out dates, Guest name, Guest phone number) with such third party service providers for the purposes of coordinating the stay, managing the Accommodation, or providing other services.

  * the information you provide to us from the linking of your accounts may be stored, processed and transmitted for fraud prevention and risk assessment purposes; and
  * the publication and display of information that you provide to Airbnb through this linkage is subject to your settings and authorizations on the Airbnb Platform and the third party site.



We only collect your information from linked third party accounts to the extent necessary to ensure the adequate performance of our contract with you, or to ensure that we comply with applicable laws, or with your consent.

##### 4.3 Google Maps/Earth. 

Parts of the Airbnb Platform use Google Maps/Earth services, including the Google Maps API(s). Use of Google Maps/Earth is subject to [Google Maps/Earth Additional Terms of Use](http://www.google.com/intl/en_us/help/terms_maps.html) and the [Google Privacy Policy](http://www.google.com/privacy.html).

#### 5\. THIRD PARTY PARTNERS & INTEGRATIONS 

The Airbnb Platform may contain links to third party websites or services, such as third party integrations, co-branded services, or third party-branded services (“ **Third Party Partners** ”). Airbnb doesn’t own or control these Third Party Partners and when you interact with them, you may be providing information directly to the Third Party Partner, Airbnb, or both. These Third Party Partners will have their own rules about the collection, use, and disclosure of information. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of the other websites you visit. 

#### 6\. YOUR RIGHTS 

You may exercise any of the rights described in this section before your applicable Airbnb Data Controller and Payments Data Controller by sending an email to [dpo@airbnb.com](mailto:dpo@airbnb.com). Please note that we may ask you to verify your identity before taking further action on your request. 

##### 6.1 Managing Your Information. 

You may access and update some of your information through your Account settings. If you have chosen to connect your Airbnb Account to a third-party application, like Facebook or Google, you can change your settings and remove permission for the app by changing your Account settings. You are responsible for keeping your personal information up-to-date.

##### 6.2 Rectification of Inaccurate or Incomplete Information.

You have the right to ask us to correct inaccurate or incomplete personal information concerning you (and which you cannot update yourself within your Airbnb Account).

##### 6.3 Data Access and Portability.

In some jurisdictions, applicable law may entitle you to request copies of your personal information held by us. You may also be entitled to request copies of personal information that you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format and/or request us to transmit this information to another service provider (where technically feasible). 

##### 6.4 Data Retention and Erasure. 

We generally retain your personal information for as long as is necessary for the performance of the contract between you and us and to comply with our legal obligations. If you no longer want us to use your information to provide the Airbnb Platform to you, you can request that we erase your personal information and close your Airbnb Account. Please note that if you request the erasure of your personal information: 

  * We may retain some of your personal information as necessary for our legitimate business interests, such as fraud detection and prevention and enhancing safety. For example, if we suspend an Airbnb Account for fraud or safety reasons, we may retain certain information from that Airbnb Account to prevent that Member from opening a new Airbnb Account in the future.
  * We may retain and use your personal information to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations. For example, Airbnb and Airbnb Payments may keep some of your information for tax, legal reporting and auditing obligations. 
  * Information you have shared with others (e.g., Reviews, forum postings) may continue to be publicly visible on the Airbnb Platform, even after your Airbnb Account is cancelled. However, attribution of such information to you will be removed. Additionally, some copies of your information (e.g., log records) may remain in our database, but are disassociated from personal identifiers. 
  * Because we maintain the Airbnb Platform to protect from accidental or malicious loss and destruction, residual copies of your personal information may not be removed from our backup systems for a limited period of time.



##### 6.5 Withdrawing Consent and Restriction of Processing.

Where you have provided your consent to the processing of your personal information by Airbnb you may withdraw your consent at any time by changing your Account settings or by sending a communication to Airbnb specifying which consent you are withdrawing. Please note that the withdrawal of your consent does not affect the lawfulness of any processing activities based on such consent before its withdrawal. Additionally, in some jurisdictions, applicable law may give you the right to limit the ways in which we use your personal information, in particular where (i) you contest the accuracy of your personal information; (ii) the processing is unlawful and you oppose the erasure of your personal information; (iii) we no longer need your personal information for the purposes of the processing, but you require the information for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; or (iv) you have objected to the processing pursuant to Section 6.6 and pending the verification whether the legitimate grounds of Airbnb override your own.

##### 6.6 Objection to Processing.

In some jurisdictions, applicable law may entitle you to require Airbnb and Airbnb Payments not to process your personal information for certain specific purposes (including profiling) where such processing is based on legitimate interest. If you object to such processing Airbnb and/or Airbnb Payments will no longer process your personal information for these purposes unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for such processing or such processing is required for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims. 

Where your personal information is processed for direct marketing purposes, you may, at any time ask Airbnb to cease processing your data for these direct marketing purposes by sending an e-mail to opt-out@airbnb.com.

##### 6.7 Lodging Complaints.

You have the right to lodge complaints about the data processing activities carried out by Airbnb and Airbnb Payments before the competent data protection authorities. If your Data Controller is Airbnb Ireland or Airbnb GSL, you have the right to file a complaint with its lead supervisory authority, the Irish Data Protection Commissioner. If your Payments Data Controller is Airbnb Payments (UK) Ltd. with its lead supervisory authority, the Information Commissioner's Office.

#### 7\. OPERATING GLOBALLY 

To facilitate our global operations Airbnb and Airbnb Payments may transfer, store, and process your information within our family of companies or with service providers based in Europe, India, Asia Pacific and North and South America. Laws in these countries may differ from the laws applicable to your Country of Residence. For example, information collected within the EEA may be transferred, stored, and processed outside of the EEA for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. Where we transfer store, and process your personal information outside of the EEA we have ensured that appropriate safeguards are in place to ensure an adequate level of data protection. 

##### 7.1 EU-US & Swiss-US Privacy Shield.  

Airbnb and Airbnb Payments comply with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States, respectively. Airbnb has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit <https://www.privacyshield.gov/>.

Under the Privacy Shield Framework, Airbnb and Airbnb Payments are subject to the authority of the Federal Trade Commission. If you have any questions or concerns relating to our Privacy Shield certification, contact us at Airbnb, Inc., Legal Department, 888 Brannan Street, San Francisco, CA 94103 or via [email](mailto:privacyshield@airbnb.com). If we are not able to resolve your concern, you may also contact your European Data Protection Authority or Commission or seek assistance from our designated Privacy Shield independent recourse mechanism, [JAMS](https://www.jamsadr.com/). In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to pursue binding arbitration through the Privacy Shield Framework, as described in [Annex I to the Privacy Shield Principles](https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=ANNEX-I-introduction). 

If we have received your personal information under the Privacy Shield and subsequently transfer it to a third party service provider for processing as described in this Privacy Policy, we will remain responsible if these providers process your personal information in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles, except where we can establish that Airbnb or Airbnb Payments was not responsible for the violation.

##### 7.2 Other Means to Ensure an Adequate Level of Data Protection.

If Airbnb Ireland is the Data Controller and your information is shared with corporate affiliates or third party service providers outside the EEA, we have - prior to sharing your information with such corporate affiliate or third party service provider – established the necessary means to ensure an adequate level of data protection. This may be an adequacy decision of the European Commission confirming an adequate level of data protection in the respective non-EEA country or an agreement on the basis of the EU Model Clauses (a set of clauses issued by the European Commission). We will provide further information on the means to ensure an adequate level of data protection on request.

##### 7.3 California & Vermont Residents. 

Airbnb Payments will not share information it collects about you with its affiliates or third parties (both financial and non-financial), except as required or permitted by your state’s law. 

##### 7.4 California Privacy Rights.

California law permits Members who are California residents to request and obtain from us once a year, free of charge, a list of the third parties to whom we have disclosed their personal information (if any) for their direct marketing purposes in the prior calendar year, as well as the type of personal information disclosed to those third parties. See the “Contact” section for where to send such requests. Airbnb and Airbnb Payments do not share personal information with third parties for their own direct marketing purposes without your prior consent. Accordingly, you can prevent disclosure of your personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes by withholding consent.

#### 8\. SECURITY 

We are continuously implementing and updating administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your information against unauthorized access, loss, destruction, or alteration. Some of the safeguards we use to protect your information are firewalls and data encryption, and information access controls. If you know or have reason to believe that your Airbnb Account credentials have been lost, stolen, misappropriated, or otherwise compromised or in case of any actual or suspected unauthorized use of your Airbnb Account, please contact us following the instructions in the Contact Us section below.

#### 9\. CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY 

Airbnb reserves the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time in accordance with this provision. If we make changes to this Privacy Policy, we will post the revised Privacy Policy on the Airbnb Platform and update the “Last Updated” date at the top of this Privacy Policy. We will also provide you with notice of the modification by email at least thirty (30) days before the date they become effective. If you disagree with the revised Privacy Policy, you may cancel your Account. If you do not cancel your Account before the date the revised Privacy Policy becomes effective, your continued access to or use of the Airbnb Platform will be subject to the revised Privacy Policy.
