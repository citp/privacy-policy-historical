# AIChE - Privacy and Security Policy

The AIChE Web site offers a convenient way to access the benefits of membership. You can interact with other members and even conduct everyday business. When you use the site you may be asked to supply personal information. We value your privacy and will only use your information as described below.

**Registering for the Site**  
When you first register as a member you will be asked to confirm your member ID. Then you will select a log in and a security question. This question will allow you to retrieve your missing login information automatically. If a problem persists you can always reset your login.

**Cookies**  
The AIChE Web site uses “cookies” to remember that you are a registered member. This will allow your experience to be tailored so that you have access to the information you are seeking without the restrictions placed on non-members. If you have disabled cookies on your computer your visit may require extra steps to access the restricted areas of the site.

**Members’ On-line Community**  
The Members’ On-line Community asks you to enter complete contact information. This section is housed in a secure area of the site and requires password access. When you register with the community you are publishing your personal information. How other members use that information is not monitored or controlled by AIChE.

**Joining AIChE**  
When you join AIChE you will be asked for personal information including educational achievements and employment. We use this information to provide you with relevant information about events, benefits and Institute activities. We do not publish this information.

**Registering for a Conference**  
Conference registrants will be asked to provide contact information. We will use this information to communicate with you about conferences and your registration.

**E-Mail Address Use  
**AIChE communicates with members and meeting registrants by e-mail. We do this to contain costs and respond in a timely fashion. AIChE does not sell or rent the e-mail addresses of members or conference registrants.
