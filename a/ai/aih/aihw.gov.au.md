# Privacy policy - Australian Institute of Health and Welfare

## Who we are

The [Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW)](https://web.archive.org/about-us) is a corporate Commonwealth entity established in 1987, governed by a management Board, and accountable to the Australian Parliament as part of the Health portfolio.

We collect and report information on many topics and issues, including health and welfare expenditure, hospitals, disease and injury, mental health, ageing, homelessness, disability and child protection.

One of our main roles is to work with the states and territories to improve the quality of data. Where possible, we compile national datasets based on data from each state and territory. We also analyse these datasets and distribute information and statistics.

## About this privacy policy

This privacy policy outlines how we handle personal information and how we comply with our privacy obligations. We update this policy if anything changes, and fully review it every three years.

Under this policy, we adhere to the:

  * [_Privacy Act 1988_ (Cwlth)](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A03712) (Privacy Act)
  * Section 29 of the _[Australian Institute of Health and Welfare Act 1987 (Cwlth)](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A03450) _ (AIHW Act).



### _Privacy Act 1988  _(Cwlth)

Under the Privacy Act, ‘personal information’ is information about a living person who could reasonably be identified. We comply with the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) in the Privacy Act when we collect, use, disclose and store personal information, and when dealing with how people may access and correct the personal information we hold about them.

The Privacy Act has an important exception to the APPs that applies to the AIHW. Section 95 permits us to take actions that might otherwise breach an [APP](https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy-law/privacy-act/australian-privacy-principles), if those actions are for medical research and in accordance with the [Guidelines under Section 95 of the Privacy Act 1988](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2014L01500/Html/Volume_2) issued by the National Health and Medical Research Council.

### _Australian Institute of Health and Welfare Act 1987_ (Cwlth)

We do not disclose information we collect about persons (living or deceased) or organisations to anyone outside the AIHW unless authorised to do so under the AIHW Act.

It is a criminal offence for our staff, or anyone working with or receiving information from us, to disclose information in breach of Section 29 of the Act.

### Our Ethics Committee

Our [Ethics Committee](https://web.archive.org/our-services/committees/aihw-ethics-committee) is established under Section 16 of the AIHW Act and the [_Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (Ethics Committee) Regulations 2018_](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2018L00317). The Committee's functions and membership are prescribed in the regulations.

One function is to determine, on ethical grounds, if identifiable data should be released for a specific purpose. This is data containing personal information (Privacy Act) or information concerning a person (AIHW Act). The Committee can impose conditions or restrictions on the release of such data.

The Committee considers applications:

  * by external researchers to access identifiable data we hold which they want to link with their own data for medical research projects
  * by our units and collaborating centres when they start a new data collection or change the scope of a data collection
  * when we propose to link data sets for analysis
  * for [data linkage](https://web.archive.org/our-services/data-linkage) activities proposed on behalf of other government agencies in our role as an accredited [integrating authority.](https://web.archive.org/our-services/data-linkage/integrating-authority)



When deciding on applications the Ethics Committee considers compliance with the:

  1. AIHW Act

  2. Privacy Act, including Guidelines under Section 95

  3. [National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human Research](https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/guidelines-publications/e72).
