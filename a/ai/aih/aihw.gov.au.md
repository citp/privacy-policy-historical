When you visit this web site, we may make a record of your visit and log some or all of the following information for statistical purposes:

  * Your server or IP address (the name or number which uniquely identify the computer through which you are connected to the Internet)
  * The address of the referring site
  * The date and time of your visit
  * Your top level domain name (eg .gov. , .uk, .au etc)
  * The address of the pages accessed and the documents downloaded

No attempt will be made to identify individual users or their browsing activities except, in the unlikely event of an investigation, where a law enforcement agency (or other government agency) exercises a legal authority to inspect ISP logs (eg by warrant, subpoena or notice to produce).

Some web sites use "cookies" to record information about an individual's access to a site. This site does not use cookies to gather personal information about users. However, it does use cookies in the Order Cart facility in the Publications portal. Whilst the Order Cart is being used, cookies are used **temporarily** (during that session) to store Publications Catalogue identification numbers and quantities of items being ordered. No information about the user is stored.

Your e-mail address will only be recorded if you send us a message. It will only be used for the purpose for which you have provided it and it will not be added to a mailing list, nor disclosed without your consent.

We may use electronic forms on this site to gather personal information for purposes directly related to a function or activity of the AIHW. Should we do so we will inform you of the purpose for which the information is collected, including whether it is to be published.

There are risks associated with the use of the Internet for transmission of information. If we use electronic forms to collect information, we will provide you with optional alternative means of providing it, such as a mailing address or telephone contact number.
