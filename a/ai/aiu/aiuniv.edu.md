We log all connections to our web servers. Those log files include your IP address. An IP address is NOT personally identifiable information, but general information about your location, connection to the Internet, and your Internet Service Provider. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer the Sites.

"Cookies" are small pieces of information stored in a user's browser that give that user a unique identification. The Sites may insert cookies into your browser that identify you as a previous user of the Sites and contain non-personally identifying information regarding you and your navigation of the Sites. In some instances, these cookies may be used by us or other web sites during your future navigation of the internet to target specific advertisements to you based on your previous use of the Sites. The Sites may also read cookies already stored within your browser to identify non-personal information about you and communicate this information to other advertisers. All cookies are established on a per session basis, and are not permanently stored on your machine.

In the event you affirmatively act to register with one of the Sites or request additional information via the Sites, you agree to the following terms regarding your contact and personal information in addition to the general terms of this privacy policy tied to use of the Sites. The Sites' contact and/or registration forms request that users provide contact and other personal information (such as their name, mailing address, telephone number, e-mail address, education level, educational interests, age, income and marital status).
