This website requires JavaScript to be enabled. Please make sure JavaScript is enabled in your web browser preferences and any JavaScript blockers are disabled for this site.

## Privacy

Introduction to Artificial Intelligence is offered by Know Labs in partnership with Stanford University. We value your privacy and will not disclose any personal information to third parties without your consent.

PRIVACY POLICY 

At KnowLabs (“KnowLabs”, “we”, “us”, “our”) we respect your privacy rights. We have created this privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) to explain how we treat the information collected and received from your use of our websites, "http://www.ai-class.com", "http://www.know.it", "http://www.knowit.com", and "http://www.knowlabs.com" (each, a “Website” and collectively, the “Websites”). This Privacy Policy applies only to the Websites, and we are not responsible for the practices of persons, companies, or websites that KnowLabs does not control, manage, or employ. Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use Agreement (“Terms of Use”) and other published guidelines, we do not release personal information about our users without their permission. 

  
What Information this Privacy Policy Covers

Some of our Website’s functionality can be used without revealing any personal information, though for features or services related to the online course, personal information is required. If you do not use these specific features or services on the Website, then the only information we collect will be “Non-Personal Information” (i.e., information that cannot be used to identify you). Non-Personal Information includes information such as the web pages that you have viewed. In order to access certain features and benefits on our Website, you may need to submit “Personally Identifiable Information” (i.e., information that can be used to identify you). Personally Identifiable Information can include information such as your name and email address, among other things. You are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the Personally Identifiable Information you submit to KnowLabs. Inaccurate information may affect your ability to use the Website, the information you receive when using the Website, and our ability to contact you. For example, your email address should be kept current because that is one of the primary manners in which we communicate with you.

  
What You Consent to by Using Our Website

Please understand that by submitting any Personally Identifiable Information to us, you consent and agree that we may collect, use and disclose such Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use, and as permitted or required by law. If you do not agree with these terms, then please do not provide any Personally Identifiable Information to us. If you refuse or withdraw your consent, or if you choose not to provide us with any required Personally Identifiable Information, we may not be able to provide you with the services that can be offered on our Website.

  
What Information We Collect

We gather two types of information about users through the Website:

Non-Personal Information. When users come to our Website, we may track, collect and aggregate Non-Personal Information indicating, among other things, which pages of our Website were visited, the order in which they were visited, when they were visited, and which hyperlinks were “clicked.” We also collect information from the URLs from which you linked to our Website. Collecting such information may involve logging the IP address, operating system and browser software used by each user of the Website. Although such information is not Personally Identifiable Information, we may be able to determine from an IP address a user’s Internet Service Provider and the geographic location of his or her point of connectivity.

We also use or may use cookies and/or web beacons to help us determine and identify repeat visitors, the type of content and sites to which a user of our Website links, the length of time each user spends at any particular area of our Website, and the specific functionalities that users choose to use. Essentially, cookies are a user’s identification card for the KnowLabs servers. Web beacons are small graphic files linked to our servers that allow us to track your use of our Website and related functionalities. Cookies and web beacons allow KnowLabs to serve you better and more efficiently, and to personalize your experience at our Website. Cookies and web beacons are not used to retain Personally Identifiable Information. From time to time we may also use additional typical methods of collecting data.

You should be able to control how and whether cookies will be accepted by your web browser. Most browsers offer instructions on how to reset the browser to reject cookies in the "Help" section of the toolbar. If you reject our cookies, many functions and conveniences of this Website may not work properly.

Personally Identifiable Information. We collect Personally Identifiable Information that you provide to us when you sign-up for email updates or online courses, participate in our public forums, send us email messages, and/or participate in online courses or services on our Website. Among other things, we may use the Personally Identifiable Information that you provide to respond to your questions, provide you the specific course and/or services you select, send you updates about online courses offered by KnowLabs or other KnowLabs events, and send you email messages about Website maintenance or updates, among other things.

Personally Identifiable Information shall not include any information posted or sent by or to you via any public Forum. 

Participation in Online Courses. From time to time, KnowLabs may offer you the opportunity to participate in an online course on or through the Website. If you desire to participate in a course, you will be asked to provide us with certain information necessary to conduct such a course. This information may include, among other things, your name and email address.
