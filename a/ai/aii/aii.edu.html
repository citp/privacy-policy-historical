				 you may provide to us. We want you to understand what kinds of information we 
				 gather from you, how this information is used and protected, and how you can 
				 control its use. This statement discloses the privacy practices of The Art 
				 Institutes Website. By using The Art Institutes Website, the user agrees, 
				 without limitation or qualification, to be bound by this Privacy Policy. Any 
				 changes in our privacy policy will be communicated in this page so please 
				 check back from time to time.

				 <p><a onclick="window.open('http://www.artinstitutes.edu/privacy_nonus.asp','PolicyNonUS','width=500 height=400 scrollbars=yes resizable');" href="#">CONSENT OF NON US RESIDENTS TO BE BOUND BY US LAW</a></p>

				 <p>
				 <b>Who May Use this Website</b><br>
				 The Art Institutes Website is not intended or designed to attract users under the age 
				 of 13. We do not collect personally identifiable data from any person we know to be 
				 under the age of 13 and instruct users under 13 not to send us any information for 
				 collection on The Art Institutes Website.
				 <br><br>
				 The Art Institutes Website is designed for users from the United States. Users from 
				 other countries are advised not to disclose personal information to The Art Institutes 
				 unless they consent to having their information used as set forth in this website’s 
				 privacy policy rather than under the law of user’s home country. You transmit data to 
				 a server located in Pennsylvania subject to United States and Pennsylvania law. You 
				 should not send any personal information to The Art Institutes Website unless you 
				 agree to be bound by this privacy policy and by United States and Pennsylvania law.
				 </p>
				 
				 <p>
				 <b>Information Collected</b><br>
				 In general, you can visit this Website without telling us who you are or revealing 
				 any information about yourself. Our Website tracking software collects the domain 
				 names but not the email addresses of visitors. Domain name information that we collect 
				 is not used to personally identify you but is used to measure the number of visits, 
				 average time spent on the site and the pages viewed. We use this information to measure 
				 the use of the site and improve the content delivered on the site.
				 <br><br>
				 When you make a request for further information from The Art Institutes, you will be 
				 asked to provide certain contact information that will be collected and used for the 
				 purpose of responding to your request. The information collected from you may include 
				 your name, address, telephone number or email address.
				 <br><br>
				 When you make a request for further information and provide The Art Institutes with your 
				 personal contact information, it will be collected and used for the purpose of responding 
				 to your specific requests. We do not share, sell, or lease personal information about you 
				 except as set forth in this Website.
				 </p>
				 
				 <p>
				 <b>How Your Information is Used</b><br>
				 We utilize "cookies" on The Art Institutes Website. These are small files that we send to 
				 and store on your computer so that we may recognize it as a unique machine the next time 
				 you visit The Art Institutes Website.
				 <br><br>
				 Unless you specify that you would prefer not to hear from us, we may also use the 
				 information you provide to The Art Institutes Website to contact you. You may have these 
				 communications terminated if you give us notice. This likely will take 4-6 weeks from the 
				 time you give us notice.
				 </p>
				 
				 <p>
				 <b>Your Choices Regarding Use of Your Personal Information</b>
				 </p><ul>
				   <li type="square">
				     You can always choose not to provide information, even though it might be needed to 
					 take advantage of The Art Institutes Website features.
				   </li>
				   <li type="square">
				     You can add or update certain information that you send to us. When you update information, 
					 we usually keep a copy of the prior version for our records.
				   </li>
				   <li type="square">
				     If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us or if you wish to check your 
					 information, please e-mail us at webadmin@aii.edu

				 </ul>
				 <p></p>
				 
				 <p>
				 <b>Access to Your Information</b><br>
				 In the event that The Art Institutes and some of our assets are sold or transferred or used as 
				 security, the information collected on our websites including The Art Institutes Website may be 
				 transferred to third parties as part of that transaction. The Art Institutes may also provide 
				 information or provide access to information to any of our affiliated businesses or to our 
				 business partners.
				 <br><br>
				 The Art Institutes may use your contact information to reply to you and send information to you. 
				 The Art Institutes does not intend to reveal individually identifiable information to third 
				 parties except in the manner stated in the Privacy Policy. The Art Institutes will provide 
				 aggregated information received from you to third parties. The Art Institutes takes commercially 
				 reasonable precautions to prevent the aggregated information provided to third parties from 
				 including significant individually identifiable information.
				 <br><br>
				 If The Art Institutes is requested by law enforcement officials or judicial authorities to provide 
				 information on individuals, The Art Institutes may, without your consent, provide such information. 
				 In matters involving claims of personal or public safety or in litigation where the data is pertinent, 
				 The Art Institutes may use or disclose your personal information without your consent or court 
				 process.
				 </p>
				 
				 <p>
				 <b>Will Your Information Be Secure?</b><br>
				 The Art Institutes recognizes you may be concerned about the security of your personal information, 
				 and we are committed to employing reasonable technology in order to protect the security of our 
				 website. Even with such technology, no website is 100% secure. We will take reasonable measures 
				 which we believe are appropriate to protect your information from loss, misuse, alteration or 
				 destruction, and, where possible, will ask that any third parties to whom we may transfer your 
				 information take comparable steps to protect that security. 
				 <br><br>
				 If you use this site, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your access 
				 information and password and for restricting access to your computer, and you agree to accept 
				 responsibility for all activities that occur under your password.
				 <br><br>
				 We are the owner of data you supply to us.

				 Disclosure per year which will identify the third parties with whom The Art Institutes or any of 
				 its affiliates has shared the information we have collected from you.  You may request the Notice
