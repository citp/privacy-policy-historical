## Personal Information Voluntarily Submitted to HHS

If you choose to provide HHS with personal information -- for example by completing a “Contact Us” form, leaving a comment, sending email, or completing a survey -- we may use that information to respond to your message and/or help us get you the information or services you requested. Submitting personal information (name, address, telephone number, email address, etc.) is voluntary and is not required to access information on our website.

We retain the information only for as long as necessary to respond to your question or request, in most cases no longer than three months. Information submitted electronically is maintained and destroyed as required by the Federal Records Act and records schedules of the National Archives and Records Administration. It may be subject to disclosure in certain cases (for example, if required by a Freedom of Information Act request, court order, or Congressional access request, or if authorized by a Privacy Act System of Records Notice). It is subject to the Privacy Act if maintained in a Privacy Act system.

## Interaction with Children Online

The Department will take all reasonable steps necessary to protect the privacy and safety of any child from whom information is collected, as required by the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). A child’s parent or guardian is required to provide consent before HHS collects, uses, or shares personal information from a child under age 13.

Information and instructions will be provided by the specific Web page that collects information about a child. The Web page will specify exactly what the information will be used for, who will see it, and how long it will be kept.

## Visiting an Official HHS Page on Third-Party Websites

We maintain accounts on third-party websites, such as social media sites, as tools to better interact with the public. The security and privacy policies of third-party websites apply to your activity on those sites. Users of third-party websites often share information with the general public, user community, and/or the third-party operating the website. You should review the privacy policies of all websites before using them and ensure that you understand how your information may be used. You should also adjust privacy settings on your account on any third-party website to match your preferences.

### HHS Accounts

Common third-party website privacy policies used by HHS include:

## Information Collected and Used from Third-Party Websites

If you have an account/profile with a third-party website, and choose to follow, like, friend, or comment on a third-party website managed by HHS, certain personal information associated with your account may be made available to us based on the privacy policies of the third-party website and your privacy settings within that website.  **We do not share personally identifiable information made available through these websites.**

HHS conducts and publishes a Privacy Impact Assessment for each use of a third-party website. Each use of a third-party website may have unique features or practices. HHS sometimes collects and uses the information made available through third-party websites. To learn more, review the [published assessments](https://web.archive.org/pia/).

## Information Automatically Collected and Stored

When you browse through our website, we use Google’s Universal Analytics (UA) software to gather and temporarily store a variety of information about your visit. However, this information cannot be used to identify you as an individual. The basic information we collect during your visit includes:

  * The name of the domain you use to access the Internet (for example, Verizon.com, if you are using a Verizon online account, or stanford.edu, if you are connecting from Stanford University's domain);

The aggregate data is available only to Web managers and other designated staff who require this information to perform their duties. It is retained only for as long as needed for proper analysis.  The Google Analytics Privacy Policy is available at <https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/>

## Demographic and Interest Data

On some portions of our website we have enabled Universal Analytics (UA), and other third-party software (listed below), to provide aggregate demographic and interest data of our visitors. This information cannot be used to identify you as an individual. **While these tools are used by some websites to serve advertisements, HHS only uses them to measure demographic data. HHS has no control over advertisements served on other websites.** For each listed software, we have included links to Web pages where you can opt-out of having these tools collect data and/or serve you interest-based advertising.

**DoubleClick** : HHS uses DoubleClick to understand the characteristics and demographics of the people who visit HHS sites. HHS staff only conducts analyses on the aggregated data from DoubleClick.

HHS may employ tools provided by Google AdWords to support Display Advertising, including Remarketing, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, data collection via advertising cookies and anonymous identifiers, the DoubleClick Campaign Manager integration and/or Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting. In general, this means that third-party vendors, including Google, may show HHS ads on sites across the Internet based upon visits to HHS websites. To implement these tools, HHS and third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies and third- party cookies together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on past visits to HHS websites.  The Google AdWords Privacy Policy is available at <https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/>

Tynt does not collect personally identifiable information. Tynt Privacy Policy is available at <http://www.tynt.com/privacy_policy>

**Widgets** : HHS offers widgets that provide specific HHS site content to any website where the widget code is implemented.

**Voice of Consumer** _:_ HHS uses the Voice of Consumer survey tool to collect feedback from HHS website visitors. The Voice of Consumer tool is implemented on HHS websites both as on-page surveys and pop-up surveys.  HHS uses survey results to measure visitor satisfaction with HHS websites. This survey tool does not require users to submit personally identifiable information. The survey reports are available only to HHS managers, members of the HHS Communications and Web Teams, and other designated staff who require this information to perform their duties.

## Cookies

Websites can automatically place small text files, known as “cookies,” on the computers of their visitors.  So long as they do not expire or get deleted, cookies identify the unique browser used by the visitor.  On each subsequent visit to the website, the visitor’s browser will retrieve the cookie, allowing us to aggregate the number of return visitors. HHS uses “cookies” to test and optimize our website design and content. We use two types of cookies on our websites:

  * We use  **session cookies**  to gather data for technical purposes, such as improving navigation through our website and generating statistics about how the website is used. Session cookies are temporary text files that expire when you leave our website. When cookies expire, they are automatically deleted from your computer.  **We do not use session cookies to collect personal information, and we do not share data collected from session cookies.**
  * We use  **multi-session cookies** , or persistent cookies, to customize our website for frequent visitors and to test variations of website design and content. Multi-session cookies are cookies that are stored over more than a single session on your computer.  **We do not use multi-session cookies to collect personal information, and we do not share data collected from multi-session cookies**. Our multi-session cookies are set to expire no more than two years after your last visit to our website. After two years, they are automatically deleted from your computer. HHS is unable to identify an individual by using such technologies.



You can take actions to block cookies by [opting out](http://www.usa.gov/optout_instructions.shtml) [](https://web.archive.org/disclaimer.html). Blocking session cookies from your computer will not affect your access to the content and tools on our website. Blocking multi-session or persistent cookies may affect the personalization of the information on those sites.
