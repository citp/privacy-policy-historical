This security measure is working when you see either the symbol of an unbroken key or closed lock (depending on your browser) on the bottom of your browser window.

Credit card numbers are used only for processing payment and are not used for other purposes. As part of real-time payment processing, FinalWire subscribes to a fraud management service. This service gives you and FinalWire an extra level of security to guard against credit card fraud to protect your financial data.
