On some pages, you can submit information about other people - for example, if you would like to notify others about your Site space or page via email. In this case, the only type of information we may collect is the email address. 

IDILogic Sites contain links to other websites, not owned, operated, or otherwise related to IDILogic, at which PII may be collected. In such cases, the collection and use of your PII will be governed by the privacy policies applicable to those websites.
