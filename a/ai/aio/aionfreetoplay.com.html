                    Generally, you can access our Internet presence without disclosing any personal data to us. It is always your choice whether or not to provide us with your personal data. We collect your data to be able to fulfil the user contract concluded with you. In addition to monitoring compliance with the terms of use and the rules of the game, this includes in particular the proper handling of your payment orders. If you would like to register on our Internet sites, participate in sweepstakes or subscribe to our newsletter, it is necessary to provide personal data. This data includes, for example, your name, address, e-mail address and other personal data which Gameforge may query in individual cases. In addition, the automatic collection of further data of registered customers, e.g. the IP address, is required for the technical implementation of our services as well as the monitoring of the use of our services in compliance with the law and the contract. The proper implementation of the user contract involves in particular the monitoring of compliance with the terms of use and the rules of the game. Insofar as we provide you clients for download to participate in our games, a programme to avoid altering or fraudulent interventions in the game may be installed in the game along with these clients to prevent unlawful use of the game and manipulation of data.   Such programmes are started together with the respective game and exclusively serve to protect the data of the respective game stored on the clients and the servers. During the participation in the respective game, an analysis of the client software, the technical communication between the client and our servers as well as known unlawful technical manipulations and aids (in particular hacks and cheats) may be conducted. Further analysis of your computer and data will not be conducted; in particular neither your communication within the game nor your other data stored on your computer outside the game will be evaluated. If no alterations of the client or the communication between the client and the server are detected on your computer, personal data will not be collected and in particular not transmitted to the respective game server or Gameforge. In case abusive use, in particular technical manipulation and violation of the terms of use and the rules of the game, is detected, the data required to eliminate the abuse will be transmitted to Gameforge. In the event that such a programme is installed along with a game, you will be informed of this by separate notice. You may abort or cancel the installation at any time by aborting the installation of the client or uninstalling the client.
