### Security

AIPAC takes the utmost care to protect the safety and security of your online transactions by using industry-standard encryption and security protocols. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). The credit card information provided is only entered through the site but is stored on our third party payment gateway.

We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
