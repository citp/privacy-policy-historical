        <p class="style50">A "cookie" is a small piece of information (token) sent by a Web
        server and stored on a user’s system (hard drive) so it can later be
        read back from that system.
        Using cookies is a convenient technique for having the browser
        remember some specific information.
        Cookies may be categorized as “session” or “persistent”
        cookies.
        “Session” cookies are temporary cookies that are used to
        maintain context or “state” between otherwise stateless Web
        transactions (e.g., to maintain a "shopping basket" of goods
        selected during a single logical session at a site) and that must be
        deleted at the end of the web session in which they are created.
        “Persistent” cookies remain over time and can be used for a
        variety of purposes, including to track a user's access over time and
        across Web sites, or to establish user preferences.</p>

    The Maxwell Web site does use session cookies, i.e., tokens that
    remain active only until you close your browser, in order to (make the site
