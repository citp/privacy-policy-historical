**Introduction**

Thanks for visiting affiliaXe's Privacy Policy, updated and in sync with the new data protection regulation, in effect from May 25th, 2018.

This Privacy Policy Agreement between affiliaXe LTD (collectively “We,” “Us, or affiliaXe”) and the User ("You") was created to govern the way affiliaXe collects, uses, processes and disclose information collected from users of affiliaXe.com (“Website”). This Privacy Policy applies to the website, mobile applications, products and services offered by affiliaxe.

Users of the Website include consumers who visit the Site, affiliates, and advertisers who work with affiliaXe via the Site and provide us with personal information.

**About affiliaXe**

As an affiliate network, affiliaXe provides services via the Internet to both Publishers and Advertisers. The Website acts as an intermediary agent between a person, entity, affiliate or its agent ("Publisher") and an "Advertiser" (another person, company, or entity).

A Publisher is operating Website(s) (internet domain, or a portion of a domain), and other promotional methods to drive traffic to another Website or Website content. The Publisher may earn financial compensation ("Payouts") for "Transactions" (actions made by Visitors as defined by the Advertiser). The "Visitor" (any person or entity that is not the Publisher, the Publisher's agent, or the advertiser) is making an action (registration, purchase, signup, etc.) which is referred to the Publisher through an Internet connection ("Link") to a Website operated by the Advertiser. The Advertiser compensates the Publisher on actions, by this Agreement and the Program Payout specifications.
