        <p><strong>1. PRIVACY</strong></p>
        <p>We are committed to  protecting your personal information. We have created this Privacy Policy to  let you know what information We collect when you participate in the Affiliate  Network at <a href="http://www.affclub.com/">the &nbsp;AffClub Website</a> (collectively, the '<strong>Affiliate Network</strong>'), why We collect  this information and how We use the collected information.</p>
        <p>Please note that  this Privacy Policy will be agreed between you and PartyPartners Limited and the  bwin.party Group, being bwin.party digital entertainment plc together with its Group companies as  defined in the <a href="legal.do">Standard  Affiliate Agreement</a> ('<strong>PartyPartners</strong>',  '<strong>We</strong>', '<strong>Us</strong>' or '<strong>Our</strong>', as appropriate).</p>
        <p>We may periodically  make changes to this Privacy Policy and will notify you of these changes by  posting the modified terms on the <a href="http://www.affclub.com/">AffClub  Website</a>. We recommend that you revisit this Privacy Policy regularly.</p>
        <p><strong>2. INFORMATION COLLECTED</strong></p>
        <p>We consider  information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not  limited to, first and last name, date of birth, bank account details, home or  other physical address, email address, phone number or other contact  information to be Personal Information ('<strong>Personal  Information</strong>'). You may be asked to provide Personal Information  when you use the AffClub Website, open an affiliate account or to use the  Affiliate Network. The Personal Information that We collect may include  information such as: contact information (including telephone number), shipping  information, billing information, transaction history, website usage  preferences, and feedback regarding the Affiliate Network. This information is  held by Us on servers based in Gibraltar and Alderney  and elsewhere from time to time. In addition, when you interact with the Affiliate  Network, Our servers keep an activity log unique to you that collects certain  administrative and traffic information including: source IP address, time of  access, date of access, web page(s) visited, language use, software crash  reports and type of browser used. This information is essential for the  provision and quality of the Affiliate Network. We do not collect Personal Information about you on the Affiliate Network without your knowledge. </p>
        <p><strong>3. MEANS OF COLLECTING AND PROCESSING DATA</strong></p>
        <p>We may  automatically collect certain data as discussed above and receive Personal  Information about you where you provide such information through the Affiliate  Network or other communications and interactions with Us. We may also receive  Personal Information from customer lists lawfully acquired from third-party  vendors. In addition, We may engage the services of third-party service  providers to provide technical support, process your online transactions and  maintain your online account. We will have access to any information you  provide to such vendors, service providers and third-party e-commerce services,  and We will use the Personal Information as set out in this Privacy Policy  below. This information will only be disclosed to third parties outside the  bwin.party Group in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We take steps to  ensure that Our arrangements with third-party service providers and online  vendors protect your privacy.</p>
        <p><strong>4. INFORMATION USE</strong></p>
        <p>We use the Personal Information We collect from you to deliver Our Affiliate Network, to provide customer support, to undertake necessary security and identify verification checks, to process any of your online transactions, meet certain business requirements and for any other purpose related to the operation of the Affiliate Network. Your Personal Information may also be used by Us to provide you with promotional offers and information regarding bwin.party products and services and in order for the AffClub to better provide a range of products and services and improved customer service. From time-to-time, We may request information from you via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary, and, therefore, you have the choice of whether or not to disclose such information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name, correspondence address and telephone number), and demographic information (such as zip or postal code or age). If you choose to participate in a survey or contest and win, by accepting any contest prize or winnings from Us, you consent to use of your name and likeness for advertising and promotional purposes without additional compensation, except where prohibited by law. Unless you have elected not to receive promotional information, We may also use your Personal Information (including your email address and phone number) to provide you with information regarding our products, services and promotions, including other gaming products (including online poker, casino, betting and bingo services) and products and services from third parties carefully selected by Us.</p>
        <p><strong>5. CERTAIN EXCLUDED DISCLOSURES</strong></p>
        <p>We may disclose  your Personal Information if required to do so by law, or if We believe in good  faith that such action is necessary to: (1) comply with any legal process  served on Us, any of Our sites or the Affiliate Network or in circumstances  where We are under a substantially similar legal obligation; (2) protect and  defend Our rights or property; or (3) act to protect the personal safety of  users of the Affiliate Network or the public. If, in Our sole determination,  you are found to have cheated or attempted to defraud Us, or any other user of  the Affiliate Network in any way including but not limited to game manipulation  or payment fraud, or if We suspect you of receiving or making fraudulent  payments, including use of stolen credit cards, or any other fraudulent  activity (including any chargeback or other reversal of a payment) or  prohibited transaction (including money laundering), We reserve the right to  share this information (together with your identity) with other online gaming  sites, banks, credit card companies, and appropriate agencies.</p>
        <p><strong>6. ACCESS</strong></p>
        <p>You may 'opt out'  of receiving any promotional communications either by choosing to opt out where  such option is made available on Our sites or the Affiliate Network or in an  email you receive from Us, or at any time by sending an email, or by writing to  Us at Customer Affiliate Network, PartyPartners Limited, Suite 711, Block 7,  Europort, Gibraltar. In addition, you may contact Us at this address if you: 1)  want to confirm the accuracy of the Personal Information We have collected  about you; 2) would like to update your Personal Information or delete your  Personal Information; and/or 3) have any complaint regarding Our use of your Personal  Information.

        <p><strong>7. COOKIES</strong></p>
        <p>Cookies are small  text files that are stored on your computer or equipment when you visit certain  online pages that record your preferences. We use cookies to track use of Our  sites. We also may use cookies to monitor traffic to the site, improve the Affiliate  Network and make it easier and/or more relevant for your use.</p>
        <p><strong>7.1 When do we use cookies?</strong></p>
        <p><strong>7.1.1. During the sign-up process</strong></p>
        <p>These cookies will hold information collected during your registration and will  allow Us to recognize you as a customer and provide you with the services you  require. We may also use this data to better understand your interests while  online and to enhance your visits to the <a href="http://www.affclub.com/">AffClub Website</a>.</p>
        <p><strong>7.1.2. On Our website</strong></p>
        <p>For visitors to Our website, we use cookies to collect  information. Our servers use two different types of cookies:</p>
        <p>A 'session-based' cookie: This type of cookie is only allocated to your  computer for the duration of your visit to Our website. A session-based cookie  helps you move around Our website faster and, if you're a registered customer, it allows Us to give you information that is more relevant to you. This cookie automatically expires when you close your browser.</p>
        <p>A 'persistent' cookie: This type of cookie will remain on your computer for 30 days.</p>
        <p><strong>7.2 Cookies allow Us to:</strong></p>

        <p class="flow">Better understand  your preferences and offer you more relevant promotional offers.</p>
        <p class="flow">Identify your preferences when customizing content or functionality for you.</p>
        <p class="flow">Confirm you are a registered user and save your login details when accessing certain services on Our website.</p>
        <p class="flow">Collect statistics on the use of Our services.</p>
        <p class="flow">We may also use cookies and web beacons to ensure that Our mailing tools are working properly.</p>

        <p><strong>7.3 How can I refuse or opt out of cookies?</strong></p>
        <p>You have the  ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but, if you prefer, you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies. The Help menu on the menu bar of most browsers will tell you  how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser  notify you when you receive a new cookie and how to disable cookies altogether.  If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to experience all of the interactive features on Our sites.</p>
        <p><strong>8. CONSENT TO USE OF ELECTRONIC SERVICE PROVIDERS</strong></p>
        <p>In order to take  part in the Affiliate Network, you will be required to receive money from Us.  We may use third-party electronic payment processors and/or financial institutions  ('ESPs') to process such financial transactions. By accepting this Privacy  Policy, you expressly consent to Personal Information necessary for the  processing of transactions being shared with ESPs, including, where necessary,  the transfer of information outside of your country. We take steps to ensure  that Our arrangements with ESPs protect your privacy.</p>
        <p><strong>9. CONSENT TO SECURITY REVIEW</strong></p>
        <p>We reserve the  right to conduct a security review at any time to validate your identity, age,  the registration data provided by you and to verify your use of the Affiliate  Network and your financial transactions for potential breach of Our Standard  Affiliate Agreement and of applicable law. By agreeing to the terms of our  Standard Affiliate Agreement you authorise Us, Our staff, agents and suppliers  to use your Personal Information and to disclose your Personal Information to  third parties for the purposes of validating the information you provide to Us  in the course of using the Affiliate Networks, including, where necessary, the  transfer of information outside of your country. Security reviews may include  but are not limited to ordering a credit report and/or otherwise verifying the  information you provide against third-party databases. In addition, to  facilitate these security reviews, you agree to provide such information or  documentation as We may request.</p>
        <p><strong>10. SECURITY</strong></p>
        <p>We understand the importance of information security and the techniques needed to secure information. We store all of the Personal Information We receive directly from  you in a password-protected database residing within Our secure network behind  active state-of-the-art firewall software. The <a href="http://www.affclub.com/">AffClub Website</a> and the Affiliate  Network support SSL Version 3 with 128-bit encryption. We take steps to ensure  Our subsidiaries, agents, affiliates and suppliers also employ adequate levels  of security. </p>
        <p><strong>11. PROTECTION OF CHILDREN</strong></p>
        <p>The Affiliate  Network is not intended for or directed at persons under the age of eighteen  (18). Any person who provides their information to Us through any part of the Affiliate  Network represents to Us that they are eighteen (18) years of age or older. It  is Our policy to uncover attempts by minors to access Our Affiliate Networks  which may involve Us having to access and verify your Personal Information. If  We become aware that a minor has attempted to or has submitted personal information via the online site, We will not accept this information and will take steps to remove such information from Our records.</p>
        <p><strong>12. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS</strong></p>
        <p>Personal Information collected on the Affiliate Network may be stored and processed in any country in which We or Our affiliates, suppliers, ESPs or agents maintain  facilities. By participating in the Affiliate Network, you expressly consent to  any transfer of information outside of your country (including to third  countries that may not have been assessed as having adequate privacy laws).  Nevertheless, We take steps to ensure that Our agents, affiliates and suppliers  comply with Our standards of privacy regardless of their location.</p>
        <p><strong>13. THIRD-PARTY PRACTICES</strong></p>
        <p>We cannot ensure the protection of any information collected by any third party administering Our Affiliate Network or any other program, since these third-party online sites are owned and operated independently of Us. Any information collected by these third parties is not governed by this Privacy Policy but by the privacy  policy, if any, of such third party. If you have questions about a third  party's information practices, please read its privacy policy. We assume no responsibility or liability whatsoever for the practices, actions or policies of such third parties, and We are not responsible for the content or privacy  practices of such online sites.</p>
        <p><strong>14. LEGAL DISCLAIMER</strong></p>
        <p>The Affiliate  Network operates 'AS-IS' and 'AS-AVAILABLE,' without liability of any kind. We  are not responsible for events beyond Our direct control. Because of the  complex and constantly changing nature of Our technology and business, We  cannot guarantee nor do We represent that there will be error-free performance  regarding the privacy of your Personal Information, and We will not be liable  for any indirect, incidental, consequential or punitive damages relating to the  use or release of Personal Information.</p>
        <p><strong>15. MERGERS AND OTHER EVENTS REQUIRING TRANSFER</strong></p>
        <p>If We should ever  file for bankruptcy, or become insolvent, or be acquired by a third party,  merge with a third party, sell all or part of Our assets, or transfer  substantially all or part of Our relevant assets to a third party, We are  entitled to share the Personal Information and all other information you have  provided through the Affiliate Network to potential and subsequent business and  merger partners.</p>
        <p><strong>16. CONSENT TO PRIVACY POLICY</strong></p>
        <p>By clicking  'Submit' or 'I agree' during the registration process or by your continued use of the Affiliate Network following the posting of this Privacy Policy (as  applicable), you agree to this Privacy Policy. This is Our entire and exclusive  Privacy Policy and it supersedes any earlier version. This Privacy Policy  should be read in conjunction with the Standard Affiliate Agreement and any  additional applicable terms posted on the <a href="http://www.affclub.com/">AffClub Website</a> . We may  periodically make changes to this Privacy Policy and will notify you of these  changes by posting the modified terms on the <a href="http://www.affclub.com/">AffClub Website</a>. We recommend  that you revisit this Privacy Policy regularly.</p>
