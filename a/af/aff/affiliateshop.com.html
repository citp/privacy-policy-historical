                    <br>
                  (a) General: When users come   to our site, we collect and aggregate information indicating their home server,   but not their e-mail addresses. Such information helps us identify the most   popular content and portions of our site and determine the effectiveness of our   various promotional activities. We aggregate such information for internal   review and thereafter it's superseded by more recent information.<br>
                  <br>
                  (b)   "Cookies": We also use "cookies" -- that is, small text files placed on your   computer's hard drive -- to help you in getting faster access to this site's   contents, and to help us determine the type of content you find of interest and   the sites to which you link, the length of time you spend at any particular area   of this site, and the particular SilkRoad services you choose to use. Cookies   are only read by the server that placed them, and are unable to execute any code   or virus. Cookies allow SilkRoad to serve you better, and to personalize your   Web-browsing experience. Nevertheless, you should be able to control how and   whether cookies will be accepted by your Web browser. For more information on   how to do this, please refer to the documentation accompanying your browser or   third party Web sites. </span>

                    <br>
                  (a) General: In certain areas of   this site, we require that you provide us with personally-identifiable   information, in order to be able to use that portion or those portions of this   site. For instance, the names and contact information of persons who visit our   Web sites are added to our data base (presently maintained in Winston-Salem,   North Carolina, USA) so that, for example, they may be contacted in the future   regarding SilkRoad's products, services or future opportunities. Such contact   may occur by email, telephone or mail, as SilkRoad deems appropriate.<br>
                  <br>

Following such internal review, such aggregated information is then   superseded by more recent information.
