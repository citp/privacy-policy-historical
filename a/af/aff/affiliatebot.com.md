> 
> Some terms used in this Policy are:
> 
> Terms like "Advertiser", "Publisher" and "Cookies" are referred to frequently in this Privacy Policy and can be defined as:
> 
> "Advertiser" \- a person or organization that has entered into a Affiliatebot Advertiser Service Agreement and operates a Web site that pays for a sale, lead or click by an Internet User referred by a Publisher. 
> 
> "Publisher" \- a person or organization that has entered into a Affiliatebot Publisher Service Agreement and may be compensated for a sale, lead or click by an Internet User that the Publisher referred to an Advertiser's Web site.

> "Cookies" \- which are small pieces of information that are stored by an Internet User's browser on the Internet User's hard drive. 
> 
> Collection of Data
> 
> Affiliatebot is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. Members of the Affiliatebot network include publishers and advertisers involved in advertising campaign transactions. Member information collected includes personally identifiable information that is necessary to conduct business, such as name, phone number, and email address. Payments made to and from Affiliatebot require the collection of personally identifiable information that may include credit card numbers and bank account information. Phone numbers may be used to contact Members for sales or inventory acquisition purposes. All Member information is collected, modified and stored in a password protected environment. This information is used for service, media delivery, contact, billing and accounts payable purposes. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others. All Member information collection is explicit, voluntary, manually entered by the Member, and can be opted-out. Affiliatebot will never share information about you without your permission. 
> 
> Cookies are used to simplify Member login and to facilitate secure navigation through the password protected areas of the website. Members who choose to reject all cookies may have difficulty navigating the password protected areas of the website depending on the nature of their connection (dynamic IP, proxy server, etc.)
> 
> Use And Disclosure of Data
> 
> Member information is not shared with any third party outside Affiliatebot, except for that necessary to conduct business, such as clearing a credit card transaction for an advertising campaign purchase or making an ACH direct deposit to pay a Publisher, or as required by law. The security of Member information is crucial to our success in the highly competitive field of online advertising. Affiliatebot may, from time to time, use "gallery" pages to identify Publishers and Advertisers by business identity ONLY (e.g. Adcycle.com is a new Member of the Fastclick Network). 
> 
> Affiliatebot reserves the right to release information on Internet Users if compelled to do so by proper judicial or governmental authorities. Disclosure shall be limited to only to those that Affiliatebot is compelled to disclose to. 
> 
> Security Measures
> 
> This website takes every precaution to protect Member information against loss, misuse or alteration. Access to personally identifiable information is password protected and restricted within our organization on a need-to-know basis.
> 
> Affiliatebot employs industry standard security measures to ensure the security of all data. Access to Affiliatebot customer data is accessible via password protection through the Advertiser and Publisher Accounts created by each Advertiser and Publisher, and to designated Affiliatebot employees who require system level access in order to perform their jobs. Access to Internet User data that identifies the Internet User's name and/or e-mail addresses is limited to designated Affiliatebot employees who require such access in order to perform their jobs and to an Advertiser or Publisher that provided such information. Each Advertiser and Publisher is responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of its own password used for accessing its accounts in Affiliatebot.
> 
> While Affiliatebot uses encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect Member information off-line. All of our Member information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers' information is protected. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment, in locked enclosures, in a restricted access, locked server room.

> This website contains links to other websites. Please be aware that Affiliatebot is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other websites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our website and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this website.

> Affiliatebot does not intentionally send unsolicited e-mail messages that could legitimately be construed as spam. Affiliatebot's Advertisers and Publishers are held to the same standards.
> 
> Advertiser and Publisher Web Sites
> 
> Although Affiliatebot requires Advertisers and Publishers to adhere to Good Business Practices as a condition of Membership in Affiliatebot, we are not responsible for the information practices of Advertisers or Publishers. Advertisers and Publishers may collect information from or about Internet Users, including personal information. The collection, use, and disclosure of information by Advertisers and Publishers are subject to their respective privacy policies, which may differ from our Privacy Policy
