### What Personally Identifiable Information does AffSpy collect?

A primary purpose of collecting information from you is to provide you with a safe, smooth, effective, and personalized experience. We will only collect information about you that we consider necessary. 

Generally, AffSpy collects information in several ways. Some information is gathered if you register. This includes, but is not limited to, your email address and password. You may also choose to submit optional information, such as your name, mailing address, phone number, and website address. We often indicate which fields are required and which fields are optional. Additionally, we save browsing and data log information linked to your account. We also collect personal information when you report a problem, either through the Site’s contact form or email system. We may also collect information that you post on our blog or that you return to us through feedback forms or surveys. If you contact AffSpy, we may keep a record of that correspondence.

Wherever AffSpy collects personal information, we make an effort to include a link to this Privacy Policy on that page. 

### What are “cookies” and how does AffSpy use them?

Data collection devices, such as “cookies,” are used to store, and sometimes track, information about you. Generally, these cookies help provide personalized services and promote trust and safety. A cookie is a small file containing a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and placed on your computer’s hard drive to assist us in providing our services. All pages on the Site where you are prompted to login or that are customizable may require that you accept cookies. Our cookies are only read by the server that placed them and are unable to execute any code or virus. More specifically, we may use cookies to:

(1) Remind us of who you are when you login and to access your account information in order to deliver to you a more personalized service;  
(2) Allow you to enter your password less frequently during a session;  
(3) Measure your visiting and purchasing/affiliate patterns in the aggregate. Aggregate data (data gathered across all user accounts) may be gathered in a non-personally identifiable form to build higher quality online services by performing statistical analyses of the collective characteristics and behavior of our visitors, such as how long and how often users view certain pages;  
(4) Determine your clickstream to the Site;  
(5) Better personalize the content that you and other users will see on the Site;  
(6) Collect IP addresses and log-in information for system administration;   
(7) Automatically share some information with Google Analytics to analyze a broad range of information. However, the analytics are exclusively for our internal use to better manage the website experience for our visitors and evaluate advertising strategies and tactics (no personally identifiable information is shared with Google); and  
(8) Other purposes to assist us in delivering the highest quality service possible.

You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits.

Advertisers linked to the Site have separate policy practices for which AffSpy has no responsibility or liability.

We may disclose account information where we have reason to believe that disclosing the information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be violating AffSpy’s policies as specified in the Privacy Policy or User Agreement, violating state or federal law, or may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) AffSpy’s rights or property, other users of the Site, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities.

For example, we may be forced to disclose information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, or users may abuse or misuse your personal information that they unlawfully collect from the Site. We will try to protect your privacy, however, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private.

### What are my choices regarding collection, use, and distribution of my information?

### What security precautions are in place to protect the loss, misuse, or alteration of my information?

Whenever AffSpy handles your personal information, we take steps to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with the relevant User Agreement and this Policy. Your information is stored on our servers located in the United States. We use procedural and mechanical safeguards to protect your personal information against loss or theft as well as unauthorized access and disclosure to protect your privacy, including encryption. Unfortunately, however, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. We cannot, therefore, warrant or ensure the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.

We recommend that you do not disclose your password to anyone. AffSpy will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or unsolicited email. If you choose to share your user name and password or your personal information with third parties, you are responsible for all actions taken with your account and therefore you should review that third party’s privacy policy. If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your personal information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately change your password.
