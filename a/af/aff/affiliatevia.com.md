# Privacy Policy

This page sets forth the privacy policies and practices of AffiliateVIA Network.

Use of Information: AffiliateVIA will not collect any information about individuals, except where it is specifically and knowingly provided by them for applying for our products and services. Examples of such information are:

  * Your Name
  * Your Contact numbers
  * Your Email IDs
  * Your Contact Address
  * Your Websites related information



The information collected will be used to send you the information you have requested and to provide information that may be useful to you. We may share non-personal aggregate statistics (group) data about our site visitors’ traffic patterns with partners or other parties. However, we do not sell or share any information about individual users.

**Your rights :** In addition to the company’s safeguards, the Data Protection Act protects your personal data in India. This provides amongst other things that the data we hold about you should be processed lawfully and fairly. It should be accurate, relevant and not excessive. The information should be kept up to date, where necessary, and not retained for longer than is necessary. It should be kept securely to prevent unauthorized access by other people. You have the right to see what is held about you and correct any inaccuracies online.

**Policy changes :** Any changes to this policy will be posted here.

**Security :** AffiliateVIA treats all the data held with the utmost care and security. Any details you give will remain completely confidential

**Tracking Technology Privacy Policy**

**Web Beacons**

**User :** A person or persons using a web browser to view a website.

Merchants who establish a commercial relationship with AffiliateVIA may insert into their web pages an electronic file called a Web Beacon, which allows a web site to record Users who have visited that page or to access certain cookies.

AffiliateVIA uses cookies and Web Beacons to track referrals of Users on behalf of registered partners (“Affiliates”) from their web sites to the web sites of AffiliateVIA’s commercial partners (“Merchants”) and also for auditing purposes. This information is used to remunerate the Affiliate for the referral, typically when a sale is made.

The tracking works by Affiliates passing Users to Merchants via a AffiliateVIA domain where a AffiliateVIA cookie is laid on the User’s computer. The User is instantly forwarded to the destination URL specified by the Affiliate. Should a AffiliateVIA Web Beacon be present on a page the User visits, AffiliateVIA records information from the Web Beacon and accesses the cookie it laid previously to record the unique cookie ID.

**Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”):**  
AffiliateVIA does not record any PII either in the cookie or in databases about the User. The cookie stores only a unique cookie ID that links to data stored in AffiliateVIA databases. Data that is recorded in the databases includes non-PII information such as the page of referral, time of referral, Affiliate ID and destination URL. We will also record the User’s IP address whenever the User’s browser communicates with our server, for auditing purposes. Additional information may also be communicated for the purposes of remuneration and auditing: Sale value, sale time, sales quantity, order ID and item code(s).

**Use of information :**  
Information recorded through AffiliateVIA Web Beacons is used to report non-PII about referrals to our partners. This includes page of referral, time of referral, sale time, sale value, sale quantity and item code(s). It will not be sold, licensed or in any way transferred to another party except for auditing purposes. We do not record any information about the User, beyond what has been described above, of their browsing activity, and we do not use that information to anticipate or plan for a User’s future activity.
