            <br>
            The Internet is an amazing tool. It has the power to change the way we live, and we're starting to see that potential today. With only a few mouse-clicks, you can follow the news, look up facts, buy goods and services, and communicate with others from around the world. It's important to&nbsp;AffiliateProfitsClub to help our customers retain their privacy when they take advantage of all the Internet has to offer. <br>
            <br>
            We believe your business is no one else's. Your privacy is important to you and to us. So we'll protect the information you share with us. To protect your privacy,&nbsp;AffiliateProfitsClub follow different principles in accordance with worldwide practices for customer privacy and data protection.<br>
            <br>
            We won’t sell or give away your name, mail address, phone number, email address or any other information to anyone. We’ll use state-of-the-art security measures to protect your information from unauthorized users. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>NOTICE<br>
            </strong><br>
            We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you (personal information) or allows us to contact you. Generally, this information is requested when you create your membership and/or subscribe to member updates or other in house mail. We use your Personal Information for four primary purposes:<br>

            To help you quickly find software, services or information. <br>

            <br>

            We adhere to the Children's Privacy Act. You must be 18 years of age to join or use AffiliateProfitsClub or any of the recommended or linked sites. This site follow the guidelines, policies and laws of the Federal Trade Commission (<a href="http://www.ftc.gov" target="_blank">www.ftc.gov </a>). We retain the right to refuse anyone membership in any of our sites. If we learn or have reason to believe that a User is underage according to the guidelines, policies and laws of the Federal Trade Commission, we will promptly revoke that User’s account and delete any personal information.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>ENFORCEMENT<br>
            </strong><br>
            If for some reason you believe&nbsp;AffiliateProfitsClub<font face="Arial"> has</font>&nbsp;not adhered to these principles, please notify us at: <a href="/CustomerSupport/customer_support/index.html" target="_blank">AffiliateProfitsClub</a> , support @ AffiliateProfitsClub.com or by certified mail, return receipt requested, MemberSpeed, Inc 2248 Meridian Boulevard Suite H., Minden, NV 89423, United States, Telephone 612-590-1467 and Facsimile 320-396-0046.&nbsp;We will do our best to determine and correct the problem promptly.

            <br>
            <strong>ELECTRONIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION</strong> <br>
            <br>
            When you buy and install a new product, we may ask you to register your purchase electronically. When you do, we merge your registration information with any information you've already left with us (we call that information your personal profile). If you haven't previously registered with us, we create a personal profile for you from your product registration information. If you ever want to review or update that information, you can click on Update Profile, and edit any of the Personal Information in your profile. If you haven't already created a membership, we will ask you to do so. This ensures that only you can access your information.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>CUSTOMER PROFILES</strong><br>
            <br>
            As mentioned above, every registered customer has a unique personal profile. Each profile is assigned a unique personal identification username, which helps us ensure that only you can access your profile.<br>
            <br>
            When you register, you create your profile, your username and password. It is your passport to seamless travel across your member area, allowing you to download software and order more plugin modules without having to fill out registration forms with information you've already provided. Even if you switch computers, you won't have to re-register – just use your Registration ID to identify yourself. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>WHAT WE DO WITH THE INFORMATION YOU SHARE</strong><br>
            <br>
            When you join us, you provide us with your contact information, including your name and email address. We use this information to send you updates about your order, questionnaires to measure your satisfaction with our service and announcements about new and exciting services that we offer. When you order from us, our 3rd party payment processors such as paypal and 2checkout will ask for your credit card number and billing address. They use this information only to bill you for the product(s) you order at that time. <br>
            <br>
            We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, including programming, answering customer questions about products or services, sending email and processing event registration. We will only provide those companies the information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.<br>
            <br>

            <br>
            If your information is lost or stolen, you must promptly notify us if your credit card, user name, or password is lost, stolen, or used without permission. In such an event, we will remove that credit card number, user name, or password from your account and update our records accordingly.<br>
            <br>
            The Site contains links to other websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites.
