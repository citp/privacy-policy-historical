**_  Privacy Policy_**  


Thermo Media, LLC (“Thermo Media”), a California Limited Liability Company, doing business as Affiliate Fuel (affliliatefuel.com).

Thermo Media is committed to protecting the privacy of all Internet users, Website publishers, and advertisers. This Privacy Policy statement explains how Thermo Media operates to protect your privacy.

Please note that Thermo Media may find it necessary, or be legally obligated, to modify this Privacy Policy from time to time. Except as otherwise required by law, modifications to this Privacy Policy will not affect the privacy of data collected prior to the effective date of the policy change. Thermo Media reserves the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time without notice by posting of such modification herein. Affiliates (as defined below) and visitors should review this Privacy Policy periodically to note any changes that may have occurred. An Affiliate (“Affiliate”) is a corporation, other legal entity, or adult person that has applied to Thermo Media, and has been accepted by Thermo Media into the Advertising Network (defined below) in accordance with the terms, conditions and procedures outlined in this Web site.

Thermo Media does not collect any personal information about visitors to, or users of, this Web site solely as a result of such visits or usage, other than persons or entities joining Thermo Media’s advertising network (“Advertising Network”) of Web sites as an Affiliate pursuant to either a written or online contract.

When an Internet user clicks on one of Thermo Media's served advertisements (running throughout the Advertising Network), Thermo Media does collect "ad delivery and reporting data" (type of browser, operating system, IP address, domain type, page(s) visited, date and time of when an Internet user has responded to an advertisement, etc.). None of the data can be linked to any individual Internet user, and therefore it cannot be used for personal identification or profiling. Thermo Media does not collect any personally identifiable information regarding the user that clicked on the ad (e.g. name, address, social security number, e-mail address, etc.).

Some information is collected through “Cookies” as described below. 

**“Cookies”**

An Internet user's browser normally places Cookies that contain small amounts of data on the Internet user's computer after a visit to any Web site. Cookies assist Thermo Media in tracking Internet users' activities beginning from an Affiliate’s Web site or e-mail. If the Internet user visits or revisits an advertiser’s site directly from such Affiliate, Thermo Media is able to continue to track the Internet user's activities on the advertiser's site and reward the Affiliate that referred the Internet user. The Cookies tell Thermo Media nothing about the Internet user personally.

Cookies are used (1) when an advertiser's banner image or other text is loaded on a Web page for viewing by an Internet user, and (2) when the banner or other text is clicked by an Internet user. The function of these Cookies is to provide Thermo Media with information solely for the purpose of paying an Affiliate’s commissions when an Internet user clicks on a link or makes a purchase on an advertiser's Web site.

**Affiliate–Identifiable Data**

Thermo Media collects certain personally identifiable information from Web sites and their owners wishing to join the Advertising Network. The collection of this information is a part of normal business practices. Persons and entities wishing to become Affiliates and join the Advertising Network are asked to provide personally identifiable data through the sign up and registration process. Examples of personally identifiable data that may be requested include name, address, phone number, e-mail address, tax ID number, VAT number, etc. All personally identifiable information that Thermo Media collects from potential and actual Affiliates is principally intended for internal administrative needs such as accounting and invoicing.

Periodically Thermo Media may desire to communicate with the Advertising Network of Affiliates via e-mail newsletters or other methods to offer marketing information or other communications to assist in business related activities. In such instances Thermo Media will access Affiliates' personally identifiable information. In the event that an Affiliate wishes not to have personally identifiable information used as described in this paragraph, such Affiliate may elect to opt-out by notifying Thermo Media in writing or electronically at any time.

All personally identifiable data provided by individual Affiliates will be kept in strict confidence by Thermo Media and will be treated with the same level of care that Thermo Media treats its other proprietary information and trade secrets; notwithstanding the foregoing, Thermo Media may in limited instances provide personally identifiable information to a third party to assist Thermo Media in normal and customary operational and statistical matters, or for efficiency purposes in providing administrative services such as billing, delivery and payouts. Any third-party receiving such information will be required to treat it in a confidential and safeguarded manner, in accordance with industry standards and in accordance with the policies stated herein. In the event that an Affiliate wishes not to have personally identifiable information used as described in this paragraph, such Affiliate may elect to opt-out by notifying Thermo Media in writing or electronically at any time.

**Security Precautions**

Thermo Media makes every effort to maintain the security of its Advertising Network, business operations and any and all data collected. Any data that is stored on Thermo Media's server is treated as proprietary and confidential and is not available to the public. Thermo Media has a strict internal security policy with respect to the confidentiality of customer and other data, limiting access only to those employees or third parties that have a need to know such information for the purpose of effectively delivering Thermo Media’s products and services; notwithstanding any other provision herein, information may be disclosed:

to government agencies or officials or other third parties if Thermo Media believes such disclosure to be required or compelled under applicable law or regulations or legal process;

to government agencies or officials upon their request, even if not compelled by a subpoena or other legal process, and without any duty on Thermo Media’s part to independently confirm that such agencies or officials are legally entitled to such disclosure;

to a buyer, subcontractor or agent, in the event that Thermo Media sells or transfers ownership, operation or control of any or all of its Advertising Networks or engages any subcontractor or agent to operate any Advertising Network or provide any service related to any Advertising Network.

**Access to Data**

Thermo Media allows Affiliates and potential Affiliates who have provided personally identifiable data, access to such data at any reasonable time, in order to ensure that such data is correct, and to make any changes.

**Privacy Policy Statements of Affiliates**

Thermo Media encourages all Web sites within the Advertising Network to create privacy policy statements and provide Internet users with prominently placed access to such statements. Additionally, Thermo Media requests that all Web site publishers doing business with Thermo Media disclose any and all information that is being collected from Internet users on their Web site, including data gathered from banners and other forms of advertising being served on their Web site.

**Spam and E-mail lists**

Thermo Media does not intentionally send unsolicited e-mail messages that could be construed as spam; Affiliates’ actions are carefully scrutinized and each Affiliate is expected to adhere to Thermo Media’s anti-spam policy.

**Miscellaneous**

Various state and federal regulations may apply to the online collection of personal information from children under the age of 13. Thermo Media is sensitive to the issue of children's privacy and makes every effort to protect the privacy of children using the Internet. Thermo Media's Web site, products, and services are neither developed for, nor directed at, children.
