Accordingly, We (along with Our staff, agents and suppliers) shall be able to use your Personal Information and disclose your Personal Information to third parties for the purposes of validating the information you provide to Us in the course of using the Affiliate Networks, including, where necessary, the transfer of information outside of your country. Security reviews may include but are not limited to ordering a credit report and/or otherwise verifying the information you provide against third-party databases. We may also receive Personal Information from customer lists lawfully acquired from third-party vendors.
