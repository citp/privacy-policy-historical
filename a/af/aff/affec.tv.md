### What We Do

At Affectv, we're dedicated to improving the relevancy of online ads for both consumers and advertisers so that your browsing experience on the internet is improved. To do this, we have built technology that analyses what users do and share across the internet including social media sites so we can tailor ads to users based on their interests. In doing so, we hope to make advertising more relevant for you. Besides the relevancy of the ads you see in this way, your online experience remains effective and inexpensive so that most content online remains free for you to view. By visiting our website, you are accepting the practices outlined in this privacy policy.

### Our Technology

Affectv provides technology services to clients that enable them to collect and use online interaction data to improve the relevance of advertising which appears on web pages. 'Interaction data' consists of anonymous information regarding the relationships between people, the website pages they visit and/or the actions they take on a website, such as sharing URLs or other content using different electronic devices such as laptops, tablets or mobile phones. For example, Affectv may collect interaction data when you visit one of our client's webpages or browse on the internet or when you interact with friends by sharing online content.

Our clients use the interaction data we capture to identify and categorise consumers who are likely to share similar interests or preferences based on observed online behavioural patterns. For example, if a person expresses an interest in comedy films, our technology would help our clients identify other people who are likely to enjoy comedy films based on similarities in interaction data between the different people. By using our technology, our clients categorize users with similar characteristics or interests, improving their ability to deliver more relevant advertising to you.

### Our Cookies

Affectv, like many other media and online advertising websites, uses cookies. Cookies are small text files that sit on your internet browser, and they are placed so websites know that you've been to their website before. Cookies contribute to a better online experience when you browse a website and allow for improvements of the website by enabling web statistics collection. For example, when you visit your most popular social network, they will log you in to your account automatically by using cookies.

Cookies are traditionally classified into two general categories; there are session cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies expire by the end of your browsing activity. These are mostly used to store shopping choices and enable the checkout process in online shopping. Persistent cookies are stored in a user's browser and remain there after a browsing session has ended for a longer period of time. These type of cookies are common in online and target advertising. Affectv uses persistent cookies to collect data over time and identify online behavioural patterns. You can identify our cookies in your browser as go.affec.tv. The persistent cookies we use to improve the relevancy of advertising are set to expire after 1 year. Devices on which we can place cookies include computers, laptops, mobile and tablet devices.

To find out more about cookies please visit [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/). 

Affectv adheres to the principles of the [EDAA OBA Framework](https://www.eprivacy.eu/en/privacy-seals/oba-certification/).

### Your Data

At Affectv, we don't use Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in order to know what ads a user may be interested in, such as your name or email address. We take consumer privacy very seriously. We use cookies to collect, aggregate and process mainly analytical and 'interactive' data in order to understand which computer browsers have viewed which content on a website; which websites are most visited from which geographical location and which other browsers and users you may have interacted with. For example, if you share a photo with another user and you subsequently click on an advert, based on the above interaction we capture, we may serve the same advert to the person you shared the photo with.

Affectv maintains anonymous analytical and interaction data for up to 12 months with the aim to use it to classify users with similar characteristics or interests into general categories. After 12 months, interaction data is no longer used for these purposes, but it is used for research and statistics reporting on an aggregated basis for as long as this data is relevant.

### Opt Out & Choices

If you would still not like to have ads tailored to your interests, please [click here](https://web.archive.org/opt-out) to opt out. This will stop you receiving ads by Affectv. If you would like to opt out of other targeted ads from other providers, please go here.

Alternatively, you can disable cookies in your internet browser (usually by selecting Tools-Options-Privacy).

But remember, cookies are used for a variety of reasons, not just online advertising, and so by deleting them you may affect your online browsing experience. Opting out of Affectv cookies does not mean you will no longer receive online advertising. It does mean that Affectv will no longer deliver ads tailored to your Web preferences and usage patterns. The Affectv Opt-out Tool is cookie-based. In order for the tool to work on your computer, your browser must be set to accept cookies. Be advised that if you change computers or upgrade or change browsers, clear or delete this opt out cookie either separately or by clearing all cookies of your browser or if you use multiple computers or browsers, you will need to repeat this opt-out process for each computer and each browser.

### Information Security

The security of your information is important to us. We have implemented reasonable security measures to protect the information in our care, both during transmission and once we receive it. This includes, but is not limited to, the use of firewalls and encryption. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, like most companies, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

### Disclosure of information to third parties

We may share Non-PII collected via our technology with affiliated third parties, including behavioural patterns, interaction data collected as above described and general statistics. For example, we may disclose that our online advertisements offering "sports car" test drives receive more clicks than those offering "Mini Van" test drives. This information is only used in an aggregated form and cannot be used to contact or identify any person individually. We encourage our media partners and our clients to comply fully with the EU regulations and recommendations on cookies use and online privacy issued by the relevant online advertisement organisations and institutions, but we do not undertake any responsibility with regards to their policies. We strongly recommend you to read the respective Privacy Policies of any website you visit.

If you have any questions or comments about our security policies, please send us an email at [privacy@affectv.com](mailto:privacy@affectv.com) or write to us at: Affectv, Black & White Building, 74 Rivington Street, London, EC2A 3AY

Regards,

The Affectv team.
