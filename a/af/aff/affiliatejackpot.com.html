                    and store information depends on the page you are visiting, 
                    the activities in which you elect to participate and the services 
                    provided. For example, you may be asked to provide information 
                    when you register for access to certain portions of our site 
                    or request certain features, such as newsletters or when you 
                    make a purchase. You may provide information when you participate 
                    in sweepstakes and contests, message boards and chat rooms, 
                    and other interactive areas of our site. Like most Web sites,

                    the use of electronic tools that may be transparent to our

                    Service Provider or use cookie technology to recognize you 
                    and hold information from your visit. Among other things, 
                    the cookie may store your user name and password, sparing 
                    you from having to re-enter that information each time you 
                    visit, or may control the number of times you encounter a 
                    particular advertisement while visiting our site. As we adopt 
                    additional technology, we may also gather information through 
                    other means. In certain cases, you can choose not to provide 
                    us with information, for example by setting your browser to 
                    refuse to accept cookies, but if you do you may be unable 
                    to access certain portions of the site or may be asked to
