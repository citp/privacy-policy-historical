Introduction  
We’re AffiliateTheme. We revolutionized the affiliate theme site building business with Word Press templates and user friendly software in 2009. Let us explain how we protect your privacy and give you our privacy policy.

Lots of Word Press affiliate marketing related websites seem like they’re just providing the information you want as a pretext to get your personal information for solicitation or marketing purposes. Our site is designed to be widely accessible without requiring you, our users, to provide your personal information. Still, some really useful features that we want to provide are naturally going to require some identifying or personal information to make them work well. But fear not, this policy is here to help you understand what we do with the information we collect on this site.
