                    AffiliateClassroom.com strives to offer its visitors the many 
                    advantages of Internet technology and to provide an 
                    interactive and personalized experience. We may use 
                    Personally Identifiable Information (your name, e-mail 
                    address, street address, telephone number) subject to the 
                    terms of this privacy policy. We will never sell, barter, or 
                    rent your email address to any unauthorized third party. 
                    Period.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>How we gather information from users:</b><br>
                    <br>
                    How we collect and store information depends on the page you 
                    are visiting, the activities in which you elect to 
                    participate and the services provided. For example, you may 
                    be asked to provide information when you register for access 
                    to certain portions of our site or request certain features, 
                    such as newsletters or when you make a purchase. You may 
                    provide information when you participate in sweepstakes and 
                    contests, message boards and chat rooms, and other 
                    interactive areas of our site. Like most Web sites, 
                    AffiliateClassroom.com also collects information automatically 
                    and through the use of electronic tools that may be 
                    transparent to our visitors. For example, we may log the 
                    name of your Internet Service Provider or use cookie 
                    technology to recognize you and hold information from your 
                    visit. Among other things, the cookie may store your user 
                    name and password, sparing you from having to re-enter that 
                    information each time you visit, or may control the number 
                    of times you encounter a particular advertisement while 
                    visiting our site. As we adopt additional technology, we may 
                    also gather information through other means. In certain 
                    cases, you can choose not to provide us with information, 
                    for example by setting your browser to refuse to accept 
                    cookies, but if you do you may be unable to access certain 
                    portions of the site or may be asked to re-enter your user 
                    name and password, and we may not be able to customize the 
                    site�s features according to your preferences.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>What we do with the information we collect:</b><br>
                    <br>
                    Like other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance 
                    your visit and deliver more individualized content and 
                    advertising. We respect your privacy and do not share your 
                    information with anyone.<br>
                    <br>
                    Aggregated Information (information that does not personally 
                    identify you) may be used in many ways. For example, we may 
                    combine information about your usage patterns with similar 
                    information obtained from other users to help enhance our 
                    site and services (e.g., to learn which pages are visited 
                    most or what features are most attractive). Aggregated 
                    Information may occasionally be shared with our advertisers 
                    and business partners. Again, this information does not 
                    include any Personally Identifiable Information about you or 
                    allow anyone to identify you individually.<br>
                    <br>
                    We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on 
                    AffiliateClassroom.com to communicate with you about your 
                    registration and customization preferences; our Terms of 
                    Service and privacy policy; services and products offered by 
                    AffiliateClassroom.com and other topics we think you might 
                    find of interest.<br>
                    <br>
                    Personally Identifiable Information collected by 
                    AffiliateClassroom.com may also be used for other purposes, 
                    including but not limited to site administration, 
                    troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce transactions, 
                    administration of sweepstakes and contests, and other 
                    communications with you. Certain third parties who provide 
                    technical support for the operation of our site (our Web 
                    hosting service for example) may access such information. We 
                    will use your information only as permitted by law. In 
                    addition, from time to time as we continue to develop our 
                    business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner with other 
                    companies or businesses. In such transactions, user 
                    information may be among the transferred assets. We may also 
                    disclose your information in response to a court order, at 
                    other times when we believe we are reasonably required to do 
                    so by law, in connection with the collection of amounts you 
                    may owe to us, and/or to law enforcement authorities 
                    whenever we deem it appropriate or necessary. Please note we 
                    may not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in such 
                    cases.<br>

                    <b>Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements:</b><br>
                    <br>
                    AffiliateClassroom.com expects its partners, advertisers and 
                    affiliates to respect the privacy of our users. Be aware, 
                    however, that third parties, including our partners, 
                    advertisers, affiliates and other content providers 
                    accessible through our site, may have their own privacy and 
                    data collection policies and practices. For example, during 
                    your visit to our site you may link to, or view as part of a 
                    frame on a AffiliateClassroom.com page, certain content that 
                    is actually created or hosted by a third party. Also, 
                    through AffiliateClassroom.com you may be introduced to, or be 
                    able to access, information, Web sites, features, contests 
                    or sweepstakes offered by other parties. 
                    AffiliateClassroom.com is not responsible for the actions or 
                    policies of such third parties. You should check the 
                    applicable privacy policies of those third parties when 
                    providing information on a feature or page operated by a 
                    third party.<br>
                    <br>
                    While on our site, our advertisers, promotional partners or 
                    other third parties may use cookies or other technology to 
                    attempt to identify some of your preferences or retrieve 
                    information about you. For example, some of our advertising 
                    is served by third parties and may include cookies that 
                    enable the advertiser to determine whether you have seen a 
                    particular advertisement before. Other features available on 
                    our site may offer services operated by third parties and 
                    may use cookies or other technology to gather information. 
                    AffiliateClassroom.com does not control the use of this 
                    technology by third parties or the resulting information,

                    third parties.<br>
                    <br>
                    You should also be aware that if you voluntarily disclose 
                    Personally Identifiable Information on message boards or in 
                    chat areas, that information can be viewed publicly and can 
                    be collected and used by third parties without our knowledge 
                    and may result in unsolicited messages from other

                    law. If a dispute arises under this Policy we agree to first

                    If it proves impossible to arrive at a mutually satisfactory
