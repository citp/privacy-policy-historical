# Privacy - Australian Federal Police

We are concerned about protecting your privacy. This statement describes how we handle personal information, including:

  * personal details
  * e-mail addresses
  * clickstream (site navigation) data, and 
  * cookies.



##  Personal details

Some forms on this site can be used to send us personal information necessary for the processing of certain applications, such as criminal history checks and should show a yellow lock towards the bottom of the page. When you submit such forms, the data is generally encrypted in a format which is virtually impossible for unauthorised parties to read. These secure forms will always have an address beginning **/,** and should show a yellow lock towards the bottom of the page.

We will keep information which you send in a secure environment and will use it only for the purpose for which it was submitted.

If you do not wish to use an online form, you may download a hard copy from the site and post it to us.

##  Email addresses

The Australian Federal Police will only record your email address if you send us a message. The address you supply will be used only for the purpose for which you have provided it, and will not be disclosed or added to a mailing list without your consent.

You are reminded that, with the exception of encrypted forms as described above, messages sent from this site over the Internet are not secure. For further information on the Internet and security, you should read the [Disclaimer](https://web.archive.org/Global/Disclaimer.aspx).

To help reduce spam, we do not publish our email addresses on this site. Email addresses which were published on earlier versions of the site are now inactive. Please use an online form if you wish to send us a message. 

##  Clickstream data

When you go to a page or document on one of our Web sites, the following information may be logged for statistical purposes:

  * the date and time at which you accessed each page or document; 
  * the Internet (IP) address of your computer; 
  * the pages you accessed, and documents downloaded; 
  * the type of browser and operating system used; 
  * the number of bytes transmitted and received for each request; 
  * the previous site or page visited; 
  * the name of any search engine and search terms used to get to the page or document; and 
  * anonymous cookie information.



No attempt will be made to identify users or their browsing activities except in the unlikely event of an investigation, where a law enforcement agency (or other government agency) may exercise a legal authority to inspect the service provider's logs.

The statistics and log files may be preserved indefinitely and used at any time and in any way necessary to prevent security breaches and to ensure the integrity of the information supplied by the AFP.

##  Cookies

We use anonymous "first party" cookies to better analyse user navigation trends and to provide additional information to our web analysis software.

Cookies may also be used in forms-based transactions to correlate the pages of a single transaction.

We do not use cookies to collect personal information, nor do we associate anonymous cookies with personal information.
