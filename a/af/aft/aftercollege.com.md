One of our top goals is to make sure that your personal information is kept confidential when you use AfterCollege. We will use our best efforts to ensure that the information you submit to us remains private, and that it's used specifically for purposes that are in line with AfterCollege's mission of helping you improve your career. 

## Visitor Information

## Individual Information

On occasions when you sign up to use a service, enter a giveaway, or purchase a product, we may request specific information from you, such as your name, email address, mailing address, telephone, billing information, etc. We may use your contact information to make you aware of additional services that may be of interest to you, or to contact you regarding changes to our service or new releases. We may also ask you for your feedback, opinions, and preferences in order to provide you with better services. 

## Disclosure of Information

We **do not** disclose your personal information to any vendors or outside parties without your consent. If you submit your information through certain co-branded sites that have agreements with AfterCollege, your information becomes property of both AfterCollege (AfterCollege, Inc.) and the owners and/or operators of the co-branded site. AfterCollege is not responsible for the way these sites use your information, but we will do our best to ensure the confidentiality of your information.

In almost all instances, as in our discussion forums, we give you the option of maintaining your name and email private.
