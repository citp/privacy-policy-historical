ironSource Ltd. and its affiliate (“ironSource", "Company" “we” or "us") respect the privacy of the users
(“User” or “you”) of its website at the address http://display.ironsrc.com/ (the "Site") including our
proprietary ad serving service (“Service”) and is committed to protect the personal information that its
Users share with it. We believe that you have a right to know our practices regarding the information we
may collect and use when you use our Site. It is hereby made clear that the term "Site" shall include the
"Service" provided therein.
1.       Your Consent (PLEASE READ CAREFULLY!)
BY ACCESSING THE SITE AND/OR USING THE SITE, YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS AND
CONDITIONS SET FORTH IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY (THE "PRIVACY POLICY"), INCLUDING
TO THE COLLECTION AND PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION (AS DEFINED
BELOW). IF YOU DISAGREE TO ANY TERM PROVIDED HEREIN, YOU MAY NOT USE THE
SITE.
2.       Which information we may collect on our Users?
We may collect two types of data and information from our Users:
The first type of information is non-identifiable and anonymous information (“Non-personal
Information”). We are not aware of the identity of the User from which we have collected the Non-
personal Information. Non-Personal Information is any unconcealed information which is available to us
while Users are using the Site. Non-personal Information which is being gathered consists of technical
information and behavioral information, and may contain, among other things, the activity of the User on
the Site, type of operation system, User's 'click-stream' on the Site, browser and keyboard language, device
manufacturer, device model etc.
The second type of information is individually identifiable information (“Personal Information”). This
information may identify an individual or may be of a private and/or sensitive nature.
             a. Users of the Site automatically provide their IP address and as applicable, GAID/IDFA.
             b. In addition, Personal Information which is being gathered consists of any personal details
                  provided consciously and voluntarily by the User. The Personal Information is collected
                  from the details the Users provide in the sign-up on on the Site which requires e-mail
                  address, name, password, publisher name, country and web site URL. The User can
                  optionally fill in his/her daily impressions, and top trafficked country.
For avoidance of doubt, any Non-Personal Information connected or linked to any Personal Information
shall be deemed as Personal Information as long as such connection or linkage exists.
We do not collect any Personal Information from you or related to you without your approval, which
is obtained, inter alia, through your acceptance to the this Privacy Policy.
3.       How Do We Collect Information on Our Users?
There are two main methods we use:

                  the Site we are aware of it and may gather, collect and record the information relating to
                  such usage, either independently or through the help of third-party services as detailed
                  below.
             b. We collect information which you provide us voluntarily. For example, we collect
                  Personal information which you voluntarily provide when you fill in the sign-up in order


                 to sign you up for the Services. We store the Personal Information either independently or
                 through the help of our authorized third-party service providers as detailed below.

           Use it for statistical and research purposes and for customization and improvement of our Site's
            interface.
    Personal Information is collected in order to:
           Be able to reply to the User's questions and concerns which were sent by the Users to
            ironSource's service center.
           Be able to contact Users for the purpose of providing them with technical assistance and
            support.
           sign you up for the Service

            as in order to safeguard our Site.

    including investigation of potential violations thereof; (c) to detect, prevent, or otherwise address
    fraud, security or technical issues; (d) to respond to User's support requests; (e) respond to claims that

    ironSource, its Users, or the general public; (h) when ironSource is undergoing any change in control,

    warning before a cookie is stored. In order to erase or disable the Local Storage option you may use the
    settings option of your device or according to the specific instructions provided by the third party
