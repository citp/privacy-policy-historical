<p><strong>PRIVACY POLICY AND YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</strong></p>
<p>This is the official privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) for LOGOonline.com 
  ("Site," "we," "us," or "our"), an Internet 
  website offered in cooperation with the LOGO television channel or programming 
  service (“LOGO Channel”). The LOGO Channel and the Site (together, 
  “LOGO”) are provided by MTV Networks ("MTVN"), a division 
  of Viacom International Inc. (collectively, the “Parent Companies”). 
  This Privacy Policy governs only the personally identifiable information ("Personal 
  Information") collected by the Site and does not cover any such information 
  collected in any other manner or for any other purpose, or for or by any other 
  MTVN programming channel, MTVN’s “Jobhunt” website, the Parent 
  Companies and any subsidiaries and affiliates of LOGO and the Parent Companies 
  (collectively, “Affiliates”), or any other company, unless specifically 
  stated.</p>
<p>Overview: This Privacy Policy is intended to explain our privacy practices 
  and inform you as to: <br>
  • The kinds of Personal Information we collect from users of the Site 
  and how that information is collected; <br>
  • How we use your Personal Information; <br>
  • The circumstances under which we disclose Personal Information to third 
  parties; <br>
  • How you can access, update or delete any Personal Information collected 
  about you by us; and<br>
  • The mechanisms we have implemented to protect your Personal Information. 
</p>
<p>This Site is offered and made available only to users 16 years of age or older 
  who reside in the United States of America, its territories and possessions 
  (“U.S.”). If you are not yet 16 years old, or do not reside in the 
  U.S., please discontinue using the Site immediately, or if, for any reason, 
  you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please do not participate in the 
  features, activities and services that require you to provide your Personal 
  Information. This Privacy Policy is a part of the terms and conditions which 
  are set forth in our <a href="/terms">Terms of Use Agreement</a>. Any terms that are 
  not defined in this Privacy Policy shall have the meaning given in the Terms 
  of Use Agreement. Both the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use Agreement are legally 
  binding on all users. </p>
<p>We reserve the right to revise this Privacy Policy at any time by updating 
  this posting without advance notice to you. Such revisions shall be effective 
  to you immediately upon posting. Notice of material changes to either document 
  will be posted on the Site’s homepage. However, we encourage you to check 
  this Privacy Policy and Terms of Use Agreement often for updates. We may also 
  e-mail you, at our discretion, about these changes.</p>
<p>We are committed to protecting users' privacy. Keeping the Personal Information 
  you share with us on the Site secure and ensuring your understanding of how 
  we collect, use, disclose and maintain your Personal Information is important 
  to us. We maintain reasonable physical, electronic and procedural safeguards 
  to protect your Personal Information and while no data transmission over the 
  Internet is 100% secure from intrusion, we have used and will continue to use 
  commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the protection of your Personal Information. 
</p>
<p>YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</p>
<p>If you are a resident of the State of California, under the California Civil 
  Code, you have the right to request from companies conducting business in California 
  a list of all third parties to which the company has disclosed Personal Information 
  during the preceding year for direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, the 
  law provides that if a company has a Privacy Policy that gives either an opt-out 
  (which we may sometimes refer to as “unsubscribe”) or opt-in choice 
  for use of your Personal Information by third parties (such as advertisers or 
  affiliated companies) for marketing purposes, the company may instead provide 
  you with information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options. </p>
<p>LOGO qualifies for the alternative option; it has a comprehensive Privacy Policy 
  and provides you with details on how you may either opt-out or opt-in to the 
  use of your Personal Information by third parties for direct marketing purposes. 
  Therefore, we are not required to maintain or disclose a list of the third parties 
  that received your Personal Information for marketing purposes during the preceding 
  year. </p>
<p>If you are a California resident and request information about how to exercise 
  your third party disclosure choices you must send a request to the following 
  address with a preference on how our response to your request should be sent 
  (email or postal mail). Send an email to the Privacy Administrator at privacy 
  -admin@afterellen.com, or you may contact us via regular mail at: </p>
<p>LOGOonline.com<br>
  1515 Broadway<br>
  New York, NY 10036<br>
  Attn: Your California Privacy Rights<br>
  c/o Privacy Administrator</p>
<p>All requests sent via regular mail must be labeled "Your California Privacy 
  Rights" on the envelope or post card and clearly stated on the actual request. 
  For all requests, please include your name, street address, city, state, and 
  zip code (your street address is optional if you wish to receive a response 
  to your request via email. Please include your zip code for our own recordkeeping). 
  We will not accept requests via the telephone or by facsimile. We are not responsible 
  for notices that are not labeled or sent properly, or do not have complete information. 
</p>
<p>To all other users of this Site, if you have other questions about this Privacy 
  Policy, please contact our Privacy Administrator at privacy-admin@afterellen.com 
  or: </p>

  c/o Privacy Administrator</p>
<p>GENERAL PRIVACY INFORMATION</p>
<p>The Site is designed and targeted to U.S. audiences and is governed by and 
  operated in accordance with the laws of the U.S. We make no representation that 
  this Site is operated in accordance with the laws or regulations of, or governed 
  by, other nations. By your participation in our Site activities, you certify 
  that you are at least 16 years of age and a resident of the U.S. If you are 
  located in the European Union or elsewhere outside of the U.S. and you participate 
  in activities on this Site contrary to our policy that only U.S. residents are 
  eligible for certain activities, you do so at your own risk and initiative, 
  and you, not us, are responsible for compliance with any applicable local and 
  national laws. Please be aware that any Personal Information you provide to 
  us or we obtain as a result of your use of this Site will be transferred to 
  the U.S. and subject to U.S. law. By using this Site, participating in any Site 
  activities, and/or providing us with your Personal Information, you consent 
  to this transfer and processing of Personal Information to and in the U.S., 
  and in other countries that may not have an equivalent level of protection or 
  a level of data protection considered adequate in the European Union or European 
  Economic Area. Consequently, you hereby waive any claims that may arise under 
  the laws and regulations that apply to you in or of any other country or jurisdiction. 
  All users of the Site are required to provide true, current, complete and accurate 
  Personal Information when prompted and we will reject and delete any entry that 
  we believe in good faith to be false, fraudulent, or inconsistent with this 
  Privacy Policy. <br>
  Your continued use of the Site indicates your acceptance of this Privacy Policy 
  and of the collection, use, disclosure, management and storage of your Personal 
  Information as described below. We may from time to time, transfer or merge 
  any Personal Information collected off-line to our online databases or store 
  off-line information in an electronic format. We may also combine Personal Information 
  we collect online with information available from other sources, including information 
  received from our Affiliates, marketing companies, or Advertisers (as defined 
  in the <a href="/terms">Terms of Use Agreement</a>). This Privacy Policy covers all 
  such Personal Information and will remain in full force and effect as long as 
  you are a user of the Site, even if your use of or participation in any particular 
  service, feature, function or promotional activity terminates, expires, ceases, 
  is suspended or deactivated for any reason. </p>
<p>1. Collection and Use of Personal Information: When we use the term "Personal 
  Information" we mean information such as your first/middle initial or name 
  and last name, street address, town or city, state, zip code, telephone number, 
  instant-messenger nickname, blog or other personal website URL, date of birth, 
  e-mail address and any other information that would allow someone to identify 
  you or contact you. Personal Information also includes information about your 
  personal preferences, survey responses and your transactions or relationship 
  with us, if you have been a user of the Site or you have provided this type 
  of information to any of the MTVN family of companies. For example, to the extent 
  we offer such services, if you order any of our various Products (as defined 
  in the <a href="/terms">Terms of Use Agreement</a>), in addition to your name and contact 
  information, we will also collect and maintain your billing address, shipping 
  address, Product selections, your credit card or other payment instrument information, 
  your order number, and information about your computer's internet address and 
  website which may have referred or directed you to the Site (e.g., the referring 
  URL). Your credit card or debit card number is classified as “Sensitive 
  Personal Information” and is collected via a secure transmission.</p>
<p>We collect Personal Information about you when you visit the Site and input 
  information, whether you are registering to use any services, features or functions 
  of the Site, participating in Promotions (as defined in the <a href="/terms">Terms of Use Agreement</a>), ordering or purchasing Products or in the course of any other 
  exchanges of information, transactions and activities. We may use the information 
  we obtain from you, including Personal Information, to tailor your experience 
  on the Site, to display content we think may be of interest to you, or to let 
  us customize what you see when you visit the Site according to your preferences.</p>
<p>a. Collection of Personal Information During Registration. To the extent we 
  offer user registration on the Site, to register as a member of the Site, you 
  are required to select a user name and password (together, your “User 
  ID”), and may be required to also provide other Personal Information, 
  such as your email address, first and last name, gender, date of birth, country 
  and zip code. Additional Personal Information may be requested during the registration 
  process (but not required), such as cable/satellite provider, ethnic information, 
  and annual income. We will allow you to change the password portion of your 
  User ID, as well as certain other Personal Information or Sensitive Personal 
  Information you have given us in order to keep your information current, but 
  once you select a user name you will not be able to change that user name provided 
  to us during registration and which is associated with your User ID. Among other 
  things, these kinds of information help us securely identify you as a registered 
  or permitted user of the Site and our features and functions. You will not be 
  able to change your date of birth without sufficient verification. </p>
<p>All member benefits are free. As a registered user of the Site, from time to 
  time, we may also provide you with certain options to subscribe to a selection 
  of free email newsletters and other periodic information. You may select such 
  options by opting-in at the time of registration or by responding to an offer 
  or invitation at a later date. You will also have the right to opt-out (unsubscribe) 
  or change your preferences at any time by logging in with your User ID and changing 
  the settings in your account. You may also opt-out to particular email communications 
  by responding to that email and using the “unsubscribe” or opt-out 
  procedure included in that communication. </p>
<p>If you are a registered user, you acknowledge, understand and hereby agree 
  that you are giving us your consent to track your activities and your use of 
  the Site in connection with your registration. You also agree to this Privacy 
  Policy and the Terms of Use Agreement.</p>
<p>b. Collection of Personal Information During Registration or In Connection 
  with Certain Features and Functions. During registration (and possibly at certain 
  other times to enable your use of other features or functions or for security 
  purposes), you will be required to provide us with certain information about 
  you in order for us to allow you to use the features and functions that we may 
  offer on the Site, such as chat rooms, message boards, electronic mail services, 
  messaging services, auctions, shopping, registration and member profile pages. 
  <br>
  <br>
  c . Collection of Personal Information in Connection with Promotions such as 
  Contests and Sweepstakes. To the extent we offer user registration on the Site, 
  registration as a member of the Site is not always required to enter Promotions 
  such as contests and sweepstakes. There may be a separate registration process 
  which will require the submission of your first and last name, street address, 
  city, state and zip code, email address, telephone number and date of birth. 
  Additional Personal Information may be requested depending on the specific Promotion, 
  but submission of such information may be optional. The Promotion’s entry 
  page and/or Rules will provide the specific requirements. You may also have 
  the opportunity to opt-in to special Promotions or offers from our Advertisers 
  in connection with many of these types of Promotions.</p>
<p>d. Use of Personal Information in Connection with Promotions and Offers; Opt-out 
  Procedures. We, or our Affiliates, may contact the Site’s registered users 
  or other users that have registered for or participated in various Site events, 
  Promotions, or transactions, or we may send offers for the purchase of goods 
  and/or services that may be of interest to users. </p>
<p>You may "opt out" of receiving marketing and promotional e-mails 
  or text messages from us at any time by going to the Site’s home page, 
  clicking the "Your Account" link, to (1) un-register your account, 
  or (2) change or edit your preferences. You may also use the opt-out mechanism 
  that is contained in an email or text message. However, we, or our Affiliates, 
  may continue to contact you via email for administrative or informational purposes, 
  including follow-up messages regarding the administration of your account, any 
  services, features or functions you have enrolled in or registered to use, any 
  Promotions you have participated in or have entered, goods and/or services or 
  Products you have ordered, or other transactions you have undertaken with the 
  Site. <br>
  In the event that we, or our Affiliates, unknowingly sends an email or text 
  message to a child (a person under the age of 16) who has registered with the 
  Site in violation of the Site’s <a href="/terms">Terms of Use Agreement</a>, 
  the child or the child’s parent or legal guardian always have the right 
  to unsubscribe (opt-out) from receiving future emails or text messages via the 
  unsubscribe mechanism contained in the email or message, or to request termination 
  of the child’s registration and status as a registered user with the Site. 
  The same unsubscribe process is available to a parent or legal guardian of a 
  minor (a person under the age of 16, or the age of majority in your state). 
  Please see the “Review, Update, or Delete Your Personal Information” 
  Section below for details.</p>
<p>e. Sharing of Aggregate Information with Third Parties. Some of the aggregate 
  user data we collect may be shared with Advertisers, our Affiliates, and other 
  business partners of the Site, its Parent Companies, and/or its Affiliates, 
  but we do not give any Personal Information to them as part of the relationship 
  except as described in this Privacy Policy. Use of their tracking technology 
  is subject to their own privacy policies.</p>
<p> f. Use of Communities. If you use any of the Communities features and functions 
  made available on or through the Site, please remember that any information 
  disclosed in these venues is automatically made public. You should exercise 
  caution when disclosing any Personal Information in the Communities, as you 
  do not know who will access and use your Personal Information or for what purposes. 
  LOGO is in no way responsible for the accuracy, use, or misuse of any information, 
  including Personal Information, that you disclose or receive through these venues 
  and you should assume that any disclosure you do make in these venues will be 
  available publicly, even without your knowledge or authorization.</p>
<p>2. Wireless Marketing Services and Promotional Opportunities: LOGO may provide 
  users and viewers with the opportunity to register for special Promotions, services, 
  news, programming and information delivered via text messaging and other wireless 
  devices such as mobile phones and, in the event we do so, users are required 
  to provide their consent to receive such information from LOGO, either by registering 
  on the Site or via their wireless device. Such services and promotional opportunities 
  are provided by Affiliates for LOGO. The Personal Information requested as part 
  of the online registration process may include a user’s telephone number 
  or a wireless email address, but only if specifically requested, and the carrier’s 
  name. Optional information may be requested for specific Promotions, such as 
  a user’s preferences regarding goods or services, choices of music or 
  artists, or other similar survey information. Depending on the Promotion, we 
  may also collect an Internet email address or other information and, depending 
  on the information collected, the user may also be required to confirm his or 
  her agreement to this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use Agreement. </p>
<p>We caution that most wireless transmissions are not secured and there is a 
  greater risk of an unknown third party’s interception of messages or a 
  user’s Personal Information when using a wireless communications device.</p>
<p>Users that register for LOGO’s wireless marketing services acknowledge, 
  understand and agree that they will be charged by the user’s wireless 
  carrier for all messages sent to the user from LOGO. Standard messaging rates 
  will apply, unless noted otherwise. Under no circumstances will the Site, LOGO, 
  its Parent Companies, or Affiliates be responsible for any wireless email or 
  text messaging charges incurred by a user or by a person that has access to 
  a user’s wireless device, telephone number, or email address. </p>
<p>a. Registration. To the extent we provide wireless marketing services, there 
  are two registration methods provided for LOGO’s wireless marketing services. 
  Standard rate Promotions will be subject to either the “single opt-in” 
  or the “double-opt-in” (Site/SMS) method, at the discretion of LOGO 
  depending on the type of Promotion. Premium rate services will require the “double 
  opt-in” (Site/SMS or SMS/SMS) method.</p>
<p>1) Single Opt-in Method: In response to print, radio, television, Internet, 
  or other promotional messages, users will be directed to send a specific word 
  or code via a text message to a designated telephone number to register for 
  the service promoted. The user’s voluntary submission of the designated 
  word or code to LOGO will mean that the user has freely and affirmatively granted 
  permission to LOGO to send text messages to him or her. LOGO will thank the 
  user for his or her registration by sending a “Thank you” message. 
  The user may terminate the service at any time by using the unsubscribe command 
  in any text message from LOGO or by sending a text message to LOGO that says 
  “STOP”, “END”, “CANCEL”, “REMOVE”, 
  “UNSUBSCRIBE” or “QUIT”. </p>
<p>2) Double Opt-in (Site/SMS) Method: In response to print, radio, television, 
  Internet, or other promotional messages, users will be directed to this Site 
  to start the registration process. The user must affirmatively consent to LOGO’s 
  sending of wireless messages to his or her designated wireless device by submitting 
  a telephone number (or wireless email address, only if requested by LOGO) and 
  by clicking the consent statement on the Site’s registration page. The 
  user must also agree to the Site’s Privacy Policy and Terms of Use Agreement 
  before the online registration process is completed. LOGO will then send a “Confirmation” 
  message to the user’s designated wireless device and will request that 
  the user confirm that he or she has agreed to receive messages from LOGO to 
  that particular telephone number (or wireless domain name when appropriate). 
  The user must respond to the “Confirmation” message with a text 
  message that states “YES” or “Y” that will indicate 
  the user’s acceptance of LOGO’s wireless marketing service. Until 
  the user responds to the “Confirmation” message, the user is not 
  registered for the specific wireless marketing service subject to the Promotion. 
  A user may respond to the “Confirmation” message at any time provided 
  that LOGO may choose to terminate offering wireless marketing service at any 
  time and the user’s response to the “Confirmation” is only 
  valid if the response is received while LOGO continues to offer the specific 
  wireless marketing service.</p>
<p>3) Double Opt-in (SMS/SMS) Method: In response to print, radio, television, 
  Internet, or other promotional messages, users will be directed to send a specific 
  word or code via a text message to a designated telephone number to register 
  for the service promoted. LOGO will then send a “Confirmation” message 
  to the user’s designated wireless device and will request that the user 
  confirm that he or she has agreed to receive messages from LOGO to that particular 
  telephone number (or wireless domain name when appropriate). The user must respond 
  to the “Confirmation” message with a text message that states “YES” 
  or “Y” that will indicate the user’s acceptance of LOGO’s 
  wireless marketing service. Until the user responds to the “Confirmation” 
  message, the user is not registered for the specific wireless marketing service 
  subject to the Promotion. A user may respond to the “Confirmation” 
  message at any time provided that LOGO may choose to terminate offering wireless 
  marketing service at any time and the user’s response to the “Confirmation” 
  is only valid if the response is received while LOGO continues to offer the 
  specific wireless marketing service. </p>
<p>b. Termination of Wireless Services by User. Regardless of which one of the 
  above opt-in methods was used to register, users may revoke their consent to 
  receive messages from LOGO by the following procedure: </p>
<p>A user may cancel one or more services via his or her wireless device at any 
  time by using the unsubscribe mechanism provided by LOGO at the time the message 
  is sent, or by sending a text message that says “STOP”, “END”, 
  “CANCEL”, “REMOVE”, “UNSUBSCRIBE” or “QUIT”. 
  LOGO will terminate the user’s registration for the most recent wireless 
  service sent to the user. Any of these words followed by the word “ALL” 
  in the user’s termination request will cancel all of the user’s 
  registered wireless services with LOGO. If the user unsubscribes from one or 
  all of LOGO service(s) via his or her wireless device, the service(s) will be 
  terminated immediately and will cancel the user’s previous opt-in.</p>
<p>c. Termination of Wireless Services by LOGO. A user understands, acknowledges 
  and agrees that LOGO may, in its sole discretion and without liability to any 
  user, terminate its offer of any specific wireless marketing service or all 
  wireless marketing services at any time without advance notice. LOGO may provide 
  notice of terminations or changes in services on this Site.</p>
<p>d. Use of Information. LOGO will not use a wireless telephone number, wireless 
  or conventional Internet email address, or other Personal Information submitted 
  for its wireless marketing services for any other purpose but to provide the 
  service requested, unless we provide advance notice of any other use. We will 
  not share such Personal Information with Advertisers or other third party marketers 
  unless you opt-in to such disclosure. We will share such Personal Information 
  with the operational service providers that assist us in delivering these wireless 
  services to you and with the Parent Companies and Affiliates. <br>
  <br>
  3. Accuracy and Confidentiality: It is your responsibility to give us current, 
  complete, truthful and accurate information, including Personal Information, 
  and to keep such information up to date. We cannot and will not be responsible 
  for any problems or liability that may arise if you do not give us accurate, 
  truthful or complete information or Personal Information or you fail to update 
  such information or Personal Information. </p>
<p>You are solely responsible for maintaining the strict confidentiality of your 
  User ID, if applicable, and for any charges, costs, expenses, damages, liabilities 
  and losses we incur or may suffer as a result of your failure to do so. You, 
  and not us, are solely responsible and liable for your activity, behavior, use 
  and conduct on the Site and for any use of the Site or any other activity or 
  conduct in connection with the Site, by any others who use your User ID, unless 
  and until you notify us that your User ID may have been compromised, misappropriated 
  or improperly taken or used by another party. </p>
<p>Bear in mind that when you submit information to us, it does not guarantee 
  that we will permit you to use any or all of the features or functions of the 
  Site.</p>
<p>4. Cookies and Other Aggregate Data: We use 'cookie' technology to collect 
  data regarding your visits to the Site. This data is stored in aggregate form 
  and is not used to identify any particular user or individual. We use cookies 
  and similar tracking technologies in a variety of ways, including: <br>
  • Keeping count of your return visits to the Site or our Parent Companies’, 
  Affiliates’, Advertisers' or partners' sites; <br>
  • Accumulating and reporting aggregate, statistical information in connection 
  with the Site; <br>
  • Determining which features users like best; and <br>
  • Saving your User ID or other information so you don't have to re-enter 
  it each time you visit the Site. </p>
<p>This Site may contain advertisements, references and links to other websites 
  and organizations. We may also use third parties to display or serve advertising 
  on the Site and our web-based newsletters or other communications which you 
  may choose to receive. Often these third party Advertisers employ cookie and 
  web bug technologies to measure advertising effectiveness. You should be aware 
  that different rules might apply to the collection, use or disclosure of your 
  Personal Information by third parties in connection with their advertisements, 
  promotions and other websites you encounter on the Internet. The use of such 
  technology by these third parties is within their control and not ours. Even 
  if we have a relationship with the third party, we do not control those sites 
  or their policies and practices regarding your Personal Information. This Privacy 
  Policy does not cover any use of Personal Information that a third party Advertiser 
  or ad server may collect from you. We encourage you to investigate and ask questions 
  directly of them in this regard. Use of Advertisers’ tracking technology 
  is subject to their own privacy policies. For more information about these third 
  party servers and how to "opt out" of the ad-serving cookie, please 
  click <a href="http://www.doubleclick.com/us/about_doubleclick/privacy/">here</a>. 
</p>
<p>Although we may track the numbers of users to inform us on how best to update 
  the Site and enhance the experience for all users, Personal Information is not 
  extracted in this process. We use tracking information on an aggregated basis 
  to help us operate the Site, enhance and improve our services, improve the look 
  of the Site and display advertising and marketing information. You can choose 
  to have your computer warn you each time a cookie or image tag is being sent, 
  or you can choose to turn off all such devices. This is done through your browser. 
  If you turn cookies off, you may not have access to many features of the Site 
  that make your Internet experience more efficient and enjoyable – like 
  the features mentioned above – and some of our other services will not 
  function properly.</p>
<p>5. Privacy of Your Postings: We respect the privacy of the contents of any 
  Personal Information related to or contained in a Posting, unless the information 
  is intended to be disclosed (such Personal Information, except as intended to 
  be disclosed, is called “Confidential Personal Information”). However, 
  we reserve the right to monitor, edit, and disclose your use of the Site or 
  Confidential Personal Information to a third party, if we believe such action 
  is required by law or is necessary to protect and defend our rights, to enforce 
  this Privacy Policy or the terms of the Terms of Use Agreement, or to protect 
  the interests of our users, Advertisers, Parent Companies, Affiliates, licensors, 
  suppliers, operational service providers, and others. Please see the <a href="/terms">Terms of Use Agreement</a> for details regarding Postings.</p>
<p>6. Disclosure to Third Parties: We do not sell, rent, lease or disclose your 
  Personal Information to unaffiliated entities or entities that are not our Advertisers, 
  except in the limited circumstances listed below. As stated above, we will disclose 
  Personal Information related to or contained in a Posting in connection with 
  the display of and other services relating to such Posting as such Personal 
  Information is intended to be disclosed. When we plan to disclose your Personal 
  Information to Advertisers, we ask for you to opt in to do so, in which case 
  their use of your information is subject to the Advertisers’ own privacy 
  policies. We may disclose Personal Information to Affiliates for marketing and/or 
  administrative purposes and you will have the right to opt-out of such disclosure 
  for marketing purpose. (For opt-out procedures, please see the section of this 
  Privacy Policy above entitled “Use of Personal Information in Connection 
  with Promotions and Offers; Opt-Out Procedures”). </p>
<p>a. Co-Branded Services and Features. The Site may also offer co-branded services 
  and features, such as events and Promotions that we put together with another 
  company or our Affiliates ("Co-Branded Partner"). Such services and 
  features may be hosted on the Site and/or our Co-Branded Partner’s website. 
  We may share your Personal Information with our Co-Branded Partner and your 
  voluntary use of or participation in a co-branded service or feature means that 
  you opt-in and give your affirmative consent to both the Site and our Co-Branded 
  Partner to collect and use your Personal Information provided during the registration 
  process and/or in connection with the specific co-branded feature or service 
  for the fulfillment of the feature or service and for marketing or administrative 
  purposes. If you wish to opt-out of a Co-Branded Partner's future use of your 
  Personal Information for marketing purposes, you will need to contact the Co-Branded 
  Partner directly. The Co-Branded Partner will be identified on the co-branded 
  feature or service. Registered or other users that participate in certain services 
  relating to Postings, such as user video uploads, agree to have certain Personal 
  Information posted on the Site or Platforms (as defined in the User Content 
  Submission Agreement that relates to user video uploads) or, if such feature 
  is offered in connection with a Co-Branded Partner, on our Co-Branded partner’s 
  website in connection with the display of the uploaded video and posted on any 
  platform that the uploaded video may be posted. Registered or other users that 
  upload videos may also be required to submit additional Personal Information.</p>
<p>b. Operational Service Providers. We also have the right to disclose your Personal 
  Information to third parties for the purpose of administering and maintaining 
  the Site’s services, features, functions and operations. We will refer 
  to these third parties as “operational service providers”. We use 
  operational service providers to efficiently provide the full range of content, 
  activities, services, features and functions we bring you and we request that 
  our operational service providers also protect your privacy and not disclose 
  your Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information to third party marketers 
  that are not associated with the Site or the LOGO Channel. Additionally, such 
  operational service providers are not permitted to use your Personal Information 
  or Sensitive Personal Information for their own marketing or promotional purposes.</p>
<p>c. Other Non-Affiliated Third Parties. We will make your Personal Information 
  and Sensitive Personal Information available to non-affiliated third parties 
  in the following limited circumstances:<br>
  • When we are compelled to do so by a governmental agency, court or other 
  entity (e.g., to respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal process); <br>
  • If we believe your actions violate any law, regulation, the <a href="/terms">Terms of Use Agreement</a>, including, without limitation, this Privacy Policy, 
  or any of our other terms and conditions, Rules, offerings or any other services, 
  features or functions of the Site, or if you threaten the rights, property or 
  safety of the Site, the LOGO Channel, the Parent Companies, the Affiliates, 
  or any of its or their operational service providers, licensors, suppliers, 
  Advertisers, customers, users, or any other party; <br>
  • If, in our sole discretion, we believe such disclosure to be necessary 
  or appropriate to investigate or resolve possible problems or inquiries, to 
  protect our business and assets, to defend our interests and/or to comply with 
  our legal and regulatory obligations; or <br>
  • In the event of a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, transfer of control, 
  joint venture or other business combination involving us, or our Parent Companies 
  or Affiliates. </p>
<p>7. Security &amp; Protection of Personal Information: We maintain reasonable 
  standards of security and confidentiality. However, for most Internet sites, 
  it is possible that third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions 
  or private communications over an unsecured transmission. We conduct financial 
  transactions via secured transmissions but may not always secure other parts 
  of the Site. We also limit access to the Site by our own employees to those 
  individuals who are authorized for the proper handling of such information and 
  any employee found violating our standards of security and confidentiality will 
  be subject to our disciplinary processes. We request that our operational service 
  providers follow the same policy. </p>
<p>8. Phishing: Phishing attacks attempt to steal consumers’ personal identity 
  data and financial account credentials. “Phishers” use ‘spoofed’ 
  e-mails to lead consumers to counterfeit websites designed to trick recipients 
  into divulging Personal Information such as credit card numbers, account usernames, 
  passwords, and social security numbers. WE DO NOT SEND EMAILS ASKING YOU TO 
  PROVIDE OR CONFIRM SENSITIVE PERSONAL INFORMATION OR YOUR USERNAME OR PASSWORD! 
  If you receive such email communication, please forward it immediately to the 
  Site’s Privacy Administrator at privacy-admin@afterellen.com, and then 
  immediately delete the fraudulent email from your computer.</p>
<p>9. Review, Update or Delete Your Personal Information: Generally, you may review, 
  update or delete your Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information 
  collected by the Site. You may also correct factual inaccuracies. However, Personal 
  Information that is necessary to check eligibility, such as date of birth or 
  age cannot be deleted, but may be modified with sufficient verification of the 
  correct information. Deletion or attempted deletion of certain Personal Information, 
  such as your user name, may not be permitted and/or may result in suspension 
  of your account or termination of any registration you may have made. To review, 
  update or delete your Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information 
  collected by the Site, [please click “MY ACCOUNT” on the homepage 
  to sign in to your Site account with your User ID. Then, click on "PERSONAL 
  INFO " to change, update, or delete your Personal Information.</p>
<p><br>
  If you wish to review Personal Information collected for Promotions such as 
  contests and sweepstakes, you will need to contact the Site’s Privacy 
  Administrator via email with a request at privacy-admin@afterellen.com and be 
  prepared to provide verification of your identity. Personal Information collected 
  for certain entries are subject to corporate and regulatory recordkeeping requirements 
  and will not be deleted upon the user’s request, unless the entrant is 
  a child under the age of 16 years old. </p>
<p>Children under the age of 16 that are unknowingly registered on the Site are 
  in violation of the <a href="/terms">Terms of Use Agreement</a>. Parents (including 
  legal guardians) of children that registered on the Site in violation of the 
  Terms of Use Agreement who wish to terminate their child’s membership 
  must use their child’s User ID to gain direct access to the account, and 
  select “EDIT ACCOUNT” or alternatively, you can send us an email 
  to the Site’s Privacy Administrator and provide us with your child’s 
  User ID and request to terminate your child’s account and registration. 
  We will not allow direct access to a user’s account and Personal Information 
  by any person without the user’s User ID (please see above for how to 
  change your preferences or the information associated with your account). If 
  a parent does not have his or her child’s User ID, the parent will be 
  required to send an email to the Privacy Administrator that includes the parent’s 
  name, address, telephone and email address, in addition to the child’s 
  name and email address as registered on the Site, plus the child’s date 
  of birth. The parent must also provide verifiable identification that they are 
  the parent of the ineligible child. LOGO will send a confirming email to the 
  parent via the email address provided to verify that the parent wishes to terminate 
  his or her child’s account and registration. The parent must then confirm 
  by sending a reply email to the designated return address. LOGO will then terminate 
  the child’s account but will notify the child of the termination request 
  via email and will identify the name, address and email address of the person 
  making the request. </p>
<p>We reserve the right to deny access, use and registration privileges to any 
  user, including without limitation, a registered user, of any services, features 
  or functions of the Site if we believe there is a question about the identity 
  of the person trying to access the user’s account or any services, features 
  or functions. And if the burden or expense of providing access to your Personal 
  Information is disproportionate to the risks to your privacy, or if the legitimate 
  rights of others would be violated, we may decide not to provide access to such 
  information. In such cases, we will provide to you an explanation of why access 
  cannot be provided and contact information for further inquiries. </p>
<p>10. Questions: If you have questions about this Privacy Policy or if you do 
  not understand any information about how we collect, maintain, use or share 
  your Personal Information, you may contact us directly by sending an email to 
  privacy-admin@afterellen.com. </p>
<p>11. Sole Statement: This document is the sole statement of the Site’s 
  Privacy Policy and no summary, restatement or other version thereof, or other 
  privacy statement or policy, in any form, including, without limitation, machine-generated, 
  is valid.</p>
