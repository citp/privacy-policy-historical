## What personal data we collect and why we collect it

##### Comments

When visitors leave comments on the site we collect the data shown in the comments form, and also the visitor’s IP address and browser user agent string to help spam detection. An anonymized string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the Gravatar service to see if you are using it so that an avatar can be displayed. The Gravatar service privacy policy is at [automattic.com/privacy](https://automattic.com/privacy/). After approval of your comment, your profile picture is visible to the public in the context of your comment. If you leave a comment on our site your name, email address, and website will be saved in cookies. These are for your convenience so that you do not have to fill in your details again when you leave another comment. These cookies will last for one year.

##### Embedded content from other websites

Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website. These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracking your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.

That data includes: Your IP address, The name of the page visited, The date and time of that visit, Your browser type and version, Your operating system, and A referring URL, if applicable (the page you’d previously visited).
