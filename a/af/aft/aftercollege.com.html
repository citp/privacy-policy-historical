            <br>
            <p>Your privacy is our top concern. We are committed to making sure that your personally identifiable information is kept confidential when you use AfterCollege and that your contact information will not be shared with another User without your consent. We will use our best efforts to ensure that the information you submit to us remains private, and that it is used specifically for purposes that are in-line with AfterCollege`s mission of helping you improve your career. However, despite our efforts to maintain the confidentiality and security of your account, no method of transmission over the Internet and no method of electronic storage is completely secure. Although, we make every effort to protect your personally identifiable information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
            <p><strong>Visitor Information</strong></p>
            <p>AfterCollege aggregates visitor data to analyze user patterns and generate site statistics. Your individual information is kept confidential and only used as part of anonymous aggregate data that helps us improve AfterCollege. We may also use your visitor information to provide you with an enhanced personalized surfing experience.</p>
            <p><strong>Individual Information</strong></p>
            <p>When you sign up as a User of AfterCollege, we may require specific information from you, such as your name, email address, mailing address, telephone, billing information, etc. If you have any hesitation about providing such information to us and/or having such information displayed on AfterCollege or otherwise used in any manner permitted in this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Service, you should not become a User. We may use your contact information to make you aware of additional services that may be of interest to you, or to contact you regarding changes to our service or new releases. We may also ask you for your feedback, opinions, and preferences in order to provide you with better services</p>
            <p>Alternately, you may sign up as a User of AfterCollege by creating your account using a third party social networking site, "SNS", (including, but not limited to, Facebook). If you decide to sign up, we will extract the publicly available personally identifiable information that you have provided to the SNS (such as your name, email address and other information you make publically available via the SNS) from the account you have with such SNS and use the information to create your account on AfterCollege. The specific information that we extract may depend on the privacy settings you have with the SNS. You hereby consent to our access to and collection of personally identifiable information about you via such SNS. </p>
            <p>Once you become a User, you may provide additional information in the Profile section describing your skills, professional experiences, and objectives.

            <p>Employers may use your personally identifiable information to contact you to learn more about your experience, skills, and interest.
