As described below, some of your personally identifiable information is disclosed to third parties and used by us and third parties.

This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to the terms of the [AFTERNIC.COM, Inc.

AFTERNIC.COM reserves the right to change its privacy policy from time to time. Before policy changes take effect, however we will post notices prominently.

 **1\. Information we collect**  
If you are merely visiting our site, we collect and store only the following information about you:

  * The IP address of the terminal from which you access the Internet 
  * The IP address of the website from which you linked directly to our site 
  * The date and time you access our site 
  * The browser you used to access the site 
  * The operating system you used to access the site 



We use this information to measure the number of visitors to the different sections of our site, and to help us make our site more useful to visitors.

We will not obtain any other personally identifying information about you when you visit our site, unless you choose to provide such information to us.

As a STANDARD MEMBER or EXCHANGE MEMBER, we collect and store additional information about you. To fully use our services, you will need to register using our online form. You will be required to provide us with your contact information and other personal information such as User ID, email address, and billing address. In addition, as an EXCHANGE MEMBER, you will be required to provide your credit card number and its expiration date. We use this credit card information to verify your name, address, and other personally identifying information as well as to process your transactions.

We automatically track certain information about you based upon your behavior on our site. We use this information to analyze user demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand your preferences and improve your AFTERNIC.COM experience.

Cookies are used on certain pages of our site. We offer certain features that are only available through the use of a cookie. Cookies are stored on your hard drive, not on our site. If your browser permits, you are always free to decline our cookies, but you may not be able to use certain site features and will have to enter your personally identifying information manually more often. If you choose to buy, bid, sell, or appraise on our site, we collect information about these behaviors. 

When you successfully buy or sell a domain name, we collect some additional information including name servers, administrative contacts, business identification, special registrar requirements, billing address, bank account number, and tracking information from checks and money orders. Bank account information is deleted when your transaction closes. 

**2\. How we use your information**  
We use the information we collect from you to transmit administrative notices, buy/sell information and support, billing information, to send you specific information that you have requested, to process your credit card purchases, and to complete the paperwork necessary to transfer a domain name registration. We may also use it to send you information that is targeted to your interests, such as upcoming auctions and promotions. By accepting the User Agreement, you expressly agree to receive this information. Additionally, on appropriate portions of the site, we may display or archive your user name and system- and user-generated feedback, including the comments you submit and that others submit about you.

If you send us personal correspondence, such as emails or letters, or if third parties such as other users send us correspondence about your activities or postings on the site, we may collect such information into a file with information specific to you. We use this information to support your customer inquiries, settle disputes, enforce our User Agreement, maintain our customer ranking system, troubleshoot problems, and to identify you as eligible for special user campaigns. On rare occasions, we may look across multiple users to identify problems, resolve disputes, and evaluate you for multiple user names.

As a general proposition, we do not sell or rent any personally identifiable information about you to any third party. If you choose to use the optional services available on the site, we will, by necessity, provide some of your personally identifiable information to these service providers. However, you can avoid these disclosures by choosing to not use these services. Because we do not control the privacy practices of these third parties, you should evaluate their practices before deciding to use their services.

Unfortunately, due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personally identifiable information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. As an example, without limiting the foregoing, AFTERNIC.COM will provide personal data records if required by the order of any court of competent jurisdiction. We may disclose any information about you to law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate, in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal and may expose us to legal liability. Therefore, although we use industry standard practices to protect your privacy, we cannot guarantee, and you should not expect, that your personally identifiable information or private communications will remain private.

**3\. Special note about children**  
Children are not eligible to use our services. We ask that minors do not submit any personal information to us. 

If you believe your child has errantly submitted personally identifying information on the site, please send us an email message with the name of your child, the email address which the child used to contact us, and the child’s postal address. We will notify you if we have any data matching these identifiers. If you can supply the additional information that we require to authenticate your relationship to the data subject, we will delete the data at your request.

**4\. Your use of other users’ information**  
In order to facilitate community, our service allows you to access other users’ personal information, such as (but not limited to) user name and listed auctions. Further, as a successful buyer or seller, you will be sent the other data subject’s name, address, email address, phone number, fax number, title, DNS information, and registrar identity information. 

By entering into our User Agreement, you agree that, with respect to other user’s personally identifiable information, you obtain through the Site or through an AFTERNIC.COM-related communication or AFTERNIC.COM-facilitated transaction, AFTERNIC.COM hereby grants you license to use such information only for:

  * AFTERNIC.COM -related communications that are not unsolicited commercial messages, and 
  

  * Any use that such user expressly opts into after adequate disclosure of the purpose(s).



Additionally, under no circumstances, except those defined in this section, can you disclose personally identifiable information about another user to any third party without our consent and the consent of such other user after adequate disclosure. Note that law enforcement personnel and other rights holders are given different information access rights.

AFTERNIC.COM and its users will not tolerate any spam. Without limiting the foregoing, you are not licensed to add any AFTERNIC.COM user, even one with whom you have transacted, to your mail (email or physical) or phone list without their express consent after adequate disclosure.

**7\. Reviewing and changing your information**  
Following registration, you can review the information you submitted via your personal MY AFTERNIC account, including your Username and encoded credit card information. 

Additionally, you can use your MY AFTERNIC account to review and modify other fields, including first and last name, address information, email address, and password. If you choose to change your email address, we will cross-match your new address in our database for relationship to any other data set. We will only allow unique email addresses to be used for registration.

At your discretion, you may review and change all fields in your personal domain name profile records at any time.
