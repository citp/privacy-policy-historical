			<h1>Afternic Privacy Policy</h1>
<div id="terms" class="left">
<p><strong>Updated May 20, 2003</strong></p>
<p>Your privacy is very important to Afternic. As part of the normal operation of our 
business services, we collect and, in some cases, disclose information about you. 
This Privacy Policy outlines the information that we collect about you and what 
may happen to that information. The privacy policies of this notice apply to
http://www.Afternic.com (hereafter, the Site).</p>

<p> As described below, some of your personally identifiable information is 
disclosed to third parties and used by us and third parties. By accepting the 
Membership Agreement, you expressly consent to our use and disclosure of your 
personally identifiable information. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into 
and subject to the terms of the <a href="agreement.php">AFTERNIC Membership Agreement</a>.</p>

<p>AFTERNIC reserves the right to change its privacy policy from time to time.</p>

<p><strong>1. Information we collect.</strong><br>
If you are merely visiting our site, we collect and store only the following information about you:
</p>
<ul style="margin-left:25px;">
	<li>The IP address of the terminal from which you access the Internet</li> 
	<li>The IP address of the website from which you linked directly to our site</li> 
	<li>The date and time you access our site</li> 
	<li>The browser you used to access the site</li> 
	<li>The operating system you used to access the site</li> 
</ul>
<p>We use this information to measure the number of visitors to the different 
sections of our site, and to help us make our site more useful to visitors.</p>

<p>We will not obtain any other personally identifying information about you 
when you visit our site, unless you choose to provide such information to us.</p>

<p>As a STANDARD MEMBER, BUYER MEMBER or AFTERNICDLS MEMBER, we collect and store 
additional information about you. To fully use our services, you will need to 
register using our online form. You will be required to provide us with your 
contact information and other personal information such as User ID, email address, 
and billing address. In addition, as a BUYER MEMBER or AFTERNICDLS MEMBER, you will 
be required to provide your credit card number and its expiration date. We use 
this credit card information to verify your name, address, and other personally 
identifying information as well as to process your transactions.</p>

<p>We automatically track certain information about you based upon your behavior 
on our site. We use this information to analyze user demographics, interests, and 
behavior to better understand your preferences and improve your AFTERNIC experience.</p>

<p>Cookies are used on certain pages of our site. We offer certain features that are 
only available through the use of a cookie. Cookies are stored on your hard drive, 
not on our site. If your browser permits, you are always free to decline our cookies, 
but you may not be able to use certain site features and will have to enter your 
personally identifying information manually more often. If you choose to buy, bid, 
sell, or appraise on our site, we collect information about these behaviors. </p>

<p>When you successfully buy or sell a domain name, we collect some additional 
information including name servers, administrative contacts, business identification, 
special registrar requirements, billing address, bank account number, and tracking 
information from checks and money orders. Bank account information is deleted when 
your transaction closes. </p>

<p><strong>2. How we use your information.</strong><br>
We use the information we collect from you to transmit administrative notices, 
buy/sell information and support, billing information, to send you specific 
information that you have requested, to process your credit card purchases, and to 
complete the paperwork necessary to transfer a domain name registration. We may 
also use it to send you information that is targeted to your interests, such as 
upcoming auctions and promotions. By accepting the Membership Agreement, you expressly a
gree to receive this information. Additionally, on appropriate portions of the site, 
we may display or archive your user name and system- and user-generated feedback, 
including the comments you submit and that others submit about you.</p>

<p>If you send us personal correspondence, such as emails or letters, or if third 
parties such as other users send us correspondence about your activities or postings 
on the site, we may collect such information into a file with information specific 
to you. We use this information to support your customer inquiries, settle disputes, 
enforce our Membership Agreement, maintain our customer ranking system, troubleshoot 
problems, and to identify you as eligible for special user campaigns. On rare 
occasions, we may look across multiple users to identify problems, resolve disputes, 
and evaluate you for multiple usernames.</p>

<p>In general, we do not sell or rent any personally identifiable 
information about you to any third party. If you choose to use the optional services 
available on the site, we will, by necessity, provide some of your personally 
identifiable information to these service providers. However, you can avoid these 
disclosures by choosing to not use these services. Because we do not control the 
privacy practices of these third parties, you should evaluate their practices before 
deciding to use their services.</p>

<p>
To enhance the effectiveness of our exchange, Afternic has formed strategic partnerships
with select organizations, mostly registrars. Upon request by such Partners, we disclose
some of your personally identifiable information to the Partners for the Partners' marketing
purposes. To each Partner we only disclose information for the members that were referred
to Afternic from the Partner's website. (Members can determine the Partner 
that referred them to Afternic by clicking "My Account" on our home page.)
All Partners have agreed to post a privacy agreement on their own websites and protect
your information accordingly.
</p>

<p>Unfortunately, due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that 
all of your private communications and other personally identifiable information 
will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. As 
an example, without limiting the foregoing, AFTERNIC will provide personal data 
records if required by the order of any court of competent jurisdiction. We may 
disclose any information about you to law enforcement or other government officials 
as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate, in connection with 
an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity 
that is illegal and may expose us to legal liability. Therefore, although we use 
industry standard practices to protect your privacy, we cannot guarantee, and you 
should not expect, that your personally identifiable information or private 
communications will remain private.</p>

<p><strong>3. Special note about children.</strong><br>
Children are not eligible to use our services. We ask that minors do not submit 
any personal information to us.</p>

<p>If you believe your child has errantly submitted personally identifying 
information on the site, please send us an email message with the name of your 
child, the email address which the child used to contact us, and the child's postal 
address. We will notify you if we have any data matching these identifiers. If you 
can supply the additional information that we require to authenticate your 
relationship to the data subject, we will delete the data at your request.</p>

<p><strong>4. Your use of other users' information.</strong><br>
In order to facilitate community, our service allows you to access other users' 
personal information, such as (but not limited to) user name and listed auctions. 
Further, as a successful buyer or seller, you will be sent the other data subject's 
name, address, email address, phone number, fax number, title, DNS information, and 
registrar identity information. </p>

<p>By entering into our User Agreement, you agree that, with respect to other user's 
personally identifiable information, you obtain through the Site or through an 
AFTERNIC -related communication or AFTERNIC -facilitated transaction, AFTERNIC 
hereby grants you license to use such information only for:</p>

<ul style="margin-left:25px;">
<li>AFTERNIC -related communications that are not unsolicited commercial messages, and</li> 
<li>Any use that such user expressly opts into after adequate disclosure of the purpose(s).</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, under no circumstances, except those defined in this section, can you 
disclose personally identifiable information about another user to any third party without 
our consent and the consent of such other user after adequate disclosure. Note that law 
enforcement personnel and other rights holders are given different information access 
rights.</p>

<p>AFTERNIC and its users will not tolerate any spam. Without limiting the foregoing, 
you are not licensed to add any AFTERNIC user, even one with whom you have transacted, 
to your mail (email or physical) or phone list without their express consent after 
adequate disclosure.</p>

<p><strong>5. Send this auction to a friend service.</strong><br>
The terms applicable to the Send this auction service apply to your use of that service. 
Without limiting the foregoing, you are not allowed to use this service to send spam. We 
do not use the email address you enter for any purpose other than to send your email. We 
do not rent or sell these email addresses. After we have generated your requested message, 
we generally discard the email addresses at some point.</p>

<p><strong>6. Control of your password.</strong><br>
Except as specifically permitted by this section, you may not disclose your AFTERNIC 
password to any third parties nor share it with any third parties. If you lose control of 
your password, you will lose substantial control over your personally identifiable 
information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, 
if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately change your 
password. </p>

<p>The AFTERNIC staff will never ask you for your password. If you receive a request from 
anyone claiming to represent us, do not reveal this information.
Instead, please <a href="https://www.afternic.com/msg2nbs.php" class="moreLink">contact Afternic</a>.
</p>

<p><strong>7. Reviewing and changing your information.</strong><br>
Following registration, you can review the information you submitted via your personal 
AFTERNIC account, including your Username and encoded credit card information. </p>

<p>Additionally, you can use your AFTERNIC account to review and modify other fields, 
including first and last name, address information, email address, and password. If you 
choose to change your email address, we will cross-match your new address in our 
database for relationship to any other data set. We will only allow unique email addresses 
to be used for registration.</p>

<p>At your discretion, you may review and change all fields in your personal domain name 
profile records at any time except username and legal name.</p>

<p><strong>8. Information security.</strong><br>
AFTERNIC uses industry standard efforts such as firewalls and SSL-encryption to safeguard 
the confidentiality of your personally identifiable information. However, 'perfect 
security' does not exist on the Internet.</p>

<p><strong>9. Privacy protection.</strong><br>
The data required by AFTERNIC to activate your membership is used solely for the account 
you maintain with us. All real data you provide to AFTERNIC is kept strictly confidential 
and will not be sold or released. Your Username on AFTERNIC can be any name of your own 
choosing, and identifies you as Standard Member or AFTERNICDLS Member. Prospective 
counterparties will be able to view your Member Profile, post comments about you, and 
view the auctions you are involved in, but in no way will have access to your true 
identity or your email address.
