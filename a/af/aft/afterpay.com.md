These linked sites are not under our control and we are not responsible for content on these sites, nor are these sites subject to this Privacy Policy. Before disclosing your personal information on any third party website we recommend that you examine the terms and conditions and privacy policy of that site.

This Privacy Policy applies when you sign up for, access, or use our services, features, technologies or functions offered on our Websites (collectively ‘Afterpay Services’) and in relation to Personal Information we may otherwise collect during the course of our business as set out in this Privacy Policy.

The revised version will be effective from the time we post it on the Websites. Afterpay may highlight any material changes to the Privacy Policy that may impact you by notifying you by email or otherwise.

In addition, you should note that retailers you buy goods or services from or contract with (even if such goods or services are purchased using Afterpay Services) have their own privacy policies, and Afterpay is not responsible for their actions, including their information protection practices.

We will only share your Personal Information with third parties as described in this Privacy Policy or as otherwise notified to you at the time of collection or with your consent.

If you open an Afterpay account directly on a third party website or via a third party application, any information that you enter on that website or application (and not directly on Afterpay’s Websites) will be shared with the owner of the third party website or application. These sites are governed by their own privacy policies and you are encouraged to review their privacy policies before providing them with Personal Information. Afterpay is not responsible for the content or information practices of such third parties.

**Consent**

We may require your consent to use and/or disclose your Personal Information if we need to use your information for a purpose that is not related to the purpose for which it was collected.

If you do not consent to Afterpay collecting, using and/or disclosing your Personal Information for such other purposes, this may affect Afterpay’s ability to deliver and improve our products and services, or to engage or do business with you.

When you provide us with your name, date of birth and residential address in establishing your profile with us, you consent to us disclosing that information to credit reporting bodies and requesting an assessment of whether it matches personal information held by the body to assist in verifying your identity under anti-money laundering laws. The body may provide us with that assessment and use your personal information, and the names, residential addresses and dates of birth of other individuals, to prepare that assessment.

If there is a failure to verify your identity in the way described above, we will notify you within the secure Afterpay service or otherwise. In Australia, we use Illion (www.illion.com.au) to provide us with the assessment to assist in verifying your identity.

If you do not want to proceed in this way to verify your identity, you should contact us, as provided below.

**Marketing and privacy**

Afterpay may send marketing materials from time to time to those who have provided Afterpay with Personal Information about products and services offered by Afterpay and our Partners.

If you signed up to receive newsletters or other marketing communications from us, you can opt-out any time by clicking the unsubscribe link at the bottom of the message.  You can also log-in to your account to opt-out and update your marketing preferences at any time.

**Controlling Our Tracking Tools  & Do-Not-Track Disclosures** 

Your browser may give you the ability to control cookies.  How you do so, however, depends on your browser and the type of cookie.  Certain browsers can be set to reject all browser cookies.  If you configure your computer to block all cookies, you may disrupt certain web page features, and limit the functionality we can provide when you visit or use our Websites.  If you block or delete cookies, not all of the tracking that we have described in this policy will stop.  If you continue without changing your settings, we will assume that you are happy to receive all cookies on this Site.  You can change your cookie settings at any time.  Some browsers have a “Do Not Track” feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked.  These browser features are still not uniform, so we are not currently set up to respond to those signals.

**Cookies and third party analytical services**

We use cookies and track IP addresses via our Websites so we can improve our services provided by our Websites and enhance your user experience.

When you access our Websites or use Afterpay Services, we (including our Partners and companies we work with) may place small data files on your computer or other device. These data files may be cookies, pixel tags, “Flash cookies,” or other local storage provided by your browser or associated applications (collectively ‘Cookies’). We use Cookies to ascertain which web pages are visited and how often, to make our Websites more user friendly, to give you a better experience when you return to a website and to target advertising to you that we think you may be interested in.

For example, Cookies allow us to save your password so you do not have to re-enter it every time you visit our site.

Most web browsers automatically accept Cookies. You can find information specific to your browser under the “help” menu. You are free to decline our Cookies if your browser or browser add-on permits, unless our Cookies are required to prevent fraud or ensure the security of websites we control. However, declining our Cookies may interfere with your use of our Websites and Afterpay Services.

**Controlling Online Interest-Based Ads   **

We sometimes work with online advertising vendors to provide you with relevant and useful ads.  This may include ads served on or through our Websites.  This may also include ads served on other companies’ websites.  These ads may be based on information collected by us or third parties.  For example, your postal code may be used to target an ad for people in your area.  These ads may also be based on your activities on our Websites or on third party websites.

Our Websites also use Google Analytics, a web analysis service of Google Inc. ('Google'). Google Analytics uses Cookies to monitor traffic to, and use of, the Websites. Information about the use of the Websites generated by these Cookies is generally transferred to a Google server in the USA and stored there. Google uses this information on our behalf to evaluate your Website usage, to compile reports on the Websites activities, and to provide additional services connected with the Websites. We will not identify you to Google, and will not merge personal and non-personal information collected through this service. You can prevent the use of Google Analytics Cookies by adjusting the settings on your browser software, however, you may not be able to fully use all of the functions of the Websites if you do so.

In addition to Google Analytics, we may also use other third-party analytics tools including but not limited to Amplitude (an analytics service provided by Amplitude Inc.) to monitor, analyse and collect information about your use of the Websites.

For more information about our ad service provider and its cookies, including information about how to opt out of these technologies, you may visit http://optout.aboutads.info  In addition, users may prevent Google’s collection of data generated by your use of the Websites (including your IP address) by downloading and installing a Browser Plugin available at https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en.

**Protecting Personal Information**

Afterpay will keep your Personal Information secure by taking reasonable steps to protect it from misuse, loss, and unauthorised access, use, modification, and disclosure.

We protect your information using physical, technical, and administrative security measures to reduce the risks of loss, misuse, unauthorised access, disclosure and alteration.    

We also review our security procedures periodically to consider appropriate new technology and updated methods.  Only properly authorised people who have a need to access Personal Information to perform their job will be able to see or use that information. Even so, despite our reasonable efforts, no security measure is ever perfect or impenetrable.

**Accessing and requesting correction of Personal Information**

We will strive to ensure that information about you is accurate when we collect or use it. Subject to some exceptions under privacy law, we will let you see the information we hold about you and correct it if it is inaccurate, incomplete or out-of-date. If we do not grant you access to your Personal Information or do not agree to correct your Personal Information we will tell you why.

If Afterpay does not agree to your request for correction, it will notify you of the reasons it does not agree and will note your request on the records it holds about you.
