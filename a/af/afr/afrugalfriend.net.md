# Disclosures

This blog, http://www.afrugalfriend.net, is a personal blog written by me.

This blog contains links to other websites. While I try to link only to sites that share a high standard of privacy, I am not responsible for the content, security, or privacy practices of other websites. All information that you submit on other websites is done so at your own risk. I do encourage you to read the privacy policy of each site that you provide personal information to.

This site links to various promotions (rebates, free samples, etc.) Please be aware that I do not personally guarantee the delivery/production of free samples or other deals promoted on this site. This site merely informs others about the free samples and links to various promotions. I do not provide the free samples or promotions.

This site is not intended for use by minors. This site does not knowingly solicit or market to minors.

I do not share, sell or lease any personal information that may be provided on this site.

This site may at times accept forms of cash advertising. This site may also accept various products, provided free of charge, to be looked at for possible review. Even though I may receive forms of compensation through review products, advertising and such, I always give my personal opinion about topics and/or products. While as of Jan 2010, this site has not written any “sponsored posts” for which we have been paid money, if this occurs in the future, that fact will be noted in the post itself.

I am an affiliate for various programs like commission junction and others. If sales occur (or leads or clicks as it may be), through a link from [http://www.afrugalfriend.net](http://www.afrugalfriend.net/), I may receive compensation. This may be in the form of a percentage commission or otherwise. Nonetheless, if I personally comment on any promotion, I will always state my personal and honest opinion.   Many of these promotions/deals would be discussed whether or not I received a form of compensation or not.
