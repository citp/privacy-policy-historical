<b><u>Effective From Jan 1, 2005</u>:</b> Afro Articles has created this statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for Afro Articles &amp; Affiliated websites.<br><br>

<span class="articletitle4">I. GENERAL</span><br><br>

<span class="articlebody">This Privacy Statement discloses the privacy practices for AfroArticles.com and any other sites on which a link to this Privacy Statement appears (collectively, the "Website"). Use of the Website is subject to this Privacy Statement and the Terms and Conditions in effect at the time of use. This Privacy Statement is incorporated by reference in the Terms and Conditions. As used herein, "we," "us" and "our" refers to AfroArticles.com.<br><br>

This Privacy Statement only applies to information collected on the Website.<br><br></span>

<span class="articletitle4">II. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</span><br><br>

<span class="articlebody"><b>A. Personally Identifying Information</b><br><br>

We do not automatically collect any personally identifying information from visitors to the Website. To take advantage of certain optional features or functions of the Website, you may be asked to voluntarily supply certain personally identifying information such as your name, address, email address and telephone number. For example, you may be asked to supply personally identifying information if you complete the optional registration process for the Website or if you participate in a sweepstakes or contest on the Website. If you do not want any of your personally identifying information collected, you can always decline to take advantage of these optional features and functions.<br><br>

<b>B. Tracking Information</b><br><br>

<b>1. Cookies:</b> Like many website operators, we use "cookies" to recognize your web browser. A "cookie" is a small piece of information that is stored in a designated file on your computer. Each cookie has a unique number with no meaning outside of the Website. Our cookies do not contain any personally identifying information about our visitors.<br><br>

We may use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. Session ID cookies terminate when you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be stored on a hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following directions found under "help" in your internet browser. You can configure your browser not to accept cookies however, if you do so, you may not be able to use certain optional features or functions of the Website. <br><br>

<b>2. Log Files:</b> Like many website operators, we use tracking programs that collect information about log files, including Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser types, internet service providers (ISPs), referring/exit pages, platform types, date/time stamps and number of clicks. The information that we collect regarding log files is not linked to personally identifying information.<br><br>

<b>3. Web Beacons/Web Bugs (Clear GIFs/ Single-Pixel GIFs):</b> Advertisements that appear on our website are sometimes delivered by third party advertisers. These third party advertisers may use web beacons or web bugs to recognize your computer each time they send you an advertisement in order to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. In this way, they may compile information about where individuals using your computer or browser saw their advertisements and determine which advertisements are clicked. No personally identifying information is gathered through web beacons or web bugs.<br><br>

<b>C. E-mail Addresses</b><br><br>

<b>1. When do we collect your email address?:</b> We do not automatically collect your email address. We obtain your email address only if you choose to provide it to us when you complete the optional registration process on our website, when you participate in one of our online offers or when you join our <a href="http://www.afroarticles.com/newsletter/">mailing/newsletter list</a>. This information will be used only for promotional mailings to the recipient. The information you provide in the directory, forums &amp; guestbook shall be used for administrative purposes only (See <a href="/portal/modules.php?name=Forums&amp;file=faq">Forum FAQ</a>).<br><br>

<b>2. How do we use your email address?:</b> If you choose to provide us with your email address, we may email you from time to time to call your attention to products and offers we believe might interest you.<br><br>

We will not give your e-mail address to other companies to market to you. In the event that you no longer want Afro Articles to store your information in our database, you are encouraged to notify us at this <a href="/article-dashboard/contacts.php">location</a> or follow the    instructions at the bottom any email that you receive from us. Additionally, we have sealed as best as we can any areas of the website through which search engine bots can retrieve any information about you. We make no guarantees as to what 'rogue bots' can retrieve, however we are constantly on the lookout for any malicious intrusions. <br><br>

<b>3. Can you opt out of receiving emails?:</b> If you prefer not to receive direct communications sent by us, our advertisers or other third parties, you will be given an opportunity to decline at the time you provide any information and/or in the email message you receive. If you decline at the time you provide us with information or choose to opt out later, you will not receive email or other communications sent directly by us or our advertisers utilizing information collected from our site. However, if you provide your personal information in order to enter one of our sweepstakes, contests or online offers, you may still receive information about the specific sweepstakes, contest or online offer you entered.<br><br>

<b>4. How to opt out of emails:</b> You can opt out of receiving emails at the time you provide your information and/or at any other time. When you submit personally identifying information, if the information might be used for emailing purposes, then you will be given the opportunity, at the time of submission, to decline to receive such communications.
