II. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?

We do not automatically collect any personally identifying information from visitors to the Website. To take advantage of certain optional features or functions of the Website, you may be asked to voluntarily supply certain personally identifying information such as your name, address, email address and telephone number. For example, you may be asked to supply personally identifying information if you complete the optional registration process for the Website or if you participate in a sweepstakes or contest on the Website. If you do not want any of your personally identifying information collected, you can always decline to take advantage of these optional features and functions.

**B. Tracking Information**

**1\. Cookies:** Like many website operators, we use "cookies" to recognize your web browser. A "cookie" is a small piece of information that is stored in a designated file on your computer. Each cookie has a unique number with no meaning outside of the Website. Our cookies do not contain any personally identifying information about our visitors.

We may use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. Session ID cookies terminate when you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be stored on a hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following directions found under "help" in your internet browser. You can configure your browser not to accept cookies however, if you do so, you may not be able to use certain optional features or functions of the Website.

Log Files:** Like many website operators, we use tracking programs that collect information about log files, including Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser types, internet service providers (ISPs), referring/exit pages, platform types, date/time stamps and number of clicks. The information that we collect regarding log files is not linked to personally identifying information.

**3\. Web Beacons/Web Bugs (Clear GIFs/ Single-Pixel GIFs):** Advertisements that appear on our website are sometimes delivered by third party advertisers. These third party advertisers may use web beacons or web bugs to recognize your computer each time they send you an advertisement in order to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. In this way, they may compile information about where individuals using your computer or browser saw their advertisements and determine which advertisements are clicked. No personally identifying information is gathered through web beacons or web bugs.

**C. E-mail Addresses**
