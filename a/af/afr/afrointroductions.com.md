  * We will not disseminate, sell, or trade your email address, location, or any personal information with any persons or companies. (Your email address is used solely by us to contact you when you have new messages or matches, to inform you of your account status, and to inform you of any enhancements in our service or of services of our associated businesses). 
  * Any information that is on your Profile (eg Height, Weight etc) will be available to other members to preview. Your email address and last name will never be available to other members, only the first name you created for your account. 
  * If you elect to add your phone number and/or address to your profile, then this information will be available to selected afrointroductions.com members.

  * When you communicate with others online, you should be aware that, when disclosing personal information such as your name, e-mail address, etc., on a web page, or in a chat room, that information may be collected and used by others to send a person unsolicited e-mail. Therefore, in order to protect the privacy of members we do not allow the posting of email addresses or other contact information on member profiles.
