<p>We are bound by the National Privacy Principles contained in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cwth) (subject to exemptions that apply to us under that Act).</p>
<p>We may, from time to time, review and update this policy, including to take account of new or amended laws, new technology and/or changes to our operations. All personal information held by us will be governed by the most recently updated policy.</p>
<p>This policy was last updated on 31 March 2009.</p>
<p></p><h2 id="U1028850807jFI">What information we collect</h2>
<p></p>
<p>In general, the personal information we collect about you includes (but is not limited to) your name, contact details (including phone numbers and addresses) and possibly financial information, including your credit card information.</p>
<p id="U1028850807A2B">We also collect information about you that is not personal information. For example, we may collect data relating to your activity on our websites (including IP addresses) via tracking technologies such as cookies, or we may collect information from you in response to a survey. We generally use this information to report statistics, analyse trends, administer our services, diagnose problems and target and improve the quality of our products and services. To the extent this information does not constitute personal information, the National Privacy Principles do not apply and we may use this information for any purpose and by any means whatsoever.</p>
<p>We generally advise that you do not publish or communicate personal information, or at least limit the personal information that you publish or communicate, to the public via our services, such as in our classifieds, forums or blogs <b>(Non-Confidential Information)</b>. You acknowledge that we cannot control any third party collection or use of your Non-Confidential Information. You agree that we may use and disclose Non-Confidential Information for any purpose and by any means whatsoever. </p>
<p></p><h2 id="U10288508077TG">How we collect it</h2>

<p>If, at any time, you provide personal or other information about someone other than yourself, you warrant that you have that person’s consent to provide such information for the purpose specified. </p>
<p></p><h2 id="U1028850807OND">Why we collect it</h2>
<p></p>
<p>The primary purpose for which we collect information about you is to provide you with products and services you have requested. We also collect information about you for the purposes outlined below.</p>
<p>We may state a more specific purpose at the point we collect your information.</p>
<p>If you do not provide us with the information that we request, we may not be able to provide you with our products or services. For example, if you do not register as a member of a website, you will not be able to access features or services that are reserved for members only. </p>
<p></p><h2 id="U1028850807ak">How we use it</h2>
<p></p>

<li>to verify your identity;</li>
<li>to investigate any complaints about or made by you, or if we have reason to suspect that you are in breach of any of our terms and conditions or that you are or have been otherwise engaged in any unlawful activity; and/or</li>
<li>as required or permitted by any law (including the Privacy Act).</li>
</ul>
<p></p><h2 id="U10288508075H">How we disclose it</h2>
<p></p>
<p>We may disclose personal information, and you consent to us disclosing your personal information, to other members of the Fairfax Group (in which case, your personal information will be collected, used, disclosed, managed and stored in accordance with this policy).</p>
<p>We may also disclose personal information, and you consent to us disclosing your personal information, to third parties: </p>

<li>that sponsor or promote any competition that we conduct or promote via our services;</li>
<li>authorised by you to receive information held by us;</li>
<li>as part of any investigation into you or your activity, for example, if we have reason to suspect that you have committed a breach of any of our terms and conditions, or have otherwise been engaged in any unlawful activity, and we reasonably believe that disclosure is necessary to the Police, any relevant authority or enforcement body, or your Internet Service Provider or network administrator;</li>
<li>as part of a sale (or proposed sale) of all or part of our business; and/or</li>
<li>as required or permitted by any law (including the Privacy Act).</li>
</ul>
<p></p><h2 id="U1028850807MZG">Opting in or out</h2>

<p>If you receive communications purporting to be connected with us or our services that you believe have been sent to you other than in accordance with this policy, or in breach of any law, please write to us at the address set out below.</p>
<p id="U1028850807uTE">Management and security </p>
<p>We have appointed a Privacy Officer to oversee the management of personal information in accordance with this policy and the Privacy Act.</p>
<p>Other than in relation to Non-Confidential Information, we will take all reasonable steps to protect the personal information that we hold from misuse, loss, or unauthorised access, including by means of firewalls, pass word access, secure servers and encryption of credit card transactions.</p>
<p>However, you acknowledge that the security of online transactions and the security of communications sent by electronic means or by post cannot be guaranteed. You provide information to us via the internet or by post at your own risk. We cannot accept responsibility for misuse or loss of, or unauthorised access to, your personal information where the security of information is not within our control.</p>
<p>You acknowledge that we are not responsible for the privacy or security practices of any third party (including third parties that we are permitted to disclose your personal information to in accordance with this policy or any applicable laws). The collection and use of your information by such third party/ies may be subject to separate privacy and security policies.</p>
<p>If you suspect any misuse or loss of, or unauthorised access to, your personal information, please let us know immediately. </p>
