Although Aflac does not collect Personal Information from you at the Web Sites unless you provide it voluntarily, we do collect Nonpersonal Information (information that is compiled in anonymous and aggregate form and is not used to locate, contact, or identify you specifically). Our servers have an activity logging feature, which automatically captures Nonpersonal Information regarding site usage, pages viewed, applications used, files downloaded, browser type, the user’s Internet service provider (ISP), and the user’s type of computer operating system. We use Nonpersonal Information only for the purpose of maintaining and improving the Web Sites. 

**2\. Cookies/Tracking Technologies and How the Web Sites Use Them**

(a) We do not use cookies to collect Personal Information.

  * We want you to know how we use tracking technologies (including **cookies** , **web beacons/GIFs, embedded scripts** as defined in Section 10 below) when you visit our Web Site or receive communications from us. We use tracking technologies/cookies to allow us to identify that the same party is moving within the Web Sites without having departed to another Web Site. Additionally, cookies/tracking technologies allow us to determine the Web Site, if any, which referred you to our Web Sites. The cookies/tracking technologies also allow us to enhance your activity and ascertain your site preferences on our Web Sites. Without cookies/tracking technologies, some multimedia images and graphics may not display properly, you may not be able to view customizable features like stock quotes, and/or you may have more difficulty navigating through the Web Sites.
  * We may use cookies/tracking technologies for a variety of purposes, including:

 **(1) Operationally-Necessary**. We may use cookies required for system administration, to prevent fraudulent activity or improve security. We are not required to obtain your consent to cookies that are operationally necessary. 

**(2) Performance-Related.** We may use cookies to assess the performance of the Web Sites, including as part of our analytic practices to improve the content offered through the Web Sites.

 **(3) Functionality-Related**. We may use cookies to tell us, for example, whether you have visited the Web Sites before or if you are a new visitor and to help us identify the features in which you may have the greatest interest.

 **(4) Re-targeting-Related**. Our Advertising, research and analytic partners may use cookies to learn more information about your interests based upon your interaction with our Web Sites and third-party sites. For further information on opt-out choices for some cookies that are available on our Web Sites, go to Section 2(b) of this Privacy Policy.



  * By themselves, cookies do not tell us your e-mail address or other personally identifiable information. Only you can provide that information on our Web Sites, if you choose to do so. We do not use cookies to collect, track, or store personally identifiable information. Our cookies will never be used to track your activity on any third-party Web Sites or to send spam.
  * You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is received. (Each browser is different, so check the Help menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences). If you reject all cookies, you may not be able to take full advantage of all offerings of the Web Sites.
  * You may encounter cookies from our third party service providers, that we have allowed on our site that assist us with various aspects of our Web Site operations and services, such as Google Analytics (as described in Section 11 below).



(b) Use of Cookies by Our Advertising Partners.

  * The advertising networks and / or content providers that deliver our ads to third-party Web Sites may use cookies or other tracking technologies to uniquely distinguish your web browser and keep track of information relating to serving ads on your web browser, such as the type of ads shown and the web pages on which the ads appeared on other third-party sites.
  * Some of these companies may combine information they collect from our Web Sites with other information they have independently collected relating to your web browser’s activities across their network of web sites. These companies collect and use this information under their own privacy policies.
  * Examples of these companies, their privacy policies, and the opt-outs they offer can be found in the table below: 
  * You may also opt-out of some of the additional third party advertising networks’ cookies that may be placed while you visit our Web Sites by going to the Network Advertising Initiative’s Website at <http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp> and the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) website at http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ and following the directions there. The effect of opting out of third party advertising networks is explained on each opt-out page. Note that for some sites, the effect of opting out of third party advertising means that customized advertising will not be delivered to you on third-party Web Sites. Information regarding your usage of Web Sites and other online services (e.g., mobile apps) may still be collected for research, analytics or internal operations purposes.
  * We are not responsible for the effectiveness of any such opt-out options.



(c) Notice to California Residents: How We Respond to Browser “Do Not Track” Signals. California Business & Professions Code Section 22575(b)(as amended effective January 1, 2014) provides that California residents are entitled to know how Aflac responds to “Do Not Track” signals. We do not use tracking technologies to track your online activities across third-party Web Sites or online services. Some web browsers incorporate a “Do Not Track” feature that signals to Web Sites that you visit that you do not want to have your online activity tracked. How browsers communicate the Do Not Track signal is not yet uniform so a standard technological response has not yet been developed by the policy and technological communities. For this reason, and because we do not track your online activities over time and across third-party Web Sites, we do not respond to Do Not Track signals currently and we await the result of work by the policy community and industry to determine when such a response is appropriate under our circumstances and what form it should take. If you wish not to be tracked by third parties while you are using our Web Sites, please follow the instructions provided in the opt-out section above in Section2(b) of this Privacy Policy.

**3\. Disclosure of your information**

Disclosure of Personal Information that we collect at the Web Sites is subject to our [privacy practices ](http://www.aflac.com/aboutaflac/privacypractices.aspx "Privacy Practices")and to this Privacy Notice. Accordingly, we will disclose Personal Information to employees, agents, or third parties only as described herein and: 

1\. To fulfill a transaction that you have requested on the Web Sites. 

2\. To service your policy. 

3\. To investigate or handle claims. 

4\. As permitted or required by law by regulatory and law enforcement authorities. 

5\. To enforce or apply our Terms and Conditions of Use and other agreements. 

6\. To protect the rights, property, or safety of Aflac, aflac.com, visitors to the Web Sites, or others. 

Aflac, like many businesses, sometimes hires other companies to perform certain business-related functions on our behalf, such as hosting specific portions of the Web Sites. We may provide your Personal Information to vendors, service providers, and other third parties who assist us in providing the Web Sites, as well as the services and activities provided through the Web Sites. We will only provide the specific and particular Personal Information that a third party needs to perform its function. We require these third parties not to further disclose your Personal Information to any other third party or use it for any other purpose. We may provide your Personal Information to our noninsurance subsidiary, Communicorp, Inc., for purposes of fulfilling orders of products (such as duck gear) that you have purchased through the Web Sites and for communicating with you regarding those orders. WE DO NOT SELL YOUR PERSONAL IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION OR MEDICAL INFORMATION TO ANYONE. 

If you are a policyholder of Aflac, Personal Information that you provide at the Web Sites may be combined with certain other information we have collected about you through our policy application/administration procedures. In addition, you will have received a Privacy Notice from us explaining how we protect the privacy and security of information you provide (please see HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices below). In addition, you can view a copy of Aflac’s Privacy Practices as they govern information obtained outside the Web Sites here. 

If we sell or transfer certain assets or if Aflac or substantially all of its assets are acquired, Personal Information and Nonpersonal Information gathered at these Web Sites may be one of the transferred assets.
