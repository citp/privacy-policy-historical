## AL-FUTTAIM

In order to provide multiple access points to the services and products we offer, Al-Futtaim operates directly, or through its affiliates or service providers, many websites, including www.futtaim.com, www.futtaim.ae, www.al-futtaim.com and www.al-futtaim.ae. Any of these websites may ask for and collect personally identifiable information in order to enhance your experience and provide you with relevant information.

## TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT

Al-Futtaim collects information about visitors to our websites so that we can provide an experience that is responsive to our customers needs. Information may be collected as part of: (i) fulfilling information requests, (ii) registering for newsletter or programme membership, (iii) submitting a job application, or (iv) responding to communications from us (e.g., surveys or promotional offers or correspondence). We endeavour to collect information only with your knowledge and with your permission if necessary. The types of personally identifiable information that we collect may include your name, home, work and email addresses, telephone and fax numbers, and other information necessary to fulfill special requests.

Al-Futtaim may also collect non-personally identifiable information about you, such as your use of our websites, communication preferences and responses to promotional offers and surveys.

## PURPOSE FOR COLLECTION, PROCESSING, AND DISCLOSURE

**Collection & Use**

Al-Futtaim is fully committed to providing you with information about the collection and use of personally identifiable information (PII) furnished by, or collected from, visitors while using our websites, products and services. It is our practice not to ask you for information unless we need it or intend to use it. Some of the primary purposes for collecting your PII are as follows:

  1. Providing services such as processing a transaction (e.g. fulfilling a request for information)
  2. Marketing and communicating with you in relation to the products and services offered by Al-Futtaim, our strategic marketing partners, and other trusted third parties
  3. Performing market research via surveys to better serve your needs, improve the effectiveness of our websites, your experience with Al-Futtaim, our various types of communications, advertising campaigns, and / or promotional activities



You will always be offered the choice not to submit your PII or to decide what communications you would like to receive from us. However, doing so may cause certain transactions to be affected.

## Processing and Disclosure

In most cases, the information you provide is added to a local or global database. In the course of processing your information, it may be necessary to transfer your PII to Al-Futtaimâ€™s affiliates and / or third party service providers located in the United Kingdom and throughout the world for the purposes outlined within this Privacy Statement. As a general practice, Al-Futtaim does not sell, rent or give physical possession of your PII to unaffiliated third parties outside the Al-Futtaim system. Situations in which Al-Futtaim may disclose your information to others include:

  1. When we have received your consent to do so 
  2. In situations where sharing or disclosing your information is required in order to offer you products or services you desire (e.g., a job application) 
  3. When companies or services providers that perform business activities on behalf of Al-Futtaim require such information (e.g. customer support services, market research administration or database management services) 
  4. When access to your PII is necessary to facilitate business operations or meet contractual obligations 
  5. To comply with legal or regulatory requirements or obligations in accordance with applicable law or court order 
  6. In case of emergency such as to safeguard the life, health, or property of an individual



If information is shared as mentioned above, we seek to limit the scope of information that is furnished to the amount necessary for the performance of the specific function. Unless otherwise precluded by legal process, we require third parties to protect your PII and abide by applicable privacy laws and regulations.

## CONSENT

As part of our commitment to keep you informed, we may mail, email, telephone or contact you by other means to notify you of new Al-Futtaim products and services or upcoming Al-Futtaim special offers, events, enhancements or other relevant information that may be of interest to you. You may also receive mailings or other communications from carefully selected third parties. We always offer you the option to decline any or all of these communications by following the directions included in our emails or other communications or by contacting Al-Futtaim directly.

We would like to keep all customers informed and equally able to take advantage of the benefits offered by Al-Futtaim and its strategic marketing partners. However, if you reside outside of the United Arab Emirates, certain data privacy regulations may require us to obtain your permission before we send you information that you have not requested from us.

In some cases your permission will be implied from the nature of the service requested or transaction undertaken. For example, Al-Futtaim may collect and use personally identifiable information that you volunteer or behavioural data or information collected in the aggregate. In addition, your permission will be deemed given for communications from us that are necessary to fulfill transactions and services that you request.

In certain circumstances, we will seek your express permission when we collect information that is regarded under certain data privacy regulations to be sensitive in nature (e.g., information revealing racial or ethnic origin or health conditions).

## DATA TRANSFERS ACROSS INTERNATIONAL BORDERS

Al-Futtaim endeavours to provide you a consistent level of customer service. To achieve this goal, we have established a global network comprised of properties, offices, data centres, trusted marketing partners, service providers, customer contact centres and trained colleagues around the world. 

The nature of our business and operations may require us to transfer your information, including personally identifiable information (PII), to other group companies, properties, centres of operations, data centres, or service providers that may be located in countries outside of your own. Although the data protection and other laws of these various countries may not be as comprehensive as those in your own country, Al-Futtaim will take appropriate steps to ensure that your PII is protected and handled as described in this Privacy Statement. 

## ACCESS TO PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION

To ensure that your personally identifiable information (PII) is accurate and up to date, we encourage you to regularly review and update your information as appropriate (e.g. in the event your home or email address changes or you wish to add an additional method for us to communicate with you). If you are registered under our recruitment portal, you can review and update your individual profile online. Please note that in an effort to prevent the unauthorised disclosure of your PII, you may be asked to provide proof of identity (or other authentication materials) together with the completed access request form. Access to PII cannot be provided by telephone.

Occasionally, information that you request to be removed will be retained in certain files for a period of time in order to properly resolve disputes or to troubleshoot problems. In addition, some types of information may be stored indefinitely on "back up" systems or within log files due to technical constraints or financial or legal requirements. Therefore, you should not always expect that all of your PII will be completely removed from our databases in response to your request.
