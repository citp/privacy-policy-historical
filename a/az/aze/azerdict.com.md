**Website Visitors**

Like most websites, AzerDict collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, including: (a) your Internet Protocol (IP) address; (b) the address of the last URL you visited prior to clicking through to the Site; (c) your browser and platform type (e.g., a Netscape browser on a Macintosh platform); and (d) the data in any undeleted cookies that your browser previously accepted from us, which may include the word look-ups you previously submitted. AzerDict's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how AzerDict's visitors use its website. From time to time, AzerDict may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website. AzerDict does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below. 

**Data Collection and Protection**

AzerDict collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with AzerDict.

And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities. 

AzerDict discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on AzerDict's behalf or to provide services and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. AzerDict will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, AzerDict discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when AzerDict believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of AzerDict, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an AzerDict website and have supplied your email address, AzerDict may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with AzerDict and our products. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.
