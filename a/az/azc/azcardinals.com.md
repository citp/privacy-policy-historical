 **2\. HOW INFORMATION MAY BE COLLECTED**

We may collect information from you in several different areas on the Website, including but not limited to those described below:

Registration: You may be asked to complete a registration form and provide personal information; you may also be asked to choose a user ID and password in order to take advantage of certain features the Website may choose to offer, such as newsletters or contests. Participation in registration is voluntary and you will have the opportunity to decide whether or not to disclose information to the Website.

Newsletters and Website Emails: We offer free newsletters to share information with you about the Website, about us and our affiliates and subsidiaries, or about our marketing partners and advertisers and sponsors. You may receive a newsletter either by registering for a particular newsletter or in conjunction with a special feature or membership for which you have registered on the Website.

For example, our third-party service providers may use these technologies to collect information that helps us with traffic measurement, research, and analytics.

 **5\. Social Networking Services**

We have worked with certain third-party social media providers to offer you their social networking services through our Services. For example, you can use third-party social networking services, including but not limited to Facebook, Twitter, and others to share information about your experience on our Services with your friends and followers on those social networking services. These social networking services may be able to collect information about you, including your activity on our Services. These third-party social networking services also may notify your friends, both on our Services and on the social networking services themselves, that you are a user of our Services or about your use of our Services, in accordance with applicable law and their own privacy policies. If you choose to access or make use of third-party social networking services, we may receive information about you that you have made available to those social networking services, including information about your contacts on those social networking services.

You also may be able to link an account from a social networking service (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Instagram) to an account through our Services. This may allow you to use your credentials from the other site or service to sign in to certain features on our Services. If you link your account from a third-party site or service, we may collect information from those third-party accounts, and any information that we collect will be governed by this Privacy Policy.

Our Web site includes Social Media Features, such as the Facebook Like button and Widgets, such as the Share button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site.

Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.

 **6\. Links to Other Web Sites**

The Services may contain links to other websites or online services that are operated and maintained by third parties and that are not under the control of or maintained by us. For example, if you "click" on a banner advertisement, the "click" may take you off the Website onto a different website. These other websites may send their own cookies to you, independently collect data or solicit personal information, and may or may not have their own published privacy policies. Such links do not constitute an endorsement by us of those other websites, the content displayed therein, or the persons or entities associated therewith. This Privacy Policy does not apply to such third-party content. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third-party websites or services.

We have adopted security procedures and reasonable safeguards to help protect against loss, misuse, and unauthorized access to the information you provide to us. For example, if we collect financial information, we will use encryption software to help protect this information when it is in transit. Please note, however, that no data transmission or storage can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your information and privacy, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you disclose or transmit to the Services and cannot be responsible for the theft, destruction, or inadvertent disclosure of your information.

 **8\. Children's Privacy**

 **8A. Scope.**

We may collect personal information from users who are under the age of thirteen (13) through their use of the Services. To the extent that this type of personal information is collected, we do so in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (15 U.S.C. 6501 et seq.).

COPPA requires us to inform parents and legal guardians about how we collect, use, and disclose personal information from Website users under the age of 13. By using the Services, you agree to the terms of this section of our Privacy Policy (individually, the “Children’s Privacy Policy”).

This Children’s Privacy Policy incorporates by reference our Terms and Conditions, which can be viewed by using the following link: [<https://www.azcardinals.com/about-us/terms-conditions>].

As used in this Children’s Privacy Policy, the following terms have the following meanings:

“Parent” includes legal guardians.

“Child” or “Children” means a user or users that are under the age of 13.

“Personal Information” or “Profile Information” means individually identifiable information including personal information such as first and last name, birthdate, phone number, physical address, email address, shirt size, and other contact information collected through the Services or when a parent registers a Child for an account.

For more information about COPPA, use the following link:

 **8B. Parental Consent.**

We are required by COPPA to use reasonable efforts to ensure that, before we collect any Personal Information from a Child, the Child user’s parent receives notice of and consents to our information collection and disclosure practices. If a user is under age 13, we must have “verifiable parental consent” before we collect and use the Child user’s personal information. We accomplish this by requiring Parents to use a credit card when providing their Child’s Personal Information. Furthermore, Parents must acknowledge that they have read, understand, and agree to this Privacy Policy before we can collect their Child’s information.

 **8C. Information We Collect, How We Collect It, and Use of That Information**

Our Terms and Conditions and this Privacy Policy set forth the information that we collect from both Children and users who are over the age of 13. This information is collected in the same manner regardless of a user’s age.

Any information collected as part of the Arizona Cardinals Kids Club is only used for the purposes of delivering membership packages to the registered Child. This information is only collected with parental consent.

 **8D. How to Review, Delete, or Alter the Information Collected from Child Users.**

Parents can review their Child’s personal information at any time by contacting the Arizona Cardinals Box Office and requesting access to that information. Parents can also have their Child’s personal information deleted and refuse to permit further collection of such information by us.

If Parents wish to view, delete, or modify the information that we have collected about their Child, or if Parents want to delete their Child’s account or profile, Parents may do so by contacting the Arizona Cardinals Box Office directly, or by e-mailing to [Privacy@cardinals.nfl.net](mailto:Privacy@cardinals.nfl.net).

 **9\. Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may amend this Privacy Policy at any time. Your continued use of the Services after any modification to the Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of the new terms. If we make any material changes we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) or by means of a notice on the Services prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.

 **10\. Access/Choice/Retention**

You may choose to receive promotional emails, newsletters, and similar communications from us. You may opt out of receiving commercial emails from us by clicking on the opt-out or "unsubscribe" link included in the commercial e-mails you receive. Please note that opt-out requests may take some time to be effective. Your opt-out request will not apply to messages that you request or that are not commercial in nature. For example, we may contact you concerning any purchases you have made with us, even if you opt out of receiving unsolicited commercial email messages.

If your information changes, or if you no longer desire to use the Services, you may request that we update or remove certain information by signing into your account and making the required changes, by emailing our Customer Support at [Privacy@cardinals.nfl.net](mailto:Privacy@cardinals.nfl.net), or by contacting us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed below. We will try to respond to your request within 30 days.

If you no longer wish to allow us to track your geolocation information or further receive push notifications in the Mobile App, you may turn these off at the device level or email us at [Privacy@cardinals.nfl.net](mailto:Privacy@cardinals.nfl.net).

We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

 **11\. Your California Privacy Rights**

California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please send an email to [Privacy@cardinals.nfl.net](mailto:Privacy@cardinals.nfl.net) or write us at:

Arizona Cardinals Football Club  
PO Box 888  
Phoenix, AZ 85001

In some cases, third parties may be able to collect information about a user's online activities over time and across different websites when he or she uses our Services.

Some web browsers may transmit "do-not-track" signals to the websites with which the user communicates. Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them. Because there currently is no industry standard concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals, we currently do not take action in response to these signals. If and when a final standard is established and accepted, we will reassess how to respond to these signals.

 **12\. International Users**

Please note that the Services are directed towards users who reside in the United States. By using the Services, you consent to the collection, storage, processing, and transfer of your information in and to the United States, or other countries and territories, pursuant to the laws of the United States. While some of these countries may not offer the same level of privacy protection as your own, we commit to uphold the privacy protections as explained in this Policy.

 **13\. Contact Us**
