# Privacy Policy - Azalead

## I. How Azalead Collects Your Information on the Azalead Websites

### Collection of Information

When you visit our Sites, we gather non-personally identifiable information such as your browser version, your operating system version, your IP address, cookie information, time stamps (time the page was accessed as well as time spent per page), and clickstream information (for example, which pages you viewed and for how long). Azalead automatically receives and records such information on our server logs from your browser.

In certain sections of our Sites, Azalead may invite you to contact us to pose questions, request information, or complete a registration form. We may ask you to supply Personally Identifiable Information in order to register before allowing you to access certain parts of our Sites. We may also collect Personally Identifiable Information when you use certain Azalead services, through the use of our Sites, or when you enter promotions or contests offered by Azalead.

“Personally Identifiable Information” means any information that identifies you personally, including your name, e-mail address, password, login ID, and other contact information that you voluntarily submit to us.

### Cookies and Web Beacons

We employ cookies on our Sites in order for our server to recognize a return visitor as a unique user. Cookies are small text files that your browser stores on your hard disk that allow us to remember you; cookies cannot access, read, or modify any other data on a computer. The cookies we place are readable only by us. All Web browsers offer the option to refuse any cookie. If you refuse Azalead cookies, you may need to re-enter certain information each time you visit our Sites and we may not be able to customize our Sites’ features according to your preferences. You may also delete cookies manually from your hard drive.

The cookies we place do not contain any personal information; however, they do contain identifiers that may be linked to certain non-personally identifiable information described in this privacy policy, as well as certain non-personally identifiable advertising IDs from third parties.

We also use the Azalead Platform on our Sites and our Email Campaigns, which utilizes cookies and web beacons, such as invisible tracking pixels, to help us better serve you and to provide targeted advertising we place on third party websites. More information regarding our collection and use of information through the Azalead Platform is provided separately, below.

### Marketing

We do not sell or rent the personal information we collect from your use of our Sites to third parties for their marketing purposes. We may combine your information with information we collect from other companies (such as demographic data) to improve and personalize the services provided to you. If you don’t wish to receive marketing communications from us, simply “unsubscribe” from email communication using the link located at the end of all marketing communications.

### Account Protection

Your password is the key to your account. We recommend the use of unique numbers, letters, and special characters in combination and that you not disclose your Azalead password to anyone. If you do share your password or your personal information with others, remember that you are responsible for all actions taken in the name of your account. If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your personal information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately notify us and change your password.

### Phishing

In order to protect yourself from third parties unlawfully seeking your personal information through email that appears to be from Azalead, you should never provide any personal information directly in response to an email you believe you have received from us. Rather, you should always close any such email, open your browser, log directly into the Azalead Site and change, update, or modify any such personal information via the Site. In the event that you believe that you have received a request for personal information in an email message that is made to appear that it was sent by us, please inform us immediately at support@azalead.com

## II. How Azalead Collects Information on the Azalead Platform

Use of the Azalead Platform on our clients’ websites is subject to those clients’ privacy policies, which govern our clients’ use of your information, including Personally Identifiable Information. Please consult with our clients’ privacy policies if you have questions about our clients’ use of the Azalead Platform or your information within their Site.

### Collection of Information

The Azalead Platform is primarily IP address-driven (in other words, we typically infer basic information about your organization based on your IP address). However, we also use cookies and web beacons, such as invisible tracking pixels, to enhance our services and help optimize and attribute the advertising we place on third party websites. When you visit a third party website that uses the Azalead Platform, we may gather non-personally identifiable information such as your IP address, cookie information (including advertising IDs and associated information), time stamps (time a page was accessed as well as time spent per web page), and clickstream information (for example, which websites and web pages you viewed and for how long). Information we collect via web beacons is associated with the existing Azalead cookie already placed on your computer.

### Opting Out of Cookie-Based Advertising

We try hard to make our advertising more relevant to you, but if you would rather opt out of seeing personalized ads from Azalead and Azalead clients, please click [here](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/). If you opt out, you will still see ads from us and our clients, but they will not be tailored based on information that may have otherwise been associated with a Azalead cookie stored on your computer.

Azalead also displays the Digital Advertising Alliance’s (“DAA”) Advertising Option Icon on advertising you see from us that has been targeted to your interests. This icon generally appears as in one of the corners of the ad and may be accompanied by text such as “AdChoices.” You can click on the icon to learn more about the ad and to opt out of seeing future personalized ads from us and our clients utilizing Azalead cookies. This is the same opt-out as the one provided above. To learn more about the DAA and the Advertising Option Icon, and to opt out of personalized advertising delivered by other participating companies, please visit <http://www.aboutads.info/how-interest-based-ads-work>.

Please note that our opt-out requires that we be able to set an opt-out cookie in your browser.

### Browser-Based “Do Not Track”

Some browsers have incorporated “Do Not Track” (DNT) features. Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal, we do not currently respond to browser DNT signals on our Sites or on third party sites that use the Azalead Platform.

## III. Terms Applicable to Both Azalead Websites and the Azalead Platform

### Use of Information

Our primary purposes in collecting your information are to provide you with an efficient and customized experience and to deliver advertising that may be of interest to you. You agree that we may use your information to:

  * provide the services and customer support you request;
  * resolve disputes, collect fees, and troubleshoot problems;
  * prevent prohibited or illegal activities, and enforce our Terms of Use;
  * customize, measure, and improve our services and our Sites’ content and layout;
  * share service updates, and promotional offers based on your communication preferences;
  * make inferences about your interests for advertising or service-related purposes;
  * provide you with offers or promotions that may interest you, or otherwise deliver you advertising, including on other websites.



### Our Disclosure of Your Information

We may disclose your information:

  * as required to respond to legal matters, enforce our policies, or protect individual rights, property, or safety;
  * to employees and agents of Azalead in order to help detect and prevent prohibited or illegal acts;
  * to service providers under contract who help with our business operations;
  * to other third parties to whom you explicitly ask us to send your information;
  * to those serving apparently valid subpoenas;
  * to other business entities, should we plan to merge with, or be acquired by, that business entity.



We also use certain third party analytics, advertising, widget, and other plugins to provide certain services on our Sites and to deliver you targeted advertisements on third party websites. The third parties operating these plugins may use cookies, web beacons, or other technologies to collect personal information about your online activities over time and across different websites when you use our Sites.

Without limiting the above, in an effort to respect your privacy we will not otherwise disclose your personal information except when we believe in good faith that the disclosure of information is necessary to prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss or to report suspected illegal activity.

### Security

Your information is stored on our servers located in the United States. We treat data as an asset that must be protected and use certain tools (including but not limited to encryption, passwords, and physical security) to protect your personal information against unauthorized access and disclosure. However, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. Therefore, although we take reasonable steps to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private.

### Anti-Abuse

If you suspect a client of abusing our services, please contact us at abuseazalead.com. All complaints are investigated, and you will receive a response on the action we will take to resolve the issue.

### Partners

Azalead has aligned with recognized leaders in the digital and direct marketing industry and hopes to influence how practices are shaped in the future. Please contact us at supportazalead.com to learn more.

### Changes

We may amend this Privacy Policy from time-to-time by posting the amended terms on our Sites. All amended terms automatically take effect 30 days after they are initially posted on our Sites.
