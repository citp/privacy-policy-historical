## How We Collect Information About You

In addition to membership information, AZA collects and maintains certain personal information about you when you send us an e-mail or complete any of our online forms, such as when you request information from us, make a donation, subscribe to one of our online newsletters, request to become a member, respond to surveys, register for meetings, or forward a web page, electronic postcard, electronic ballot, or electronic newsletter. Such information may include your name, mailing address, and e-mail address; it may also include the e-mail addresses of those to whom you forward AZA electronic content, and any other information collected in the forms. You may be asked to provide credit card information to become a member of AZA, contribute to AZA, purchase certain information or materials from AZA, or subscribe to various AZA publications.

##### Information We Gather Automatically

AZA.org also collects certain other information that cannot identify you personally when you visit our web site. This information includes your IP address and your domain name. AZA.org logs these IP addresses and domain names, and aggregates them for system administration and to monitor the use of our site. We use the aggregated information to measure the number of visits to our site, the average time spent on our site, the number of pages viewed, and various other site statistics. This monitoring helps us to provide a more useful and engaging online experience to AZA.org visitors, and helps us to improve the quality of our content.

AZA uses cookies in order to make the results available for your on-site searches. Cookies are used in the login process to the Members Only section of the Site. The cookies that control the login process expire after 24 hours, unless you use "Member log out", which removes the cookie immediately. A cookie is a small file that is sent out by a web site, accepted by the user's browser, and placed on the user's hard drive. You can always set your browser to warn of cookies being placed, and then chose which cookies you want to accept. AZA does not match any information gathered by cookies with personal information you may have voluntarily submitted to AZA.

##### Use of Information

We may use the information you voluntarily provide to contact you regarding zoo and aquarium issues that we believe may be of interest to you, to keep you updated regarding AZA programs, and to invite you to support our programs. We may also send such information to the people whose e-mail addresses you provide when forwarding AZA electronic content. When we do so, our sole intent is to enlarge our family of informed zoo and aquarium advocates and organizational supporters. Every recipient of our electronic communications can quickly and easily "opt out" of future such communications by following the instructions on any electronic communication we send.

From time to time, we may make such voluntary information, excluding credit card information (which will never be disclosed), available to AZA affiliate organizations or to sponsors or licensees that provide special programs or services that we think you might find interesting or beneficial. AZA uses strict standards in determining which reputable companies become sponsors and licensees, to ensure that such organizations are committed to the protection of visitors' privacy and committed to the goals of AZA.

If your volunteered personal information will be used in any manner other than as stated above, such use shall be specifically posted. If you wish to update or remove your information, or if you do not wish your information to be shared with affiliated third parties, please e-mail us at [General Inquiry](mailto:G.e.n.e.r.a.l.I.n.q.u.i.r.y@aza.org).
