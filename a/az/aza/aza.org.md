## Use of Information

We may use the information you voluntarily provide to contact you regarding zoo and aquarium issues that we believe may be of interest to you, to keep you updated regarding AZA programs, and to invite you to support our programs. We may also send such information to the people whose e-mail addresses you provide when forwarding AZA electronic content. When we do so, our sole intent is to enlarge our family of informed zoo and aquarium advocates and organizational supporters. Every recipient of our electronic communications can quickly and easily "opt out" of future such communications by following the instructions on any electronic communication we send.

From time to time, we may make such voluntary information, excluding credit card information (which will never be disclosed), available to AZA affiliate organizations or to sponsors or licensees that provide special programs or services that we think you might find interesting or beneficial. AZA uses strict standards in determining which reputable companies become sponsors and licensees, to ensure that such organizations are committed to the protection of visitors' privacy and committed to the goals of AZA.

AZA allows donors to contribute through mobile texts. Donors who contribute in this manner have the option of instructing AZA that they would prefer to "opt out" (a) of the sharing of their contact information with third parties AZA determines may have offers or services of interest to donors or (b) of receiving further communications from AZA itself (which also would prevent the sharing of contact information with third parties). Mobile donors may exercise their "opt out" choices by [clicking here](mailto:G.e.n.e.r.a.l.I.n.q.u.i.r.y@aza.org?subject=Opt%20out "Opt out").
