			<p>If you only browse the website during your visit and input no data, we collect

			<p>Software programs are used to create summary statistics from this information

  or state law.</p>
			<p>In the State of Arizona, laws exist to ensure that government is open, and 
  the public has a right to access most records and information possessed by state 
  government. At the same time, there are exceptions to the public's right to 
  access public records that serve various needs, including the privacy of individuals. 
  Both state and federal laws provide exceptions.</p>

  Web site and has taken steps to safeguard the integrity of its data, and prevent
