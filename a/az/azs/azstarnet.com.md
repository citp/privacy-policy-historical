### StarNet's privacy policy

StarNet believes in keeping your confidential information just that...confidential. Subject to the terms below, we will not sell to or share with anyone your personally identifiable information. We will share with potential advertisers only aggregate visitor information. 

**WHAT INFORMATION IS COLLECTED**

We collect a limited amount of personal information from you in certain areas of StarNet for various reasons. The following is a description of what information is collected.

**Registration Information**

Registration may be required to participate in our online forums or bulletin boards, to enter contests and promotions, or to vote in some online polls.  Some features of the site are third party services and may require a separate registration. You should review the applicable privacy policies of these affiliated third party sites before providing personally identifiable information. StarNet is not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties.  
  
**IP Addresses** An IP address is a number assigned to your computer when you connect to the Internet. As part of the protocol of the Internet, web servers can identify your computer by its IP address. In addition, web servers may be able to identify the type of browser you are using or even the type of computer.  StarNet collects IP addresses and related information for the purposes of system administration, to assess the traffic to our site, to report aggregate information to our advertisers, and to maintain and improve our site. We do not link IP addresses to your personally identifiable information. We can and will use IP addresses, however, to identify a user when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our terms of service or to protect our service, site, customers or others.

**Use Of Cookies**

Cookies are small bits of information that some Web sites (including StarNet) transfer to an individual's hard drive for research purposes. StarNet uses cookies to analyze the traffic, such as total visitors and pages viewed on our site, to improve the functionality of some pages, and make improvements based on the data we collect. We use cookies in features such as the Custom Clipper to enhance and customize a user's experience on the site. StarNet never saves passwords or credit card information in cookies. The use of cookies has become a standard in the industry, especially at Web sites that provide any kind of personalized service. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can usually set your browser to refuse cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. If you refuse cookies, you may not be able to use some of the functionality of StarNet. Cookies may also be used by StarNet's advertisers and partners from third party sites to which StarNet links. We do not control these cookies. The use of cookies by advertisers is standard in the Internet industry.

**WHO IS COLLECTING THIS INFORMATION**

StarNet collects this information via our web site. In the case of co-branded sites, various third parties may collect such information. You should review the applicable privacy policies of these third parties before providing personally identifiable information. StarNet is not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties. While you are using StarNet, you may be linked or directed to other third party sites outside StarNet that are beyond StarNet's control. For example, you might click on a link or banner ad that will take you off StarNet's site. Each of these third parties may have a privacy policy different from that of StarNet. These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data or solicit personal information. You should review the applicable privacy policies of these third party sites before providing personally identifiable information. These links and banners may take you to sites of advertisers, sponsors and co-branding partners. Please review the privacy policies of these sites. StarNet is not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties.

**HOW COLLECTED INFORMATION IS USED**

StarNet uses registration information to learn more about how visitors use the site and to measure areas of interest. This allows StarNet to build features and functionality that will enhance your StarNet experience. We also use the registration process to filter out those who post to StarNet's online forums but do not comply with our User Agreement.  Aggregate information is used to help us run and maintain our site, study traffic patterns and generally learn about the usage of our site. Some of this aggregate information may be used to help us set advertising rates, determine advertising fees, and attract advertisers and co-branding partners.

**WITH WHOM THE INFORMATION MAY BE SHARED**

Except for the following exceptions, we will not knowingly authorize the disclosure of your personal identifiable information (other than aggregate statistical information) to third parties without your consent. First, we may disclose user information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may have breached our User Agreement or who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) StarNet's rights or property, other StarNet users, or anyone else who could be harmed by such activities. Second, we may disclose user information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.  It is important to know that you may inadvertently provide personally identifiable information to third parties through your postings to a forum or participation in a chat session. For example, while we do not always require that you make your real name available in online forums, your user name is visible and may reveal information about yourself. We encourage you to give some thought to the privacy implications of your choice of a user name. 

**CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF 13 YEARS**

In accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), StarNet will not knowingly accept personally identifiable information from a child under the age of 13 without a parent's or guardian's prior consent. Participation in some sections of StarNet is restricted to users over the age of 13 or 18. 

**LINKS TO OTHER SITES**

While you are using StarNet, you may be linked or directed to other third party sites outside StarNet that are beyond our control. Each of these third parties may have a privacy policy different from that of StarNet. For example, you might click on a link or banner ad that will take you off our site. These links and banners may take you to sites of advertisers, sponsors and co-branding partners. Please review the privacy policies of these sites. StarNet is not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties. For example, the links to StarNet Community sites will take you to various organizations. These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data or solicit personal information. You should review the applicable private policies of these third party sites before providing personally identifiable information. StarNet is not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties.

**SECURITY PROCEDURES WE USE**

We are very concerned with the security of your personally identifiable information and take great care in providing secure transmission of your information from your PC to our servers. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us.  Once we receive your information, we take appropriate steps that we believe are reasonable to protect the security of your data on our system, both internally and from outsiders, and to ensure the integrity of the data we collect. We use a combination of technological and policy methods to protect this data.  Your bulletin board registration or contest registration may be protected with a password. If you have Internet service provided by StarNet (via its Fastucson.net affiliate), your account is protected with a password. You must take care not to divulge your password to anyone. StarNet will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or e-mail. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and any account information.

We may use your sign-on, log-in name, e-mail address or other identifier to block you from online forums if you violate our user agreements. 

**CHANGES IN THESE TERMS**

We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time and will post notices on this site at the time of any material changes to this Privacy Policy. Your continued use of the StarNet site following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes.  If you have questions or concerns regarding StarNet's Privacy Policy, please e-mail StarNet at [sncommunity@azstarnet.com](mailto:sncommunity@azstarnet.com), call StarNet's Community Director at (520) 618-7833, or send a letter via postal mail to:StarNet Community
