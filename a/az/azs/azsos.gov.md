In some cases, additional contact information such as email address is collected in addition to complete your online experience. We use your email to respond to your requests and to the issues you have identified, and/or possibly to forward your email to another State agency for appropriate action. 

Please be aware that in the State of Arizona, laws exist to ensure that state government is open and that the public has a right to access appropriate records and information possessed by the state. However, if personal information is requested on the web site or volunteered by the user, state law and the federal Privacy Act of 1974 may protect it.
