    <p>
        THIS NOTICE DESCRIBES HOW MEDICAL INFORMATION ABOUT YOU MAY BE USED AND DISCLOSED
        AND HOW YOU CAN GET ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION. PLEASE REVIEW IT CAREFULLY.</p>
    <p>
        This Notice describes how Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Arizona ("BCBSAZ") may use
        and disclose your protected health information ("PHI"). It also describes our legal
        obligations concerning your PHI and your rights to access and control your PHI.
        This Notice takes effect on April 14, 2003 in accordance with the privacy regulations
        issued under the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of
        1996 ("HIPAA Privacy Regulations").</p>
    <p>
        PHI is individually identifiable health information, including actual medical information
        as well as your name, address, phone number, identification number or other identifiers,
        collected from you or created by or received by a health care provider, a health
        plan, your employer, or a health care clearinghouse and that relates to: (1) your
        past, present, or future physical or mental health or condition; (2) the provision
        of health care to you; or (3) the past, present, or future payment for health care
        provided to you.</p>
    <p>
        We are required by law to maintain the privacy of your PHI. We are obligated to
        provide you with a copy of this Notice and we must abide by the terms of this Notice.
        We reserve the right to change this Notice at any time. If we make a material change
        to our Notice, we will mail a revised Notice to the address that we have on record
        for each insurance policyholder. The policyholder is the person in whose name the
        policy was issued.</p>
    <h2 id="imgUsesDisclosuresPHI">
        USES AND DISCLOSURES OF PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION (PHI)</h2>
    <p>
        The following is a description of how we are most likely to use and/or disclose
        your PHI.</p>
    <h3>
        Payment Activities</h3>
    <p>
        We may use and disclose your PHI for all functions that are included within our
        payment activities. For example, we will use or disclose your PHI to obtain premiums
        and to pay claims for services provided to you in accordance with your policy. We
        may disclose your PHI when a provider or your designated broker or agent requests
        information regarding your eligibility for coverage under our health plan, or we
        may use your information to determine if a treatment that you received was medically
        necessary. Additionally, if you are enrolled in a group health plan, we may disclose
        your PHI to your employer for it to administer the group health plan if the employer
        has amended the plan document for the group health plan to limit the uses and disclosures
        it may make of your PHI. Please see your plan documents for a full explanation of
        the limited uses and disclosures that the employer may make of your PHI. We may
        also disclose summary health information to your employer for it to obtain premium
        bids for the group health plan coverage or to modify or terminate the group health
        plan. Summary health information has been stripped of information which would directly
        identify you.</p>
    <h3>
        Health Care Operations</h3>
    <p>
        We may use and disclose your PHI for our health care operations. These functions
        include, but are not limited to, quality assessment and improvement, reviewing provider
        performance, business management and administration. For example, we may use or
        disclose your PHI to provide you with information about one of our wellness or care
        management programs, to respond to a customer service inquiry from you or in connection
        with fraud and abuse detection and compliance programs.</p>
    <h3>
        Business Associates</h3>
    <p>
        We contract with individuals and entities (business associates) to perform various
        functions on our behalf which involve the use and/or disclosure of PHI. Business
        associates must agree in writing to appropriately safeguard your information. For
        example, we may disclose your PHI to a business associate to manage our claims processing
        system, to manage certain aspects of our pharmacy benefits or to maintain certain
        provider networks.</p>
    <h3>
        Other Entities</h3>
    <p>
        We may use or disclose your PHI to assist health care providers in connection with
        their treatment or payment activities, or to assist other entities covered by the
        HIPAA Privacy Regulations in connection with certain health care operations. For
        example, we may disclose PHI to another covered entity in order to coordinate benefits,
        if you or your family members have coverage through another carrier.</p>
    <h3>
        Potential Impact of State Law</h3>
    <p>
        In some situations, the HIPAA Privacy Regulations do not take the place of state
        privacy or other laws that provide individuals greater privacy protections. As a
        result, the privacy laws of a particular state, or other federal laws, rather than
        the HIPAA Privacy Regulations, might impose a privacy standard under which we will
        be required to operate. For example, certain information regarding HIV or AIDS,
        communicable diseases, abortion, or records from certain drug and alcohol abuse
        programs may be subject to additional restrictions.</p>
    <h3>
        Disclosures to You on Your Authorization</h3>
    <p>
        We must disclose your PHI to you as described in the Individual Rights section of
        this Notice. Additionally, you may give us written authorization to use your PHI
        or to disclose it to anyone for any purpose. We will disclose your PHI to an individual
        you designate as your personal representative and who has qualified for such designation
        in accordance with relevant state law. However, we may elect not to treat the person
        as your personal representative if we have a reasonable belief that you have been,
        or may be, subjected to domestic violence, abuse, or neglect by such person, treating
        such person as your personal representative could endanger you, or we determine,
        in the exercise of our professional judgment, that it is not in your best interest
        to treat the person as your personal representative.</p>
    <h3>
        Others Involved in Your Health Care and Disaster Relief</h3>
    <p>
        Unless you object, we may disclose your PHI to a friend or family member that is
        involved in your health care. We also may disclose your information to an entity
        assisting in a disaster relief effort so that your family can be notified about
        your condition, status, and location. If you are not present or able to agree to
        these disclosures of your PHI, then we may determine in our professional judgment
        if the disclosure is in your best interest.</p>
    <h3>
        Marketing</h3>
    <p>
        We may use your PHI to communicate with you face-to-face or about a promotional
        gift of nominal value.</p>
    <h3>
        Health Oversight Activities</h3>
    <p>
        We may disclose your PHI to a government agency authorized to oversee health care
        systems or government programs. The Arizona Department of Insurance is such an entity.
        Examples would include disclosures for audits, investigations, inspections, licensure
        or disciplinary actions, or civil, administrative, or criminal proceedings or actions.
        Oversight agencies include government agencies that oversee the health care system,
        government benefit programs and other government regulatory programs.</p>
    <h3>
        Legal Proceedings</h3>
    <p>
        We may disclose your PHI: (1) in the course of any judicial or administrative proceeding;
        (2) in response to an order of a court or administrative tribunal (to the extent
        such disclosure is expressly authorized); and (3) in response to a subpoena, a discovery
        request, or other lawful process, once we have met any administrative requirements
        of the HIPAA Privacy Regulations.</p>
    <h3>
        Public Health Activities</h3>
    <p>
        We may use or disclose your PHI to public health authorities. For example, we may
        use or disclose information for the purpose of preventing or controlling disease,
        injury, or disability, or we may disclose such information to a public health authority
        authorized to receive reports of child abuse or neglect.</p>
    <h3>
        Abuse or Neglect
    </h3>
    <p>
        We may disclose your PHI to appropriate authorities that are authorized to receive
        reports of abuse, neglect, or domestic violence. Additionally, as required by law,
        we may disclose your information to a governmental entity authorized to receive
        such information if we believe that you have been a victim of abuse, neglect, or
        domestic violence.</p>
    <h3>
        Law Enforcement</h3>
    <p>
        Under certain conditions, we also may disclose your PHI to law enforcement officials.
        Some examples of the reasons for such a disclosure may include that it is required
        by law or some other legal process, it is necessary to locate or identify a suspect,
        fugitive, material witness, or missing person or it is necessary to provide evidence
        of a crime that occurred on our premises.</p>
    <h3>
        Coroners, Medical Examiners, Funeral Directors, and Organ Donation</h3>
    <p>
        We may disclose PHI to a coroner or medical examiner for purposes of identifying
        a deceased person, determining a cause of death, or for the coroner or medical examiner
        to perform other duties authorized by law. We also may disclose, as authorized by
        law, information to funeral directors so that they may carry out their duties. Further,
        we may disclose PHI to organizations that handle organ, eye, or tissue donation
        and transplantation.</p>
    <h3>
    
    Research</h3>
    <p>
        We may disclose your PHI to researchers when an Institutional Review Board or privacy
        board has reviewed the research proposal and established protocols to ensure the
        privacy of the information, and approved the research, or as part of a limited data
        set which includes no unique identifiers (information such as name, address, identification
        number, etc. that can identify you).</p>
    <h3>
        To Prevent a Serious Threat to Health or Safety</h3>
    <p>
        We may disclose your PHI if we believe that the disclosure is necessary to prevent
        or lessen a serious and imminent threat to the health or safety of a person or the
        public. We also may disclose PHI if it is necessary for law enforcement authorities
        to identify or apprehend an individual.</p>
    <h3>
        Military Activity and National Security, Protective Services</h3>

    <h2 id="imgIndividualRights">
        YOUR INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS</h2>
    <p>
        The following is a description of your rights with respect to your PHI.</p>
    <h3>
        Right to Request a Restriction</h3>
    <p>
        You have the right to request that we place additional restrictions on our use and
        disclosure of your PHI. We are not required to agree to any restriction that you
        may request. If we do agree to the restriction, we will comply with the restriction
        unless the information is needed to provide emergency treatment to you or unless
        the use or disclosure is otherwise permitted or required by law.</p>
    <p>
        To request a restriction, you may complete a Restriction Request Form and mail it
        to the Privacy Office at the address listed in the last section of this Notice.
        To obtain a Restriction Request Form, please call the BCBSAZ Customer Service number
        listed on the back of your BCBSAZ identification card, or (602) 864-4400 or (800)

        232-2345, ext. 2255.</p>
    <h3>
        Right to Request Confidential Communications</h3>
    <p>
        If you believe that a disclosure of all or part of your PHI may endanger you, you
        may request that we communicate your PHI to you in an alternative manner or at an
        alternative location. We will accommodate a request for confidential communications
        that is reasonable and that truthfully states that the disclosure of all or part
        of your PHI could endanger you. Once a request for confidential communications goes
        into effect, all of your PHI will be processed in accordance with your instructions
        unless a particular use or disclosure is otherwise required by law. We will not
        process requests on a diagnostic-specific basis. Please note that, even if you request
        confidential communications, the check for services you receive from a provider
        could be sent to the policyholder. Additionally, such services may alter deductible
        figures, coinsurance maximums and other cost sharing items.</p>
    <p>
        To make such a request, you may either call the Privacy Office at (602) 864-2255
        or (800) 232-2345, ext. 2255, or mail a written request to the Privacy Office at
        the address listed in the last section of this Notice. Within 30 days of any verbal
        request, you must document an oral request in writing. Any written request must
        include the following information: (1) your BCBSAZ identification number, (2) your
        date of birth, (3) your desire that we communicate with you in an alternative manner
        or at an alternative location, (4) what the manner and location are, and (5) your
        belief that the disclosure of all or part of the PHI in a manner inconsistent with
        your instructions would put you in danger. If you prefer, you may complete a Confidential
        Communication Request Form and mail it to the Privacy Office at the address listed
        in the last section of this Notice. To obtain a Confidential Communication Request
        Form, please call the BCBSAZ Customer Service number listed on the back of your
        BCBSAZ identification card, or (602) 864-4400 or (800) 232-2345.</p>
    <h3>
        Right to Access</h3>
    <p>
        You have the right to inspect and copy your PHI, with limited exception, that BCBSAZ
        and its business associates maintain.</p>
    <p>
        To request access to your PHI, you must complete a Request for Access to Protected
        Health Information &amp; Records Form and mail it to the Privacy Office at the address
        listed in the last section of this Notice. To obtain a Request for Access to Protected
        Health Information &amp; Records Form, please call the BCBSAZ Customer Service number
        listed on the back of your BCBSAZ identification card, or (602) 864-4400 or (800)
        232-2345. If you request a copy of the information, we may charge a fee for the
        costs of copying, mailing, or other supplies associated with your request.</p>
    <p>
        We may deny your request to inspect and copy your PHI in certain circumstances as
        set forth in the HIPAA Privacy Regulations Under certain conditions, if you are
        denied access to your information, you may ask us to designate a different licensed
        health care professional, who did not participate in the initial determination,
        to review that determination. To make such a request, call the Privacy Office at
        (602) 864-2255 or (800) 232-2345, ext. 2255. Not all denials of access are subject
        to review.</p>
    <h3>
        Right to Amend</h3>
    <p>
        If you believe that your PHI is incorrect or incomplete, you may request that we
        amend your information. To request that we amend your PHI you must complete an Amendment
        Request Form and mail it to the BCBSAZ Privacy Office at the address listed in the
        last section of this Notice. To obtain an Amendment Request Form, please call the

        card, or (602) 864-4400 or (800) 232-2345.</p>
    <p>
        In certain cases, we may deny your request for an amendment for reasons set forth
        in the HIPAA Privacy Regulations. For example, we may deny your request if the information
        you want to amend was not created by us, but by another entity. If we deny your
        request, you have the right to file a statement of disagreement with us. Your statement
        of disagreement will be linked with the disputed information and all future disclosures
        of the disputed information will include your statement.</p>
    <h3>
        Right of a Listing of Disclosures</h3>
    <p>
        You have a right to a listing of certain disclosures BCBSAZ and its business associates
        have made of your PHI. You are not entitled to a listing of disclosures which were
        made for our payment or health care operations, pursuant to your authorization or
        in certain other limited instances. Please note that most disclosures of PHI will
        be for purposes of payment or health care operations. A listing will include the
        date of the disclosure, to whom we made the disclosure, a brief description of the
        information disclosed, and the purpose for the disclosure. Your request may be for
        disclosures made up to 6 years before the date of your request, but may not include
        disclosures made before April 14, 2003.</p>
