# AzBlue.com Privacy Statement

THIS NOTICE DESCRIBES HOW MEDICAL INFORMATION ABOUT YOU MAY BE USED AND DISCLOSED AND HOW YOU CAN GET ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION. PLEASE REVIEW IT CAREFULLY.

This Notice describes how Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Arizona ("BCBSAZ") may use and disclose your protected health information ("PHI"). It also describes our legal obligations concerning your PHI and your rights to access and control your PHI. This Notice takes effect on April 14, 2003 in accordance with the privacy regulations issued under the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ("HIPAA Privacy Regulations").

PHI is individually identifiable health information, including actual medical information as well as your name, address, phone number, identification number or other identifiers, collected from you or created by or received by a health care provider, a health plan, your employer, or a health care clearinghouse and that relates to: (1) your past, present, or future physical or mental health or condition; (2) the provision of health care to you; or (3) the past, present, or future payment for health care provided to you.

We are required by law to maintain the privacy of your PHI. We are obligated to provide you with a copy of this Notice and we must abide by the terms of this Notice. We reserve the right to change this Notice at any time. If we make a material change to our Notice, we will mail a revised Notice to the address that we have on record for each insurance policyholder. The policyholder is the person in whose name the policy was issued.

##  USES AND DISCLOSURES OF PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION (PHI)

The following is a description of how we are most likely to use and/or disclose your PHI.

###  Payment Activities

We may use and disclose your PHI for all functions that are included within our payment activities. For example, we will use or disclose your PHI to obtain premiums and to pay claims for services provided to you in accordance with your policy. We may disclose your PHI when a provider or your designated broker or agent requests information regarding your eligibility for coverage under our health plan, or we may use your information to determine if a treatment that you received was medically necessary. Additionally, if you are enrolled in a group health plan, we may disclose your PHI to your employer for it to administer the group health plan if the employer has amended the plan document for the group health plan to limit the uses and disclosures it may make of your PHI. Please see your plan documents for a full explanation of the limited uses and disclosures that the employer may make of your PHI. We may also disclose summary health information to your employer for it to obtain premium bids for the group health plan coverage or to modify or terminate the group health plan. Summary health information has been stripped of information which would directly identify you.

###  Health Care Operations

We may use and disclose your PHI for our health care operations. These functions include, but are not limited to, quality assessment and improvement, reviewing provider performance, business management and administration. For example, we may use or disclose your PHI to provide you with information about one of our wellness or care management programs, to respond to a customer service inquiry from you or in connection with fraud and abuse detection and compliance programs.

###  Business Associates

We contract with individuals and entities (business associates) to perform various functions on our behalf which involve the use and/or disclosure of PHI. Business associates must agree in writing to appropriately safeguard your information. For example, we may disclose your PHI to a business associate to manage our claims processing system, to manage certain aspects of our pharmacy benefits or to maintain certain provider networks.

###  Other Entities

We may use or disclose your PHI to assist health care providers in connection with their treatment or payment activities, or to assist other entities covered by the HIPAA Privacy Regulations in connection with certain health care operations. For example, we may disclose PHI to another covered entity in order to coordinate benefits, if you or your family members have coverage through another carrier.

###  Potential Impact of State Law

In some situations, the HIPAA Privacy Regulations do not take the place of state privacy or other laws that provide individuals greater privacy protections. As a result, the privacy laws of a particular state, or other federal laws, rather than the HIPAA Privacy Regulations, might impose a privacy standard under which we will be required to operate. For example, certain information regarding HIV or AIDS, communicable diseases, abortion, or records from certain drug and alcohol abuse programs may be subject to additional restrictions.

###  Disclosures to You on Your Authorization

We must disclose your PHI to you as described in the Individual Rights section of this Notice. Additionally, you may give us written authorization to use your PHI or to disclose it to anyone for any purpose. We will disclose your PHI to an individual you designate as your personal representative and who has qualified for such designation in accordance with relevant state law. However, we may elect not to treat the person as your personal representative if we have a reasonable belief that you have been, or may be, subjected to domestic violence, abuse, or neglect by such person, treating such person as your personal representative could endanger you, or we determine, in the exercise of our professional judgment, that it is not in your best interest to treat the person as your personal representative.

###  Others Involved in Your Health Care and Disaster Relief

Unless you object, we may disclose your PHI to a friend or family member that is involved in your health care. We also may disclose your information to an entity assisting in a disaster relief effort so that your family can be notified about your condition, status, and location. If you are not present or able to agree to these disclosures of your PHI, then we may determine in our professional judgment if the disclosure is in your best interest.

###  Marketing

We may use your PHI to communicate with you face-to-face or about a promotional gift of nominal value.

###  Health Oversight Activities

We may disclose your PHI to a government agency authorized to oversee health care systems or government programs. The Arizona Department of Insurance is such an entity. Examples would include disclosures for audits, investigations, inspections, licensure or disciplinary actions, or civil, administrative, or criminal proceedings or actions. Oversight agencies include government agencies that oversee the health care system, government benefit programs and other government regulatory programs.

###  Legal Proceedings

We may disclose your PHI: (1) in the course of any judicial or administrative proceeding; (2) in response to an order of a court or administrative tribunal (to the extent such disclosure is expressly authorized); and (3) in response to a subpoena, a discovery request, or other lawful process, once we have met any administrative requirements of the HIPAA Privacy Regulations.

###  Public Health Activities

We may use or disclose your PHI to public health authorities. For example, we may use or disclose information for the purpose of preventing or controlling disease, injury, or disability, or we may disclose such information to a public health authority authorized to receive reports of child abuse or neglect.

###  Abuse or Neglect 

We may disclose your PHI to appropriate authorities that are authorized to receive reports of abuse, neglect, or domestic violence. Additionally, as required by law, we may disclose your information to a governmental entity authorized to receive such information if we believe that you have been a victim of abuse, neglect, or domestic violence.

###  Law Enforcement

Under certain conditions, we also may disclose your PHI to law enforcement officials. Some examples of the reasons for such a disclosure may include that it is required by law or some other legal process, it is necessary to locate or identify a suspect, fugitive, material witness, or missing person or it is necessary to provide evidence of a crime that occurred on our premises.

###  Coroners, Medical Examiners, Funeral Directors, and Organ Donation

We may disclose PHI to a coroner or medical examiner for purposes of identifying a deceased person, determining a cause of death, or for the coroner or medical examiner to perform other duties authorized by law. We also may disclose, as authorized by law, information to funeral directors so that they may carry out their duties. Further, we may disclose PHI to organizations that handle organ, eye, or tissue donation and transplantation.

###  Research

We may disclose your PHI to researchers when an Institutional Review Board or privacy board has reviewed the research proposal and established protocols to ensure the privacy of the information, and approved the research, or as part of a limited data set which includes no unique identifiers (information such as name, address, identification number, etc. that can identify you).

###  To Prevent a Serious Threat to Health or Safety

We may disclose your PHI if we believe that the disclosure is necessary to prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat to the health or safety of a person or the public. We also may disclose PHI if it is necessary for law enforcement authorities to identify or apprehend an individual.

###  Military Activity and National Security, Protective Services

Under certain conditions, we may disclose your PHI if you are, or were, Armed Forces personnel for activities deemed necessary by appropriate military command authorities. If you are a member of foreign military service, we may disclose, in certain circumstances, your information to the foreign military authority. We also may disclose your PHI to authorized federal officials for conducting national security and intelligence activities, and for the protection of the President, other authorized persons, or heads of state.

###  Inmates

If you are an inmate of a correctional institution, we may disclose your PHI to the correctional institution or to a law enforcement official for the institution to provide health care to you, for your health and safety, for the health and safety of others, or for the safety and security of the correctional institution.

###  Workers' Compensation

We may disclose your PHI to comply with workers' compensation laws and other similar programs that provide benefits for work-related injuries or illnesses.

###  Disclosures to the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services

We are required to disclose your PHI to the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services when the Secretary is investigating or determining our compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Regulations.

###  Other Uses and Disclosures of Your Protected Health Information (PHI)

Other uses and disclosures of your PHI that are not described above will be made only with your written authorization. If you provide us with such an authorization, you may revoke the authorization in writing, and this revocation will be effective for future uses and disclosures of PHI. However, the revocation will not be effective for information that we already have used or disclosed, relying on the authorization.

##  YOUR INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS

The following is a description of your rights with respect to your PHI.

###  Right to Request a Restriction

You have the right to request that we place additional restrictions on our use and disclosure of your PHI. We are not required to agree to any restriction that you may request.
