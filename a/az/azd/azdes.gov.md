Thank you for visiting the Department of Economic Security (DES) agency web site and reviewing our Privacy Policy Statement. Pursuant to A.R.S. § 41-3901 et seq., all agencies of the State of Arizona shall contain a Privacy Policy Statement. This disclosure addresses collection, use and security of and access to information that may be obtained through the use of the DES web site. Your rights to privacy are of utmost importance to the State of Arizona in building trust and confidence when conducting business through the Internet.

**Online Customer Service and Alternatives**   
The Department of Economic Security offers many of the services online that you might otherwise transact in person. Our goal is to provide citizens a more convenient and efficient means with which to interact with Arizona government. If you choose not to participate in these activities, your choice will in no way affect your ability to receive benefits or services. If you prefer to apply for benefits or services in person, you may do so at the respective State agency providing such benefits and/or services. 

**Collection and Use of Information **  
The State of Arizona does not collect information about you unless you voluntarily participate in an activity that asks for such information. The information requested and supplied by you through the web, is the same information requested if performed in person at a State agency. Please be aware that in the State of Arizona, laws exist to ensure that state government is open and that the public has a right to access appropriate records and information possessed by the state. However, if personal information is requested on the web site or volunteered by the user, state law and the federal Privacy Act of 1974 may protect it. Should you have any questions, contact the agency directly about the records we keep and our use of information. 

**Security **  
The Department of Economic Security has taken several steps to safeguard the integrity of its computer systems and networks. Including, but not limited to, individual authentication, the security of transmitted data, security monitoring, auditing, and encryption of your information.
