Specifically, the information we collect automatically may include information like your IP address, device type, unique device identification numbers, browser-type, broad geographic location (e.g., country or city-level location) and other technical information.

Some of this information may be collected using cookies and similar tracking technology, as explained further under the heading “Cookies and similar tracking technology” below.

The types of information we collect from third parties includes the names or descriptions of videos or content viewed via our Sites or third-party Sites; and we use the information we receive from these third parties to provide you with a personalized and unified user experience, for example by allowing you to share, post or link our content through your accounts with third-party social media services.

Please note that if you choose to interact with social media features on our Sites, or if you are logged in to your social media or other accounts (e.g., Facebook, Twitter or Google) while using our Sites, those social media services may collect information about your use of our Sites. Information collected by third-party social media services is governed by the privacy notices of those third parties and we recommend that you make yourself aware of such privacy notices.

_Other ways we use personal information_

We may share or disclose your personal information with the following categories of recipients:

  * To our group companies, third-party service providers and partners who provide data processing services to us (for example, to support the delivery of, provide functionality on, or help to enhance the security of our Sites, for advertising services so we can select and serve relevant advertisements to you, for market research assistance, or for analytics and search engine services to improve and optimize our Sites), or who otherwise process personal information for purposes that are described in this Notice or notified to you when we collect your personal information.

  4. **LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING PERSONAL INFORMATION (EEA VISITORS ONLY)**



If you are a visitor from the European Economic Area (“EEA”), our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.

However, we will normally collect personal information from you only (i) where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you, (ii) where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your rights, or (iii) where we have your consent to do so. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you or may otherwise need the personal information to protect your vital interests or those of another person.

If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contact with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information).

If we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), this interest will normally be to operate our Sites and communicate with you as necessary to provide our services to you and for our legitimate commercial interests, for instance, when responding to your queries, improving our Sites, undertaking marketing, or for the purposes of detecting or preventing illegal activities. We may have other legitimate interests and if appropriate we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.

If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information, please contact us using the contact details provided under the “Contact Us” heading below.

  5. **STORAGE AND SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION**

  6. **COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES**



We and third parties may use cookies and other tracking technologies to enable certain features and functionality of our Sites and to provide you with content that is customized to your interests.

  7. **ADDITIONAL NIELSEN TERMS (applicable outside the EEA only)**



The Sites that enable you to view A+E Networks’ video content feature proprietary measurement software from The Nielsen Company (“Nielsen”) which will allow you to contribute to market research, like Nielsen’s TV Ratings. The information is collected directly by Nielsen’s software within the applicable Site. Neither A+E Networks nor Nielsen makes any representations or warranties to you regarding the Nielsen software. The Nielsen software is licensed solely for your use within the applicable Site, and Nielsen reserves all intellectual property rights and goodwill associated with such software. The Nielsen software also contains third-party software that remains the property of its respective owners.

To learn more about Nielsen’s digital measurement products and your choices in regard to them, please visit Nielsen’s Digital Measurement Privacy Policy page at nielsen.com/digitalprivacy for more information. Once there, you can access more detailed information about the measurement software and learn about your choices with regard to Nielsen’s measurement.

  8. **INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS**



Your personal information may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you are resident. These countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country (and, in some cases, may not be as protective).

Specifically, our website servers are located in the USA, and our group companies and third-party service providers and partners operate around the world. This means that when we collect your personal information we may process it in any of these countries.

However, we have taken safeguards to require that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this Notice. These include implementing an intra-group data transfer agreement incorporating the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of personal information between our group companies, which require all group companies to protect personal information they process from the EEA in accordance with European Union data protection law. A copy of our intra-group data transfer agreement can be provided upon request.

Where required by applicable data protection law, we have implemented similar safeguards with our third-party service providers and partners and further details can be provided upon request.

  9. **DATA RETENTION**



We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements).

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

  10. **YOUR DATA PROTECTION RIGHTS (EEA VISITORS ONLY)**



If you are a resident of the EEA, subject to applicable law, you may have certain rights regarding your personal information.

Specifically, you may be able to make the following choices:

  * Access, correct, update or request deletion of your personal information by contacting us using the contact details provided under the “Contact Us” heading below.
  * Object to processing of your personal information, ask us to restrict processing of your personal information or request portability of your personal information by contacting us using the contact details provided under the “Contact Us” heading below.
  * Opt out of marketing communications we send you at any time by clicking on the “unsubscribe” or “opt out” link in the marketing emails we send you, or by logging into your account and managing your email preferences.
  * Withdraw your consent at any time to our collection and processing of your personal information. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
  * Complain to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your personal information. For more information, please contact your local data protection authority.



To exercise these rights, please contact us as described in the “Contact Us” section below. We respond to requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws.

If you are under 13 years of age, you are not permitted to submit any personal information to us on any Site, and if we become aware that we have inadvertently received personal information from a visitor under the age of 13, we will delete that information from our records.

Some Sites we own or operate may be directed toward children under 13 (“Children’s Sites”). Children’s Sites are not governed by this Notice. The Notice that applies to a Children’s Site will be posted in an easily accessible location on the Children’s Site.

We are not responsible for the collection, use or sharing of your information by these third parties.
