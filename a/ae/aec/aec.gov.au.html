<h1>Privacy</h1>
      <h2>Information collection and privacy protection</h2>
      <p>The Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) makes every effort to adhere 
        to the Guidelines for Federal and ACT Government World Wide Websites developed 
        by the Australian Privacy Commissioner (available at <a href="http://www.privacy.gov.au/internet/web/index.html">http://www.privacy.gov.au/internet/web/index.html</a> 
        ).&nbsp; In particular the AEC seeks to comply with Information Privacy Principles 
        (see Glossary below) 1 to 3 and 10 and 11 of the <i>Privacy Act 1988</i> 
        (a copy of the Act is available at SCALEplus the legal information retrieval 
        system owned by the Australian Attorney General's Department at <a href="http://scaleplus.law.gov.au/">http://scaleplus.law.gov.au </a> ).</p>
      <p>This page explains the type of information that is collected by the AEC, 
        how such information is used, and under what circumstances and to whom 
        it may be disclosed.&nbsp; </p>
      <h2>Your email address</h2>
      <p>The AEC will only record your email address in the event that you send 
        a message by email or if you register requesting notifications.&nbsp; Registration 
        for notifications may be made initially by email, postal mail or facsimile.&nbsp; 
        Your email address will only be used for the purpose for which you have 
        provided it and will not be added to any mailing lists without your consent 
        by way of a specific request in writing.&nbsp; The AEC will not use or disclose 
        your email address for any other purpose, without your prior written consent.</p>
      <h2>Clickstream data and cookies</h2>
      <p>When visiting this website the AEC's site server makes a record of the 
        visit and logs the following information for statistical purposes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>the user's server address - this allows us to consider the visitors 
          who use the site most, and tailor the site to their interests and needs;</li>
        <li>the user's 
          operating system (for example Windows, Mac etc.) - this allows us to 
          tailor browser or platform specific parts of the site to each operating 
          system because browsers act differently on each platform;</li>
        <li>the user's 
          top level domain name (for example .com, .gov, .au etc.) - this can 
          allow us to tailor information relevant to different domains;</li>
        <li>the date and 
          time of the visit to the site - this is important for identifying the 
          website's busy times and ensuring maintenance on the site is conducted 
          outside these periods;</li>
        <li>pages accessed 
          and documents downloaded - this indicates to us which pages or documents 
          are most important to our users and also helps identify important information 
          that may be difficult to find;</li>
        <li>duration of 
          the visit - this indicates to us how interesting and informative our 
          site is to our users;</li>
        <li>geographic 
          location - this shows us how well marketed our site is internationally;</li>
        <li>the site visited 
          before the AEC website - this helps us determine the interests of our 
          users and which sites are providing links to ours as well as sites where 
          we may be able to seek links;</li>
        <li>the type of 
          browser used - this is important for browser specific coding e.g. Javascript. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>No attempt will be made to identify users or their browsing activities 
        unless legally compelled to do so, such as in the event of an investigation, 
        where a law enforcement agency may exercise a warrant to inspect the Internet 
        Service Provider's log files.</p>
      <p>This site contains links to other sites.&nbsp; The AEC is not responsible 
        for the privacy practices or the content of such websites.&nbsp; The AEC has 
        no knowledge if cookies or other tracking devices are used on linked websites.</p>
      <h2>Security of Information</h2>
      <p>We provide a secure environment and a reliable system but you should 
        be aware that there may be inherent risks associated with the transmission 
        of information via the Internet. For those who do not wish to use the 
        Internet, the AEC provides alternative ways of obtaining and providing 
        information.&nbsp; </p>
