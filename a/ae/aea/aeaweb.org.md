    2. With respect to Automatically Collected Information: we collect this information through:  
 **Cookies:** A cookie is a small file placed on the hard drive of your computer. "Session" cookies are only stored during a web site visit and expire when the web browser is closed.

### 4\. HOW DO WE USE YOUR CUSTOMER INFORMATION, AND WHAT ARE OUR GROUNDS FOR PROCESSING YOUR CUSTOMER INFORMATION?

    1. We use your Personally Identifiable Information to fulfill your orders for journals, and to communicate with you regarding such orders or delivery of services, or about membership if you are a member of our organization, or to respond to communication from you. Our basis for processing information for this purpose is that when you subscribe to our journals, become a member of our organization, or participate in the JOE Network, conference submission and registration, or any other online services, we have a contract with you to provide those goods, services, and information.

    5. We may process your Customer Information where necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims, whether in court proceedings or in an administrative or out-of-court procedure.

### 5\. HOW DOES THE COMPANY STORE YOUR CUSTOMER INFORMATION AND KEEP IT SECURE?

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. We maintain appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect Customer Information against accidental or unlawful destruction, accidental loss, unauthorized alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, misuse, and any other unlawful form of processing of the Customer Information in our possession. This includes, for example, firewalls, password protection and other access and authentication controls. We use SSL technology to encrypt data during transmission through the public internet. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. We cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or store on the Service, and you do so at your own risk. We also cannot guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. If you believe your Customer Information has been compromised, please contact us as set forth in the "How to Contact Us" section. If we learn of a security systems breach, we will inform you and the authorities of the occurrence of the breach in accordance with applicable law.

### 6\. HOW LONG DOES THE COMPANY RETAIN YOUR CUSTOMER INFORMATION?

We retain Customer Information as long as deemed necessary in order to maintain order histories and membership records for our legitimate internal business purposes, and, subject to your rights as set forth in Section 8.

### 7\. TO WHAT CATEGORIES OF THIRD PARTIES DO WE SHARE YOUR CUSTOMER INFORMATION?

    1. We do not sell, rent or lease Customer Information for marketing purposes.
    2. We will transfer your Customer Information as needed to certain vendors who require the information to provide business support services to the Company, including our Website hosting company, and our journal printers and delivery partner (“Service Vendors”). A list of our Service Vendors is available [here](https://web.archive.org/privacypolicy/vendors).

Your financial information is stored with [Paypal](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/paypal-safety-and-security) or our merchant processors.
    4. We may share your information with third parties such as our attorneys or law enforcement agencies in order to defend against legal claims or comply with legal obligations, or in order to protect your vital interests or the interests of another person.
