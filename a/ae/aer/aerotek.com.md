### Legal Basis for Processing Personal Information (EEA users only)

If you are a user from the European Economic Area, our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.  

However, we will normally collect personal information from you only (i) where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you, (ii) where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your rights, or (iii) where we have your consent to do so.  In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you.

If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information).  

If we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), this interest will normally be to operate our platform and to communicate with you as necessary to provide our services to you and for our legitimate commercial interest; for instance, when responding to your queries, improving our services, undertaking marketing, or for the purposes of detecting or preventing illegal activities.  We may have other legitimate interests and if appropriate we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.

You may choose to provide your personal information with Allegis Group for a particular position for which you are not successful. In such a situation, as you have indicated that you are looking for opportunities beyond your current role, Allegis may retain your personal information in order to present you with other opportunities for which your experience may be suitable. If you have concerns about Allegis Group retaining this data for these purposes please discuss them with your contact at Allegis Group.

If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information, please contact us using the contact details provided under the  _Contacting Us_ heading below.

### International Data Transfers

As a global company, we may transfer personal information to Allegis Group companies and third parties located in the United States and in other countries that may be outside your country of residence for storage and processing in order to provide the Allegis Services. These countries may not necessarily have data protection laws as comprehensive as those in your country or residence. In addition, we will have taken appropriate safeguards to protect your personal information in accordance with this Notice and applicable law wherever it is processed.  These safeguards include implementing the European Commission Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of personal information between Allegis Group companies and our self-certification to the Privacy Shield Frameworks which are explained in further detail below.  Further details of these safeguards can be provided upon request.
