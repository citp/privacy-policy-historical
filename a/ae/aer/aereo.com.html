	<h3 class="legal">Our Commitment to Privacy</h3>
	
	<p class="legal">At Aereo, we take your privacy very seriously. We are committed to complying with all applicable federal, state and local privacy laws and regulations. We strive to provide an environment in which our customers trust us to handle personal information responsibly. We provide this privacy notice as part of our commitment to privacy by describing the personal information that we collect, how we use it, how we protect it, and with whom we share it.</p>
	
	<p class="legal">This Privacy Policy explains how we collect and use your information, including personally identifiable data, such as your name, email address, postal address, phone number, internet protocol address and payment and/or credit card information (collectively, "Personal Data"), as well as certain other information including, without limitation, demographic and usage information (collectively "Other Data").

This Privacy Policy applies to all Aereo Members and/or Aereo Users. </p>
	
	<h3 class="legal">Information That We Collect</h3>
	
	<p class="legal">When you register to become an Aereo Member and/or become an Aereo User, we may collect the following data from you:</p>
	
	<p class="legal"><em>Personal Data:</em> We collect Personal Data from you when you voluntarily provide such information, such as when you register to become an Aereo Member, become an Aereo User and/or contact us with inquiries that may contain such data. Please note that when you register to become an Aereo Member, certain Personal Data, including credit and payment card information, may be provided to an outside billing company, called Vindicia , Inc. ("Vindicia ").  Such Personal Data that is provided to Vindicia  will be subject to Vindicia 's privacy policies and terms of use which are available on the <a href="http://www.vindicia.com">Vindicia  website</a>. 
	</p>
	
	<p class="legal"><em>Other Data</em>: We also collect Other Data, including the Research Data described below, about your use of Aereo and about your Supported Devices and/or other devices or browsers through which you may access Aereo. In addition, as set forth in more detail below, we may obtain, collect and store demographic information, such as gender, age, occupation, hobbies and interests or similar information. We may receive information about you from other sources including third party sources, online or offline, and add it to the information that you provided to us and/or that we collected.  We may also receive other data or information from or through you about third parties, such as a third party email address in connection with the "invite a friend" feature, if you provide such information directly or enable Aereo to access that information maintained in a third party resource such as, for one example, your email provider.  We may use such data to contact that third party with respect to your use of the "invite a friend" feature as well as for other Aereo related marketing. </p>
	
	<p class="legal"><em>Cookies and Web Beacons</em>: When you visit the Aereo web site or interact with Aereo, we receive and store certain information.

	<p class="legal"><em>Research Data and Aggregated Data</em>: In an ongoing effort to improve Aereo, Aereo may conduct research and obtain data, either directly or through or from third parties (e.g. Google Analytics), on its individual customers' demographics, interests and behavior based on Personal Data and Other Data that Aereo will provide such third party and Aereo will maintain and use data ("Research Data") resulting from and/or connected to that research.  In addition, Aereo and/or a third party may compile Personal Data and/or Other Data on an aggregated basis ("Aggregate Data").  Aereo may share this Aggregate Data with its affiliates, agents and business partners. This Aggregate Data does not identify you personally.</p>
	
	<h3 class="legal">Additional Information About Our Use of Your Personal Data and Other Data</h3>

For example, if you contact us by email, we will use the Personal Data you provide to answer your question or resolve your problem. Also, if you provide Personal Data in order to obtain access to Aereo, we will use your Personal Data to provide you with access to Aereo. We may also use your Personal Data to monitor your use of Aereo and to contact you regarding your use of Aereo. In addition, Aereo or its authorized service providers, may use financial information or payment methods, such as credit cards, to process payment for any purchases made through Aereo, to protect against fraudulent transactions and otherwise as needed to monitor and manage our business.

Aereo may use your residential address, your Internet protocol address and other technical measures, including geo-location, to verify your location.</p>
	
	<p class="legal">We may also use information that you have provided to us to contact you in the future to tell you about products and functionality that we believe will be of interest to you.

	<h3 class="legal">Children</h3>
	
	<p class="legal">While Aereo provides Aereo Equipment and/or the Aereo Platform by which Members may choose to access broadcast television and other content, our Terms of Use expressly prohibit anyone under eighteen (18) from registering for an Aereo Membership and require that any use of an Aereo Membership by a family member under the age of eighteen (18) be under the direct supervision of their parent or guardian. We do not intentionally seek to collect Personal Data from children under the age of thirteen (13), nor do we knowingly collect Personal Data from children younger than thirteen (13).

If you think that a child under the age of thirteen (13) has provided Personal Data to Aereo, please contact us and we will endeavor to delete that information from our databases.</p>
	
	<h3 class="legal">Our Disclosure of Your Data</h3>
	
	<p class="legal">There are certain circumstances in which we may share your Personal Data and/or Other Data with certain third parties without further notice to you:</p>
