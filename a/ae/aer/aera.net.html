          Research Association (AERA) is committed to maintaining your confidence 
          and trust, and maintains the following privacy policy to protect personal 
          information you provide online. </p>
        <p><strong>Basic Confidentiality Policy</strong><br>
          Where personal information is required for use of the website or in 
          interacting with the website it is AERA policy that information, such 
          as your name, postal and e-mail address or telephone number, is private 
          and confidential. The personal information you provide is stored in 
          a secure location, is accessible only by appropriate staff, and is used 
          only for the purposes for which you provide the information, such as 
          to reply to your request or to send you requested materials. Note: the 
          membership directory is a benefit of membership. The directory’s 
          information is based on that information which members have indicated 
          is publishable and it is available to other members in the Members Only 
          site.</p>
        <p>If you also indicate on our site that you would like to receive announcements 
          and notices from AERA, your personal information will be added to the 
          appropriate AERA mailing list. If at any time you change your mind and 
          would like to add or remove your name from AERA's mailing list, or correct 
          your personal information, you may change this information within the 
          Update Your Record portion of the Members Only site. You may also email 
          us at <a href="mailto:members@aera.net">members@aera.net</a>.</p>
        <p><strong>No Release of Information to Third Parties</strong><br>
          Personal information collected as a function of this website will not 
          be released to third parties except to further the purpose for which 
          you provide the information or if such release is required by law. Note, 
          the membership directory is available to members in the Members Only 
          site. The directory is compiled from information provided by members 
          for reference uses such as searching for and contacting colleagues or 
          for making referrals, etc. </p>
        <p><strong>No Computer Tracking of Identifiable Information</strong><br>
          Our website does not track, collect, or distribute personal information 
          about visitors. We regularly compile aggregate statistics that show 
          the number of visitors to our site, the requests we receive for particular 
          information on our website, and the Internet Service Providers (ISPs) 
          that those requests come from. These aggregated statistics are used 
          by internal AERA technical support staff to improve the website in an 
          ongoing effort to provide better information and services to the public.
