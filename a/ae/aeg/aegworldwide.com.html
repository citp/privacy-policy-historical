<p><strong>Types of information that may be collected</strong></p>

In the process of providing these products and/or services, we require our customers to provide certain personally identifiable information. Specific details may include, but is not limited to the following and may be subject to change:</p>
<ul>
  <li>In the case of contests, promotions,   and/or newsletter registrations: We require   all users and/or customers wishing to   participate in any of our contests, drawings,   sweepstakes, promotions, or newsletters   to complete a Participant Registration   Form. During this registration process   we generate and collect certain personally   identifiable information.</li>
  <li>The personally identifiable information   that may be collected from our customers   in completion of a registration form:   Customer's first name, last name, zip   code, phone number, age and email address.

  <li>The personally identifiable information   that may be collected from our customers   in completion of a product and/or service   purchase: The verifiable personally identifiable   information required includes the customer's   first and last name, first and last name   of the credit card owner, credit card   billing address, credit card number, credit   card expiration date, customer's shipping   address, phone number, and email address. </li>
  <li>If a customer sends us personal correspondence,   such as emails or letters, we may collect   such information into a file specific   to you.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How is information collected</strong></p>
<p> We may collect information from you in several different areas on the Site, including but not limited to those described below:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Registration</strong><br>
    You may be asked first to complete a registration   form and provide personally identifiable   information; you may also be asked to   choose a user ID and password in order   to take advantage of certain features   the Site may choose to offer, including,   but not limited to, Newsletters, Contests,   Forums, Fantasy or other subscription   based services. </li>
  <li><strong>Newsletters and Site Emails</strong><br>
    We may offer free newsletters to share   information with you about the Site, about   us and our affiliates and subsidiaries,   or about our business partners and advertisers   and sponsors. You may receive a newsletter   either by registering for a particular   newsletter or in conjunction with a special   feature or membership for which you have   registered on the Site. You may cancel   your free email subscription by following   the instructions provided on the Site   or, in some instances, in the designated   area of certain newsletters or emails. </li>
  <li><strong> Contests or Sweepstakes</strong><br>
    We may operate contests and sweepstakes   through the Site, which may require registration.   Your personally identifiable information   may be used to contact you for winner   notification, prize delivery confirmation   or other related purposes. We may ask   your permission to allow us to post publicly   some of your information on the Site,   such as on a winners page, in the event   you win a contest or sweepstakes. Except   as required by applicable law, we will   not post your information without your   permission. In some instances, a third   party advertiser or sponsor may operate   or host a contest or sweepstakes on the   Site, and collect your information. In   those cases, where we are not the operator   or host of the contest or sweepstakes,   we have no control over the information   collected and accordingly urge you to   review the advertiser's or sponsor's privacy   policy applicable to the contest or sweepstakes   before participating. </li>
  <li><strong>Surveys or Voting</strong><br>
    From time-to-time we may request personally   identifiable information from you via   surveys or voting polls. Participation   is voluntary and you will have the opportunity   to decide whether or not to disclose information.   At times, you may have to register to   vote or to take part in a survey. </li>
  <li><strong>Cookies</strong><br>
    As with many Websites, the Site uses standard   technology called "cookies,"   which are small data files that are transferred   to your computer when you allow your browser   to accept cookies. Cookies automatically   identify your Web browser to the Site   whenever you visit the Site, and make   using the Site easier for you by saving   your passwords, purchases, and preferences.   By tracking how and when you use the Site,   cookies help us determine which areas   are popular and which are not. Many improvements   and updates to the Site are based on data   obtained from cookies. Accepting cookies   allows you, among other things, to personalize   your experience on the Site. Cookies may   also allow the Site to present to you   advertising which may be of interest to   you. If you do not want information collected   through the use of cookies, you generally   can opt out of providing this information   by turning the cookies off in your browser;   however, some areas of the Site may not   provide you with a personalized experience   if you have disabled the use of cookies. </li>
  <li><strong> IP Addresses and Click-stream Data</strong><br>
    We may collect IP addresses and/or click-stream   data for purposes of system administration   and to report aggregate information to   our advertisers and sponsors. An IP address   is a number that is automatically assigned   to your computer whenever you access the   Internet. Our computers identify your   computer by its IP address. When you request   Web pages from the Site, our computers   log your IP address. <br>
    Click-stream data is information collected   by our computers when you request Web   pages from the Site. Click-stream data   may include such information as the page   served, the time, the source of the request,   the type of browser making the request,   the preceding page view and other such   non-personal information. When analyzed,   this data helps us analyze how visitors   arrive at the Site, what type of content   is most popular, what type of visitors   in the aggregate are interested in particular   kinds of content and advertising, and   the like. </li>
  <li><strong>Transaction Information </strong><br>
    If you order any information from our   Site, buy any of our products or subscribe   for any of the services offered on our   Site, we will ask you to complete an order   form that will request certain information   from you, including financial information   such as a credit card number and expiration   date and general contact, billing and   shipping information. We will use this   information to complete the transaction   that you have requested, i.e., to deliver   the information, products or other services   that you order, and to invoice you. Such   information is collected and stored through   encrypted means for your protection. </li>
  <li><strong>Fantasy Games</strong><br>
    When you register to play Fantasy games,   you may be asked to provide personally   identifiable information.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How we use the information we collect</strong></p>
<p> We internally use personally identifiable information about our customers to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to statistically analyze site usage, to improve our content and product offerings and to customize our site's content and layout. We believe these uses allow us to improve our site and provide better service to our customers. </p>
<p> We may occasionally use a customer's email address and, in rare situations mailing address or phone number, to contact a customer regarding administrative matters or notices.</p>
<p> We may use information in the file we maintain about a customer to resolve disputes and troubleshoot problems.</p>
<p><strong>With whom the information may be shared</strong></p>
<p> Information we collect may be accessed by a variety of parties, depending upon the project for which the information was originally collected, the terms of that engagement, and the policies into or out of which the consumer has opted. From time to time, we may send you offers from AEG, its affiliated properties, and our promotional partners based on the information you have provided us. In addition, we may provide information we collect about you with third party companies regarding promotions, sweepstakes and other opportunities / offers. These third parties are subject to stringent data security and confidentiality requirements. </p>
<p> While we believe this disclosure of your information will result in opportunities that may be of interest to you, you have the right to tell us not to give your information to any third party. If you want AEG to keep all of your information we have collected confidential and not share it with any third party, please either email us or mail your written request to:</p>
<p>Attn: AEG Digital - Privacy Policy<br>
800 West Olympic Blvd<br>
Los Angeles, CA 90015<br>
or email: <a href="mailto:privacypolicy@aegworldwide.com">privacypolicy@aegworldwide.com</a></p>
<p>  Your request must include your name, email address, mailing address and must be signed. (Signature only required for written request sent by regular mail). Please allow six weeks to process your request. After your request has been fulfilled, the only disclosures we will make are those required by law.</p>
<p><strong>What choices do I have about AEG collecting, using, and sharing my information</strong></p>
<p> It is possible for you to use much of our site without giving us any personally identifiable information. When you do register with us or give us personally identifiable information, you will have an opportunity at the time we collect your information -- to limit e-mail communications from AEG and from our third-party partners. You can request at any time that AEG not send future e-mail to you either by unsubscribing from the communication or by contacting us at <a href="mailto:privacypolicy@aegworldwide.com">privacypolicy@aegworldwide.com</a>. Also, as mentioned above, there are ways to limit the information collected through technology -- though some of our features won't work if you decide to do this.</p>
<p><strong>What security precautions are in place to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of your information</strong></p>
<p> We use industry standard efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your personally identifiable information. However, please keep in mind that "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet and/or the World Wide Web.</p>
<p><strong>Chat Rooms, Forums, and Message Boards</strong></p>
<p> The Site may make chat rooms, forums and message boards available to its users. You are not required to provide any personal information when using these areas but you may choose to do so. If you post personal information online, it will be publicly available and you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties. AEG cannot ensure the security of any information you choose to make public in a chat room, forum, or message board. Also, we cannot ensure that parties who have access to such publicly available information will respect your privacy. Please exercise caution when deciding to disclose personal information in these areas.</p>
<p><strong>Links to other Websites</strong></p>
<p> You should be aware that when you are on the Site you could be directed to other sites beyond our control. For example, if you "click" on a banner advertisement, the "click" may take you off the Site onto a different Website. This includes links from advertisers, sponsors and partners that may use the Site's logo as part of a co-branding agreement. These other Websites may send their own cookies to you, independently collect data or solicit personal information and may or may not have their own published privacy policies. If you visit a Website that is linked to our Site, you should consult that site's privacy policy before providing any personal information.</p>
<p><strong>A special note for parents concerning privacy</strong></p>
<p> We do not encourage children to participate in providing us with any personally identifiable information. We ask that children (12 years of age and under) do not submit any personal information to us. If you are a minor under the age of 13 years, please use our services only under the approval and supervision of your parents or legal guardian(s). </p>
<p> We support the guidelines and regulatory requirements provided in the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA):<br>

<p>By providing us with any personal information you expressly and unconditionally release and hold harmless Anschutz Entertainment Group, Inc., X AEG Entity HERE and its subsidiaries, affiliates, directors, officers, employees and agents from any and all liability for any injuries, loss or damage of any kind arising from or in connection with the use and/or misuse of your collected personal information. In addition, while AEG takes efforts to ensure the proper and appropriate use of AEG data provided by AEG to third party companies, promotional partners or vendors, AEG is not liable for any injuries, loss or damage of any kind arising from or in connection with the use and/or misuse of your collected personal information by AEG or the above-mentioned non-AEG entities.</p>
