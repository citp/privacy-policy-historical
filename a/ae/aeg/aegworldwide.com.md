  * The personally-identifiable information that may be collected in an entry or similar form includes, but may not be limited to, customer's first name, last name, zip code, phone number, age and email address. Winners of contests, drawings, sweepstakes, and/or promotions will be required to provide additional personally-identifiable information such as a shipping address and telephone number. If the privacy policy varies for a particular sweepstakes, promotion or feature, that information will be disclosed in the sweepstakes or promotion rules or feature's terms of use.
  * In the case of a ticket or other product and/or service which involves a purchase which is completed on the Site, in order to complete the purchase of a ticket, a product and/or service, an online credit card transaction is required. During this process we generate and collect certain personally-identifiable information.

You may also have the opportunity to permit us to maintain this information in a personal profile for you so you do not have to re-enter the information each time you make a purchase. If a customer sends us personal correspondence, such as emails or letters, we may collect such information into a file specific to you.



**How is information collected?**

We may collect information from you in several different areas on the Site, including but not limited to those described below:

  * **Registration**  
If you register for a service you will be asked to complete a registration form and provide personally-identifiable information; you may also be asked to choose a user ID and password in order to take advantage of certain features the Site may choose to offer, including, but not limited to, newsletters, contests, forums, fantasy games, webcasts, or other subscription based services. 
  * **Newsletters, Site Emails, Mobile Offers**  
We may offer newsletters and/or other communications to share information with you about the Site, about us and our affiliates and subsidiaries, or about our business partners and advertisers and sponsors. You may receive a newsletter either by registering for a particular newsletter or in conjunction with a special feature or membership for which you have registered on the Site. You may cancel your subscription by following the instructions provided on the Site or in the designated area of the newsletters or emails or as specified in a mobile communication.

  * **Contests or Sweepstakes**  
We may operate contests and sweepstakes through the Site, which may require registration in order to enter. Your personally-identifiable information may be used by us to contact you for winner notification, prize delivery confirmation or other promotional purposes. Your entry in the contest or sweepstakes may also result in your being added to our mailing/texting lists as well as those of our promotional partners associated with the contest or sweepstakes. Acceptance of a prize may require you (unless prohibited by law) to allow us to post publicly some of your information on the Site, such as on a winner's page, in the event you win a contest or sweepstakes. In some instances, a third party advertiser or sponsor may operate or host a contest or sweepstakes on the Site, and collect your information. In those cases, where we are not the Sponsor of the contest or sweepstakes, we may have no control over the information collected and accordingly urge you to review the official rules of the contest/sweepstakes as well as the advertiser's or sponsor's privacy policy applicable to the contest or sweepstakes before participating.

  * **Cookies**  
As with many websites, the Site uses standard technology called "cookies," which are small data files that are transferred to your computer when you allow your browser to accept cookies. Cookies automatically identify your Web browser to the Site whenever you visit the Site, and make using the Site easier for you by saving your passwords, purchases, and preferences. By tracking how and when you use the Site, cookies help us determine which areas are popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates to the Site are based on data obtained from cookies.

  * **IP Addresses and Click-stream Data**  
We may collect IP addresses and/or click-stream data for purposes of system administration, to improve our Site, to report aggregate information to our advertisers and sponsors and/or other internal uses related to the Site. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you access the Internet. Our computers identify your computer by its IP address.

If you place an order or subscribe for any of the services offered on our Site, we will ask you to complete an order form that will request certain information from you, including financial information such as a credit card number and expiration date and general contact, billing and shipping information.

  * **Fantasy Games/Webcasts**  
When you register to play fantasy games or participate in webcasts, you may be asked to provide personally-identifiable information. 



**How we use the information we collect?**

We internally use personally-identifiable information about our customers to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to statistically analyze site usage, to improve our content and product offerings and to customize our Site's content and layout. We believe these uses allow us to improve our Site and provide better service to our customers.

We may use a customer's email address and mailing address or phone number, to contact a customer regarding administrative matters or notices, issues with a transaction, satisfaction with the Site and/or our products and services and to provide further information regarding additional events, products and/or services in which we believe the customer would be interested.

We may use information in the file we maintain about a customer to resolve disputes and troubleshoot problems.

**With whom the information may be disclosed.**

Information we collect may be accessed by a variety of parties, depending upon the purpose for which the information was provided and the context in which the information was provided.

If you register with the Site, your information and information related to purchase you make on any of our Sites will be aggregated and maintained as part of your profile and may be accessed or used by us and our clients (the venues) for whom we are providing ticketing services to provide you with information or marketing communications we think you will be interested in.

In order to process your requests we may provide your personally-identifiable information to service providers or other companies who work on our behalf in order, for example, to process the transaction and deliver the tickets or other goods/services you have ordered. When we do so, we use reasonable efforts to assure that they comply with our Privacy Policy and applicable law. When we are acting as a service provider on behalf of a client (a venue), we provide your personally-identifiable information to the client for use, among other things, in connection with identification/verification of purchasers of tickets and event security.

In addition, in the event that we go through an existing or potential business transition, such as a merger, acquisition, liquidation or sale of all or a portion of our assets, customer information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred.

We may, without your consent, access and disclose your personal information, any communications sent or received by you, and any other information that we may have about you as may be permitted or required by law, regulation, rule or court order pursuant to requests from governmental, regulatory or administrative agencies or law enforcement authorities; or to prevent, investigate, identify persons or organizations potentially involved in, or take any action regarding suspected fraud, violations of our Terms of Service, or activity that appears to us to be illegal or we believe may expose us to legal liability. Additionally, we may disclose personal information in situations that we believe to be emergencies involving potential threats to the physical safety or any person or property if we believe that your information in any way relates to that threat.

Finally, if you choose to opt-in by checking off the appropriate box or otherwise notifying us, your information may be provided (by us) to unaffiliated third parties for their use to contact you. Otherwise we will not provide your information to unaffiliated third parties for marketing purposes.
