We don’t need you to register or provide personally-identifiable information to view our site or access much of its content.

Here are the ways we collect personally-identifiable information.

  * **Information collected by automated means**



We may use cookies, web beacons/pixel tags, log files, and other technologies to collect certain information about visitors to our site, use of our online services, and interactions with our emails and online advertisements.

**Google Analytics Demographic and Interest Reporting**

Aegon receives Demographic and Interest Reports from Google, which include aggregated, non-personally identifiable information about our website traffic regarding visitors’ age, gender, and interests. The reports let Aegon see how many of our users visit over a date range, and how their behaviour varies by attribute (e.g., male vs. female). Information regarding these reports is derived by Google from the DoubleClick third-party cookies. This information will not be used for any purpose other than those set out in this Statement. More information on the [DoubleClick cookie](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/2839090?hl=en-GB)  
 

We don’t sell personal information or use your personal data for any purposes other than those outlined, unless you authorise it. The [Protecting Your Personal Information](http://dms.aegon.co.uk/download/8cf4fd76ae71c96bd6fd35c2f3b2d9de) leaflet will give you more detail.

Aegon Investment Solutions Ltd and Scottish Equitable plc are subsidiary companies of Aegon UK plc. They and other Aegon UK plc subsidiary companies may send you marketing information. Please write to Brand and Marketing Media, Aegon, Edinburgh Park, Edinburgh, EH12 9SE if you don't want to receive this.

If we collect medical data, we may use it to assess any claims you make under the plan, and we’ll hold it for as long as we're required to. We may pass it to re-assurers, private investigators, medical professionals and/or healthcare management companies (which would be used to arrange medicals).

We may also use publicly available information during the claims validation process.

We have policies in place, which means that we hold all personal data securely and limit access to those who need to see it. We apply extra security to sensitive personal data, such as medical details.

We’re legally obliged to make information available to regulatory bodies or authorities such as the Financial Conduct Authority or HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC). We may also have to disclose information to comply with money laundering laws and for other purposes, for example detecting crime.

We’ll also share permitted relevant information with anyone acting on your behalf (for example a financial adviser) so they can fully carry out their role as agent.

We may also disclose your information to third party organisations who process data on our behalf. This could include processing information outside the European Economic Area (EEA), for example the USA. However, where such processing takes place, appropriate controls are in place to ensure the protection of your information. Those third party organisations may process and store your personal information abroad and may have to disclose it to foreign authorities to help them in their fight against crime and terrorism

We can receive individual planholders' and/or scheme members’ personal information from, and provide it to, employers, trustees and financial advisers, as long as we have the appropriate authority. For example, they can:

    * request statement of benefits
    * update our records as part of a monthly or yearly renewal of a scheme
    * change their members’ personal information
    * get valuations of policy or membership benefits


  * **How we treat your personal data**



We fully support and follow the principles of Data Protection, as set out in the Data Protection Act (‘the Act’). We make sure that our staff – and those acting on our behalf – obtain, use and disclose personal data lawfully and correctly. We don’t believe we can operate successfully otherwise. It’s also important in making sure everyone we deal with has confidence in us. This policy operates in all of our offices – both in the UK and overseas.

By using appropriate and consistent management and controls, we’ll:

  * meet our legal obligations to specify what we’re using the personal information for in the Scottish Equitable plc Data Protection Notification particulars, which you can find on the [Information Commissioner’s website](http://www.ico.org.uk/) at [www.ico.org.uk](http://www.ico.org.uk/)
  * only collect and process information to the extent that we need it to operate or to comply with a legal requirement
  * make sure the information is accurate and of high quality
  * apply checks to determine how long the information is held for
  * make sure that the people we hold information on can fully exercise their rights under the Act
  * safeguard personal information by taking appropriate technical and organisational security measures
  * make sure that personal data isn’t transferred outside the EEA without suitable safeguards or agreements are in place 

**Your rights under the Data Protection Act**

You have a number of rights under the Data Protection Act, including:

    * the right to get copies of all the personal data that we hold on you, with only a few exceptions
    * the right not to receive direct marketing, for example we may provide you with an opt in or opt-out mechanism depending on the requirements of the site’s Jurisdiction and the site. An opt-in mechanism will provide you the opportunity to positively indicate that you would like us to send you future communications and we will not send you any unless you have opted-in. An opt-out mechanism will provide you the opportunity to indicate that you do not want us to send you such further communications, and if you opt-out we will not send you any. 

Either way, opting-in or opting-out will be up to you and, in addition, if you do not want us to use your personal information for a particular purpose or disclose it to a third party, you may opt out at any time by contacting us as detailed below.

Specific opt-outs may also be provided at the point of collection or along with the communications to you. Please note though, by opting-out, you may not be able to participate in certain activities on our websites.

## Recruitment

We operate an online recruitment portal called iRecruitment through our website.

Aegon UK Corporate Services Limited is the data controller of any information you give us. We’ll only use this information for assessing your application against the selection criteria for the particular position you’ve applied for, and for processing your application throughout that selection process.

We may use internet and social media searches to perform due diligence on candidates in the course of recruitment. Where we do so, we will comply with all applicable data protection, employment and equality legislation.

We’ll treat your personal information in confidence and won’t disclose it to any third parties, except where:

      * permitted by law or by our regulator
      * an agency is used by us as part of the employment screening process, including background checks, criminal history and credit referencing checks
      * you’ve given prior consent
      * we need to share it with companies in the Aegon UK Group as part of the selection and application process 

We’ll keep your CV and the results of any screening processes for 3 months after the conclusion of the recruitment process. If your application is successful, we’ll keep the information and hold it during your employment.

We will not hold your information any longer than we require to, but we may retain some information (for example relating to HMRC records) for up to 6 years following termination of employment. Our Data Protection Policy means that we hold all personal data securely and limit access to those who need to see it. We apply extra security to sensitive personal data, such as medical data and results of criminal checks.
