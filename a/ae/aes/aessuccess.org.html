  <p>The Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency, also conducting operations as American Education Services and FedLoan Servicing ("PHEAA"), is committed to safeguarding the privacy and confidentiality of your personal information.  We are required by Federal law to tell you how we collect, share and protect your personal information.  Please read this Privacy Policy carefully to understand what we do.</p>
  <p>This Privacy Policy applies to individuals whose loans have been made or are owned by <abbr title="Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency">PHEAA</abbr>, or whose loans are guaranteed by <abbr title="Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency">PHEAA</abbr> but owned by another entity.  If your loans are serviced by <abbr title="Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency">PHEAA</abbr>, but owned or guaranteed by a lender or guarantor other than <abbr title="Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency">PHEAA</abbr> we will comply with that lender's or guarantor's privacy policy with respect to personal information about you that we receive through our relationship with that lender or guarantor.</p>
  <h3>Section 1.  Information We Collect and Share</h3>
  <p>We collect and share personal information about you in order to identify you as our customer, to establish and manage customer accounts, to complete customer transactions, to provide information to you about our products and services, and to comply with legal and regulatory requirements.  Examples of the types of personal information that we collect:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your Social Security Number, name, contact information, birth date, assets, and income.</li>
    <li>Your transaction history and account balances.</li>
    <li>Your credit history and credit scores.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We collect personal information about you from sources that include, but are not limited to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Information we receive from you or your representative on applications, promissory notes, forms, and through other communications (for example, when you take out a loan, send us an email, or open an online account on our website).</li>
    <li>Information about your transactions with us or others, including lenders, schools, or the <abbr title="United States">U.S.</abbr> Department of Education (for example, when you make a payment or finish school).</li>
    <li>Information we receive from consumer credit reporting agencies or public records.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We may share all of the information we collect, as described below.</p>
  <h3>Section 2. Disclosure of Personal Information</h3>
  <p>All financial companies need to share their customers' personal information to run their everyday business.  Below, we explain how and why we may share your personal information.</p>
  <p>We do not disclose personal information about our customers or former customers, except as permitted or required by law.  For example, <abbr title="Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency">PHEAA</abbr> shares your personal information in the delivery of our financial products and services to you in the following circumstances:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>When you have authorized the disclosure of information.</li>
    <li>To provide products or services that you request.</li>
    <li>As required by order of court or subpoena, pursuant to state, local, federal, or international statute, regulation or mandate, and in cooperation with law enforcement agencies.</li>
    <li>With consumer reporting agencies.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Additionally, <abbr title="Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency">PHEAA</abbr> sometimes shares your personal information with nonaffiliated vendors that perform services on our behalf, for example, printing services, software programming, or loan collection support.  <abbr title="Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency">PHEAA</abbr> provides these vendors with only the information needed to perform that particular service.  Before representatives of these vendors receive such information, we require that they sign an agreement to keep all personal information confidential.  These vendors may not use this information for their own purposes.</p>
  <p><abbr title="Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency">PHEAA</abbr> may share your information with nonaffiliated vendors that market <abbr title="Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency">PHEAA</abbr> products and services to you.  Generally, we only provide these vendors with customer contact information, although we might provide limited account information in some circumstances, such as account balances or status, payment amount or transaction history.  Such nonaffiliated marketers must agree via contract with <abbr title="Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency">PHEAA</abbr> to keep your information confidential and to use the information only to market <abbr title="Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency">PHEAA</abbr> products and services.</p>
  <p>In compliance with United States Department of Education requirements under the Higher Education Act, <abbr title="Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency">PHEAA</abbr> is required to collect and disclose the Social Security Numbers of applicants for Federal student loans.  The primary use of this information is to verify customer identity, determine program eligibility and benefits, permit the servicing of financial aid, and certify attendance and status at an approved higher education institution.  Disclosure of your Social Security Number is mandatory for participation in Federal student loan programs under the Higher Education Act.  For information on how the Department of Education treats the privacy of Social Security Numbers, please link to the following website to see the Department of Education's privacy policy: <a href="http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/privacy.htm" rel="external"><abbr title="h t t p : / / w w w dot fafsa dot gov / privacy dot h t m">http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/privacy.htm</abbr></a>.</p>
  <p>Finally, consistent with student loan industry practice, <abbr title="Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency">PHEAA</abbr> shares customer information with industry aggregators for the benefit of students.  Such industry aggregators include the National Student Clearinghouse<sup>1</sup>, <abbr title="E L M">ELM</abbr> Resources<sup>2</sup>, and Meteor<sup>™ 3</sup>.</p>
  <p>Consistent with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (<abbr title="C O P P A">COPPA</abbr>), <abbr title="Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency">PHEAA</abbr> will not knowingly collect or retain information submitted by children under the age of 13.  If <abbr title="Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency">PHEAA</abbr> learns that we unknowingly collected personally identifying information from children under 13 years of age, we will immediately take all reasonable measures to delete the information from our computer systems and all other data systems.</p>
  <h3>Section 3. Data Security</h3>
  <p>To protect your personal information from unauthorized access and use, we use security measures that comply with federal law and regulations.  These measures include computer safeguards and secured files and buildings.  We restrict access to nonpublic personal information about you to those employees who we have determined have a legitimate business need for the information in order to provide our products and services.</p>
  <h3>Section 4. Online Privacy Practices</h3>
  <p><abbr title="Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency">PHEAA</abbr> protects the privacy of your personal information on our websites using the same standards and care that we utilize for all <abbr title="Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency">PHEAA</abbr> communications and transactions.</p>
