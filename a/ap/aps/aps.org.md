# Privacy Policy

APS respects the privacy of members, users of its services, and visitors to its various websites and operates according to the following policies.

## Personal Information

Some personal information including addresses, phone numbers, e-mail addresses, and other demographic information is collected for membership, subscriptions and publications, meeting registrations, submission of articles, and other similar transactions. APS takes precautions to protect your individual information from unauthorized use. APS may make internal use of your contact information to inform you of situations or services that may interest you.

The APS online Membership Directory is a service restricted to use by members. It contains basic contact information and membership data. E-mail addresses are not released to outside organizations, except when a vendor performs a service for APS under its supervision. Member postal mailing lists are sold on a carefully screened basis, and only when the mailed material is thought to be of significant interest or benefit. Members may suppress the publication of their personal information in the Membership Directory, decline to receive APS-generated email messages, or request to be excluded from externally sold mailing lists by contacting the Membership Department at [membership@aps.org](mailto:membership@aps.org). Unpublished author or referee information is never sold, and is only used for purposes related to APS, its journals, and/or manuscripts which have been submitted to them.

When you submit credit card transaction information to our site online, we use a secure server with commercial encryption software. When APS utilizes the services of the American Institute of Physics for certain credit card transactions to purchase APS products or services, those transactions are covered by AIP's similar [privacy policy](http://www.aip.org/privacy.html).

## Cookies

A “cookie” is a file a Web site places in your computer for future reference. APS uses cookies to improve some of its services, such as the Meeting Scheduler and the Referee Server. Information supplied through an APS cookie is used only by APS and is not shared with others.

## Server Logs

As you travel through the APS websites, our servers log information about your session. Information logged includes items such as your IP address, what browser you are using, the time and date you visited, how long your session lasted, and what pages you visited. We use this information from our server logs primarily to learn about our visitors as a group. It helps us to improve services on the site and plan for future needs so that we can assure continuity of service. Systematic (“robotic”) downloads of journal material are not permitted, and an individual log may be examined and/or access terminated when this activity is observed. Or, we may check an individual log for editorial purposes or when an individual has reported trouble accessing an APS system.

## Future Changes

APS reserves the right to change this policy in any manner at any time without prior notice. If we make material changes to our privacy policy, these changes will be posted on this page.

## Disclaimer

This privacy policy applies to all American Physical Society websites, but not to websites of any APS Division, Forum, Topical Group or Section. It does not apply to websites operated by organizations or groups who associate themselves in any way with the APS. It does not apply to any other Internet websites, including those that have hypertext links to any APS website.

It is our intent to provide accurate information; however, changes in circumstances after the time of publication may affect the accuracy of information on this site. APS gives no assurance as to the accuracy of any information or advice contained.

We take measures to protect our website but there is no warranty that the APS website will be free of infection by viruses or any other contaminating or destructive properties. The user accepts sole responsibility and risk associated with the use and results of APS website materials, irrespective of the purpose to which such use or results are applied.

APS encourages you to exercise discretion while browsing the Internet. The APS website provides links to other websites which are not controlled by APS. A link from the APS website is not an APS endorsement for any company or organization. APS is not responsible for the accuracy, copyright compliance, legality or decency of material contained on any other website. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our website and to read the privacy statements of each website that collects personally identifiable information.
