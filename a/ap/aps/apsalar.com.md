**Information We Collect Within our Mobile Services, for Publishers**

Apsalar provides the Services to mobile application publishers. If you are a publisher using Apsalar’s Services, Apsalar may access, index, and cache requests made from your applications to our system, including by automated means. In the course of providing these Services, Apsalar collects non-personally identifiable information regarding the behavior and usage patterns of users of mobile applications and other mobile properties operated by participating mobile application publishers. Apsalar also collects certain information about visitors to publishers’ mobile applications that connect to the Apsalar Services. Apsalar will automatically collect and receive information about those visitors such as, but not limited to, carrier provider, IP addresses, Apple’s ID for Advertising (IDFA), Google Android ID and Advertising ID for Android (AIFA), carrier user “ID”, and geo-location information. In this policy, we refer to this non-personally identifiable information, together with other non-personally identifiable information that we obtain from third parties, as “User Data.” Apsalar also supports the Do Not Track flags requested by Apple and Google. Apsalar purges User Data logs after 18 months.

We also analyze the non-personally identifiable User Data collected from various mobile applications. We are aware of the sensitivity of certain types of User Data. We do not collect User Data that we consider sensitive.

While these agents and service providers may have access to your personal information in connection with the performance of services for Apsalar, they may not use such information for any purpose other than providing such services to Apsalar.
