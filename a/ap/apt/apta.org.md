### APTA.org Privacy Policy

**Cookies:**  
Cookies are small files that allow us to track our users' interaction with the Web site. Cookies don't identify the user personally, just the computer used to access the site. APTA's Web sites use session cookies. These files are generated whenever a user accesses the site and they are terminated once the user leaves the site. APTA's Web sites don't use persistent cookies, which have to be deleted manually. If for some reason you don't want your information collected via cookies, you should have the option to disable the cookie function through your Internet browser. However, some areas of the site may require cookies to be enabled. 

**Data Collection:**  
APTA's Web sites (www.apta.org, www.ptbulletin.org, www.ptmagazine.org) do not collect names, e-mail addresses, or any other personal information unless it is voluntarily provided by site visitors. Visitors will be informed when the Web site requires personal information (name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, credit card number and/or other identifying information). APTA will not distribute this information to third-parties.

Data submitted by a user will be used for the express purpose described at the point of collection in APTA's database and for statistical purposes to analyze user behavior. APTA will protect the information provided. APTA does not disclose, give, sell, or transfer personal information with third parties without the site visitor's express permission. If demographic information is given to third parties, only aggregate information will be provided. 

**E-Mail:**  
APTA will make every attempt to protect any personal information submitted to us electronically. However, electronic email is not secure against interception. Any sensitive information submitted to the site is provided at the risk of the sender. If you are concerned that the content of your communication is especially sensitive, you should consider sending it by postal mail instead. 

**Privacy Policy:**  
This privacy policy is subject to change and applies only to information on APTA's Web sites, and not to outside sites linked to by APTA's Web sites. By using APTA's Web sites, you signify your agreement to the terms of our privacy policy. 

**Security:**  
APTA incorporates reasonable safeguards to protect the security, integrity, completeness, accuracy, and privacy of the personal information that we collect. APTA has put in place precautions to protect such information from loss, misuse, and alteration. Only those APTA employees who need access to your information in order to do their jobs are allowed access. Our intent is to honor or exceed any U.S. legal requirements for health information privacy.
