We may from time to time receive information relating to your job application from third parties, such as recruitment agencies, head hunters and parties performing reference checks.

You can also register a profile without applying for a specific position or without releasing your profile in the Candidate Pool (as defined below). 

Please be informed that if you choose to apply for a job with APMT, we may request you to provide information on persons whom you allow us to contact for reference purposes. We will only collect information from such references that is adequate and relevant to assess your qualifications, experience and areas of improvement. 

If you are below the local legal age applicable in your country (16 years in the Netherlands) please make sure to consult your parents/legal guardian before applying for a position with APMT. Please also be informed that APMT requires your parents’/legal guardian’s consent before an employment relationship may be established.

If you are applying for a position where health certification is required by law or internal policy, for example in all positions offshore, you may also be required to participate in a health examination in compliance with applicable local law.

If you are applying for a position where a criminal history record, credit report or visa/work permit etc. is required by law or internal policy, you may be required to provide these as well, in compliance with local law.

APMT is an equal opportunity employer (in accordance with applicable law) and makes all employment-related decisions entirely on merit and qualifications. Consequently, you should only include information relevant for the review of your application, and disregard information such as your race or ethnic origin, your political or philosophical orientation, your religious beliefs, your union memberships or your sexual orientation. If you are applying for a position in the US you will be asked to provide certain specific demographic information in a separate questionnaire due to APMT’s obligation to collect information for equal opportunity compliance purposes.
