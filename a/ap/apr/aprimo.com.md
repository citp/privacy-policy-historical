Profile  
We store information that we collect through Web forms, cookies and log files to create a profile of our users. A profile is stored information we keep on individual users that details their potential interest in our products and services. Consequently, collected information is tied to the users personally identifiable information to provide relevant information and improve the content of our Web site. This profile is used to direct pertinent marketing promotions to the user. At the present time, we do not share your profile with third parties. 

Cookies  
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user's hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. Here is a link to information about cookies: http://www.microsoft.com/info/cookies.htm 

We use cookies to facilitate the filling out of our various Web forms. After you fill out a form, a cookie is set saving your information (name, title, company, address, phone and e-mail) which then pre-populates (i.e. fills out) the pertinent sections of other forms you may be prompted to complete on our Web site. We also use cookies for the password-protected sections of our site. By setting a cookie on our site, users would not have to log in a username and password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. See the "Profile" section. 

In addition, we utilize certain software to analyze the server logs and generate a report about the traffic to www.aprimo.com. These reports are general and we do not utilize a cookie or other means to monitor a user's specific activity or return visits to our site. However, this analysis does provide us with information about the source through which you are originating your connection to the Internet (such as an Internet service provider such as AOL or MSN or your company if you are accessing the Internet through corporate access). 

Log Files  
Like most standard Web site servers we use log files on our Web site. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information. 

In addition, we may use clear gifs in our HTML-based e-mails to let us know which e-mails the recipients have opened. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If users would like to opt-out of these e-mails, please see the Opt-out section. 

**Communications from Aprimo**

Special Offers and Updates

We communicate with our customers on a regular basis to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account. We will reply via e-mail or phone, in accordance with our customer's wishes. 

Disclosure of Personal Information  
Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web site. 

At the present time, we DO NOT otherwise share personal information with other companies, except as is necessary in connection with our efforts to communicate with you. 

Choice/Opt-out  
You are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having your information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for information. For example, our order form has an 'opt-out' mechanism so that if you request information from us and would like the information delivered in a non-electronic format, you can keep your e-mail address off our lists.
