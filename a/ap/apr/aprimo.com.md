# Aprimo Privacy Notice

_Date last revised: February 22, 2017_

Aprimo, Inc. (“Aprimo”) is committed to protecting the privacy of individuals. This Privacy Notice explains what personally identifiable information we collect through our marketing and recruiting websites and software as a service offerings to our customers (the “Sites”) and how we use that information.

 ** _Personally Identifiable Information We Collect and How We Use It_**

Aprimo will collect personally identifiable information (such as your name, mailing address, telephone number, or email address, employer name, employer address or products and operating systems you use) when it is voluntarily submitted to us at the Sites. We will use this information to comply with your request for information or as otherwise disclosed to you at the location on the Sites at which you submit your information. For example, if you request technical support assistance, we need to know who you are, what product you are using and in what computer system environment you are using the product in order to respond to your request as efficiently and effectively as possible. In addition, from time to time, we may refer to your personally identifiable information to better understand your needs and how we can improve our products and services. We may use that information to contact you.

Our customers may transmit your personally identifiable information to us through our software as a service offerings. For example, some of our offerings allow our customers to generate and send marketing communications to end users. We will utilize personally identifiable information transmitted to us to facilitate our requests from our customers. We require that our customers only transmit data to us in accordance with your consent and applicable laws. Nevertheless, if you believe that your personally identifiable information is being misused through the Sites in any way, please contact us at the information below.

We provide links to third party Internet sites strictly as a service to you. Your personally identifiable information is not shared with these third parties. However, Aprimo is not responsible for the privacy practices of third party Internet sites. If you leave the Sites to visit a third party site, you should be sure to read the privacy notice of each Internet site that you visit.

We use standard server side logging to track the number of visitors to the Sites, gather HTTP header information, and generate statistics about your visits to the Sites in various ways. For example, this information is used to generate analytics related to the Sites and for troubleshooting purposes.

Some pages within the Sites may use a technology called “cookies”. A cookie is a token that a server gives to your browser when you access an Internet website. Cookies are capable of storing many types of data. Cookies help provide additional functionality to the Sites or to help us analyze site usage more accurately. In all cases in which cookies are used, the cookie will not collect personally identifiable information except with your explicit permission. However, information gathered from use of cookies may be combined with other data sources to identify you.

The Sites are not intended or designed to attract children under the age of 13. Aprimo does not collect personally identifiable data from any person it knows to be under the age of 13.

 ** _Disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information to Third Parties_**

We will not sell or otherwise transfer the personally identifiable information you provide via the Sites to any third party unless (1) otherwise disclosed to you when you submit your information; (2) in connection with the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of a business division of Aprimo, a line of Aprimo’s business or Aprimo’s entire business, or through merger with another company; (3) to provide needed information to our agents, resellers, partners and contractors who may provide products and/or services to you; (4) as necessary for processing your transactions; or (5) for compliance with possible legal or governmental disclosure requirements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a customer of ours transmits or stores your personally identifiable information at the Sites, that customer may utilize your personally identifiable information in accordance with the consent you provided when it was collected or otherwise in accordance with applicable law.

 ** _Protecting Personally Identifiable Information_**

Aprimo is committed to protecting the personally identifiable information entrusted to us. We have implemented commercially reasonable physical, electronic and administrative procedures designed to safeguard this information from unauthorized access or disclosure. Unfortunately, no data transmitted over or accessible through the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while Aprimo attempts to protect all personally identifiable information, we cannot ensure or warrant that personally identifiable information will be completely secure from misappropriation by hackers or from other nefarious or criminal activities, or in the event of a failure of computer hardware, software, or a telecommunications network. We will notify you in the event we become aware of a security breach involving your personally identifiable information (as defined by the applicable state and federal laws) stored by or for us. By disclosing your email address to us for any reason, you expressly consent to receive electronic notice from us in the event of such a security breach.

 ** _Your California Privacy Rights_**

California law provides that California residents have a right to request businesses to tell them how their personal information has been shared with third parties, if at all, for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes.  To make such a request, please contact us using the information below.

 ** _Do Not Track Signals_**

Certain web browsers and other devices you may use to access the website may permit you to indicate your preference that you do not wish to be “tracked” online.  At this time, the website does not respond to “Do Not Track” signals.
