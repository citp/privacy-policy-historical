Respecting and protecting investor privacy has always been vital to our business. This Privacy Policy describes how Apollo Global Management, LLC (together with its subsidiaries and affiliates "Apollo", "us", "we" or "our") gathers and uses personal information about you when you visit Apollo’s websites that link to this Privacy Policy (including Apollo.com, Apolloic.com, Apolloreit.com, AGMfunds.com, and Apolloalternativeassets.com, and any sites that are automatically redirected to them, collectively, the "Sites"); how we protect and share this information; and the rights you may have in relation to this information. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully, and consult our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/site-services/terms-of-use) for more information about the general terms and conditions regarding your use of the Sites.

In the event that you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, or if you object to our uses of your personal information, please contact our Privacy Office at [privacy@apollo.com](mailto:privacy@apollo.com).

## A. The Types of Information We Collect

When you visit and browse the Sites, you may provide us with information, and we will collect certain information automatically.

**1\. Information You Provide to Us**

In order to access certain services provided via the Sites or to request certain information from Apollo via the Sites, you will be required to provide certain personal information. More

This may include your name, postal address, e-mail address, telephone number, facsimile number, investor status, or other information about yourself. In particular, you may be required to provide a username and password to access certain features. If you choose to not provide us with information, you might not be able to gain access to certain information and services on the Sites, which rely on such information (for example, you will not be able to register for e-mail updates if you do not provide us with an e-mail address, and if you choose not to provide a username and password, we will not be able to provide you with services available through an online account).

**2\. Information We Collect Automatically**

We also collect information about you automatically. More

For example, when you visit the Sites, we collect your IP address, your browser type, your operating system, the pages you view on the Sites, the duration of your visit, the pages you view immediately before and after you access the Sites, and the search terms you enter on the Sites.

We collect this information using cookies, which are small files that a website sends to your computer or device while you are viewing the website, or other technical methods to track visitor usage, including web beacons, which are small pieces of data that are embedded in images on the pages of a website.

We and other companies use cookies and web beacons for a variety of purposes. For instance, when you return to our Sites after logging in, cookies provide information to the Sites so that the Sites will remember who you are. We use web beacons and other technologies to analyze the traffic patterns on the Sites, such as the frequency with which our users visit various parts of the Sites. More

You may be able to have your browser warn you when a cookie is sent, and you may be able to turn off all cookies. You can do this through your web browser settings. Each browser is different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookie settings. If you turn cookies off, you won't have access to many features that may improve your browsing, like the features mentioned above, and some of our services may not function properly.

Other technical methods including web beacons may involve the transmission of information either directly to us or to another party authorized by us to collect information on our behalf. We may also use these technical methods in HTML e-mails that we send visitors to the Sites to determine whether such visitors have opened those e-mails and/or clicked on links in those e-mails.

**3\. Additional Information Collection Practices**

The Sites may contain links to websites operated by third-parties, and your personal information may be collected by those third-parties when you use their websites. More

Should you choose to visit these third-party sites, you should review their privacy policies to ensure you understand and are comfortable with their practices concerning your information. We do not accept, and do disclaim, any responsibility for the privacy policies and information collection, use, and sharing practices of any third-party website (whether or not such site is linked on or to the Sites). These links are provided to you for convenience purposes only, and you access them at your own risk. 

Some of our third-party partners may ask you to provide personal information on their websites and may share such personal information with us, as governed by their respective privacy policies. More

The third-party partners we receive personal information from include web hosting providers. We receive information related to name, occupation, address, and contact information from third party partners. Our use of information received from such a third party will be dictated by the third party’s privacy policy and not this Privacy Policy.

We will link the information that we collect automatically with the information you provide us, and we will combine the information we collect online with information we collect offline or that is collected by third-parties.

### B. How We Use the Information We Collect

We use information we collect about you primarily to: provide services to you in accordance with any contract with you, communicate with you, and manage and improve our services for you and our other investors, as permitted by applicable laws. More

We use your personal information to:

  * respond to your requests for forms, literature, or information, on the basis that it is in our business interests to respond to your requests, and you have requested that we do this;
  * manage and administer customer services, including but not limited to the administration of your customer account. In most cases we do this is to meet our contractual obligations to you. Where there is no such obligation, we have a business interest in keeping our records accurate and up to date, which will assist you when we provide our services;
  * process transactions, as necessary to meet our contractual obligations to you;
  * provide you with the services you have requested. In many cases we will provide these services to comply with contractual obligations to you, but if these services are not governed by any contract, we will use your information in this way to meet our business interests in providing the best service possible;
  * prepare investor disclosure materials. This is necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to meet our interests in managing our business effectively, and for informing you and our other investors about how we are meeting your expectations;
  * improve the Sites and learn about how visitors use the Sites. This is necessary for us to improve the services we offer through the Sites, and benefits you as it helps us make the Sites more usable and appealing;
  * communicate with you about our products and services, including providing you with information about features on the Sites and possible changes to our Privacy Policy or terms of use. If required by applicable law, we will only send these messages on the basis that you have consented, or otherwise it will be to meet our business interests in providing information to our investors about new products and features. You can opt out of receiving marketing communications at any time;
  * comply with legal obligations; and
  * protect our rights, your rights, and the rights of others, as this may be necessary to meet our own high standards of business practice.



We may use information for any purpose if the information does not identify you and cannot be combined with other information accessible to us to identify you. For example, we may prepare aggregated reports about how visitors tend to interact with the Sites for research about the use of the Sites and how the Sites could be improved, from which your interactions with the Sites cannot be singled out.

### C. How We Share the Information We Collect

**1\. In Connection with Third Party Offers**

For example, you may choose to purchase products or services offered by a third-party or elect to receive information or communications from a third-party.

We disclose this information to third-parties for the purposes and on the basis described above (see Section B), for example, to process your transactions and to respond to your requests for information or communications from third-parties.

**2\. Service Providers**

More

We may disclose information when we believe in good faith that such disclosures:

  * are required by law, including, for example, to comply with a court order or subpoena, or in response to a law enforcement agency's request;

We may also share information about you to the extent reasonably necessary to proceed with the consideration, negotiation, or completion of a merger, reorganization, or acquisition of our business, or a sale, liquidation, or transfer of some or all of our assets. More

The above-described disclosures are provided on the basis that they are either necessary to comply with our legal obligations or they are necessary to meet our legitimate interests in managing our business efficiently and for developing future business.

Additionally, we reserve the right to share with third-parties information that does not identify you (and cannot be combined with other information accessible to us to identify you) for any purpose.

### D. The Security Measures We Take to Safeguard Information

The security and confidentiality of the information we collect or receive is extremely important to us, and we take our responsibility to protect this information very seriously. We have implemented commercially reasonable technical, administrative, and physical security measures to protect the information that we collect or receive.

We do not knowingly solicit or collect personal information on the Sites from children under the age of 13.

Third-parties, such as our analytics providers, may collect data that relates to you on the Sites, across time, and over other websites. We cannot control third-parties’ responses to do-not-track signals or other such mechanisms.

In addition, we may transfer your information outside the United States to our affiliates, business partners, and service providers located in other countries. More

In some cases, your personal information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in a country that is not regarded as ensuring an adequate level of protection for personal information under European Union or other applicable laws.
