## E-mail addresses

The software collects e-mail addresses from users who buy our software. These e-mails are used to send license keys and changes in registration. Registered users can change or remove their e-mail addresses by contacting us.  
If you sign up for our newsletter, your email address will be kept confidential, and it will only be used to send you our newsletter. 

## Personal Information

During purchase process, we collect user information. This information is collected by our registration provider - [Plimus](http://www.plimus.com/), trusted e-commerce company, known for their long-term reputation for professionalism and security. They have their own privacy policy. No personal information will ever be shared with another company. 

We (Apowersoft) do not know users' credit card numbers and other sensitive payment information - this data is only available to the secure service of Plimus during the purchase process and they deal with it safely. 

## Cookies and other technologies

As is standard practice on many corporate websites, we uses "cookies" and other technologies to help us understand which parts of our websites are the most popular, where our visitors are going, and how much time they spend there. We also use cookies and other technologies to make sure that our online advertising is bringing customers to our products and services. We use cookies and other technologies to study traffic patterns on our website, to make it even more rewarding as well as to study the effectiveness of our customer communications. And we use cookies to customize your experience and provide greater convenience each time you interact with us.   
As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and click stream data. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We will not use the information collected to market directly to that person. **
