Your **privacy is valued** and the importance of protecting your personal data is recognized. This notice describes the privacy policy of APOTELYT.COM ("the Site") and the treatment of personal information. By visiting the Site, you are accepting and consenting to the practices described in this Privacy Policy Notice. 

Any personal details you submit to the Site, such as your name and email address, will not be used for any other purposes than to contact you in case a message from you requires a reply. The Site will take reasonable technical and organisational precautions to **prevent the loss, misuse or alteration of your personal information**. The Site will securely store any personal information you provide and will not sell it or pass it on to others. 

## First-party cookies 

The Site receives and stores certain types of non-personal information whenever you interact with it. Like many other websites, the Site uses " **cookies** " to save selected data about your internet session, such as IP address and referring page. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that are stored by your Web browser and enable the provision of personalised site features. The Help menu on the menu bar of most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, and how to disable cookies altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the website of its producer. However, because cookies may allow you to take advantage of some of the Site's essential features, it is recommended that you leave them turned on.

## Third-party cookies

Like many other websites, the Site uses **Google Analytics** to monitor and analyse internet traffic. Google Analytics generates statistical and other information about website use, which are stored via cookies on client computers. The information thereby generated is used to create reports that are of interest to webmasters. For example, data about the frequency of visits to the website, the particular pages viewed, and the platform used is collected. These data make it possible to improve a website's design and better tailor its contents to visitor customs and preferences. Google will store and use this information in line with the [Google privacy policy](http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html). If you would like to opt out of Analytics cookies, you can do so by [installing a respective plug-in](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout) to your browser. 

The Site publishes **Google Adsense** advertisements, which are tailored by Google to reflect your interests. To determine the latter, Google will track your behaviour across the web using cookies. You can view, delete or add interest categories associated with your browser using [Google's ads preference manager](http://www.google.com/ads/preferences). You can also completely opt-out of receiving the Adsense partner network cookie. However, this opt-out mechanism uses a cookie, and if you clear the cookies from your browser, your opt-out will not be maintained. To ensure that an opt-out is maintained in respect of a particular browser, you might want to use a respective [Google browser plug-in](https://www.google.com/settings/ads/plugin).

The Site contains plug-ins for the social network **Facebook**. You will recognise Facebook plug-ins by the Facebook logo on the Site. If you click the Facebook "Like" button while you are signed in to your Facebook account, you can link the content of the Site to your Facebook profile.
