        </section>

        <section class="content">
            <p>Network Communications, Inc. is committed to safeguarding your privacy
            online whenever you use any of our Websites, including (but not limited to)
            ApartmentFinder.com. We encourage you to review the following Privacy Policy
            so that you may understand how your personal information will be treated as you
            make full use of our many offerings.</p>

            <strong>What personally identifiable information about me do you collect?</strong>
            <p>We may collect different types of information in several different ways from our
            Websites.</p>

            <p>You may browse our Websites without submitting any personal information. We
            may ask you for personal information at other times, including (but not limited to)
            when you request information about a property, enter a sweepstakes, contest,
            or promotion sponsored by us or one of our partners or you may provide us with
            personal information when you send us a letter or email message, such as if you
            report a problem with our Websites or services. If you contact us, we may keep a
            record of that correspondence.</p>

            <p>From time to time, we also may ask visitors to complete surveys that we use for
            research purposes. Wherever we collect personal information, the information
            you provide will be subject to the terms of this Policy. In addition, we may use
            IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track visitor's movement,
            and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses,
            however, will not be linked to your personally identifiable information.</p>

            <p>Finally, our sites also may contain links and advertisements to other Websites
            that are operated by other companies or persons. Therefore, we do not
            control the privacy policies of those sites. This Policy statement only applies to
            information collected and maintained by us.</p>

            <strong>What are cookies and how do you use them?</strong>
            <p>As part of offering and providing customizable and personalized services, we
            use cookies to store and sometimes track information about you. A cookie is
            a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a Web server and
            stored on your computer's hard drive. Some of these cookie files will be stored
            on your hard drive even after you close your browser and other files may be
            temporary files that will be deleted when you close your Internet browser. We
            will not, however, attempt to read any cookies or files that may be on your
            computer, including cookies that may have been placed on your computer by
            other Websites that you may have visited.</p>

            <strong>Generally, we use cookies to:</strong>
            <p>(1) Remind us of who you are and to access your information in order to permit
            the tailoring of the Websites to better match your interests and/or preferences.
            These cookies will be stored on your computer and may be modified while you browse our sites.<br>
            (2) Estimate our audience size. Each browser accessing one of our Websites is
            given a unique cookie that is then used to determine the extent of repeat usage,
            usage by a visitors, and to help target our services and advertisements based on
            your interests and behavior.<br>
            (3) Track your progress and number of entries in some of our promotions,
            sweepstakes, and contests. When one of the promotions that we host uses
            cookies, the information written to the cookie may be used to indicate the player's
            progress through the promotion, and may be used to track entries, submissions,
            and status in prize drawings.<br>
            (4) Measure certain traffic patterns, such as which areas of our Websites
            you have visited and your visiting patterns. This information, however, is only
            gathered in aggregate form - that is, this aggregated information is not linked
            to any personal information that can identify any individual person. We use this
            research to understand how our visitors' habits are similar or different from one
            another so that we can make each new experience on our sites a better one.
            We may use this information to better personalize the content, banners, and
            promotions that you and other visitors will see on our sites.</p>

            <strong>Third Party Advertisers and Cookies</strong>
            <p>We use third-party companies to serve ads when you visit our Websites. These
            companies may use information (not including your name, address, email
            address or telephone number) about your visits to our Websites in order to
            provide advertisements on our Websites, other sites and other forms of media
            about goods and services that may be of interest to you. If you would like more
            information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this
            information used by these companies, please click here.</p>

            <strong>How do you use my information?</strong>
            <p>Our primary goal in collecting personally identifiable and other information is to
            provide you, the visitor, with a customized experience on our Websites. This
            includes personalization services and many other types of services. By knowing
            a little about you, we are able to deliver more relevant advertisements and
            content, and hence a better and more valuable service, to you. For example, the
            more we know about the type of home or community in which you are interested,
            the more appropriate information we can deliver to you.</p>

            <p>In addition, we do research on our visitors' demographics, interests, and
            behavior based on the information provided to us when requesting more
            information, during a promotion, from our server log files, or from surveys. We
            do this to better understand and serve our visitors. This research is compiled
            and analyzed on an aggregated basis and may be shared with advertisers or
            business partners. We also collect IP addresses for system administration and to
            report aggregate, non-personally identifiable information to our advertisers and
            partners. For this purpose, no personally identifiable information will be linked to
            any information that can identify any individual person.</p>

            <strong>Who besides you is collecting my information?</strong>
            <p>When you are on any of our Websites and are asked for personal information,
            you are sharing that information with us alone, unless it is specifically stated
            otherwise. Some of our services, however, may be offered in conjunction
            with a partner company. In order to provide this co-branded service to you, it
            may be necessary for us to share your personal information with our partner
            company. For example, if you want to receive information about an apartment
            from a community, we may send your personally identifiable information to that
            community so that it can fulfill your request.</p>

            <p>In addition, promotions that run on our Websites also may be sponsored by
            companies other than us or may be co-sponsored by us and another company.
            Some or all data collected during a promotion may be shared with the sponsor.
            If data from your entry will be shared, you will be notified prior to the time of data
            collection. You can decide not to participate in the promotion if you do not want to
            share your information.</p>

            <strong>What happens when I click on a link from one of your sites?</strong>
            <p>As a convenience, our Websites contain links and advertisements to other sites
            that may not be controlled by, or affiliated or associated with, us. Accordingly,
            we do not make any representations concerning the privacy practices or terms
            of use of such sites, nor do we control or guarantee the accuracy, integrity,
            or quality of the information, data, text, software, music, sound, photographs,
            graphics, video, messages, or other materials available on such sites. We
            encourage you to view the privacy policy and terms of use of any sites that you
            may visit. Additionally, the inclusion or exclusion of links or advertisements on
            our sites does not imply any endorsement by us of the sites, the site's provider,
            or the information on the sites.</p>

            <p>Specifically, please be aware that our partners, advertisers, and other Websites
            that have links on our sites may collect personally identifiable information about
            you. The information practices of those partners, advertisers, and other Websites
            linked to our sites are not covered by this Policy.</p>

            <strong>With whom do you share my information?</strong>
            <p>As a general rule, we will not disclose any of your personally identifiable
            information except when we have your permission or under special
            circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that the law requires it or
            as specifically set forth in this Policy. Please see the Terms of Use for each of
            our products and services for more detailed information about how your personal
            information may be shared. The following describes some of the ways that your
            information may be disclosed.</p>

            <p>Many promotions also may offer opportunities for you to request additional
            information from sponsors. By requesting more information, you give us
            permission to transfer your personal information to the sponsor so they can fulfill
            your request.</p>

            <p>From time to time, you may request specific information about a property or you
            may be offered the opportunity to receive materials or special offers from third
            parties. If you opt to receive information from these third parties, we will share
            your name, address, telephone number, if requested by you or provided, and
            email address with them and our local representatives.</p>

            <p>Third Party Data and Aggregated Data: Under confidentiality agreements, we
            may match visitor information with third-party data. Also, we disclose aggregated
            visitor statistics (for example, "25% of our visitors use mobile devices") in order to
            describe our services to current and prospective partners, advertisers, and other
            third parties, and for other lawful purposes. As noted above, this aggregated
            information will not be linked to any personally identifiable information that can
            identify any individual person.</p>

            <p>Other: We may also disclose your personally identifiable information in special
            cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is
            necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be
            violating our Terms of Use or may be causing injury to or interference with (either
            intentionally or unintentionally) our rights or property, the rights of our visitors or
            other parties, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. We may
            disclose or access your personally identifiable information when we believe in
            good faith that the law requires it and for administrative and other purposes that
            we deem necessary to maintain, service, and improve our products and services.
            We also may disclose your personally identifiable information in connection with
            the sale of our company's business or assets.</p>

            <strong>What are my choices regarding your collection, use, and distribution of my
            information?</strong>
            <p>We may, from time to time, send you email regarding our products and services.
            In addition, if you indicated upon requesting more information that you are
            interested in receiving offers or information from our partners and us, we may
            occasionally send you direct mail about products and services that we feel may
            be of interest to you. Only we (or companies with whom we contract and who
            agree to keep your information confidential) will prepare these direct mailings
            and only if you indicated that you do not object to receiving these offers. If you
            do not want to receive or continue receiving such mailings, simply tell us at
            <a href="mailto:webmaster@apartmentfinder.com">webmaster@apartmentfinder.com</a>.</p>

            <p>On some of our promotions, we will ask for your email address in order to update
            you on your score, entries, and status in prize drawings. When you participate
            in these types of promotions, you automatically receive promotion-related email,
            unless you choose the no-email option that some promotions offer. Occasionally
            these promotion-related email messages may include targeted advertisements.
            You may also be required to provide personally identifiable information to collect
            your prize when you win one of our promotions or contests.</p>

            <p>You also have choices with respect to cookies. By modifying your Internet
            browser preferences, you have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified
            when a cookie is set, or to reject all cookies. If you choose to reject all cookies
            you may be unable to use some of our services, including services that require
            registration in order to participate.</p>

            <p>If you are participating in one of our promotions and you wish to update your
            email address for the promotions mailing list or to stop participating in one of the
            promotions, please contact us at <a href="mailto:webmaster@apartmentfinder.com">webmaster@apartmentfinder.com</a>.</p>

            <strong>How do you protect my personal financial information?</strong>
            <p>Keeping your personal financial information private is vitally important to us.
            Knowing that you use certain services or features may help us to offer you
            better and more relevant content and advertisements. But as with all personally
            identifiable information, we do not make this available to any third parties except
            as set forth in this Policy. Any visitor statistics that we may provide to prospective
            advertisers or partners regarding financial information are provided in the
            aggregate only and do not include any personally identifiable information linked
            to any individual visitor.</p>

            <strong>What about my child's privacy?</strong>
            <p>The safety of children is very important to us. We maintain general audience
            Websites that are designed for use by adults and that comply with the Children's
            Online Privacy Protection Act. Specifically, we do not knowingly collect
            information from visitors under age 13.</p>

            <p>We encourage parents to create a safe place for children on the Internet.
            Parental control protections (such as computer hardware, software or filtering
            services) are commercially available that may assist parents in limiting access
            to content that may be harmful to minors. We also encourage parents to monitor
            their child's use of the Internet and teach them not to disclose any personally
            identifiable information (including their age, appearance, school, grade, etc.)
            about themselves in emails, chat rooms, or on other sites, except with your
            knowledge and approval.</p>

            <strong>Where can you get additional information about us or our Websites?</strong>
            <p>Our Websites are owned and operated by:</p>

            <p>Network Communications, Inc.<br>
