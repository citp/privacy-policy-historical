You can get additional details by clicking on the highlighted links. Also, please read our Children's privacy policy to learn about how we treat information collected from children.<br><br>

Questions regarding our privacy policy should be directed to:<br><br>

staff@Apacheclips.com<br><br>

What Does the Apacheclips Privacy Policy Cover?<br><br>


This privacy policy applies to web pages ending in Apacheclips.com that contain a link to this privacy policy at the bottom of the web page. Inclusion of the Apacheclips logo at the top of a web page does not necessarily mean that this privacy policy applies. Be sure to check the URL that you link to from Apacheclips web pages to determine whether this privacy policy applies.

What Information Does Apacheclips Collect From You?<br><br>


You can visit our site and use most of our services without having to tell us who you are or reveal any personally identifiable information to us. There are, however, a few instances where we do collect personally identifiable information in order to fulfill your request.<br><br>

Whenever you visit Apacheclips, our web server logs automatically receive and record anonymous information from your web browser including your IP Address, Apacheclips cookie information, the Apacheclips page(s) you request, the time spent on each web page and any search terms you query.<br><br>

Apacheclips uses this anonymous information to customize your experience on our site, to show you more relevant advertising messages, and to improve our services in general. This information allows other users to benefit from the quality searches you perform, ultimately receiving the most relevant, pertinent information. We ordinarily do not attempt to link this information to a specific person.<br><br>

When you register to become a Member of the Apacheclips website, Apacheclips collects certain information such as your e-mail address, and your domain URL (collectively, "Membership Information"). In addition, we may collect survey responses or other information regarding our users' interests and preferences.<br><br>

Apacheclips will not distribute, sell or rent any of the personal information about you to other people or nonaffiliated companies except to enable the provision of services or products you have requested or when we have your permission to do so.<br><br>

We encourage you to always remain aware of this possibility. Apacheclips encourages you to use common sense and be cautious about what information you may provide on-line, whether through our websites or elsewhere on the Internet.<br><br>
