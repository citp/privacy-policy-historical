# APA Privacy Statement

The American Psychological Association (APA) is committed to maintaining your confidence and trust, and maintains the following privacy policy to protect personal information you provide online. 

Basic Confidentiality Policy  
It is APA policy that personal information, such as your name, postal and e-mail address or telephone number, is private and confidential. The personal information you provide is stored in a secure location, is accessible only by appropriate staff, and is used only for the purposes for which you provide the information, such as to reply to your request or to send you requested materials. 

If you also indicate on our site that you would like to receive announcements and notices from the APA, your personal information will be added to the appropriate APA mailing list. If at any time you change your mind and would like to add or remove your name from the APA's mailing list, or correct your personal information, please email us at [webmaster@apa.org](mailto:webmaster@apa.org)

No Release of Information to Third Parties  
Personal information will not be released to third parties except to further the purpose for which you provide the information or if such release is required by law. 

No Computer Tracking of Identifiable Information  
Our web site does not track, collect or distribute personal information about visitors. We regularly compile aggregate statistics that show the number of visitors to our site, the requests we receive for particular information on our web site, and the Internet Service Providers (ISPs) that those requests come from. These aggregated statistics are used by internal APA technical support staff to improve the website in an ongoing effort to provide better information and services to the public.
