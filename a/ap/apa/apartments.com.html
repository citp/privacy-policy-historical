    <div><h1>Privacy Statement</h1><br><p>The Privacy Statement (the “Statement”) that follows describes the collection, use and disclosure of information practices by Apartments.com and its affiliates (“us” or “we”) in connection with the operation of our websites www.apartments.com, www.apartmenthomeliving.com,
    and our related mobile applications, (collectively, the “Site”). This Statement applies to the national version of Apartments.com as well as to any other versions or pages of Apartments.com that we operate, including a version of the Site that you
    may have arrived at from a distribution partner’s website.
</p><p>This Statement does not describe the collection, use and disclosure of information through means other than the Site (e.g., offline) or the collection, use and disclosure practices of any third party, including Apartments.com’s distribution partners.
    For information on a third party’s information collection, use and disclosure practices, please review the privacy policy on the applicable third party’s website. Also, please note that this Site may contain links to other websites. We are not responsible
    for the websites, content or privacy practices of any third party. By using this Site, you acknowledge that you have read this Statement and agree that you are bound by Terms of Service, which form a legally binding contract between you and us.
</p><p>The policy that follows is applicable to our information collection, use and disclosure practices.
</p><h2>Collection of Personally Identifiable Information</h2><p>You are not required to provide any personally identifiable information to visit the Site. We automatically collect Usage Data (as described below) and may collect ZIP codes and other information in connection with your use of the Site (e.g., the type
    of apartment you are looking for). We collect personally identifiable information only when you provide it. You may be required to provide personally identifiable information to use certain services. In addition, you may submit personally identifiable
    information in other ways, including: (a) participating in online surveys, promotions, contests and sweepstakes; (b) subscribing to newsletters, editorial content, or promotional content sent via email (which have opt-out instructions if you wish
    to unsubscribe); (c) submitting reviews or other content to the Site; and (d) in connection with other products, services, features, or requests made available through the Site. We also publish toll-free phone numbers for many of the apartment listings
    on the Site. By dialing one of these phone numbers, you consent to the Site or a service provider operating on the Site’s behalf recording the date, time and length of your call and the phone number from which the call originated, along with the call
    itself and other information that may be captured. Any Usage Data and/or personally identifiable information resulting from such calls may be used as described in this Statement, including for follow up marketing purposes. The types of personally
    identifiable information collected will depend on the nature of the submission or the features of the Site used, but could include your name, address, phone number, and/or email address.
</p><h2>Passive Information Collection</h2><p>The Site automatically collects information and may also customize your visit through technical means, including the following:
</p><ol><li><strong>Cookies</strong>: Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer’s hard drive by computers (or servers) to identify your computer.</li><li><strong>Web Beacons</strong>: Web beacons (also known as pixel tags, Internet tags, clear GIFs, or single-pixel GIFs) are electronic images embedded into a Web page. </li><li><strong>IP Address Logs</strong>: Apartments.com, also logs Internet Protocol (IP) addresses – the location of your computer on the Internet.</li></ol><p>Cookies allow us to recognize you when you visit the Site, to personalize your experience and generally to serve you better. For example, if you enter your name, address or ZIP code on one of the Site’s forms, it may be stored in a cookie so you do not
    have to enter it again on other forms on the Site. Cookies and Web beacons (which may be placed by us or a third party tracking utility partner) can tell us what advertising you have seen on the Site, which allows us to offer you a more diverse selection
    of advertising information and may also be used together to measure the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns. Cookies, Web beacons and IP addresses are also used to compile data regarding Site usage (what Web site you came from, what pages of
    the Site you visit, how long you were on the Site, what type of browser you are using, what Web site did you go to, etc.). This type of tracking does not identify you personally. Web beacons may also be included in emails sent by the Site to determine
    when and if such emails are opened or forwarded. You can disable cookies or otherwise manage them through tools provided with your browser software and with third-party software packages. If you turn off cookies, many of the Site’s features will not
    work as well or at all. Anonymous information regarding usage of our Site and services that is collected and/or aggregated by or on behalf of Apartments.com through the use of such technical means or otherwise is referred to in this Statement as <strong>“Usage Data.”</strong> The use of third party cookies is not covered by our privacy policy. We do not have access or control over these cookies.
</p><h2>Collection of Information by Third Parties</h2><p>As noted above, Apartments.com distribution partners and other third party vendors may collect information about you when using the Site through the use of cookies and Web beacons. For example, third-party advertising companies, such as Google, use cookies
    to serve advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you across the Internet based on your past visits to the Site and other websites. The Site also uses third-party vendors to collect statistical information regarding Site
    usage. These third-party vendors, such as Amazon, may note some of the pages you visit on the Site through the use of Web beacons or pixels. Amazon may place and use 3 pixels on the Site to show interest-based ads on websites across the Internet.
    In the course of serving advertisements to you, these third-party advertising companies may also place or recognize a unique “cookie” on your computer to allow them to recognize Web beacons and otherwise improve advertising effectiveness. The Google
    Analytics feature implemented and used on this Site includes remarketing display advertising where Google uses a cookie to remember information about your visit and deliver more relevant ads. In addition, the Site may share statistical and behavioral
    data about visitors to our Sites with these third-party advertising companies for the purpose of managing and targeting advertisements on the Site and/or on other websites. Visitors can opt-out of Google’s use of cookies by visiting Google’s Google’s
    <a href="https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated?hl=en" target="_blank">Ad Settings</a> Visitors can also opt-out of receiving interest-based ads from Amazon by visiting the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/adprefs">Amazon Advertising Preferences page</a> &nbsp;or by visiting the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">Digital Advertising Alliance’s opt-out page</a>.

    a request that you make (e.g., in order to send you apartment information you have requested, we will share your contact information with a participating Site property owner and/or management company). </p><p>To communicate with you regarding the Site service (e.g., the Site may send you emails or call you to confirm an apartment availability inquiry or to notify you that you have received a lead regarding an apartment you have advertised or to request that
    you participate in a survey).
</p><p>To send promotional materials, newsletters, or other content via email, targeted advertising, or otherwise, unless you have indicated that you do not wish to receive such materials.
</p><p>To improve your user experience.
</p><p>To manage its relationships with its distribution partners, customers, and other third parties to which the Site may disclose personally identifiable information pursuant to this Statement (e.g., to provide reporting to customers, to provide customer
    support, and to resolve disputes).
</p><p>For Site administration, analysis, research, development, optimization and other internal purposes, including, without limitation, to compile Usage Data.
</p><p>Usage Data: Usage Data is used by the Site for administrative, analytical, research, optimization and other purposes. For example, the Site may use statistical analyses of Usage Data in order to measure interest in the various areas of the Site, for development
    purposes and to inform advertisers and partners in aggregate and anonymous terms about consumers who click on their advertising or other messages. IP Addresses are also used for systems administration and troubleshooting purposes.
</p><p>With respect to promotional materials and newsletters that the Site may send via email from time to time, the Site will not continue to send you such communications if you ask us not to by following the unsubscribe instructions in each promotional email
    from the Site or by a request sent to <a href="mailto:unsubscribe@apartments.com">unsubscribe@apartments.com</a>. However, you agree that the Site may send to you, and you cannot opt out of, communications of a transactional or relationship nature,
    including, but not limited to, communications regarding fraudulent or illegal activity, account status, changes to this Statement or the Site’s Terms of Service, as well as communications to confirm, fulfill and follow up on your registration, service
    or a request submitted through the Site.
</p><h2>Information Sharing</h2><p>The Site may share personally identifiable information that you provide with third parties in the following cases: Distribution partners. The Site may share your personally identifiable information with its distribution partners on the condition that
    such partner’s disclosure and use of the information is consistent with this Statement.
</p><p>Requests. The Site maintains relationships with third party providers for some of the products and services offered through the Site. If you request information or services through the Site, you agree that the Site may share personally identifiable information
    as may be necessary to provide such information to or perform such services for you. In some cases, the information that you provide through the Site may be collected directly by a third party or its designee (e.g., through forms hosted by such third
    party or on a page framed with the Site’s branding). Personally identifiable information also may be shared with the specific third parties that can respond to your requests in the form of reporting and other follow-up communications. The subsequent
    use or disclosure of any information collected by or provided to third parties is subject to their privacy policies and practices.
</p><p>Direct Marketing. Except as provided herein, it is the Site’s policy not to disclose personally identifiable information of our customers to third parties specifically for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. If you are 18 years of age or older
    and have affirmatively agreed to receive third party direct marketing materials, the Site may share your personally identifiable information with third parties for direct marketing purposes. Although the Site will endeavor to notify all third-party
    direct marketers that the information provided to them is confidential, the subsequent use or disclosure of information is subject to those third parties’ privacy policies and practices. Service Providers. The Site works with third parties that provide
    services on its behalf. Examples include providers of analytical, development, promotional, research, review moderation, and other services. For example, the Site may ask that a third party conduct an online survey or sweepstakes or send newsletters
    or advertising on its behalf. In such cases, the Site requires that the third party maintain your personally identifiable information as confidential and use the information only to perform the services specified by the Site and not for their own
    promotional purposes.
</p><p>Other. The Site expressly reserves the right to release any personally identifiable information or other information you provide to third parties under the following circumstances: (a) when required by law or legal process, (b) to investigate and/or take
    action against illegal activity, suspected abuse, or unauthorized use of the Site’s services, (c) to protect the property or safety of our users or others, (d) to enforce our Terms of Service and (e) in connection with any sale or other transfer of
    ownership of all or a part of Apartments.com or any of its businesses. If you make any personally identifiable information publicly available on the Site (e.g., by posting a listing which contains personally identifiable information), anyone may see
    and use such information and we are not responsible for such use. The Site reserves the right to share any personally identifiable information you post on the Site with third parties with your prior consent. To the extent the Site does so, the subsequent
    use and disclosure of such information is subject to the privacy policies and practices of those third parties.
</p><p>Please note that the messages that the Site sends to you to confirm, fulfill, or follow up on a request may incidentally include promotional material or other content from the Site or its partners. In the case of these messages, the Site is not sharing
    your personally identifiable information with those third parties. The Site reserves the right to share Usage Data with any third party for any reason.
</p><h2>Mobile Applications</h2><p>Location Information. Your location is obtained from the mobile device or the network, or directly from you, and is used to search for information you may need – including local searches for rental properties. When we execute such searches on your behalf
    we do not transfer your identity or personally identifiable information to third parties, other than the rental property owners. This information is not used to create a profile about you or your activities. Your location is only stored in the app
    if you save your location (rental property) searches and may be deleted by you by clearing your search history. Location coordinates are shared with our geocoding service provider (such as Google Maps) only to perform the task of providing maps and
    directions per your request. Other information about your device. We collect non-personally identifiable information from your mobile device in order to provide our services to you. Information may include device type and mobile service carrier. No
    information, including location information, is shared with any third parties for marketing purposes. Our apps do not interact or share information with any other applications installed on your mobile device.
</p><h2>Add a Listing Terms of Service</h2><p>If you elect to use the Site’s Free Listing service to advertise a property, it is important to note that any information you choose to include in your listing may be made publicly available via the Site and other media in which the Site listings are
    published, including affiliate sites. For example, you may include a phone number and/or an email address to allow users to contact you regarding your listing. As such, you may receive unsolicited phone calls and emails from third parties, even after
    your listing is no longer on the Site. Except for required information, you should not include any contact or other information in your listing that you do not want other parties to see or use. If you wish to access, verify the accuracy of, or change
