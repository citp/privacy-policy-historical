            <h3 align="center"><strong>Collection of Personally Identifiable Information</strong></h3>
            <p>You are not  required to provide any personally identifiable information to visit the Site. CV  &nbsp;automatically collects Usage Data (as  described below) and may collect ZIP codes and other information in connection  with your use of the Site(e.g., the type of apartment you are looking for). We collect  personally identifiable information only when you provide it. You may be  required to provide personally identifiable information to use certain  services.&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, you may submit personally identifiable  information in other ways, including: (a) participating in online surveys,  promotions, contests and sweepstakes; (b) subscribing to newsletters, editorial  content, or promotional content sent via email (which have opt-out instructions  if you wish to unsubscribe); and (c) in connection with other products,  services, features, or requests made available through the Site. We also  publish toll-free phone numbers for many of the properties that list apartments  for rent on the Site. If you dial one of these phone numbers, the Site or a  service provider operating on the Site’s behalf may record the date, time and  length of your call and the phone number from which the call originated, along  with other information that may be captured. Any Usage Data and/or personally  identifiable information resulting from such calls may be used as described in  this Statement, including for follow up marketing purposes. The types of  personally identifiable information collected will depend on the nature of the  submission or the features of the Site used, but could include your name,  address, phone number, email address and credit card information. In the event  that you purchase an ad in a print/online package through a newspaper  Affiliate, the Affiliate is required to share your name, phone number and email  address with CV in order to allow us to process and maintain your ad.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

              <br>
              <strong>Cookies:</strong> Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer's hard drive by  computers (or servers) to identify your computer.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Web Beacons:</strong> Web beacons (also known as pixel tags, Internet tags, clear GIFs, or  single-pixel GIFs) are electronic images embedded into a Web page.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>IP Address Logs:</strong> CV also logs Internet Protocol (IP) addresses— the location of your computer on  the Internet.</p>
            <p>Cookies allow CV to  recognize you when you visit the Site, to personalize your experience and  generally to serve you better. For example, if you enter your name, address or  ZIP code on one of the Site's forms, it may be stored in a cookie so you do not  have to enter it again on other forms on the Site. Cookies and Web beacons can  tell us what advertising you have seen on the Site, which allows CV to offer  you a more diverse selection of advertising information and may also be used  together to measure the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns. Cookies,  Web beacons and IP addresses are also used to compile data regarding Site usage  (what Web site you came from, what pages of the Site you visit, how long you  were on the Site, what type of browser you are using, what Web site did you go  to, etc.). This type of tracking does not identify you personally.&nbsp; Web beacons may also be included in emails  sent by the Site to determine when and if such emails are opened or forwarded.  You can disable cookies or otherwise manage them through tools provided with  your browser software and with third-party software packages. If you turn off  cookies, many of the Site's features will not work as well or at all. Anonymous  information regarding usage of our Site and services that is collected and/or  aggregated by or on behalf of Apartments.com through the use of such technical  means or otherwise is referred to in this Statement as "<strong>Usage Data</strong>."</p>
            <p><strong>Flash  LSOs:</strong> We use local  shared objects, also known as Flash cookies, to store your preferences such as  volume control or high game score, or display content based upon what you view  on our site to personalize your visit.&nbsp; Third Parties, with whom we  partner to provide certain features on our site or to display advertising based  upon your Web browsing activity, use Flash cookies to collect and store  information.</p>
            <p>Flash cookies are different from browser  cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored.&nbsp; Cookie  management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies.&nbsp;  To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies click  here:&nbsp; </p>

For example, the Site may use statistical  analyses of Usage Data in order to measure interest in the various areas of the  Site, for development purposes and to inform advertisers and partners in  aggregate and anonymous terms about consumers who click on their advertising or  other messages. IP Addresses are also used for systems administration and  troubleshooting purposes. <br>
              <br>
With respect to promotional materials and newsletters that the Site may send  via email from time to time, the Site will not continue to send you such  communications if you ask us not to by following the unsubscribe instructions  in each promotional email from the Site or by a request sent to <a href="mailto:movinghelp@apartments.com">movinghelp@apartments.com</a>. However, you agree that the  Site may send to you, and you cannot opt out of, communications of a  transactional or relationship nature, including, but not limited to,  communications regarding fraudulent or illegal activity, account status, changes  to this Statement or the Site’s Terms of Service, as well as communications to  confirm, fulfill and follow up on your registration, service or a request  submitted through the Site. </p>
            <h3 align="center"><strong>Information Sharing</strong></h3>
            <p>The Site may  share personally identifiable information that you provide with third parties  in the following cases:</p>
            <ol start="1" type="1">
              <li><strong>Affiliates.</strong> The Site may share your       personally identifiable information with Affiliates on the condition that       the Affiliates' disclosure and use of the information is consistent with       this Statement. </li>
              <li><strong>Requests.</strong> The Site maintains relationships       with third party providers for some of the products and services offered       through the Site.&nbsp; If you request information or services through the       Site, you agree that the Site may share personally identifiable       information as may be necessary to provide such information to or perform       such services for you. For example, if you request information about a       unit or floor plan for a property advertised on the Site, Apartments.com       will share the information collected through such request with that       property (or its designee) and any other parties providing that listing       (e.g., if a third party management company provides the listing to us on       behalf of the property or our “Feedback” service provider may collect       information and ideas on our behalf).&nbsp; In some cases, the information       that you provide through the Site may be collected directly by a third       party or its designee (e.g., through forms hosted by such third party or       on a page framed with the Site’s branding).&nbsp; Personally identifiable       information also may be shared with the specific third parties that can       respond to your requests in the form of reporting and other follow-up       communications. The subsequent use or disclosure of any information       collected by or provided to third parties is subject to their privacy       policies and practices.&nbsp; </li>
              <li>&nbsp;<strong>Sweepstakes/Promotions.</strong> In the event that you participate in a sweepstakes, contest, or other       promotion on the Site that is sponsored by the Site and a third party, we reserve       the right to share personally identifiable information collected in       conjunction with the sweepstakes, contest or promotion with the third       party. After the information is provided to such third parties, the       subsequent use or disclosure of such information is subject to those third       parties’ privacy policies and practices. </li>
              <li><strong>Direct Marketing.</strong> Except as provided herein, it is       the Site’s policy not to disclose personally identifiable information of       our customers to third parties specifically for the third parties' direct       marketing purposes. If you are 18 years of age or older and have       affirmatively agreed to receive third party direct marketing materials, the       Site may share your personally identifiable information with third parties       for direct marketing purposes. Although the Site will endeavor to notify       all third-party direct marketers that the information provided to them is       confidential, the subsequent use or disclosure of information is subject       to those third parties’ privacy policies and practices. </li>
              <li><strong>Service Providers.</strong> The Site works with third       parties that provide services on its behalf.&nbsp; Examples include       providers of analytical, development, promotional, research, Live Chat,       and credit card processing and other services. For example, the Site may       ask that a third party conduct an online survey or sweepstakes or send       newsletters on its behalf. Similarly, if you make a payment to the Site by       credit card, the Site will share your personally identifiable information       and credit card information with a third party in order to process credit       card transactions, or such information may be collected directly by the       credit card processing service provider on the Site’s behalf. In such       cases, the Site requires that the third party maintain your personally       identifiable information as confidential and use the information only to       perform the services specified by the Site and not for their own       promotional purposes. . </li>
              <li><strong>Email List Opt-Outs.</strong> In the event the Site sends       promotional emails to you on behalf of third-party advertisers and you inform       the Site you wish to opt out of future promotional emails from a       particular third party, the Site will share your email address with that       third party so the third party may add you to its opt-out lists. </li>
              <li><strong>Other.</strong> The Site expressly reserves the       right to release any personally identifiable information or other       information you provide to third parties under the following       circumstances: (a) when required by law or legal process, (b) to       investigate and/or take action against illegal activity, suspected abuse,       or unauthorized use of the Site ’s services, (c) to protect the property       or safety of our users or others, (d) to enforce our Terms of Service and       (e) in connection with any sale or other transfer of ownership of all or a       part of CV or any of its businesses.&nbsp; If you make any personally       identifiable information publicly available on the Site (e.g., by posting       a listing which contains personally identifiable information), anyone may       see and use such information and Apartments.com is not responsible for       such use.&nbsp; The Site reserves the right to share any personally       identifiable information you post on the Site with third parties with your       prior consent.&nbsp; To the extent the Site does so, the subsequent use       and disclosure of such information is subject to the privacy policies and       practices of those third parties.&nbsp; </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Please note that  the messages that the Site sends to you to confirm, fulfill, or follow up on a  request may incidentally include promotional material or other content from the  Site or its partners. In the case of these messages, the Site is not sharing  your personally identifiable information with those third parties. The Site reserves  the right to share Usage Data with any third party for any reason.</p>
