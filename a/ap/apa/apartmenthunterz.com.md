## What personal information is collected from you

The ApartmentHunterZ.com collects information in several ways from different parts of our website.

Some personal information is gathered when you register. During registration, we ask for your name and email address. The system will also ask for your street address, city, state/province, zip/postal code, country, telephone number, and the URL of your website, although only fields that are marked with an asterisk (*) on the registration field are required. This information is used solely to assist you in navigating the system by automatically filling in certain forms (such as the Vacancy posting form) with your information so that you don't have to continually re-enter it. Once you register you are no longer anonymous to ApartmentHunterZ.com – you have a username and are able to take full advantage of the many offerings of the ApartmentHunterZ.com.

In addition to registration we may ask you for personal information at other times, including (but not limited to) when you place vacancies or take advantage of the other features of the ApartmentHunterZ.com. If you contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence. Every page within the ApartmentHunterZ.com includes a link to this Privacy Policy.

## Tracking Technologies and how they are used

Technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts are used by apartmenthunterz.com and our partners, affiliates, or analytics or service providers (Google Analytics, LiveChat). These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking users' movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis. 

Generally, we use cookies for the following purposes:

  1. To store and sometimes track information about you
  2. To identify and label all «new» vacancies since your last visit to the site
  3. Optionally to permanently save your password on your computer so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our site
  4. To enable you to «checklist and compare» vacancies that you want to mark for future retrieval and viewing



Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some features or areas of our site may be limited. (See «What choices are available to you regarding the collection, use, and distribution of your information» for more information on cookies.) 

We use Local Storage Objects (LSOs) such as HTML5 to store content information and search preferences. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LSOs.

## How you can access, update or delete your information

Upon request, ApartmentHunterz.com will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your personal information. To request this information please [contact us here](https://web.archive.org/support/contact). We will provide you with the means to ensure that your personal information is correct and current. You may edit or delete your user profile at any time by clicking on the «My Profile» link or graphic provided by the system once you are logged in. Once you have logged onto the system during a given session, wherever you go on the ApartmentHunterZ.com, your information will stay with you until or unless you click on the «Sign Out» link, which is accessible from within the «My Profile» screen. We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe.

We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. 

## The kind of security precautions that are in place to protect the loss, misuse, or alteration of your information

Other than the administrator of the ApartmentHunterZ.com or other authorized personnel of the ApartmentHunterZ.com, you are the only person who has access to your personal information. Your user registration is password-protected to prevent unauthorized access.

We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. ApartmentHunterZ.com will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited email. As an extra security precaution, you may want to logoff once you have completed a session in the ApartmentHunterZ.com. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library or Internet cafe.

The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).

We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, ApartmentHunterZ.com cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems. If you have any questions about security on our Website, you can [contact us here](https://web.archive.org/support/contact/)

If you submit personal information to any of those sites, your information is governed by their privacy policies. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any Website you visit. 

Our Website includes Social Media Widgets, such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site. These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.
