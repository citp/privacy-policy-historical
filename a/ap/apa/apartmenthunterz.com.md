## What personally identifiable information is collected from you

The Apartment Hunters collects information in several ways from different parts of our web site.

Some personal information is gathered when you register. During registration, we ask for your name and email address. The system will also ask for your street address, city, state/province, zip/postal code, country, telephone number, and the URL of your web site, although only fields that are marked with an asterisk (*) on the registration field are required. This information is used solely to assist you in navigating the system by automatically filling in certain forms (such as the Vacancy posting form) with your information so that you don't have to continually re-enter it. Once you register you are no longer anonymous to Apartment Hunters - you have a username and are able to take full advantage of the many offerings of the Apartment Hunters.

In addition to registration we may ask you for personal information at other times, including (but not limited to) when you place vacancies or take advantage of the other features of the Apartment Hunters. If you contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence. Every page within the Apartment Hunters includes a link to this Privacy Policy.

## What cookies are and how they are used

As part of offering and providing customizable and personalized services, the Apartment Hunters may use [cookies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie) to store and sometimes track information about you. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. Several features of the Apartment Hunters require that you accept cookies in order to work properly. (See "What choices are available to you regarding collection, use, and distribution of your information" for more information on cookies.)

Generally, we use cookies for the following purposes:

  1. To identify and label all "new" vacancies since your last visit to the site.
  2. Optionally to permanently save your password on your computer so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our site.
  3. To enable you to "checklist and compare" vacancies that you want to mark for future retrieval and viewing.



Third party advertising networks that serve vacancies onto the Apartment Hunters may also use their own cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site.

The Apartment Hunters may also collect [IP addresses](http://www.zdwebopedia.com/TERM/I/IP_address.html) for system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers to let us know what features are effective.

## The kind of security precautions that are in place to protect the loss, misuse, or alteration of your information

Other than the administrator of the Apartment Hunters or other authorized personnel of the Apartment Hunters, you are the only person who has access to your personal information. Your user registration is password-protected to prevent unauthorized access.

We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. Apartment Hunters will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited email. As an extra security precaution, you may want to logoff once you have completed a session in the Apartment Hunters. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library or Internet cafe.

When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, Apartment Hunters cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.

Apartment Hunters does not knowingly collect information from anyone under 13 years of age. If we find that we have mistakenly collected information from a child we will take the necessary steps to delete the information immediately. If you feel that we have collected information from a user under the age of 13 please contact us and we will delete it.
