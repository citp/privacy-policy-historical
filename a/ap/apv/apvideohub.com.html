        The Associated Press Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>
        Updated: 2 April 2012</p>
    <div class="cont-text">

    <p>The Associated
    Press and its affiliates (collectively, “AP”, “us”, “our”, “we”) recognize the
    importance of protecting the privacy of
    personal information that may be provided to us by individual users or readers
    of AP content online. </p>

    <p>Accordingly, we
    have adopted a privacy policy to govern how we treat such information. This
    policy does not apply to information you
    may provide to us offline. AP may change this privacy policy from time to time,
    in its sole discretion, and any such changes
    will become effective when the AP posts the revised privacy policy online. Your
    continued use of this Website indicates
    your consent to AP’s privacy policy and the most current version then in effect.</p>

    <h2>WHAT INFORMATION
    DOES AP COLLECT? </h2>

    <p>AP may collect
    personally identifiable information when you specifically and knowingly provide
    it to us, such as when you provide your
    personal information such as your e-mail address, name, phone number or address.
    </p>

    <p>AP may also
    collect non-personally identifiable information via the use of cookies. Cookies
    are pieces of information that are transferred
    to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies are used to
    assist you in using site information and
    content by saving your user preferences. Cookies are also used to collect
    aggregate information about Website users on
    an anonymous basis. </p>

    <h2>WHAT DOES AP DO
    WITH THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT? </h2>

    <p>AP will use the
    personally identifiable information directly submitted by you solely for the
    purpose for which you have provided it. We
    may also use the information you provide to us to contact you for reasons
    related to your original communication to
    us. Additionally, we may periodically send you promotional e-mail about
    existing or prospective products and
    services offered by AP, as well as to obtain information to better understand
    our users. We may disclose all of the
    information we collect about you to our affiliates who offer related goods and
    services, and to nonaffiliated third parties that
    perform services on our behalf, including marketing services.</p>
    <p>With regard to
    non-personally identifiable information, AP is currently using and has
    contracted with third party vendors to track and
    analyze usage and volume statistical information from our users to administer
    our content in order to improve our
    services. We may also perform statistical analysis of user behavior in order to
    measure interest in our online products and
    services for product development purposes and to inform advertisers as to how
    many consumers have seen or clicked their
    advertisement. We also use demographic and preference information to allow
    advertisements on our sites to be targeted to
    the users for whom they are most pertinent, so users see advertising that is
    most likely to interest them, and advertisers
    send their messages to people who are most likely to be receptive.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

    <p>This information
    may also be used as part of our demographic research. In this event, the
    research is compiled and analyzed on an
    aggregated basis. The AP reserves the right and may grant to third parties such
    right to publish non-personally
    identifiable, aggregate information regarding our users for promotional
    purposes and as a representative audience for
    advertisers.</p>

    <p>AP will not
    disclose any personally identifiable information about our current or former
    users to anyone, except as permitted or
    required by law, or as described herein. AP will endeavor to maintain physical,
    electronic, and procedural safeguards to
    protect the confidentiality of the information that we collect online. </p>

    <h2>WITH WHOM DOES AP
    SHARE THE INFORMATION IT COLLECTS? </h2>

    <p>As a general
    rule, AP will not disclose any of your personally identifiable information
    except under one of the following circumstances: </p>
   <ul class="list-content">
    <li>we have
    your permission; </li>

    <li>we determine in good faith that information is legally required to be revealed by
    any relevant statute, regulation,ordinance, rule,
    administrative or court order, decree, or subpoena; </li>

    <li>information
    revealed during the course of AP’s enforcement of the policies and procedures
    of the Website; </li>

    <li>information
    that we determine must be disclosed to correct what we believe to be false or
    misleading information or to
    address activities that we believe to be manipulative, deceptive or otherwise a
    violation of law; </li>

    <li>where you
    are otherwise notified at the time we collect the data; </li>

    <li>where we
    need to share your information to provide the product or service you have
    requested;</li>

    <li>when
    disclosed to an affiliate of AP or when such disclosure is made subject to
    confidentiality restrictions in connection with a
    sale, merger, transfer, exchange, or other disposition (whether of assets,
    stock, or otherwise) of all or a
    portion of the business conducted by the Website. AP may share the
    non-personally identifiable information that
    AP gathers, in aggregate form only, with advertisers and other partners. </li>
   </ul>
    <p>AP may use
    services provided by third parties, including, without limitation, Google
    Analytics (“Google”) to collect non-personally
    identifiable information on pages that contain AP's news content. Please refer

    responsible for any actions or policies of any third-party service providers,
    including, without limitation, Google. </p>

    <p>This information
    collected by third-party service providers is used by AP and is disclosed to
    AP's advertising partners so that they can
    determine the efficacy of their campaigns. None of the information collected or
    reported to our advertising partners
    identifies you.</p>


    <h2>THIRD PARTY SITES</h2>

    <p>This Privacy
    Policy does not address, and we are not responsible for, the privacy,
    information, or other practices of any third parties,
    including, without limitation, any third party operating any site to which the
    any AP website contains a link. </p>

    <p>The inclusion of
    a link in any AP website does not imply endorsement of the linked site by us.</p>

    located outside of the United States of America, please note that the
    information you provide to us will be transferred to
