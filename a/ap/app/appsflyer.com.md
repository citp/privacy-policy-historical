# Privacy Policy - AppsFlyer

AppsFlyer provides a software development kit which allows the tracking of mobile application use, installations and downloads. This privacy policy explains how we make use of data and information received from our customers that integrate our software development kit with their mobile application (“ **Customers** ”) and the end-users of those Customers (“ **End Users** ”). If not specifically defined herein, capitalized terms have the meaning given to them in the AppsFlyer Terms and Conditions, which is available at [www.appsflyer.com/privacy-policy](http://www.appsflyer.com/privacy-policy)

We respect the right to privacy of Customers and End Users. Your ability to make informed choices about the use of your information is important to us. This privacy statement explains our policy regarding the collection, use, disclosure and protection of any information we receive.

**Information We Collect**

In order to receive the AppsFlyer Services, Customers will be required to register and provide us with certain information, including information that can be used to personally identify Customers. It is your voluntary decision whether to provide us with any such personal information, but if you refuse to provide such information we may not be able to register you to receive our Services.

**Analytics End Users Information We Collect**

Customers that use our Services to track the use of their mobile application will provide us with information regarding the characteristics and activities of their End Users, including information regarding downloads and installations of such mobile application and any information regarding in-app events such as in-app purchases. We do not intentionally collect any information that may personally identify any End Users. AppsFlyer obtains this information as a result of data being sent to our servers from our SDK in an End User’s mobile application. The data collected by the SDK includes: IP address, User agent, platform, SDK version, anonymous User ID, time tamp  Developer Key, application version, device identifiers such as: unique device identifier “UDID” (iOS device) (UDID not collected by default. opt-in is needed in order to collect UDID), Media Access Control (“MAC”) Address, ODIN, Android ID (Android device), device model, manufacture, OS version, in-app events, locale, time zone, and network status (WiFi/3G). End User data collected AppsFlyer platform is presented to you to analyze your applications. Customers should make sure to update their application T&C accordingly. In addition, we provide you with aggregated and anonymous benchmark data that includes your End User data and all other Customers’ End User data.

**End User Opt-Out Provision**

Your End Users can opt-out of AppsFlyer Analytics tracking by emailing privacy@appsflyer.com

The opt-out is specific to AppsFlyer activities and does not affect the activities of other ad networks or analytics providers that you use. If an End User opts-out, AppsFlyer will stop tracking data for that device going forward. The AppsFlyer Analytics tracking will stop across all applications.

**How we Use Information**

We will not share Personal Information provided to us except when required by law, regulation, subpoena or court order. We may use Personal Information internally – for example, to help diagnose problems with our servers, or to improve the Services and make AppsFlyer more useful. We will retain Personal Information regarding a Customer for as long as the applicable Customer account is active or as is necessary for us to provide Services. By “Personal Information” we mean any information that can be directly associated with a specific person or entity such as a name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, or information about activities directly linked to such person.

By analyzing the information we collect (including regarding End Users) we compile certain analytics regarding the use of our Customer’s mobile applications. We provide such analytics to our Customers. Analytics do not contain the Personal Information of any End User.

In addition, by analyzing all information we receive, we may compile aggregate information across a variety of mobile applications and Customers (“ **Aggregate Information** ”). ** ** Aggregate Information is anonymous and we will not link Aggregate Information to any Personal Information. Aggregate Information helps understand trends and customer needs so that new products and services can be considered and so existing products and services can be tailored to customer desires. We may share such Aggregate Information with our partners, without restriction, on commercial terms that we can determine in our sole discretion.

**How we Protect Information**

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. We encrypt sensitive information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).

We will make reasonable commercial efforts to delete any information provided to us by a Customer upon the receipt of a written request by such Customer. We cannot restore information that we have deleted.

**Other Uses or Transfer of Your Information**

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, we will fully cooperate with any law enforcement authorities or court order requesting or directing us to disclose the identity, behavior or digital content of any user suspected to have engaged in illegal or infringing behavior.

In providing the Services, we may use subcontractors that are located in countries other than your own, and send them information we receive. For example, we may send your information to any countries outside the United States or the European Economic Area. All our subcontractors will be subject to non-disclosure and non-use obligations. Nevertheless, some countries may have levels of protection of personal and other information which are not as high as in your country of residence or business.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, we may transfer data we have collected if we sell our business or part of it.
