Our software development kit and API’s allows the tracking of mobile application use, installations and downloads.

We collect information under the direction of our Customers, and have no direct relationship with the individuals whose data we process. We respect the right to privacy of Customers and End Users. Your ability to make informed choices about the use of your information is important to us. This privacy policy explains our policy regarding the collection, use, disclosure and protection of any information we receive.

**Information We Collect**

In order to receive the AppsFlyer Services, Customers will be required to register and provide us with certain information, including information that can be used to personally identify Customers; such as email address, first and last name, company name, company’s website. Customers may also provide their billing details, such as credit card number, should they choose to activate their account right away. It is your voluntary decision whether to provide us with any such personal information, but if you refuse to provide such information we may not be able to register you to receive our Services.

**Analytics End Users Information We Collect**

Customers that use our Services to track the use of their mobile application will provide us with information regarding the characteristics and activities of their End Users, including information regarding downloads and installations of such mobile application and any information regarding in-app events such as in-app purchases. AppsFlyer obtains this information as a result of data being sent to our servers from our SDK in an End User’s mobile application. The data collected by the SDK includes information such as IP address, User agent, platform, SDK version, anonymous User ID, time stamp Developer Key, application version, device identifiers such as: IDFA (Identifier For Advertisers), Android ID (Android device), Google Advertiser ID, device model, manufacture, OS version, in-app events, and network status (WiFi/3G). End User data collected by the AppsFlyer platform is presented to our Customers to analyze their applications. We provide our Customers with aggregated and anonymous benchmark data.

In certain instances, our Customers may choose to connect and integrate our platform with third parties that have partnered with AppsFlyer. In order to do this, our Customers have to actively set parameters that allow for such integration and measurement. In such instances, information collected and processed may be provided to both the Customer and their partner networks. Here, we are again acting as a third party processor on behalf on our Customers. Please review the privacy policy of our partner associated with the application in question.

**End User Opt-Out Provision**

If you are an End User, you can opt-out of AppsFlyer Analytics tracking by emailing us at [privacy@appsflyer.com](mailto:privacy@appsflyer.com). If you no longer wish to be contacted by one of our Customers that use our service, please contact the Customer that you interact with directly. 

The opt-out is specific to AppsFlyer activities and does not affect other tools such as ad networks and other analytics that your services provider may use. If you are an End User and choose to opt-out; we will stop tracking data for that device going forward. The AppsFlyer Analytics tracking will stop across all applications.

**How We Use Information**

The use of information collected through our service will be used for creating aggregate data and anonymous data, and for internal use or for improving the services and creating new features; data may include data of your End Users and such data of all other Customers. We will not share Personal Information provided to us other than as set forth under this Policy and except when required by law, regulation, subpoena or court order. We may use Personal Information internally – for example, to help diagnose problems with our servers, help diagnose and prevent fraudulent activity, or to improve the Services and make AppsFlyer more useful. We may retain Personal Information for as long as the applicable Customer account is active or as is necessary for us to provide Services, but we may adopt shorter retention period to the extent required by our partners. By “Personal Information” we mean any information that can be directly associated with a specific person or entity such as a name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, or information about activities directly linked to such person.

By analyzing the information we collect (including regarding End Users) we compile certain analytics regarding the use of our Customer’s mobile applications. We provide such analytics to our Customers. Analytics do not contain the Personal Information of any End User.

In addition, by analyzing all information we receive, we may compile aggregate or anonymized information across a variety of mobile applications and Customers (“Aggregate Information”). Aggregate Information is anonymous and we will not link Aggregate Information to any Personal Information. Aggregate Information helps understand trends and customer needs so that new products and services can be considered and so existing products and services can be tailored to customer desires. We may share such Aggregate Information with our partners, without restriction, on commercial terms that we can determine in our sole discretion.

**How We Protect Information**

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to us, we encrypt such information both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. We encrypt sensitive information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).

We will make reasonable commercial efforts to delete any information provided to us by a Customer upon the receipt of a written request by such Customer. We cannot restore information that we have deleted.

**Legal Disclosures**

We may also disclose your personal information as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, bankruptcy proceedings, or similar legal process when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request. If AppsFlyer is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our website, of any change in ownership, uses of your personal information, and choices you may have regarding your personal information.
