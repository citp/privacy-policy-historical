# Privacy - Appfigures app analytics

## Personal data we collect

When you use our platform we may collect personal information about you. The information that we may collect broadly falls into the following categories:

**Information you provide to us:** In the course of engaging with our services, you may provide personal information about yourself when you sign up for and use the service, consult with our support team, integrate the services with another website or service, or communicate with us in any other way. Such information includes your email address, personal and company name, and billing information if you are on a paid plan.

**Information we collect automatically:** When you use the platform through the website, API, or our mobile apps, we may automatically collect certain information about your device and usage patterns. We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect some of this information. We use this information to improve our service and provide your with an overall better experience.

## Your linked accounts are secure

Some reports require that you link your developer accounts. To connect to your linked accounts automatically, we may need to store sensitive information such as your username, password, or API key ("Credentials"). We store Credentials securely, and only use them for importing new data into your account. Your credentials are always stored encrypted and are never displayed in your account.

## You have full control of your data

We give you complete control over your reports data, personal settings, and private information. You can delete reports and credentials at any time – those reports will be deleted in their entirety permanently from our platform.

## We don't keep more than we have to

We store only information pertinent to displaying reports that are relevant to your account. We do not save or access any other data, for any other purpose. Where possible, the original raw data we store can be viewed through the archive, downloaded, and deleted at any time.

## We'll never share your private data directly

We don't, and will never, share any private data that's improted into your account directly with any third party.

## You can opt out of anonymous data sharing

We offer the ability to contribute data anonymously so we can create new features and give you market insights and trends. Contributing is completely optional and you can opt-out entirely at any time. [Learn more](https://web.archive.org/support/kb/611/what-is-the-anonymous-data-pool)

## Encryption for all sensitive data

We utilize advanced encryption approved and used by the U.S Government to encrypt all sensitive and private information including your account password and the passwords for any accounts you link.
