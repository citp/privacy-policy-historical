**General**  
AppZone collects and uses your personal information to operate the AppZone website and deliver the services you have requested. AppZone also uses your personal information to inform you of other products or services that may be available from AppZone and/or its affiliates. 

AppZone may also post surveys to our website or contact you regarding surveys. We use surveys to better understand our customers, to provide higher quality services, to conduct market research, and to provide guidance to the products and services we offer, among other things. AppZone may also conduct contests or promotions from time to time. If you participate in any contest, promotion, or survey we may request certain personal information from you. Participation in any survey or contest is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether to participate. By participating in any contest, survey, and/or promotion you consent to the use of any information you provide, at the sole judgment of AppZone.  AppZone may use a third party service provider to conduct these surveys, contests, and/or promotions. Any third party service provider will be prohibited from using the information for any other purpose.  We will not share the personal information you provide through a contest, survey, or promotion with any outside individual or organization for any unrelated purpose except as provided herein.

**Testimonials**  
We post customer testimonials, statements, and/or other similar items (collectively “Testimonial” or “Testimonials”) on our website which may contain personally identifiable information.  Generally, we obtain the customer’s consent via email prior to posting the Testimonial.  To request removal of your personal information from our Testimonials, please contact us at support@AppZone.com.  In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.
