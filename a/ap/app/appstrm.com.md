IMPORTANT NOTICE TO USERS WHO DOWNLOADED OR USED CLIENTCONNECT SOFTWARE (AS DEFINED BELOW) AND ITS RELATED SERVICES AND FEATURES BEFORE JANUARY 1, 2014.

(collectively, the "ClientConnect Software"). This Privacy Policy explains how ClientConnect Ltd. and its affiliates (together, “ClientConnect”, “we,” or “us”) treat your information and protect your privacy when you use the ClientConnect Software, and the rights and options available to you regarding your information. We believe that you have a right to know our practices regarding the information we may collect and use when you access, download and/or use the ClientConnect Software. All capitalized terms that are defined in the EULA, will have the same meaning when used in this Privacy Policy.

PLEASE READ CAREFULLY: BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, ACCESSING, AND/OR USING THE CLIENTCONNECT SOFTWARE, YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS SET FORTH IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY, INCLUDING THE COLLECTION, PROCESSING, AND USAGE OF YOUR INFORMATION. IF YOU DISAGREE TO ANY TERM PROVIDED HEREIN, YOU MAY NOT DOWNLOAD, CONNECT TO, ACCESS, ACTIVATE, AND/OR USE THE CLIENTCONNECT SOFTWARE, AND ARE OBLIGED TO UNINSTALL, ERASE, OR REMOVE THE CLIENTCONNECT SOFTWARE FROM YOUR COMPUTER. 

The ClientConnect Software may include various features and content that are offered and delivered to you by the Publisher or other third parties, such as news, messages, and games, as well as features and content that you may choose to add (“Content”). The following are the privacy practices of ClientConnect. Third parties must comply with these policies when providing you with Content that is included, directly or indirectly, in the ClientConnect Software: 

Information ClientConnect Collects and Receives. 

There are several types of data being collected from you as detailed herein. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY DETAILED HEREIN, IT IS NOT NECESSARY FOR YOU TO PROVIDE CLIENTCONNECT WITH ANY PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION TO USE THE CLIENTCONNECT SOFTWARE. “Personally Identifiable Information” is information that identifies an individual, including their login credentials to a third-party website, name, postal address, and email address. 

Search Data. 

As part of the functionality provided by the ClientConnect Software (through the Toolbar and/or the Search Protect software products), we may collect and store information about your search activity when you use our web search services (such as search queries). This information may be shared with third-party applications that use Search Data to function, or to offer you more customized information and services. The information is collected and stored by Cookies (as explained below) and may include Personally Identifiable Information, depending on your search query. For instance, if you search your own name, Personally Identifiable Information would be included in the search query. BY USING THE SEARCH FEATURES PROVIDED BY US, YOU ARE CONSENTING TO GRANT CLIENTCONNECT PERMISSION TO COLLECT YOUR SEARCH QUERIES, SHARE THEM WITH THIRD PARTIES, AND USE SEARCH-RELATED COOKIES.

Usage Data. 

The ClientConnect Software further collects anonymous, aggregated information and non-personal data, such as ClientConnect Software-generated User IDs, User language, Internet Protocol (IP) address, the geographic location of the device from which you access the web, and other ClientConnect Software Usage Data, all of which do not include Personally Identifiable Information. We may use such information, including making it available to our service providers, partners, and other third parties. You may choose not to send ClientConnect Software Usage Data at any time when you disable or uninstall the ClientConnect Software. 

Browsing Data.

The ClientConnect Software (including the Toolbar, the Search Protect, and the Value Apps software) may also collect and store information about your web browsing locally on your device, like the web pages that you have visited and the content you have accessed. This locally saved information may interact with the ClientConnect Software and send us information about your web browsing so we can suggest services or provide you with ads that may be more relevant to you, including via our [ Partners](http://valueapps.vaccint.com/ct234324/settings) when using the Value Apps software. Only generalized inferences are passed from the ClientConnect Software to our servers.

Please note that when using Value Apps, your Browsing Data may also include information from secured web pages that you have visited. For example, it may include product codes, purchase prices, and coupons used during online purchases. This information may be collected by us and/or by our [ Partners](http://valueapps.vaccint.com/ct234324/settings) within Value Apps. Note that we will neither store nor use any of your sensitive information that may appear on secured pages. 

Additional Services. 

We may combine the web Search Data with other non-Personally Identifiable Information (as further detailed above, e.g. Browsing Data or Usage Data) and if we do, some of the otherwise non-Personally Identifiable Information may become Personally Identifiable Information (for example, see the following section about the Search Protect software). In addition, the ClientConnect Software also takes the form of apps, buttons, or gadgets that we created for your enjoyment. If this ClientConnect Software requires any access, collection, use, or sharing of your information – both your Personally Identifiable Information and non-Personally Identifiable Information, then we will ask for your permission prior to accessing your information. 

Search Protect. 

Search Protect is a separate piece of software installed on your hard drive in connection with your installation of a Toolbar or third-party software. It is designed to change and protect your preferred Browser home page and default search settings from unintentional takeover by third-party software during redirection of service attacks. Search Protect may alert you if a third party attempts to change your Browser’s default search or home page settings. Further explanation about the Search Protect software is available in the ClientConnect [EULA](http://www.ourtoolbar.com/Eula/). Search Protect captures some non-Personally Identifiable Information about your Internet Browser, including your Browser search settings, your computer, and companies’ attempts to redirect your search settings, and stores this information with your Search Data (search queries and/or IP address). ClientConnect does not sell or rent the information you provide through Search Protect to any Third Parties. It may share the information with its wholly owned subsidiaries or [ partners](http://valueapps.vaccint.com/ct234324/settings). 

Value Apps. 

Value Apps is an aggregation, categorization, and optimization platform offering Apps based on your browsing information. Value Apps is installed on your Browser or computer in connection with your installation of a Toolbar or third-party Extension. Value Apps may require use of your Personally Identifiable Information, including your IP address, the web pages you visit, and their content.

Notwithstanding the Browsing Data section of this Privacy Policy, Browsing Data with respect to Value Apps may contain all browsing data including, without limitation, URLs. 

Your Browsing Data and Search Data are collected and analyzed through the Value Apps platform , and we share such information with our Partners so our Partners or we, as applicable (depending on the App provider), can suggest services or provide you with offers that may be relevant to you according to the data collected and processed. 

Value Apps contain Third-Party Apps that the use thereof is governed by their relevant terms and conditions, as referred below. Any active Third-Party Apps on Value Apps may result in you sending information to such Third Parties ([Partners](http://valueapps.vaccint.com/ct234324/settings)) so they may provide you with best offers and customize your experience. Information collected by a Third-Party App provider ([Partner](http://valueapps.vaccint.com/ct234324/settings)) is governed by its relevant privacy policy.
