    <h2>Online Privacy Policy Statement</h2>
	  <p>This Privacy Policy is provided to help you understand how we protect Customer information. Applied Bank (herein referred to as Bank, we, us or our) respects your decision to do business with us and takes your privacy seriously. Our Privacy Policy provides you with an opportunity to make informed choices about the management of personal information. You trust us with your personal and financial information and we'll honor that trust by handling your information carefully and sensibly. This Privacy Policy will help you understand how we safeguard and use information, and how it applies to all Customers or former Customers who obtain financial services from us for personal, family or household purposes. Similarly, our Customers who receive information from us or transact business with us through the Internet are covered by additional privacy policies on our websites.<br>

	  <h2><a id="1" name="1"></a> Collection of Information</h2>
    <p>We collect information from and about you in order to identify you as our Customer, establish and manage Customer accounts, complete Customer transactions, understand Customer needs, market products and services we believe are of value to Customers, and comply with legal and regulatory requirements. We collect and obtain Customer information from various sources including the following: <br>
</p><ul>
	<li>Information listed on credit applications or other related forms</li>
	<li>Information listed on deposit account opening forms</li>
	<li>Enrollment in Online Banking</li>
	<li>Credit reporting agencies</li>
	<li>Customer transactions with us or other institutions</li>
	<li>Customer communications with the Bank or any of its affiliates</li>
	<li>Public information</li></ul><p></p>
	
 
    <h2><a id="2" name="2"></a>Security Procedures</h2>
	  <p>We are committed to maintaining the security of our Customers’ financial and personal information. All operational and data processing systems are in a secure environment that protects Customer information from being accessed by unauthorized individuals or third parties. Access to nonpublic information about you is restricted to those Associates who need to know that information in order to provide products or services to you. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard your nonpublic personal information. Correspondence and telephone conversations are monitored for quality, compliance, and accuracy to ensure that our standards are being followed.</p>

<p>From time to time, we may enter into agreements with other companies to provide services to us or to make products and services available to you. Under these agreements, the companies may receive information about you. They must safeguard this information, and they may not use it for any other purpose.</p>
	  
	 
	
    <h2><a id="3" name="3"></a>Disclosures to Service Your Account</h2>
	  <p>It is often necessary for us to disclose Customer information to companies, including our affiliates, which perform services necessary to establish and manage Customer accounts on our behalf. These services may include transaction and statement processing, research and analysis, delivery of benefits and programs, marketing services, card issuance, Customer Service, and protection against fraud. Additionally, if we offer Customers the opportunity to enroll in affinity, frequent user, or award programs, we may provide certain Customer information to companies that administer such programs. When it comes to disclosing Customer information to others for the purpose of establishing and managing Customer accounts, we place limits on who receives specific information. We disclose to these companies information that they need to establish and manage Customer accounts and restrict the use of that information so that it cannot be used for any purpose beyond the intended service. We may also provide certain Customer information to others outside of the Bank as required or permitted by law, such as to government entities, other third parties in response to subpoenas, or to consumer reporting agencies.</p>
	  
	 
	
    <h2><a id="4" name="4"></a>Disclosures to Provide You with Offers for Products and Services</h2>
	  <p>We do not disclose any Customer information to anyone, except as permitted by law. However, we recognize that an important benefit for our Customers is the opportunity to receive offers for products and services from other companies that may work with us. In the future, we may provide these offers to Customer when we believe they will find them of value. These offers will be developed under conditions designed to safeguard Customer information.</p>
	  
	
    <h2><a id="5" name="5"></a>Offers for Products and Services of Other Companies</h2>
	  <p>As described in this Privacy Policy, we work with affiliated and non-affiliated companies that help us service your account, and disclose information to these companies as permitted by law. In the future, we also may work with other companies to provide our Customer with offers for products and services that they provide. These other companies may include financial service providers (that offer for example, insurance, loan and investment products) and non-financial companies (that offer for example card registries, membership clubs, and other consumer products and services). Unless you direct us not to, we may disclose information about you to those companies to enable them to develop and deliver these offers to you.</p>

<p>If you prefer, you may tell us not to disclose information about you to other companies for the purpose of providing you with their products and services; you can write to the Bank c/o P.O. Box 17125, Wilmington, DE 19850-7125 (“opt-out”). Please include your Applied Bank Account Number(s) in your letter. If you opt out, everyone associated with your account will be excluded as well. If you have more than one account with us, you may receive multiple copies of this Privacy Policy. In that event, you will need to separately opt-out of this information disclosure for each of your accounts with us.</p>

<p>If you opt-out, you may still receive offers for products and services provided by affiliated or non-affiliated companies when we communicate with you about your account. These offers, however, will be developed without disclosing information about you to the other companies. You may also still receive offers that are developed without the use of information that we have collected about you.</p>
	  
	 
	
    <h2><a id="6" name="6"></a>Vermont Residents Only</h2>
	  <p>We will not disclose information about you to other companies for the purpose of providing you with their products and services unless you authorize us to do so (“opt-in”). You may opt-in by writing to the Bank c/o 17125, Wilmington, DE 19850-7125 or by contacting our Customer Service Department at 800-947-1090.</p>

<p>Even if you do not opt-in, you may still receive offers for products and services provided by affiliated or non-affiliated companies when we communicate with you about your account. These offers, however, will be developed without disclosing information about you to the other companies.</p>

<p>If you elect to opt-in and subsequently decide to revoke the opt-in direction you have given to us, you can write to the Bank c/o P.O. Box 17125, Wilmington, DE 19850-7125 or contact our Customer Service Department at 800-947-1090.</p>
	  
	 
	
    <h2><a id="7" name="7"></a>Protecting Our Children</h2>
	  <p>We do not knowingly market to children. We recognize the importance of protecting children's identities and privacy.</p>
	  
	 
	
    <h2><a id="8" name="8"></a>Former Customers</h2>
	  <p>If you decide to close your account or your account becomes inactive or is closed for some other reason, we will continue to treat and safeguard your information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
	  
	 
	
    <h2><a id="9" name="9"></a>Commitment to Service</h2>
	  <p>We believe the confidentiality and protection of Customer information is one of our fundamental responsibilities. While information is critical to providing quality service, we recognize that one of our most important assets is our Customers’ trust. Thus, the safekeeping of Customer information is a priority for us. We will continuously strive to maintain complete and accurate information about our Customers and their accounts. If you believe that our records contain inaccurate or incomplete information about you, it is important that you notify us as soon as possible. We will investigate your concerns and correct any inaccuracies.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy replaces any prior privacy policy we have posted or delivered to you. We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time, and we will inform you of changes as required by law.</p>
	  
	 
	
    <h2><a id="10" name="10"></a>Online Privacy Addendum</h2>
