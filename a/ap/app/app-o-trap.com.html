<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<h3>Website Visitors</h3>
<p>Like most website operators, App-o-Trap collects
non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and
servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language
preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.
App-o-Trap’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying
information is to better understand how App-o-Trap’s visitors
use its website so we can make improvements. From time to time,
App-o-Trap may release non-personally-identifying information in
the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its
website.</p>


<p>
App-o-Trap avoids collecting potentially personally-identifying
information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses except to the extent
necessary to provide certain services.


</p>




<h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>
<p>App-o-Trap may collect statistics
about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance,
App-o-Trap may monitor the most popular pages on
app-o-trap.com sites. App-o-Trap may display this
information publicly or provide it to others. However, App-o-Trap
does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described
below.</p>

<h3>Google App Engine</h3>
<p>Some of App-o-Trap's services may be provided by Google App
Engine, a service operated by Google. As such, you should assume that any
information you provide to App-o-Trap may be available to
App-o-Trap and to Google. For details about the specific privacy
guarantees made by Google, please refer to
<a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/privacy.html">code.google.com/appengine/privacy.html</a>.</p>

<h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
<p>App-o-Trap discloses potentially personally-identifying and
personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors
and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to
process it on App-o-Trap’s behalf or to provide services available
at App-o-Trap’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose
it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations
may be located outside of your home country; by using App-o-Trap’s
websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them.
App-o-Trap will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying
and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees,
contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above,
App-o-Trap discloses potentially personally-identifying and
personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order
or other governmental request, or when App-o-Trap believes in good
faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights
of App-o-Trap, third parties or the public at large. If you are a
registered user of a App-o-Trap website and have supplied your
email address, App-o-Trap may occasionally send you an email to
tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date
with what’s going on with App-o-Trap and our products. We primarily
use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we
expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for
example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve
the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request
or to help us support other users. App-o-Trap takes all measures
reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use,
alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and
personally-identifying information.</p>

<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s
computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the
visitor returns. App-o-Trap uses cookies to help
App-o-Trap identify and track visitors, their usage of
App-o-Trap website, and their website access preferences.
App-o-Trap visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their
computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using
App-o-Trap’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of
App-o-Trap’s websites may not function properly without the aid of
cookies.</p>

<h3>Business Transfers</h3>
<p>If App-o-Trap, or substantially all of its assets were acquired,
or in the unlikely event that App-o-Trap goes out of business or
enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is
transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers
may occur, and that any acquiror of App-o-Trap may continue to use
your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>

<h3>Ads</h3>
<p>Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by
advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to
recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to
compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information
allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that
they believe will be of most interest to you. Except in the section "Advertiser
Cookies" immediately below, this Privacy Policy discusses the use of cookies by
App-o-Trap and does not cover the use of cookies by any
advertisers. For more information about advertiser cookies you should consult
the privacy policies of the specific advertising networks you wish to learn
more about.</p>

<h3>Advertiser Cookies</h3>
<p>Third party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on
your prior visits to the App-o-Trap website. Google's use of the
DART cookie enables it and its partners to serve ads based on your visit to the
App-o-Trap site and/or other sites on the Internet. You may opt out
of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy/ads/">advertising opt-out page</a>.
</p>

<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, App-o-Trap may
change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in App-o-Trap’s
sole discretion. App-o-Trap encourages visitors to frequently check
