# Privacy Policy | AppLovin

_Effective Date:_ April 2, 2018

AppLovin Corporation (“we,” “us,” “our” or “AppLovin”) is a mobile advertising company that provides application developers with a platform to deliver advertising to their consumers. Our technology enables our partners to show mobile application users more relevant advertising that is based on users’ interest in applications. In order to provide these services, we collect and use certain information about user activity in mobile applications.

The AppLovin Privacy Policy (this “Policy”) explains how we collect, use, and share information through our advertising platform (“Services”) and our corporate website at www.AppLovin.com (“Site”), as well as your choices related to that information.

## Advertising Services Privacy Policy

This section describes the information we collect, use, and share through our Services.

### Information Collection and Use

If you are a consumer that downloads and uses an application which contains the AppLovin SDK or otherwise interacts with the Services, we may collect certain device information including the following:

  * Device make, model and operating system;
  * Device properties related to screen size & orientation, audio volume and battery;
  * Carrier;
  * Operating system;
  * Name and properties of mobile application through which a consumer interacts with the Services;
  * Country, time zone and locale settings (country and preferred language);
  * Network connection type and speed;
  * IP Address;
  * Internet browser user-agent used to access the Services; and
  * Identifier for advertisers (IDFA).



This device information may be collected across mobile apps and websites over time. We may also combine information we collect with other information we derive through analytical techniques, and we use that combined information to offer the Services. This type of information may include transactional data related to a consumer’s interaction with an application, such as information about the actions taken in an application like purchases or application installations. We may also collect certain types of information automatically, including through the use of Cookies. You can control or disable the use of cookies at the individual browser level on your device.

Using the information we collect, we are able to deliver the Services, improve them, and research and develop new ones.

### Information Sharing

We may share information we collect or derive with third parties for the following purposes:

  * With service providers that perform services on our behalf;
  * With our affiliates;
  * To provide our clients with the Services, such as to deliver relevant advertising, and to provide attribution;
  * For analytics and research purposes;
  * In response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal processes;
  * To protect our or a third party’s legal rights or to defend against a legal claim; and
  * As part of a business transfer such as a merger, acquisition, or at bankruptcy.



### Sharing With Third-Party Partners and Customers

We work with third party companies who help us provide and improve our Services or who use advertising or related products.

### Advertising, Measurement and Analytics Services (Non-Personally Identifiable Information Only).

We may provide these partners with information about the reach and effectiveness of their advertising without providing information that personally identifies you, or if we have aggregated the information so that it does not personally identify you. For example, we may tell an advertiser how its ads performed, or how many people viewed their ads or installed an app after seeing an ad.

### Service providers and other partners

We transfer information to service providers, and other partners who support our business, such as providing technical infrastructure services, analyzing how our Services are used, measuring the effectiveness of ads and services, providing customer service or facilitating payments. These partners must adhere to strict confidentiality obligations in a way that is consistent with this Privacy Policy and the agreements we enter into with them.

### Opt-Out:

To opt-out of our collection of information from mobile devices, please visit your device’s settings to set the “Limit Ad Track” or other similar feature on your device. You can also opt-out of our data collection and use through the process we described here [Opt Out](https://web.archive.org/optout). You can also make choices about data collection for certain companies by visiting <http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/>.

Note that if you opt-out you will still see advertising on your device, but it may be less relevant to your interests. In addition, if you reset your device identifier or use a different device you may need to renew your opt-out.

### Children’s Online Privacy Protection Rule

We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13 except as permitted by U.S. law. For example, we may collect certain types of information (e.g., IDFAs) from apps that are directed toward children for activities that fit within the “support for internal operations” exception from the notice and consent requirements in the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Rule.

### Data Security and Retention

We implement reasonable measures to help secure the information we collect through the Services. We retain the data we collect through the Services for up to 2 years. Information is automatically purged from our system if the Services do not receive any updated information for a device in the last 2 years. Note that we will retain information in our systems for as long as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

AppLovin is responsible for the processing of personal data it receives, under each Privacy Shield Framework, and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. AppLovin complies with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of personal data from the EU and Switzerland, including the onward transfer liability provisions.

With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Framework, AppLovin is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.

### Lawful Basis for Processing

On certain occasions, we process your personal data when it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party, such as to provide services to you. We may also process your personal data to respond to your inquiries concerning our products and services.

On other occasions, we process your personal data where required by law. We may also process your personal data if necessary to protect your interests or the interests of a third party.

Additionally, we process your personal data when necessary to do so for fraud prevention, improving our network and services, and marketing our services to advertisers and publishers; where these interests are not overridden by your data protection rights.

If the processing of personal data is necessary and there is no other lawful basis for such processing, we will generally ensure that consent has been obtained from you. You have the right to withdraw your consent to processing of personal data at any time.
