Such activities are beyond the control of AppGrooves. Please do not post any personal information through the Applications that you expect to keep private. Please note that we will disclose the information you direct us to disclose, even if it contains Personal Information, for example if you opt-in to share user comments, geographic location, or other content or information on a third-party service, such as Facebook or Twitter. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p><h1 class="c1" id="h.jhiao49hvwse"><span class="c2">Alerts</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>You may choose to allow the Application to provide alerts.
