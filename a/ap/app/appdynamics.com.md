### 2\. About this Privacy Policy

AppDynamics and our affiliates (" **we** ", " **us** ", or " **our** ") are committed to protecting and respecting your personal information and privacy.

This policy (together with our website [terms of use](https://www.appdynamics.com/terms-of-use/) and any other documents referred to in this policy) gives details of what information we may collect from you or that you may provide to us, and how we may store and use this information. Such information may be collected or provided when you communicate with us or use our mobile apps, websites or any of our products.

 **Please read the following carefully to understand how we collect and use your information.

### 3\. Where We Store Your Information

We are a global organization and so the information that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination other than the country in which the information was collected (information is frequently transferred to the United States because that is where we are headquartered).

Your information may also be processed by our staff at any of our locations around the world or by the staff of our suppliers at any of their locations around the world. Such staff may be engaged in, among other things, the fulfillment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services.

Information you provide to us may be stored on our servers or those of our third party service providers. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password that enables you to access certain parts of our website, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. You should not share your password with anyone.

### 4\. AppDynamics Products

Some of our products may be used by our customers to collect information that is or could be personal information. We may have no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal information we process on behalf of our customers. An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend or delete inaccurate data controlled by one of our customers should direct its query to our customer (the data controller). We use and disclose such information as specified in the agreement(s) between our customer and us and/or as required by law.

When we employ another company to perform a function of this nature, we strive to provide them with the minimum information that they need to perform their specific function;
