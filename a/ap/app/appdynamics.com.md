### 4\. Where We Store Your Information

We are a global organization and so the personal information that we process may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination other than the country in which the information was collected or provided (personal information is frequently transferred to the United States because that is where we are headquartered).  Where we transfer your personal information outside the European Economic Area, we will ensure that your personal information is protected by appropriate safeguards as required by applicable data protection laws. These safeguards may include, in particular, the EU standard contractual clauses and the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield.   

Your personal information may also be processed by our staff at any of our locations around the world or by the staff of our suppliers at any of their locations around the world. Such staff may be engaged in, among other things, the fulfillment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services.

Your personal information may be stored on our servers or those of our third party service providers.

Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password that enables you to access certain parts of our website or our products, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. You should not share your password with anyone.

### 11\. Disclosure of Your Information

We will never sell or share your information to any third party for marketing purposes, without your express written consent. However, in the course of providing our services, we may share your personal information, as detailed below.

 _Aggregated information:_

In an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of our website, services and products, we often conduct research on customer demographics, interests and behavior based on the personal information and other data provided to us. This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis, and we may share this aggregated data with our affiliates, agents and business partners. This aggregated information does not identify you personally.

We may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our products to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.

 _Third Parties:_

We also share your personal information with selected third parties including:

(a) our affiliates, business partners, resellers, suppliers and subcontractors for the performance of any contract we enter into with them or you. When we employ another company to perform a function of this nature, we strive to provide them with the minimum personal information that they need to perform their specific function;

(b) partners and service providers with whom we have a strategic relationship or that perform work for us to provide products and services to you. These third parties may help us host and/or analyze data, process information, fulfill orders, deliver products or information, manage and enhance user data, provide customer service, assess your interest in products and services or conduct user research and surveys. These companies are obligated to protect your personal information and may have their own privacy policies if you link to or access their websites or systems; and

We may disclose your personal information to third parties:

(a) including any of our affiliates:

(i) where necessary to perform a contract with you or take steps prior to entering into a contract with you (for example, where you have purchased a product and / or service from us, we use your personal information to process payment and fulfil your order);

(ii) because it is in the affiliate’s legitimate interests as a provider of an application and business performance monitoring software platform to maintain , improve and promote their products and services (for example, they use information about you to tailor your view of our website to make it more interesting and relevant in respect of the products and services on view) and for the reasons set out above in Section 8.

This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

### 12\. How long do we keep your information

Your information will be stored for only as long as necessary for the purposes set out above and so this period will vary depending on your interactions with us (for instance, where you have made a purchase with us, we will keep a record or your purchase for the period necessary for invoicing, warranty and tax purposes and to ensure the adequate provision of services to you, whether via the use of our website or contractually for our products). We may also keep a record of dealings with you for as long as is necessary to protect us from a legal claim.

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.

Where you have an account with us that is used to access our products, we will delete this if you are inactive for 12 months. This does not affect your organisation’s licence to use our products (if one is in place).

### 13\. Security

We take appropriate steps to protect the personal information we receive from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. We restrict access to personal information to AppDynamics employees, contractors, business partners, and agents who are subject to strict contractual obligations.

However, no Internet or email transmission is ever fully secure or error-free. In particular, email sent to or from us may not be secure. Therefore, you should take special care in deciding what information you send to us via email. Please keep this in mind when disclosing any personal information to us.

We ask that you not send us, and you not disclose, any sensitive personal information to us directly or through our products (such as protected health information, passwords and authentication/authorization credentials for other services, credit card numbers or other financial information other than for the purpose of making payment to us, driver’s license numbers, passport numbers, social security numbers or information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or other beliefs, health, criminal background or trade union membership).

Even where you withdraw your consent, we may still process your personal information for limited purposes, for example, to give effect to your request or to safeguard our business. In some circumstances, withdrawing your consent to our use or disclosure of your personal information will mean that you cannot use some of our products or services.

We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s Internet usage and to help enforce our policy by instructing their children never to provide personal information through our website or products without their permission.
