**Policy and guidelines for use of marks in advertising, promotion and display**  
Apple Vacations and its affiliates have the exclusive rights to use the APPLE VACATIONS service mark and other Apple Vacations marks and logos. Under the trademark laws, the Apple Vacations companies must prevent the use of their names and marks in ways that could give customers and potential customers the mistaken impression that an Apple Vacations company owns or is affiliated with an agency using its marks. Apple Vacations (and trademark law) allow the "fair use" of Apple Vacations marks and logos by agencies, in a truthful, informational way in accordance with the rules provided here. Please adhere to the following specific rules when using Apple Vacations names and marks in promotions on Internet web sites and in print advertisements. 

**General Rules**

  * All uses of the APPLE VACATIONS name or any Apple Vacations mark must relate solely to Apple Vacations travel packages and not to the agencies selling them.
