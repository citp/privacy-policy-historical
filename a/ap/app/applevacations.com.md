# Apple Vacations - Privacy Policy

**General**  
This policy covers how APPLE VACATIONS treats personal information that APPLE VACATIONS collects and receives, including information related to your past use of APPLE VACATIONS products and services. Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, or phone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that APPLE VACATIONS does not own or control or to people that APPLE VACATIONS does not manage or employ.  
Please read the following policy to understand how your personal information will be treated as you use our web site. This policy may change from time to time, so please check back periodically.

**Personal Information  
**APPLE VACATIONS may obtain information from you when you enter a sweepstakes, contest or promotion; or when you request information about various vacation packages we offer; or when you make travel arrangements using our web site; or if you contact APPLE VACATIONS using our web site. If you contact APPLE VACATIONS, we may keep a record of that correspondence. Wherever APPLE VACATIONS collects personal information we make an effort to include a link to this Privacy Policy on that page.

Personal information that we may request from you in order to provide you with our product could include your vendor number, name, date of birth, address, E-mail address, IATA number, password, credit card number, credit card expiration date, check number, and the amount that is being charged or paid. This personal information is collected when you voluntarily complete the online form which requests this information, when you opt to receive promotional information via e-mail during the online reservation process, and/or when you make a purchase on our site. The information you provide can be used to provide you with a product, to send promotional information, collect payment for our product, and/or to allow you access to our online services. To amend information given in the (VPP) Vacation Preference Profile click on the “Change Profile” link under the “Win a Free Vacation” section of the site. To amend information collected while purchasing a product online please contact APPLE VACATIONS directly.

**Security**  
During some instances when you are required to log in, you will be asked for a password and/or a User ID. These are both unique and regarded as confidential; consequently, they should be carefully guarded. Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords, User IDs, and/or any account information.

Sending personal information over the Internet always involves some measure of risk. To mitigate this risk, APPLE VACATIONS has implemented technology and systems which ensure that the information you provide is secure and protected. In those instances when you are asked to submit private information such as a credit card number, you can be assured that we have security measures in place to protect this information. A secure server which encrypts all information before sending it using the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol transmits the information you provide to us. It is only decrypted after reaching APPLE VACATIONS servers. APPLE VACATIONS also employs the use of "Electronic Signatures" for credit card processing in accordance with the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act.

_**Is any information ever automatically collected?**_  
As previously stated, we do not automatically gather any personal information about you. However, for those users of our Apple Online Booking Engine, we facilitate the use of that portion of our site by sending a cookie to your browser designed to help us provide you with a customized experience. This cookie is not configured to provide us with any personally identifying information such as your name or credit card number. It does include the date you logged on and the number of times you logged on to our site in a 24-hour period. After that 24-hour period, this cookie expires. Most web browsers allow you to exercise control of cookie files on your computer by erasing them, blocking them, or notifying you when such a file is stored. Consult your web browser documentation for instructions on how to control this function.

_**How does Apple Vacations use my information?**_  
APPLE VACATIONS' primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you, the user, with a customized experience on our site. This includes tour packages to meet your travel plans, budget and other concerns, interactive communications, and other types of services, which are completely free to you. APPLE VACATIONS may advertise certain hotels, destinations, or excursions. By knowing a little about you, APPLE VACATIONS is able to deliver more relevant advertisements, packages, and vacation plans to you. In this process, the advertiser never has access to individual information. Only APPLE VACATIONS has access to individual information. You will only receive special offers via E-mail from APPLE VACATIONS if you have indicated that you would like to receive them. You can change your request to receive mails at any time.

APPLE VACATIONS does research on our user's demographics, interests, and behaviors based upon the information provided to us through our web site. We do this to better understand and serve our users. This research is compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis. APPLE VACATIONS may share this aggregated data with advertisers or business partners such as affiliated companies USA3000 Airlines & AM Resorts.

_**Who is collecting information?**_  
When you are using APPLE VACATIONS site and are asked for personal information, you are sharing that information with APPLE VACATIONS alone, unless it is specifically stated otherwise. If data is being collected and/or maintained by any company other than APPLE VACATIONS you will be notified prior to the time of the data collection or transfer. If you do not want your data to be shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer by not using that particular service.

Promotions that run on APPLE VACATIONS' web site may be cosponsored by APPLE VACATIONS and another company. Some or all data collected during a promotion may be shared with the sponsor or co-sponsor. If data will be shared, you will be notified prior to the time of data collection or transfer. You can decide not to participate in the promotion if you don't want your data to be shared.

Please be aware that APPLE VACATIONS advertisers or web sites that have links on our site may collect personally identifiable information about you. The information practices of those web sites linked to APPLE VACATIONS are not covered by this privacy statement.

_**With Whom does APPLE VACATIONS share my information?**_  
As a general rule, APPLE VACATIONS will not disclose any of your personally identifiable information except when we have your permission or under special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that the law requires it. APPLE VACATIONS may also disclose account information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be violating APPLE VACATIONS Fair Trade Contract or may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) APPLE VACATIONS' rights or property, other APPLE VACATIONS' users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. APPLE VACATIONS may disclose or access account information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it and for administrative and other purposes that we deem necessary to maintain, service, and improve our products and services.

APPLE VACATIONS may from time to time, send you E-mail regarding our products and services. In addition, if you indicated that you are interested in receiving offers or information from APPLE VACATIONS, we may occasionally send you direct mail about products and services that we feel may be of interest to you. Only APPLE VACATIONS (or agents working on behalf or in partnership with APPLE VACATIONS and under confidentiality agreements) will send you these direct mailings and only if you indicated that you do not object to these offers. If you do not want to receive such mailings, simply tell us when you give us your personal information. Or, at any time, you can easily edit your APPLE VACATIONS information to no longer receive such offers and mailings.

APPLE VACATIONS does not sell or rent user information to anyone. We will notify you at the time of data collection or transfer if your data will be shared with a third party and you will always have the option of not permitting the transfer. If you do not wish to allow your data to be shared, you can choose not to participate in certain promotions or contests.

_**What else should I know about my privacy?**_  
Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online--for example on message boards, through E-mail, or in chat areas--that information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.

Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any account information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you are online.
