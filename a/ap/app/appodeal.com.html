Please note that cookie-based opt-outs are not effective on mobile applications. However, on many mobile Devices, application users may opt out of certain mobile ads via their Device settings or by downloading the AppChoices mobile application offered by the Digital Advertising Alliance.</p><p>The online advertising industry also provides websites from which you may opt-out of receiving targeted ads from our data partners and our other advertising partners that participate in self-regulatory programs. You can access these, and also learn more about targeted advertising and consumer choice and privacy, at <a href="//networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="_blank">networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a>, or <a href="//www.youronlinechoices.eu/" target="_blank">www.youronlinechoices.eu</a>&nbsp;and <a href="//www.aboutads.info/choices/" target="_blank">www.aboutads.info/choices/</a>.

For example, if you have opted-out on your computer browser, that opt-out will not be effective on your mobile Device. You must separately opt-out on each Device.

These advertisements provide a mechanism to opt-out of the advertising partners’ use of this information for interest-based advertising purposes.</p><h3>7.
