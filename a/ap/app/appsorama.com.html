Your use of the AoR Sites and any personal information you provide on the AoR Sites remain subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use. If you access the AoR Sites from a third-party social networking site, you may also be required to read and accept the third party's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.</p><br><br><h3>THE INFORMATION AOR COLLECTS</h3><p><i>User Provided Information through Facebook</i></p><p>AoR's primary objective in collecting user information is to provide and enhance the AoR Sites and to enable users to easily navigate and enjoy the AoR Sites. When you use the AoR Sites, we may collect and record the information you provide us voluntarily through www.facebook.com ("Facebook") in accordance with the policies and terms of Facebook.</p><br><p>The types of personal information collected may vary depending on the activity.

Web Beacons) which are used to track the online usage patterns of our Users anonymously. No personally identifiable information from your AoR account is collected using these clear gifs. In addition, we may use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our Users to track which emails are opened by recipients. The information is used to enable more accurate reporting, improve the effectiveness of our marketing, and make AoR Sites better for our Users.</p><p><i>Flash LSOs</i></p><p>We use local shared objects, also known as Flash cookies, to store your preferences, such as volume control or high game score, or to display content to personalize your visit based upon what you view on our site. Third parties, with whom we partner to provide certain features on our site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity, use Flash cookies to collect and store information.</p><p>Flash cookies are different from browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored.

AoR is not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these public areas of the site. Your display name (not your email address) may be displayed to other Users when you upload images or videos or send messages through the AoR Sites and other Users can contact you through messages and comments. Any images, captions, videos or other content that you submit to the AoR Sites may be redistributed through the Internet and other media channels, and may be viewed by the general public.</p><p>We may use your email address for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of major AoR Site changes, new messages in your inbox, for customer service purposes, or if you are a potential winner in a sweepstakes). We use both your personally identifiable information and certain non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous User usage data, cookies, IP addresses, browser type, clickstream data, etc.) to improve the quality and design of the AoR Sites and to create new features, promotions, functionality, and services by storing, tracking, and analyzing User preferences and trends.<br>We use cookies, clear gifs, and log file information to: (a) retain information so that you will not be required to re-enter it during your visits to the AoR Sites; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns; (d) monitor aggregate metrics, including total number of visitors and traffic; (e) track your entries, submissions, and status in promotions, sweepstakes, and contests; (f) diagnose or fix technical problems reported by Users or engineers that are associated with the IP addresses controlled by a specific web company or ISP; and (g) access your information after you sign in.</p><br><br><h3>WHEN AOR DISCLOSES INFORMATION</h3><p>AoR will not share, sell, rent or trade your personal information other than as described in this privacy policy.</p><p>We provide personally identifiable information and non-personally-identifiable information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies, or other businesses or persons for the purpose of processing such information on our behalf, including credit card processing. We require that our subsidiaries, affiliated companies, or other businesses or persons agree to process such information in compliance with our Privacy Policy and we use reasonable efforts, including confidentiality and security measures, to limit their use of such information.</p><p>We use a third party payment gateway. If you choose to make a purchase within one of our applications, you will be transferred to a third party payment gateway to make the payment. The third party then provides AoR the name on the account and the amount paid so that we may complete the transaction.</p><p>We do share non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous User usage data, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third-parties to assist them in understanding the usage patterns for certain content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality on the AoR Site. AoR may share personally-identifiable information and/or non-personally-identifiable information with third party-affiliates and business partners for the purpose of offering greater functionality and enhanced services through AoR or other sites, and for the purpose of communicating these services to you.</p><p>We may release personally identifiable information and/or non-personally-identifiable information if required to do so by law, or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws (such as U.S. Copyright Law) or respond to a court order, subpoena, or search warrant.</p><p>It may be necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities, including but not limited to, fraud, potential threats to public safety or the physical safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Use, or as otherwise permitted by law.</p><p>AoR also reserves the right to disclose personally identifiable information and/or non-personally identifiable information that AoR believes, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to enforce our Terms of Use, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend itself against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, to protect the security or integrity of our the AoR Sites, and to exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of AoR, our Users or others.</p><br><br><h3>YOUR CHOICES</h3><p>You may, of course, decline to submit personally identifiable information through the AoR Sites, in which case AoR may not be able to provide certain services to you. Please note that media files uploaded by Users to the AoR Sites cannot be removed and remain subject to our Terms of Use.</p><p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personally identifiable information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p><p>If you have any questions or comments about security on our Web site or this Privacy Policy, you can email us at <a href="mailto:info@appsorama.com">info@appsorama.com</a>.</p><br><br><h3>THIRD-PARTY ADVERTISERS, LINKS TO OTHER SITES</h3><p>AoR allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the AoR Sites. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the AoR Sites. These third-parties automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content.</p><p>AoR does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent. However, please note that if an advertiser asks AoR to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men ages 18-34) or audience segment (for example, men ages 18-24 who have viewed certain channels of content) and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the target audience.<br>You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks. This Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites.</p><br><br><h3>OUR COMMITMENT TO DATA SECURITY</h3><p>AoR uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to AoR and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, AoR makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.</p><p>If AoR learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective measures. AoR may post a notice on the AoR Sites if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive a free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice) you should notify us by using the contact Information in this statement.</p><br><br><h3>OUR COMMITMENT TO CHILDREN'S PRIVACY</h3><p>Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important to AoR.
