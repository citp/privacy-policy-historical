This privacy policy applies to the Site and all products and services offered, managed or maintained by AppeProPo, Inc.

**PERSONAL DATA AND IDENTIFICATION INFORMATION**  
Personal data means any information capable of identifying an individual. It does not include anonymized data. We may process the following categories of personal data about you:

We may collect personal identification information from Users in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to: when Users visit our site or make use of the Service; register on the site or Service; place an order; subscribe to the newsletter; respond to a survey; fill out a form; and in connection with other activities, services, features or resources we make available on our Site or Service. These methods and the use is outlined below in How We Use Collected Information.

**IN APP SHARING OF CUSTOMIZED APP DATA**

The Service, among other things, permits Users (the "Customizing User") to create a customized version of the Service (the "User Customized App") which is accessible to Users (the "Customized Users") that are invited or otherwise selected by the Customizing User to download the User Customized App. Each Customizing User would have access and a right to use most, if not all, of the information, photographs, video, audio and other material and data that you provide through the use of the User Customized App, some of which is likely to be or include personally identifiable information (the "Customized App Data").   
By way of example, if Jane Doe was getting married, she might decide to make use of the Service by creating a User Customized App for use by her family, friends and all the other expected guests at her wedding. Ms. Doe would have access to all photographs, information and other Customized App Data that you provide through the User Customized App and Ms. Doe could elect to share such Customized App Data with such Customized Users or other third parties through the User Customized App or otherwise.

**DATA RETENTION**

We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.

When deciding what the correct time is to keep the data for we look at its amount, nature and sensitivity, potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure, the processing purposes, if these can be achieved by other means and legal requirements.

For tax purposes the law requires us to keep basic information about our customers (including Contact, Identity, Financial and Transaction Data) for six years after they stop being customers.

If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please email us at legal@appycouple.com.

You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive or refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.

We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.

We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you.

If you are not happy with any aspect of how we collect and use your data, you have the right to complain to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), the UK supervisory authority for data protection issues (www.ico.org.uk). We should be grateful if you would contact us first if you do have a complaint so that we can try to resolve it for you.

**SHARING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION**

Other than as provided herein, we do not sell, trade, or rent Users' personal identification information to others. We may share generic aggregated demographic information not linked to any personal identification information regarding visitors and users with our business partners, trusted affiliates and advertisers for the purposes outlined above. We may also share personal identification information to our commercial partners in the event that you elect voluntarily to process certain transactions through our Site or Service.

**DATA SECURITY**

We also allow access to your personal data only to those employees and partners who have a business need to know such data. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they must keep it confidential.

We have procedures in place to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach if we are legally required to.

**INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS**

Countries outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) do not always offer the same levels of protection to your personal data, so European law has prohibited transfers of personal data outside of the EEA unless the transfer meets certain criteria.

Many of our third parties service providers are based outside the European Economic Area (EEA) so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.

Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we do our best to ensure a similar degree of security of data by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is in place:

  * We will only transfer your personal data to countries that the European Commission have approved as providing an adequate level of protection for personal data by; or
  * Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts or codes of conduct or certification mechanisms approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe; or
  * If we use US-based providers that are part of EU-US Privacy Shield, we may transfer data to them, as they have equivalent safeguards in place.



If none of the above safeguards is available, we may request your explicit consent to the specific transfer. You will have the right to withdraw this consent at any time.
