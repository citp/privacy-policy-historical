We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is also used to gather broad demographic traffic information. 

Traffic Data records the visitor's domain name or IP address of the ISP from which the user is logged on.

We may share information about visitors and traffic results with advertisers, for example, the number of visitors to our pages.

Data created by a Web server that is stored on a user's computer. It provides a way for the Web site to keep track of a user's patterns and preferences and, with the cooperation of the Web browser, to store them on the user's own hard disk._

_The cookies contain a range of URLs (addresses) for which they are valid. When the browser encounters those URLs again, it sends those specific cookies to the Web server. For example, if a user's ID were stored as a cookie, it would save that person from typing in the same information all over again when accessing that service for the second and subsequent time._

Our site uses cookies to keep track of your shopping cart User ID, to limit voting to keep counts accurate, and to make sure you don't see the same ad repeatedly. We also use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests, and to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our site. 

Sometimes we use an outside ad company to display ads on our site. These ads may contain cookies. Other companies' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one. Advertisers or other companies do not have access to Applelinks cookies.
