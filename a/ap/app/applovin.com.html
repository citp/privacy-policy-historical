                    <h3>Opt-Out:</h3>
                    <p>We make it easy to opt-out of ourtargeted advertising services. In order to do so, simply visit the <a href="/optout">Opt Out section</a> on the Site. Please note that even if you opt-out, you may still receive content and advertising from AppLovin. Opting-out just means that the advertisements you do receive from us will not be targeted in any sort of way.</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>You may control how your browser responds to cookies by adjusting the privacy and security settings of your web browser.</li>
                      <li>You may limit the disclosure of certain Non-Personal Information by your mobile Device to us and Publishers by adjusting the settings on your mobile Device. For iOS mobile Devices, go to “Settings” from your Device’s homescreen; scroll down to “Privacy”; select “Advertising”; and turn on “Limit Ad Tracking.” For Android mobile Devices, go to “Google Settings” on your Device; select “Ads”; and check the box labeled “Opt Out of Interest-Based Ads.”</li>

We request that such individuals do not provide personal information through the Services. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with information without their consent, he or she should promptly <a href="/contact">contact us</a> and we take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is deleted from our files.</p>
                    <p>If a partner flags their application or mobile website as directed towards children under 13, we will not collect any information on these users for behavioral marketing, profile building, or remarketing purposes.</p>

                    <h2 id="nine">9. Data Security, Integrity and Retention</h2>
                    <p>Your privacy is very important to AppLovin and we are committed to protecting your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. We have implemented physical, technical and administrative security measures for the Services that comply with applicable laws and industry standards. For example, we use firewalls, encryption technology and other automated software designed to protect against fraud and identity theft.</p>
                    <p>In addition, we take steps to ensure that information is stored in an anonymous format through a technique known as “<a href="#hasheddata">hashing</a>”. When a Consumer downloads and uses an App or website that requests AppLovin to serve advertisements, we may collect and process information locally on the Consumer’s mobile device. This allows us to identify the sensitivity level of certain <a href="#deviceinformation">device information</a> prior to transferring it to our servers for storage. Rather than sending sensitive device information as <a href="#rawdata">raw data</a> that can be easily associated with the relevant Consumer, we only transfers anonymous hashed representations of certain types of information back to AppLovin. Our servers then associate the hashed representations with a unique anonymous identifier assigned to each Consumer by AppLovin. When a Consumer subsequently interacts with the Services, this process allows us targeted advertising without storing any sensitive information in a form that would be easily readable to unauthorized third parties.</p>
                    <p>AppLovin also protects Consumer privacy by seeking to minimize the amount of sensitive data that we store on our servers in the first place. For additional information regarding how we store data, please refer to the <a href="/yourprivacy">Consumer Privacy</a> portion of the Site. You may also <a href="/contact">contact us</a> anytime with your questions or concerns.</p>
                    <p> AppLovin retains the raw data it collects from Consumers for up to 2 years. The information received from Business Partners is retained for as long as needed to provide you services. We will retain and use the information we receive for as long as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>
                    <h2 id="ten">10. Changes to the Policy</h2>
                    <p>We may, in our sole discretion, make changes to the Policy from time to time in order to accommodate new technologies, industry practices, regulatory requirements or for other purposes. The most recent version of the Policy will always be posted on the Site. If we do make any changes, we will also update the “Effective Date” posted at the top of the Policy. If we make any material changes we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) or by means of a notice on this Site prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage you to review the Policy periodically to ensure that you understand how we collect, use and share information through the Services.</p>
                    <p>Any changes to the Policy will become effective when the revised Policy is posted on the Site. By continuing to use the Services following such changes, you are agreeing to accept the terms of the revised Policy.</p>

                    <h3 id="aggregateinformation">Aggregate Information.</h3>
                    <p>Aggregate information refers to de-identified information about groups or particular types of individuals that use the Services. Such information does not identify you as a particular individual. An example of aggregate information would include the total number people that accessed an AppLovin App from a particular region or while using a specific type of mobile device.</p>

If anonymous information is ever directly or indirectly associated with personal information, AppLovin will also treat the combination of data as personal information.</p>
                    <h3 id="applovinapps">AppLovin Apps.</h3>
                    <p>AppLovin Apps means the mobile applications within our network of application publishers and developers.</p>

                    <p>Cookies are small pieces of information that your internet browser places on the hard drive of your device when you visit a website.

                    <h3 id="deviceinformation">Device Information.</h3>
                    <p>Device information refers to the information automatically collected from a Consumer’s device by our SDK. Such information may be processed locally, or transferred to AppLovin for processing and/or storage. AppLovin may collect and/or store device information as <a href="#rawdata">raw</a> or <a href="#hasheddata">hashed</a> data. For a complete list of the device information we collect from Consumers, please refer to the <a href="#three">Information We Collect From Consumers</a> section of the Policy.</p>
                    <h3 id="hasheddata">Hashed Data.</h3>
                    <p>Hashing is a technique that anonymizes data. Storing information as hashed data allows AppLovin to associate certain information with a Consumer without directly affiliating him or her with personal information. AppLovin stores sensitive information in hashed form to help protect the privacy of such Consumers while providing the Services. Please refer to the <a href="#nine">Data Security, Integrity and Retention</a> of the Policy or the <a href="/yourprivacy">Consumer Privacy</a> portion of the Site for additional information about how we use “hashing” to safeguard Consumer information.</p>

                    <p>Personal information means information that can be used, either directly or indirectly, to contact you or identify you as a particular individual.</p>
                    <h3 id="rawdata">Raw Data.</h3>

By downloading and using an AppLovin App, Consumers grant the application developer with permission to collect such device information and share it with AppLovin. AppLovin may track this information over time and across multiple AppLovin Apps (and may also combine the device information with anonymous information from other sources) in order to deliver targeted advertisements through the Services.</p>
                    <h3 id="webbeacons">Web Beacons.</h3>
                    <p>A web beacon (sometimes referred to as a “pixel tag” or a “clear GIFs”) is a programming code that can be used to display an image on a website, email or other communication. Web beacons are typically one-pixel, transparent images and are used to transfer an individual’s unique user identification (often in the form of a cookie) to a database in order to associate that individual with previously acquired information about him or her in a database. AppLovin uses web beacons keep track of certain online behavior (e.g., the websites you visit, the mobile applications you use, your interaction with AppLovin emails etc.) in order to help us to determine the types of things that you find the most interesting.</p>
