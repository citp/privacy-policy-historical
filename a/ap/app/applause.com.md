Below you will find detailed information about rights relating to the processing of your personal data: [For usability purposes, the following information may be hidden at first and only appear at the user’s request as a multi-layer presentation (“layered information”)]

**I. Right to access**  
As a data subject you have a right to obtain access and information under the conditions in accordance with Article 15 of the General Data Protection Regulation.   


This means in particular that you have the right to obtain confirmation from us as to whether we are processing your personal data. If so, you also have the right to obtain access to the personal data and the information listed in Article 15 paragraph 1 of the General Data Protection Regulation. This includes information regarding the purposes of processing, the categories of personal data that are being processed and the recipients or categories of recipients to whom the personal data has been or will be disclosed (points (a), (b) and (c) of Article 15 paragraph 1 of the General Data Protection Regulation).  


You can find the full extent of your right to access and information in Article 15 of the General Data Protection Regulation, which can be accessed using the following link: <http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679>.  


**II. Right to rectification**   
As a data subject, you have the right to rectification under the conditions provided in Article 16 of the General Data Protection Regulation.  


This means in particular that you have the right to receive from us without undue delay the rectification of inaccuracies in your personal data and completion of incomplete personal data. You can find the full extent of your right to rectification in Article 16 of the GDPR, which can be accessed using the following link: <http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679>.   


**III. Right to erasure (“right to be forgotten”)**  
As a data subject, you have a right to erasure (“right to be forgotten”) under the conditions provided in Article 17 of the General Data Protection Regulation.  


If we have made the personal data public and are obliged to erase it, we are also obliged, taking account of available technology and the cost of implementation, to take reasonable steps, including technical measures, to inform data controllers which are processing the personal data that you have requested the erasure by such data controllers of any links to, or copy or replication of that personal data (Article 17 paragraph 2 of the General Data Protection Regulation).  


The right to erasure (“right to be forgotten”) does not apply if processing is necessary for one of the reasons listed in Article 17 paragraph 3 of the General Data Protection Regulation. This can be the case, for example, if processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims (points (a) and (e) of Article 17 paragraph 3 of the General Data Protection Regulation).  


You can find the full extent of your right to erasure (“right to be forgotten”) in Article 17 of the GDPR, which can be accessed using the following link: <http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679>.   


**IV. Right to the restriction of processing**   
As a data subject, you have the right to restrict processing under the conditions provided in Article 18 of the General Data Protection Regulation.   


This means that you have the right to obtain from us the restriction of processing if one of the conditions provided in Article 18 paragraph 1 of the General Data Protection Regulation applies. This can be the case, for example, if you contest the accuracy of the personal data. In such a case, the restriction of processing lasts for a period that enables us to verify the accuracy of the personal data (point (a) of Article 18 paragraph 1 of the General Data Protection Regulation). Restriction means that stored personal data is marked with the goal of restricting their future processing (Article 4 paragraph 3 of the General Data Protection Regulation).  


You can find the full extent of your right to restriction of processing in Article 18 of the GDPR, which can be accessed using the following link: <http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679>.   


**V. Right to data portability**  
As a data subject, you have a right to data portability under the conditions provided in Article 20 of the General Data Protection Regulation.  


This means that you generally have the right to receive your personal data with which you have provided us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and to transmit that data to another data controller without hindrance from us if processing is based on consent pursuant to point (a) of Article 6 paragraph 1 or point (a) of Article 9 paragraph 2 of the General Data Protection Regulation or on a contract pursuant to point (b) of Article 6 paragraph 1 of the General Data Protection Regulation and processing is carried out by automated means (Article 20 paragraph 1 of the General Data Protection Regulation).  


You can find information as to whether an instance of processing is based on consent pursuant to point (a) of Article 6 paragraph 1 or point (a) of Article 9 paragraph 2 of the General Data Protection Regulation or on a contract pursuant to point (b) of Article 6 paragraph 1 of the General Data Protection Regulation in the information regarding the legal basis of processing in Section C of this Data Privacy Policy.  


In exercising your right to data portability, you also generally have the right to have your personal data transmitted directly from us to another data controller if technically feasible (Article 20 paragraph 2 of the General Data Protection Regulation). You can find the full extent of your right data portability in Article 20 of the General Data Protection Regulation, which can be accessed using the following link: <http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679>.   


**VI. Right to object**  
As a data subject, you have a right to object under the conditions provided in Article 21 of the General Data Protection Regulation.

## Applause’s Security Philosophy: Our Commitment to You

As a provider of software and services for many users on the Internet, Applause recognizes the importance of effectively and continuously protecting user security. We understand that secure products are instrumental in sustaining the trust that you place in our products and services, and we strive to create innovative products serve your needs and operate in your best interests. The security of your personal information is important to us; please be assured that we have adequate security measures in place to protect and secure end user information.

For additional information relative to Applause’s Information Security Program and its underlying policies & procedures, please email your request to support@applause.com or testers@utest.com.

**A Shared Security Responsibility Environment**

We have designed our products to be flexible, scalable, and robustly configurable to our users and the needs of our user organizations. This means that, at the application level, access restrictions, account delegation, user rights and the implementation of additional security controls are often left to the discretion of our end users. While we commit to securing the underlying system architecture, code, and the information we collect, we trust our users to share the responsibility of securing access to data that is ultimately placed in their respective product instances. This includes all data entered through the Platform interface into the instance, the user accounts you provision to access your instance(s), and the associated user roles and groups that enable various access-levels of those users. For this reason, we recommends that users of the Platform maintain sufficient controls to provide reasonable assurance of the following standards:

  * Protect access to your account: Access to the Applause Platform should be restricted to authorized users, and user names and passwords should be kept confidential.
  * Protect the integrity of your data: Users are responsible for the accuracy, quality, integrity and legality of information entered into accounts and for the quality and performance of the Platform with respect to user-configurations of accounts.
  * Report security vulnerabilities: Users are responsible for reporting issues and incidents related to information security, and following up on the status of those issues to ensure they are resolved, in accordance with the process outlined below.



**Need to Report a Security Vulnerability?**

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability within any of Applause’s product offerings, we encourage you to let us know right away.

If you are an Applause Platform customer and have a security issue to report regarding your personal account, or have discovered a vulnerability in an Applause product, please contact your assigned Project Manager directly or report the incident via email to support@applause.com.

If you are an Applause Community member and have a security issue to report regarding your personal Applause account, or have discovered a vulnerability in an Applause product, please contact your assigned Community Manager and report the incident via email to testers@utest.com.

Applause takes security issues seriously and will respond swiftly to fix verifiable security issues. Some of the components that make up the Applause Platform are complex and take time to update. When properly notified of legitimate security issues, Applause personnel will do their best to acknowledge your emailed report, assign resources to investigate the issue and mitigate potential problems as efficiently and effectively as possible.

**Overview of Platform Security Controls**

We offer a variety of services and solutions through our software-as-a-service cloud offering to customers and community testers, including dashboard analytics, reporting, test services execution, test cycle management, and test cycle analytics. We have designed our Information Security (“InfoSec”) Program around supporting security of the core application, infrastructure, and data components that support our core testing service offerings (“the Platform”). The InfoSec Program and its underlying policies apply to all users of the Applause Platform, including all employees, customers, community testers and other third parties.

Applause provides a host of advanced functionality to secure the Platform including role-based access, strong connection encryption, robust password policies and more. Applause adds further layers of security, such as application-only access, to provide users complete confidence in the Platform and their data.

Applause employs stringent, 24/7 monitoring tools, controls, policies and procedures to ensure that it provides the strongest security for its users.

Key benefits and features of Applause’s commitment to security include:

  * Role-level Access & Idle Disconnect: Role-based access control ensures users can only use data and Platform functionality that is related to their specific responsibilities, as dictated by their account administrator. Additionally, Applause automatically locks the Platform when idle connections are detected to prevent unauthorized access. Finally, the Platform natively provides a complete audit trail to ensure changes within a user account or customer instance are tracked with user login details and timestamp.
  * Physical Access: Applause leverages a third party provider to provide physical access security to the Platform infrastructure. All data center access is limited to data center technicians and approved Applause staff.
  * Strong SSL Encryption: Applause provides SSL encryption for user login and all subsequent data.
  * Application-Only Access: Applause ensures that external users of the Platform can only access the application, not the underlying database.
  * Employee Access: No Applause employees, partners, or contractors ever access private customer repositories or accounts unless required through our standard service obligations or for specific support reasons. When working a support issue, we do our best to respect your privacy and the security of your data as much as possible; we only access the files and settings as required through the resolution of your issue.
  * Strong Password Policies: Applause provides various password policies to prevent unauthorized access to user accounts, including minimum password length and complexity requirements, password repetition controls, and automatic lock-out after unsuccessful login attempts.
  * Continuous Security Monitoring: Applause employs intrusion detection systems to identify malicious traffic attempting to access the Platform network. Any unauthorized connection attempts are logged and appropriately investigated. Applause also employs numerous performance and utilization monitoring solutions for the Platform infrastructure.
  * Risk Management: Enterprise-grade anti-virus software guards against Trojans, worms, viruses, and other malware from affecting the Platform and its underlying components. Encryption is required on all removable media (employee laptops, thumb-drives, etc.) that contains or has access to sensitive Platform data.
  * Separation of Duties: Job responsibilities are separated, and mandatory employee reference checks are employed at all levels of Applause operations. Applause tracks and maintains any and all exceptions to standard segregation of duties policies and associated access permission changes.
  * Communication: Applause maintains robust communication protocols and procedures to ensure that all policy and system changes that impact security are timely communicated to Platform users through the application interface. In the event emergency communication is needed, Applause also supports alternative methods of communication to users, including email notifications and alerts.
