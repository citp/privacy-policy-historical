**Applause’s Security Philosophy: Our Commitment to You**

As a provider of software and services for many users on the Internet, Applause recognizes the importance of effectively and continuously protecting user security. We understand that secure products are instrumental in sustaining the trust that you place in our products and services, and we strive to create innovative products serve your needs and operate in your best interests. The security of your personal information is important to us; please be assured that we have adequate security measures in place to protect and secure end user information.

For additional information relative to Applause’s Information Security Program and its underlying policies & procedures, please email your request to [support@applause.com](mailto:support@applause.com) or [testers@utest.com](mailto:testers@utest.com).

_A Shared Security Responsibility Environment_

We have designed our products to be flexible, scalable, and robustly configurable to our users and the needs of our user organizations. This means that, at the application level, access restrictions, account delegation, user rights and the implementation of additional security controls are often left to the discretion of our end users. While we commit to securing the underlying system architecture, code, and the information we collect, we trust our users to share the responsibility of securing access to data that is ultimately placed in their respective product instances. This includes all data entered through the Platform interface into the instance, the user accounts you provision to access your instance(s), and the associated user roles and groups that enable various access-levels of those users. For this reason, we recommends that users of the Platform maintain sufficient controls to provide reasonable assurance of the following standards:

  * **Protect access to your account:** Access to the Applause Platform should be restricted to authorized users, and user names and passwords should be kept confidential.
  * **Protect the integrity of your data:** Users are responsible for the accuracy, quality, integrity and legality of information entered into accounts and for the quality and performance of the Platform with respect to user-configurations of accounts.
  * **Report security vulnerabilities:** Users are responsible for reporting issues and incidents related to information security, and following up on the status of those issues to ensure they are resolved, in accordance with the process outlined below.



**Need to Report a Security Vulnerability?**

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability within any of Applause’s product offerings, we encourage you to let us know right away.

If you are an Applause Platform customer and have a security issue to report regarding your personal account, or have discovered a vulnerability in an Applause product, please contact your assigned Project Manager directly or report the incident via email to [support@applause.com](mailto:support@applause.com).

If you are an Applause Community member and have a security issue to report regarding your personal Applause account, or have discovered a vulnerability in an Applause product, please contact your assigned Community Manager and report the incident via email to [testers@utest.com](mailto:testers@utest.com).

Applause takes security issues seriously and will respond swiftly to fix verifiable security issues. Some of the components that make up the Applause Platform are complex and take time to update. When properly notified of legitimate security issues, Applause personnel will do their best to acknowledge your emailed report, assign resources to investigate the issue and mitigate potential problems as efficiently and effectively as possible.

**Overview of Platform Security Controls**

We offer a variety of services and solutions through our software-as-a-service cloud offering to customers and community testers, including dashboard analytics, reporting, test services execution, test cycle management, and test cycle analytics. We have designed our Information Security (“InfoSec”) Program around supporting security of the core application, infrastructure, and data components that support our core testing service offerings (“the Platform”). The InfoSec Program and its underlying policies apply to all users of the Applause Platform, including all employees, customers, community testers and other third parties.

Applause provides a host of advanced functionality to secure the Platform including role-based access, strong connection encryption, robust password policies and more. Applause adds further layers of security, such as application-only access, to provide users complete confidence in the Platform and their data.

Applause employs stringent, 24/7 monitoring tools, controls, policies and procedures to ensure that it provides the strongest security for its users.

Key benefits and features of Applause’s commitment to security include:

  * _Role-level Access & Idle Disconnect:_ Role-based access control ensures users can only use data and Platform functionality that is related to their specific responsibilities, as dictated by their account administrator. Additionally, Applause automatically locks the Platform when idle connections are detected to prevent unauthorized access. Finally, the Platform natively provides a complete audit trail to ensure changes within a user account or customer instance are tracked with user login details and timestamp.
  * _Physical Access:_ Applause leverages a third party provider to provide physical access security to the Platform infrastructure. All data center access is limited to data center technicians and approved Applause staff.
  * _Strong SSL Encryption:_ Applause provides SSL encryption for user login and all subsequent data.
  * _Application-Only Access:_ Applause ensures that external users of the Platform can only access the application, not the underlying database.
  * _Employee Access:_ No Applause employees, partners, or contractors ever access private customer repositories or accounts unless required through our standard service obligations or for specific support reasons. When working a support issue, we do our best to respect your privacy and the security of your data as much as possible; we only access the files and settings as required through the resolution of your issue.
  * _Strong Password Policies:_ Applause provides various password policies to prevent unauthorized access to user accounts, including minimum password length and complexity requirements, password repetition controls, and automatic lock-out after unsuccessful login attempts.
  * _Continuous Security Monitoring:_ Applause employs intrusion detection systems to identify malicious traffic attempting to access the Platform network. Any unauthorized connection attempts are logged and appropriately investigated. Applause also employs numerous performance and utilization monitoring solutions for the Platform infrastructure.
  * _Risk Management:_ Enterprise-grade anti-virus software guards against Trojans, worms, viruses, and other malware from affecting the Platform and its underlying components. Encryption is required on all removable media (employee laptops, thumb-drives, etc.) that contains or has access to sensitive Platform data.
  * _Separation of Duties:_ Job responsibilities are separated, and mandatory employee reference checks are employed at all levels of Applause operations. Applause tracks and maintains any and all exceptions to standard segregation of duties policies and associated access permission changes.
  * _Communication:_ Applause maintains robust communication protocols and procedures to ensure that all policy and system changes that impact security are timely communicated to Platform users through the application interface. In the event emergency communication is needed, Applause also supports alternative methods of communication to users, including email notifications and alerts.
