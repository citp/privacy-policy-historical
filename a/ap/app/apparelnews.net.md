You can access the Privacy Policy any time by clicking on the footer on any page of the [ApparelNews.net](http://www.apparelnews.net/) website. **Your use of and/or registration on any aspect of the Website will constitute your agreement to this Privacy Policy.** If you cannot agree with the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Website. This Privacy Policy does not cover information collected elsewhere, including without limitation, sites linked to from the [Website](http://www.apparelnews.net/).

The Website generally collects personally identifying information with your specific knowledge and consent. For instance, when you enter a sweepstakes or contest, complete a survey, make a purchase, subscribe to our publication(s), or register for any portion of our services, you are asked to provide information such as your e-mail address, name, or phone number. Information such as your type of business and job function may also be requested.

Our servers may also automatically collect information about your computer when you visit the Website, including, without limitation, the type of browser software you use, the operating system you are running, the Website that referred you, and your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address. For example, we may want to know how long you spent on our site, or which pages or features you spent time with.

We will not sell, rent, swap, or authorize any third party to use your email address or any information that personally identifies you without your permission.

Service Provider uses personally identifying information you supply through the Website to provide you with the service you have requested. For example, if you subscribe to any of our publications, we may use your e-mail address to send you a confirmation notice and your mailing address to send you the publication. Similarly, if you enter an online sweepstakes, we will use this information to notify you if you are a winner. We may also use the information to communicate with you about new features, products, or services, and/or to improve the services that we offer by tailoring them to your needs.

While your personally identifying information is protected as outlined above, we reserve the right to use aggregated, anonymous data about our users as a group for such business purposes as analyzing usage trends and seeking compatible advertisers and partners.

In the event all or a portion of the assets owned or controlled by Service Provider, its parent, or any subsidiary or affiliated entity are sold, assigned, transferred, or acquired by another company, the information from and/or about our Website users may be among the transferred assets.
