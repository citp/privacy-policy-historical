# Read our Privacy Policy | Appboy

Last Revised May 30, 2013

Appboy collects information through the use of applications created and distributed by third party developers that integrate Appboy software or services ("Developer Applications"). This privacy policy describes Appboy’s collection of information from end users of mobile devices who have downloaded a Developer Application that integrates Appboy services and from visitors to our website.

This privacy policy does not govern any collection or disclosure of information by third parties, including Developer Applications. For a complete description of information gathered by any particular Developer Application, see the privacy policy for that Developer Application. If you believe an Developer Application uses Appboy software or services but does not have a privacy policy, contact us at [info@appboy.com](mailto:info@appboy.com).

Appboy collects information through use of Developer Applications, including:

Device Information \- We collect information about devices running Developer Applications, including platform, a unique Appboy-generated ID, OS version, IP address, carrier information, and a country code.

Application Usage Information \- We collect information about how Developer Applications are used, such as the frequency and duration of usage.

Website Information \- We may collect information provided on our website such as contact information or feedback. Additionally, we may use cookies and web beacons to monitor traffic patterns and collect information about previous visits to our web site.

Personally Identifiable Information \- We may collect personally identifiable information shared with Developer Applications. We may also collect personally identifiable information from third parties used for authentication, such as when a user logs in to a Developer Application using a Facebook account, and from third party partners such as Facebook, Twitter, and Klout. Personally identifiable information collected may include name, email address, location, gender, interests, device, app usage, user ID, and contact information.

Appboy may collect device location information if location services are enabled for any Developer Applications on the device. We use location information to provide Developers with information about the use of their Developer Applications and to assist in serving advertisements. Anonymous location information may be shared with advertising partners and Developers for their independent use. See the "Opt-out" section below for details on limiting the collection of location information.

Appboy Internal Use \- We use information we collect to provide partner Developers and advertisers with information about usage of Developer Applications that integrate the Appboy Service.

We will share information we collect with third parties only in ways described in this privacy statement.

We may disclose information we collect :

to third party advertising partners;

to third parties as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or similar legal process;

to third parties as we deem necessary, based on our good faith belief, (i) to protect our rights, user safety or the safety of others, (ii) to investigate fraud, or (iii) to respond to a government request;

to trusted services providers who work on our behalf, who do not have an independent use of the information we disclose to them, and who have agreed to adhere to the rules set forth in the privacy statement;

to third parties in conjunction with a merger, acquisition or sale of Appboy. If Appboy is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, affected users will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of this information, as well as any choices users may have regarding this information;

to advertisers and third-party advertising networks and as described below under the Section entitled Automatic Data Collection and Advertising;

to Developers in the form of aggregated, anonymous data about the way Developer Applications are used so that Developers can improve their respective Developer Applications. We use information about you collected from third party partners in compliance with the terms set forth by those third parties.

We automatically collect information about how Developer Applications are used, such as the frequency and duration of usage. This includes details about mobile devices, such as a unique Appboy-generated ID for the mobile device. We share anonymous information about use of Developer Applications with Developers and analytics companies, including which Developer Applications users have downloaded and the way those Developer Applications are used, which facilitates improvements to Developer Applications. We may also provide information about use of Developer Applications to our advertising partners.

You may opt out of the collection of location information by turning off location services for Developer Applications on your mobile device. You may opt out of the collection of personally identifiable information by not providing that information to Developer Applications. You can prevent collection of personally identifiable information from third parties such as Facebook or Twitter by not logging in to Developer Applications using your Facebook or Twitter account. You can prevent collection of all information by uninstalling Developer Applications that integrate the Appboy Service.

If you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to email [privacy@appboy.com](mailto:privacy@appboy.com).

Appboy will retain information collected throughout the life of each user’s use of Developer Applications except where prohibited by law. If you would like us to delete User Information and Automatically Collected information associated with your record, please contact us at [privacy@appboy.com](mailto:privacy@appboy.com). We will keep anonymous information and may need to retain some identifying information to ensure that your request continues to be honored. Your information will be deleted from our active database but may remain in our archives. If we are required to maintain certain information about you, we will comply with your deletion request after fulfilling any legal requirements.

We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with information without their consent, he or she should contact us at [privacy@appboy.com](mailto:privacy@appboy.com). We will delete such information from our files within a reasonable period of time.

We are concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information. We provide physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect information we process and maintain. For example, we limit access to this information to authorized employees who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our Services.

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. We will notify you of any changes to our Privacy Policy by posting the new Privacy Policy here, https://www.appboy.com/privacy. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes.

By using a Developer Application, you are consenting to our collection and processing of information as set forth in this Privacy Policy now and as amended by us. "Processing" means using cookies on a computer/hand held device or using or touching information in any way, including, but not limited to, collecting, storing, deleting, using, combining and disclosing information, all of which activities will take place in the United States. If you reside outside the U.S. your information will be transferred to the U.S., and processed and stored there under U.S. privacy standards. By using the Application and providing information to us, you consent to such transfer to, and processing in, the U.S.
