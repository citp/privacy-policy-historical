# Appboy Mobile App CRM

Last Revised January 3, 2012

Appboy collects information through the use of applications created and distributed by third party developers that integrate Appboy software or services ("Developer Applications"). This privacy policy governs Appboy’s collection of information from end users of mobile devices who have downloaded a Developer Application that integrates Appboy services but who have not registered with Appboy ("Non-Registered Users"). 

This privacy policy does not govern Appboy’s collection of information from end users who register with Appboy ("Registered Users"). Appboy’s collection of information from Registered Users is governed by the privacy policy found at https://www.appboy.com/privacy#registered.

This privacy policy does not govern any collection or disclosure of information by third parties, including developers. For information on third party information collection policies and practices, you must contact those individual third parties.

Appboy collects information through your use of Developer Applications, including:

Device Information \- We collect information about devices running Developer Applications, including platform, a unique Appboy-generated ID for your device, OS version, IP address, carrier information, and a country code.

Application Usage Information \- We collect information about how Developer Applications are used, such as the frequency and duration of usage.

Website Information \- We may collect information you provide on our website such as contact information or feedback. Additionally, we may use cookies and web beacons to monitor traffic patterns and collect information about your previous visits to our web site.

Personally Identifiable Information \- We do not collect personally identifiable information from Non-Registered Users. However, the unique Appboy-generated ID for your device could later be associated with personally identifiable information if you register as an Appboy user in the future.

Appboy may collect information about the location of your device if location services are enabled for any Developer Applications on your device. We use location information to provide Developers with information about the use of their Developer Applications and to assist in serving advertisements. Anonymous location information may be shared with advertising partners and Developers for their independent use. See the "Opt-out" section below for details on limiting the collection of location information.

Appboy Internal Use \- We use information collected from Non-Registered Users to provide partner Developers and advertisers with anonymous information about the usage of Developer Applications that integrate the Appboy Service.

We will share information collected from Non-Registered Users with third parties only in ways described in this privacy statement.

We may disclose information we collect from Non-Registered Users: 

to third parties as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or similar legal process; 

to third parties as we deem necessary, based on our good faith belief, (i) to protect our rights, your safety or the safety of others, (ii) to investigate fraud, or (iii) to respond to a government request;

to trusted services providers who work on our behalf, who do not have an independent use of the information we disclose to them, and who have agreed to adhere to the rules set forth in the privacy statement;

to third parties in conjunction with a merger, acquisition or sale of Appboy. If Appboy is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of this information, as well as any choices you may have regarding this information;

to advertisers and third-party advertising networks and as described below under the Section entitled Automatic Data Collection and Advertising;

to Developers in the form of aggregated, anonymous data about the way you use Developer Applications so that Developers can improve their respective Developer Applications.

We automatically collect information about your use of Developer Applications, such as the frequency and duration of usage. This includes details about your mobile device, such as a unique Appboy-generated ID for your mobile device. We share anonymous information about your use of Developer Applications with Developers and analytics companies, including which Developer Applications you have downloaded and the way you use those Developer Applications, which facilitates improvements to Developer Applications. We may also provide information about your use of Developer Applications to our advertising partners.

You may opt out of the collection of location information by turning off location services for Developer Applications on your mobile device. You can prevent collection of all information by disabling Appboy through the Settings screen in the Appboy user interface on a per-app basis, or by uninstalling Developer Applications that integrate the Appboy Service.

If you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to email [privacy@appboy.com](mailto:privacy@appboy.com).

Appboy will retain information about the use of Developer Applications by Non-Registered Users except where prohibited by law. Information collected from Non-Registered Users is anonymous and therefore we are unable to delete usage information regarding any particular Non-Registered User.

We do not use the Service to knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with information without their consent, he or she should contact us at [privacy@appboy.com](mailto:privacy@appboy.com). We will delete such information from our files within a reasonable period of time.

We are concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information. We provide physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect information we process and maintain. For example, we limit access to this information to authorized employees who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our Services.

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. We will notify you of any changes to our Privacy Policy by posting the new Privacy Policy here, https://www.appboy.com/privacy#nonregistered. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes.

By using a Developer Application, you are consenting to our collection and processing of information as set forth in this Privacy Policy now and as amended by us. "Processing" means using cookies on a computer/hand held device or using or touching information in any way, including, but not limited to, collecting, storing, deleting, using, combining and disclosing information, all of which activities will take place in the United States. If you reside outside the U.S. your information will be transferred to the U.S., and processed and stored there under U.S. privacy standards. By using the Application and providing information to us, you consent to such transfer to, and processing in, the U.S.
