## About this Privacy Policy

The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to explain:

  * the scope and application of this Privacy Policy;
  * the kind of personal information the Winning Group may collect about you and how we collect the information;
  * how we use your personal information;
  * how we may disclose your personal information;
  * how we protect the information we hold about you; and
  * how you can access the information we hold about you.



This Privacy Policy applies to personal information collected by the Winning Group by any means or technology and whether we have asked for the information or not. By using the websites operated by the Winning Group, or otherwise interacting with us in relation to the products and services offered by us (including at our retail stores, trade shows or participating in competitions or promotions offered by us), you consent to the Winning Group using your personal information as set out in this Privacy Policy. 

### Links to other sites

Our websites may contain links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by the Winning Group. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites and you access these sites at your own risk. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that you visit to identify how it collects and uses personal information.

## What kind of personal information do we collect and hold?

In the process of conducting our business, we are likely to collect a wide range of personal information about you. The type of personal information we collect generally includes your name, residential, shipping and billing addresses, email address, telephone or mobile numbers, as well as interests and information about your transactions with us or our business partners, including the products and services we provide to you. 

If you are accessing our products and services via our websites, we may use technology to collect information as to your activities, including the IP address of your computer (or other devices), your web browsing history on our websites and transactional data including your payment histories. 

We do not generally collect "sensitive information" (such as information about ethnic origin, religious or political views, health information etc) from you. 

If you are a participant of a competition organised by us, we may collect additional personal information from you. Please refer to the section "Competition Contestants" below for more information. 

### Credit card information

We do not store any credit card information obtained at our retail stores, by telephone or through our websites. We pass it onto our bank or where applicable, our supplier for processing. If you use PayPal to complete your transaction, your personal information (including credit card information) will be collected and used by PayPal in accordance with its privacy policy, which is available here: <https://www.paypal.com/au/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full>. 

We only retain the last 4 digits for verification of your credit card on delivery. In some instances we request a copy of your driver's licence and credit card to confirm delivery when you are not going to be at home or the products have been purchased as a gift to ensure the transaction is not fraudulent. This information is destroyed as soon as its accuracy is confirmed.

## How do we collect personal information?

The Winning Group collects personal information directly from you when you submit it online (including via email and live chats) to a website operated by the Winning Group, by telephone or facsimile, or in person at one of our stores or trade shows. 

There may also be occasions when we collect personal information from publicly available sources or third parties, such as via our business partners where we are responsible for delivering goods or services directly to you, or social media platforms such as Facebook or Twitter.

You have the option of not disclosing personal information to us or to use a pseudonym when dealing with us in relation to a particular matter, unless it is, in our view, impractical for us to deal with you that way or we are otherwise required by law or authorised by a court or tribunal to deal you on an identified basis.

## Disclosure of personal information

We never sell, rent, lease or disclose your personal information to other organisations, except as outlined in this Privacy Policy. Personal information provided to a member of the Winning Group may be shared with the Winning Group. In addition, we may disclose your personal information to organisations outside the Winning Group which assists us to deliver our products and services. These third parties are too numerous to list and they may change from time to time. Some examples of the types of such organisations include: 

  * our products and services suppliers, such as for supplying products ordered by you and providing services in relation to maintenance and repairs of products; 
  * financial services providers, such as our banks or third party supplier for securing payment of the products or services we provided to you, such as PayPal, and where applicable credit report agencies or debt collectors;
  * technology service providers, such as internet service providers, database management services, digital mail providers who send communications on our behalf, live help service providers and service providers for the prevention of fraud and protection of data;
  * service providers who performs market research or manage or review the services provided to you, such as Feefo or Bazaarvoice; 
  * mailing systems and courier companies which organise delivery of the products you have purchased; and
  * our professional advisers, accountants, lawyers and auditors. 



These third parties may be located in Australia or overseas, including but not limited to the United States and India. 

We require these organisations to maintain the confidentiality of your personal information and also seek to ensure that they adhere to the Australian Privacy Principles. These service providers are not permitted to use your personal information for their own marketing purposes. 

In addition, we may release your personal information under the following circumstances:

  * when required to do so by a court or under applicable laws or regulation (for example, a subpoena) or where requested by a government agency; 
  * where we consider a company or an individual may be engaged in fraudulent activity or other deceptive practices that a governmental agency should be made aware of; and 
  * to appropriate persons, where your communication suggests possible harm to others. 



### Rate and review

If you provide a review or rating for a product available on one or more of our websites, you agree that we may publish part or all of your review or rating together with your first name and suburb.

## Security

The Winning Group takes reasonable steps to ensure that your personal information is protected from misuse, interference or loss and unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. We have systems and procedures in place to protect your privacy whenever we collect, store, and use or disclose personal information. We regularly upgrade these systems and review our procedures to ensure high standards of security are used to protect your personal information. As a condition of working for the Winning Group all our employees sign a confidentiality agreement. However, since no system is 100% secure or error free, we cannot guarantee that your personal information is totally protected, for example, from hackers or misuse. If you enter personal information on our website, you should exercise due care to safeguard any passwords, ID number, or other special access features associated with your use of our website. 

We will take reasonable steps to destroy or permanently de-identify personal information from our systems which is no longer required by us. 

## How to access and amend personal information

We strive to keep your personal information accurate, up-to-date and complete. Our Privacy Policy enables you to find out what information we hold about you and correct that information if it is wrong.

If you become aware that any information we hold about you is incorrect or out-of-date, please let us know immediately. We will be happy to accept updated personal information in writing from the owner of that information at any time. However, in order to protect your privacy and security, we will take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting you access or enabling you to make corrections of your personal information. Depending on the nature of your request, we may ask the owner of the information to complete a personal information request form.

Our objective is to respond to any request within a reasonable timeframe and no later than 30 days. We will inform you if this timeframe is not achievable.

In some circumstances, the Winning Group may not be in a position to grant access to personal information, such circumstances include:

  * providing access is likely to pose a serious threat to the safety of an individual or publicly;
  * providing access is likely to unreasonably impact on the privacy of others;
  * the request for access is frivolous or vexations;
  * providing access would reveal information which relates to existing or anticipating legal proceedings or otherwise impact on any negotiations;
  * providing access is unlawful (including being unlawful as directed by a court or tribunal order) or is likely to impact on actions being taken in relation to alleged unlawful activities relating to the functions and activities of the Winning Group; or
