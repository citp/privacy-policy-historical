 **Non-personal Information** : which is non-identifying and non-identifiable information, without particular reference to the identity of the user from which such information was collected;

 **  and**

 **Personal Information** : which is individually identifiable information that identifies an individual, or may with reasonable effort identify an individual, either alone or in combination with other information, or may be of private or sensitive nature.  As part of our products and services, We may receive, collect and analyze personal information in order to provide services requested by or offered to our business partners, and to improve the features and usability of our products and services.

Digital Turbine is committed to comply with applicable legislation relating to its operation, including the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council (“ **GDPR** “). Digital Turbine has implemented specific data practices regarding the provisions of its products and services in the EU, as described below:

For mobile devices activated in the EU, information collected through our products and services embedded in mobile devices activated in the EU is non-personal information. For such devices, the Digital Turbine products and services will replace any identifiers relating to a specific mobile device with a randomly generated identifier. This identifier cannot be used to identify a specific individual.
