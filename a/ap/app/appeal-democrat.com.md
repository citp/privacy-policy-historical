We may share your personally identifiable information with other companies with which we conduct business. For example, if you enter our contests, make a purchase or use our e-mail services, we sometimes rely on outside companies to provide these services to you. In such cases, we need to provide your personally identifiable information to them. Or if you choose to purchase items through our commerce site, we will forward your information to third parties for credit card processing and order fulfillment. We also sometimes provide your information to our advertisers, so that they can serve ads to you that meet your needs. While **APPEAL-DEMOCRAT** will seek to require such third parties to follow appropriate privacy policies and will not authorize them to use this information except for the express purpose for which it was provided, **APPEAL-DEMOCRAT** does not bear any responsibility for any actions or policies of any third parties.

Finally, you should be aware that when you voluntarily disclose personally identifiable information (e.g., first and last name, address, e-mail address, etc.) on the forums or in the chat areas, that information can be collected and used by others and may result in unsolicited messages from other posters or parties.
