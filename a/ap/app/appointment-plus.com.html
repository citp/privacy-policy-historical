Contemporary Web Plus, Inc. dba Appointment-Plus ("Appointment-Plus") respects your privacy and the privacy of your customers. The following Privacy Statement
 outlines how Appointment-Plus will treat information as you use our software as a service scheduling solutions. Please direct any questions that you may have
  regarding our Privacy Statement at any time to info@appointment-plus.com. 
<br><br>
<b>Personally-identifiable Information</b><br>
When you first register for a free trial to use our services, we gather some basic information about you such as your name, business type or occupation, email 
address, and other contact information. We request this information so that we may register you for our service, and customize our application to meet the specific
 needs of your business or profession. In addition, we use such information as a mailing list to periodically provide you information to assist you in setting up and 
 utilizing Appointment-Plus. 
<br><br> 
By collecting some information about you, we are able to deliver relevant information to you about Appointment-Plus services (never third party services). You have 
the option of opting out of any Appointment-Plus mailings such as the Appointment-Plus monthly newsletter.  Appointment-Plus may disclose or access account information
 in the event the law requires such disclosure and for administrative or related purposes to maintain and improve our services to you. Appointment-Plus will never 
 share personally-identifiable information about you, your business or your customers with any third party without receiving your permission, unless required to do 
 so by law.<br><br> 
Appointment-Plus requires all of our clients (and their staff) to log into their Appointment-Plus accounts before they are permitted to gain access to their account
 information. You must enter your unique Appointment-Plus username and enter your personal password in order to log into your Appointment-Plus account. Ultimately, 
 you are responsible for keeping your password secret, which means that you should not tell anyone what your password is. We recommend that you change you and your 
 staff members  passwords regularly by going, at anytime, to the Staff Member section of site administration and entering new passwords. 
<br><br> 
<b>Non-Personally-Identifiable Information Automatically Collected</b><br>
At times, we may collect information about you that is not personally-identifiable. Examples of this type of information include the type of Internet Browser you 
are using, the type of computer operating system you are using, and the domain name of the Web site and/or Internet Service Provider from which you linked to our 
site. In addition, we may collect user statistics that we may provide to prospective advertisers or partners. This information is provided in the aggregate only 
and will not include any personally identifiable information about any individual users.
<br><br>
<b>Cookies</b><br>
When you log into Appointment-Plus, we use cookies to provide customizable and personalized services, such as changing your personal profile. By modifying your 
browser preferences, you may accept all cookies, be notified when a cookie is set, or reject all cookies. Even if you reject the use of cookies, you will still be
 able to use our services. 
 <br><br>
<b>Scheduling and Appointment Confidentiality</b><br>
Appointment-Plus never shares client information with anyone. For persons scheduling appointments with a service provider, Appointment-Plus will not share their 
personal schedule information with anyone except the service provider with whom they make an appointment. All scheduling and appointment information will be
 confidential. Each service provider can view only information relating to his or her appointments or such information as you allow.
<br><br> 
<b>Customer and Employee Confidentiality</b><br>
Appointment-Plus also holds your customer and employee information in strictest confidence.  Contemporary Web Plus does not disclose your personal information 
to companies or organizations not affiliated with us. Although the Appointment-Plus is a self-directed scheduling system, a technical support person at 
Appointment-Plus or its affiliates may use your personal information to help you with a technical problem or provide support services. All Appointment-Plus
 employees are based domestically in the United States.  Appointment-Plus or its affiliates may also use your personal information to communicate with you
  about services that you have expressed an interest in or that we believe may be of interest to you. In addition, we may, as permitted by law and without 
  your prior permission, provide personal information about you contained in our records or files to persons or organizations such as: persons who perform 
  a business function for us, regulatory or law-enforcement authorities, or our affiliated companies. 
<br><br>  
<b>Children</b><br>
Children should request permission from their parent or guardian prior to sending personal information online. Appointment-Plus does not intend to collect 
any personally-identifiable information from individuals under the age of 13. If a child has provided Appointment-Plus with personally-identifiable information, 
a parent or guardian of that child should contact us if they would like such information deleted from our records. We will use reasonable efforts to delete the 
child's personally-identifiable information from the existing files.
<br><br>
<b>Security</b><br>
Our Web site has high security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. These security measures
 include state-of-the-art firewall, high physical protection in the data center, nightly backup procedures, and Secure Socket Layer (SSL) to protect your data 
 and financial information during Internet transmission.  Notwithstanding, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat those
  measures or use your personal information for improper purposes.  We cannot absolutely ensure the security of any information transmitted to us over the Internet, 
  and we accept no liability for any unintentional disclosure of such information.  You acknowledge that you provide your personal information at your own risk.
<br><br>  
<b>Credit Card Transactions</b><br>
Credit card transactions are processed by third party gateways such as Authorize.net, Merchant Ware, Linkpoint, Paypal, etc. which have confidentiality of transactions
 covered by their privacy policies. These gateways offer secure encrypted credit card transactions for thousands of companies and have stringent security measures
  in place.
<br><br>  
<b>Communication of Changes</b><br>
Protecting your privacy and information is a top priority of Appointment-Plus. We will make reasonable efforts to communicate any changes to our Privacy Statement
 to our customers, but in any event our Privacy Statement may change from time to time and we invite you to review this Policy online at any time.
