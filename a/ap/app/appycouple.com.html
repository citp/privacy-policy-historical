<h1>Privacy policy</h1>
<p>
    <br>
</p>
<p>
    This Privacy Policy governs the manner in which AppeProPo, Inc. collects, uses, maintains and discloses information collected from users (each, a "User") of the appycouple.com website (the "Site") and the mobile application service generally known as “Appy Couple" or as “powered by Appy Couple" (the "Service"). This privacy policy applies to the Site and all products and services offered, managed or maintained by AppeProPo, Inc.</p>
<p>
    <strong>Personal identification information</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We may collect personal identification information from Users in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to: when Users visit our site or make use of the Service; register on the site or Service; place an order; subscribe to the newsletter; respond to a survey; fill out a form; and in connection with other activities, services, features or resources we make available on our Site or Service. Users may be asked for, as appropriate, name, email address, mailing address, phone number, credit card information. Users may, however, visit certain portions of our Site anonymously. We will collect personal identification information from Users only if they voluntarily submit such information to us. Users can always refuse to supply personally identification information, except that it may prevent them from engaging in certain Site and Service related activities.</p>
<p>
    <strong>In App Sharing of Customized App Data</strong>
</p>
<p>
The Service, among other things, permits Users (the "Customizing User") to create a customized version of the Service (the "User Customized App") which is accessible to Users (the "Customized Users") that are invited or otherwise selected by the Customizing User to download the User Customized App.  Each Customizing User would have access and a right to use most, if not all, of the information, photographs, video, audio and other material and data that you provide through the use of the User Customized App, some of which is likely to be or include personally identifiable information (the "Customized App Data"). <br>
By way of example, if Jane Doe was getting married, she might decide to make use of the Service by creating a User Customized App for use by her family, friends and all the other expected guests at her wedding.  Ms. Doe would have access to all photographs, information and other Customized App Data that you provide through the User Customized App and Ms. Doe could elect to share such Customized App Data with such Customized Users or other third parties through the User Customized App or otherwise.</p>
<p>
    <strong>Non-personal identification information</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We may collect non-personal identification information about Users whenever they interact with our Site or Service (including those visiting on an anonymous basis).
