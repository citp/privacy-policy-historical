We enable content creators, artists, developers and the wider internet community to share, promote and download original content including apps, games, live wallpapers, themes, ringtones and wallpapers.

We take your privacy seriously and are committed to protecting the information we collect. The following privacy policy is designed to let visitors to and users of appraw.com (our "Website") and mobile applications (our "Mobile Apps") understand our privacy practices. We refer to our Website visitors and Mobile App users as users ("Users") of the Appraw service (our "Services"). We also encourage you to read through our [Terms Of Service](https://appraw.com/terms) of which are incorporated into this Privacy Policy by reference.

## 1\. WHAT TYPES OF INFORMATION DOES APPRAW COLLECT?

**a) User Provided Information.** We obtain certain information when you provide it to us: for example, if you setup your account profile, you may provide your name, email address, your date of birth and a list of interests such as your favorite music and television shows. Some of that information can be used to identify or contact you directly and is sometimes referred to as personally identifiable information.  
**b) Information from Use of our Service.** Appraw gathers non-personally identifiable information from Users of our Service. Non-personally identifiable information is information that cannot by itself be used to identify a particular person or entity, and may include: the Internet Protocol (IP) address, unique device identifiers, operating system, mobile network information, browser type, locations of the Website pages the user views right before arriving at, while navigating and immediately after leaving the Website, and non-precise location information (e.g., your city or zip code). Appraw enables you to send messages to other Users in the Appraw community. While we generally don't read the content of these messages, we keep track of the number of messages sent and similar information to keep our Service running smoothly. Appraw also enables you to 'friend' other members of the Appraw community, and records which members of the community you've friended, which Appraw groups you've joined, and what pieces of content you've uploaded via the Service.  
**c) User Generated Content.** We offer our Users the opportunity to post reviews, upload images and audio, and offer opinions. Such postings are governed by our Terms of Service . In addition, such postings may appear on other websites or when searches are executed on the subject of your posting. Whenever you voluntarily disclose personally identifiable information on publicly viewable web pages or applications, that information will be publicly available and can be collected and used by others. We encourage you to read the Appraw online safety tips.  
**d) Facebook Connect** \- When you connect or login to Appraw with your Facebook account, we can access certain information you've added on Facebook in order to provide a social and personalized experience while using the Service. We adhere to the Facebook Platform Policies which restrict how we may can access and use this information.

For example, we may review messages sent via the Service between you and other members of the Appraw community for compliance with our policies, but will treat these messages as private to the extent required by applicable law. We don't sell your personally identifiable information to third parties.
