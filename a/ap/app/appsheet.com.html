<section id="intro">
    <em>Most recently modified: April 28th, 2014</em>
    <p>
        We care about and respect the privacy of your data.
    </p>
    <p>
        The AppSheet service asks for and stores some of your personal contact information, in particular your email address. Our service also collects and analyses service usage data across all its users. This privacy policy explains what data is recorded in each category and how this data is used.
    </p>
</section>


<section id="policy-updates">
    <h2>Policy Updates</h2>
    <p>
        Our service is evolving rapidly. The privacy policy is described below as designed but we cannot guarantee that our implementation is free of bugs, complete, or consistent with every aspect of the design.
    </p>
</section>


<section id="personal-info">
    <h2>Personal Information</h2>
    <p>
        You provide personally identifiable information when you sign up for our service. When you sign up via a third-party authentication provider (like Google or Dropbox), our service retrieves and saves some information about you from the provider (the specific information is controlled by the authentication provider and by the permissions you approve when you sign up). In particular, our service retrieves your email address.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your personally identifiable information will not be sold or rented to third parties in a way that identifies you as an individual. As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets, and, depending upon the transaction, your personally identifiable information may be one of the transferred assets. In the event that we are acquired by another company, your personally identifiable information may be part of the assets transferred to the acquiring party.
    </p>
    <p>
        We may share anonymized aggregated order information with third parties as a way to understand, explain and analyze our business (eg: X% of our users utilized feature Y).
    </p>
</section>


<section id="app-data">
    <h2>Application Data</h2>
    <p>
        The data used and collected by your applications resides in a third-party storage provider (eg: Google Drive, Dropbox, etc). Our backend service does not persist this data. However, in order to improve performance, we may temporarily cache data, images and other files.
    </p>
    <p>
        In order to interact with your data, our backend service maintains authentication (OAuth) tokens that allow our software to act "on your behalf" to read and write data. These tokens are securely stored along with your personal information.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our mobile client is designed to work offline. As a result, all application data used by the client can be cached locally. This data is not visible to other applications on the mobile device. As an exception, photos taken by the user on the device are also stored in the camera roll on the device, where they are visible to other applications (this is done for user convenience in managing photographs).
    </p>
</section>


<section id="usage-data">
    <h2>Usage Data</h2>
    <p>
        Our service uses browser session cookies and browser local storage to maintain user session state. This helps to speed up user login. You can set your browser to disable cookies and local storage, but this will significantly compromise or disable product usability.
    </p>
    <p>
        As you use our service, it logs usage information in backend log files including the features you accessed on our site, and standard browser-provided information. We utilize this information not only to debug issues and problems, but also to learn aggregated patterns across all our users and thereby improve our service.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our service may send notifications via email and other notification mechanisms. We may employ clear gifs to track the effectiveness of our emails.
    </p>
    <p>
        We may use multiple third-party products and services to help understand and analyze usage data on our site. Currently, we utilize Google Analytics and MixPanel, both of which collect usage data from your browser/app as you use our site. Each such third-party service has its own privacy policy.
    </p>
    <p>
        We may share anonymized non-personally identifiable usage data with third-party partners to understand, analyze, or explain aggregate customer usage of our service.
    </p>
</section>


<section id="data-security">
    <h2>Data Security and Durability</h2>
    <p>
        We store user personal information and access tokens in databases hosted by cloud-computing hosting providers. We take reasonable technical steps to protect your information including the use of passwords, OAuth, secure HTTP, etc. However, we cannot guarantee that your information is immune to a breach in the security and privacy mechanisms implemented by us and the hosting providers.
    </p>
</section>


<section id="third-party">
    <h2>Third-Party Sites</h2>
    <p>
        Our service provides you with links to third party sites. Once you click on a link to a third-party site, the privacy policy of that third party site is in effect.
    </p>
</section>


<section id="communication">
    <h2>Communication</h2>
    <p>
        Our service uses email and other available communication channels to interact with you once you start using our service. These communication channels have their own limitations with respect to message security and privacy, and to the extent your information is communicated on those channels, it is subject to those limitations.
    </p>
</section>


<section id="opt-out">
    <h2>Opting Out</h2>
    <p>
        If at any time you are dissatisfied with our service and want to stop being a user (we hope not!), please send an email to <a class="link" href="mailto:support@appsheet.com">support@appsheet.com</a> and we will delete your account. We may retain some information for a reasonable period for purposes of reporting and auditing. We may retain and utilize your historical non-personally identifiable usage information indefinitely as part of the data used for analysis and learning.
