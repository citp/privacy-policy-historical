We may share the information we collect in various ways, including the following:

**3.1 Vendors and Service Providers.** We work with third-party service providers to render our Services, including (but not limited to) website and application development, cloud hosting, maintenance, backup, storage, payment processing, analysis, security. If a service provider needs to access information about you to perform services on our behalf, they do so under close instruction from us, including policies and procedures designed to protect your information. Complete list of our vendors is available within our Data Processing Agreement document.

**3.2 Business Transfer.**  Information may be disclosed and otherwise transferred to any potential acquirer, successor, or assignee as part of any proposed merger, acquisition, sale of assets, or similar transaction, or in the event of insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership in which information is transferred to one or more third parties as one of our business assets.

**3.3  As Required By Law and Similar Disclosures**. We may also share information to (i) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request; (ii) enforce this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations hereof; (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues; (iv) respond to your requests; or (v) protect our rights, property or safety, our users and the public. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and spam/malware prevention.

**3.4 With Your Consent.**  We share information about you with third parties when you give us consent to do so.  For example, we often display personal testimonials of satisfied customers on our public websites. With your consent, we may post your name alongside the testimonial.

## 4. Security

**4.1 Security Practices.** We take steps to protect the security of the personally identifiable information we collect, including, for example, physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards.

Although we take appropriate measures to ensure the security of your personal data, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot give absolute assurances that personally identifiable information we collect may not be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy.

For more information, please see our [MachForm Security](https://www.machform.com/infrastructure-security/) page.

**4.2 Data Locations.** MachForm Cloud servers are based in the United States.

## 5\. Data Retention

How long we keep information we collect about you depends on the type of information or the type of the service you’re using, as described in further detail below. After such time, we will delete your information from all of our servers, including backups.

**5.1 Account information.** We retain your account information for as long as your account is active and a reasonable period thereafter in case you decide to re-activate the Services.  We also retain some of your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, to enforce our agreements, to support business operations, and to continue to develop and improve our Services.

**5.2 MachForm Cloud.** We retain all your form data for as long as your account is active. When you terminate or cancelled your cloud subscription, all your form data will be automatically deleted within 30 days.

**5.4 MachForm Self-Hosted**. All your form data is stored in your own MySQL database server. We don’t have any access to your data, thus you’ll need to manage your own data retention policy.

## 6\. Your Data Protection Rights Under The GENERAL DATA PROTECTION REGULATION (GDPR)

If you are a resident of the European Economic A, you have the following data protection rights:

  * If you wish to  **access, correct, update, or request deletion**  of your personal information, you can do so at any time by contacting us. Your request may be limited in certain cases: for example, if fulfilling your request would reveal information about another person, or if you ask to delete information which we or your administrator are permitted by law or have compelling legitimate interests to keep.
  * You can  **object to the processing**  of your personal information, ask us to  **restrict the processing**  of your personal information, or  **request portability**  of your personal information. Again, you can exercise these rights by contacting us.
  * You have the right to  **opt-out of marketing communications**  we send you at any time. You can exercise this right by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link in the marketing emails we send you or from your account settings page.
  * Similarly, if we have collected and process your personal information with your consent, then you can **withdraw your consent** at any time.  Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
  * You have the **right to complain to a data protection authority** about our collection and use of your personal information. For more information, please contact your local data protection authority.



We respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws.

## 7\. Data Transfers

Personal information that you submit through the Services may be transferred to countries other than where you live, such as, for example, to our servers in the U.S.  Your personal information may be transferred to countries that do not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you initially provided the information.

We rely upon a number of means to transfer personal information which is subject to the European General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) in accordance with Chapter V of the GDPR. These include:

  * **Standard data protection clauses.**  We may, in accordance with Article 46 of the GDPR, transfer personal information to recipients that have entered into the European Commission approved contract for the transfer of personal data outside the European Economic Area.
  * **Other means**. We may, in accordance with Articles 45 and 46 of the GDPR, transfer personal information to recipients that are in a country the European Commission or a European data protection supervisory authority has confirmed, by decision, offers an adequate level of data protection, pursuant to an approved certification mechanism or code of conduct, together with binding enforcement commitments from the recipient to apply the appropriate safeguards, including as regards data subjects’ rights, or to processors which have committed to comply with binding corporate rules.
