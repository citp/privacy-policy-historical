Examples include referral data (the web sites you visited just before and just after our site), the pages viewed, time spent at our Apptivo SaaSand IP (Internet Protocol) addresses. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you surf the Internet. When you request a page from our Apptivo SaaS, our servers log your IP address to create aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns for advertisers and partners, and for purposes of system administration. We use this aggregated information to determine consumer trends and needs, which allows both Apptivo and our partners to advertise more effectively, and allows you to receive advertisements that are less duplicative and more relevant to your interests.
