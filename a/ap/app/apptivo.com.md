# Privacy Policy - Apptivo

**Updated on July 29, 2019**

**1\. Introduction**

The U.S. Department of Commerce and the European Commission have agreed on a framework of data protection principles and supplemental principles to enable U.S. companies to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data transferred from the EEA to the U.S. (“EU-U.S. Privacy Shield”). Apptivo highly respects the privacy of its customers, business partners and employees and recognizes the requirement for appropriate protection and proper management of personal information provided. Apptivo on behalf of itself and its wholly owned U.S. domiciled entities, has made a decision to voluntarily adhere to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Principles recognized by the EEA as providing adequate data protection. Apptivo complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as agreed upon between the U.S. Department of Commerce and the European Commission regarding the collection, usage, retention and removal of personal information from European Union member countries. Apptivo certifies that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Privacy Principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for onward transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose limitation, Access, Recourse, Enforcement and Liability as well as the Supplemental Principles of the Framework.
