### General Privacy Information

This site contains links to affiliates, clients, vendors, sponsors, advertisers and other third party internet sites and services who may collect data in connection with sweepstakes, promotions, surveys, e-commerce, etc. They each have separate privacy and data collection practices, independent of this site and AppleGamer has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies or actions and is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such sites. Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily and publicly disclose personal information on any online service or website - for example through email - that information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. Further, while AppleGamer takes reasonable steps to protect your personal information using the security and other measures set forth herein, AppleGamer cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information transmitted to us, and you do so at your own risk. You are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any account information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you are online. 

  


### Collection and Use of Information

This site collects information about you both from what you tell AppleGamer and what AppleGamer collects through the use of cookies (see Cookies below). Information collected about you is used in two different ways. Information is "aggregated" -- meaning that the information from many users is grouped together in a way that does not disclose the personal information of any particular user. AppleGamer may use this aggregated information to determine user traffic statistics for this site (including without limitation to determine browser usage, duration of stay, the referring URL, IP address geographical location, etc.) and to evaluate which games and services are successful and which ones are not, and in order to evaluate which new services or games hat we should make available on this site. AppleGamer may use only the anonymous click stream data to help our advertisers and sponsors deliver better-targeted advertisements. In addition, some of your personal information may be shared with third parties who assist AppleGamer in producing, maintaining, servicing, and running this site or provide a service to this site's users. 

  


### Registration

Anyone who participates in any interactive activities offered (or to be offered in the future) on this site may be asked to register for a free ID and password or to complete subscription registration for an ID and password. AppleGamer use this contact information from this registration form to send the registrant information about AppleGamer, AppleGamers events and new services or game productions. Users may always opt-out of receiving any such information either by responding to the relevant communication as directed or by contacting this site (see Contacting This Site and Changing Your Personal Information below). 

  


### Child Online Protection Act Notification

Pursuant to 47 U.S.C. Section 230(d) as amended, AppleGamer hereby notifies you that parental control provisions (such as computer hardware, software, or filtering services) are commercially available that may assist you in limiting access to material that is harmful to minors. Information identifying current providers of such protections is available at the Electronic Frontier Foundation Website, http://www.eff.org/pub/Censorship/Ratings_filters_labelling/, and at the American Links Up Website, http://www.netparents.org/parentstips/browsers.html.
