## Website Visitors

Like most website operators, Appcheating collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Appcheating’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Appcheating’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Appcheating may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

Appcheating also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on http://appcheating.com blog posts. Appcheating only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.

## Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to Appcheating’s websites choose to interact with Appcheating in ways that require Appcheating to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Appcheating gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a blog at http://appcheating.com to provide a username and email address.
