<p>1.6 Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Info Collected Using Technology.</p>
<p>appraisalscope.com currently uses cookie and web beacon technology to associate certain Internet-related information about an individual with information about the individual in our database. Additionally, we may use other new and evolving sources of information in the future (together, “Technology Information”)</p>
<p>(a) Cookies and IP Addresses. A cookie is a small amount of data stored on the hard drive of the individual’s computer that allows us to identify the individual with his or her corresponding data that resides in our database.

We also keep track of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. An IP Address is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer every time you log on to the Internet.</p>
<p>(b) Web Beacons. A web beacon is programming code that can be used to display an image on a web page (by using a programming function — see http://truste.org for more information), but can also be used to transfer an individual’s unique user identification (often in the form of a cookie) to a database and associate the individual with previously acquired information about an individual in a database. This allows us to track certain websites an individual visits online. Web beacons are used to determine products or services an individual may be interested in, and to track online behavioral habits for marketing purposes. In addition to using web beacons on web pages, we also uses web beacons in email messages sent to individuals listed in our database.</p>
<p>(c) New Technology. The use of technology on the Internet, including cookies and web beacons, is rapidly evolving, as is our use of new and evolving technology. As a result, we strongly encourage individuals to revisit this policy for any updates regarding its use of technology.</p>
<p>(d) Usage Tracking. We track information related to the electronic mailings and web pages viewed by users and subscribers, as well as the hyperlinks clicked by subscribers, while viewing our emails or visiting our websites.</p>
<p>(e) Log Files. Log files are used to track and monitor subscriber usage.</p>
<p>(f) Optional Registration. We may offer free voluntary registration to potential subscribers. During such registration, the subscriber is required to supply an email address and other personal information. This information is required if the subscriber wants to participate in Company services.</p>
