            Appointy reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to change, modify, update, add, or remove portions of this Privacy Policy at any time, with or without notice to you. Please check this Privacy Policy periodically for changes.  For Business Users, this Privacy Policy will be available in the “My Account” section of the Appointy website.

                        PII is any piece of information which can be traced back to a specific individual user and thus potentially be used to uniquely identify, contact, or locate that specific individual.  Examples of PII include names, telephone numbers, social security numbers, credit card numbers and other unique identifiers.  In no event will Appointy sell or transfer PII to third parties, or otherwise provide third parties with access thereto, except as specifically provided in this Privacy Policy and/or in our applicable Terms of Use.

We may also collect credit card information from Consumers in circumstances where a Business User has decided that it requires such information to be collected from Consumers scheduling appointments with it through the Services. We may also collect user submitted information including but not limited to ratings &amp; reviews of businesses and service providers with whom the submitting Consumer has interacted through the Services, and any responses or other postings by a Business User.

We may also ask Business Users to provide a valid credit card number and billing address so that we can process any payments for use of the Services by such Business User, pursuant to the Business User Terms of Use.  Business Users, as registered users of the Services, may modify their account information at any time by accessing the “My Account” section of their Appointy account when such Business User is logged into the Services.

The activities of third parties are beyond the control of Appointy.  Please do not post any information that you expect to keep private on the Appointy website or in other areas of the Services.

In any of the above situations, we may provide that information to the appropriate Consumer, Business User or advertiser so that they may attempt to schedule an appointment or provide you with information regarding the advertised products or services about which you inquired.

If we share any of the information collected from you with such a third party, their use of that information will be governed by their privacy policy.

                        <br>
                        If you or any other user of the Services sends an email or provides an email address to Appointy for any reason, we reserve the right to retain that email address to use to send future notifications in accordance with this Privacy Policy and the applicable Appointy Terms of Use.

                        Information and User Submitted Materials provided by a Business User on its profile or elsewhere on the Services will be accessible by Consumers.
