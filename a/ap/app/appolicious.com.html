  <p>Appolicious Inc. (“us” or “we”) is committed to protecting your online privacy.&nbsp; This Privacy Policy discloses the privacy practices for the <a href="/">www.appolicious.com</a> website (our “Site”). We encourage you to read this Privacy Policy carefully to learn what information we collect from you and how we use that information.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1. Information We      Collect</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We collect two types of information about users: &nbsp;personally identifiable information (“personal information”), and non-personally identifiable information (“non-personal information”).&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Personal information is information that identifies a specific user.&nbsp; When you engage in certain activities that we make available on our Site, such as opening an account, submitting or posting content, or entering a contest, we may ask you to provide certain personal information, such as your name and email address.&nbsp; While you can chose whether to engage in any such activity, if you do not provide required information, you will not be allowed to engage in that activity.</p>
<p>Non-personal information is information that does not identify a specific user.&nbsp; This type of information may include things like the Uniform Resource Locator (“URL”) of the websites you visited before and after coming to our Site and your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address.&nbsp; We and our authorized third-party service providers and ad servers may automatically collect this information when you visit our Site, as described in more detail below. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
