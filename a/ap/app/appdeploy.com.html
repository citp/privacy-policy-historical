 <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>
The following statement describes the privacy policy relating to the AppDeploy<span class="sup">SM</span> 
web site (the "Site") operated by KACE Networks, Inc. ("KACE" or "we").&nbsp; KACE is 
committed to user privacy in all of its communications regarding its products 
and services.&nbsp; If you provide KACE with information, it will be treated 
according to this policy.&nbsp; KACE encourages you to read this policy before 
interacting with the website.&nbsp; By providing any personal information to KACE via 
KACE Web sites or e-mail addresses, you agree to these terms.&nbsp; This policy 
covers all KACE Web sites and customer communications.</p>
The purpose of this privacy policy is to inform you of the following:
<ul>
	<li>What kind of information, including any personally identifiable information, is collected</li>
	<li>Who collects the information</li>
	<li>How the information is used</li>
	<li>With whom the information may be shared</li>
	<li>What choices are available to you regarding its collection, use, and distribution</li>
	<li>The security procedures that are in place to protect the information</li>
	<li>How you can correct inaccuracies in the information</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Information We Collect</b>
<br>
<u>Non-Personally Identifiable Information.</u>&nbsp; Non-personally identifiable 
information is information that, by itself, cannot be tracked to a specific 
individual.&nbsp; KACE may collect non-personally identifiable information while you 
are visiting the Site.&nbsp; While providing services and features, KACE may collect 
web surfing data such as your IP address, web pages on the Site that have you 
visited, time and date, the web site you came through to reach the Site, and 
whether or not you clicked on any links while at the Site.&nbsp; We may use different 
types of technologies to collect this information, including cookies and 
single-pixel GIFs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If your browser is configured to accept the cookies, these cookies will be used to 
recognize your computer when you revisit the Site to provide you with a better 
web surfing experience; for example, it allows us to learn how you use the Site 
and to show you information we think you would want to see.&nbsp; If you wish, you 
can configure your browser to block cookies; however, your ability to access 
certain portions of the Site may be affected.</p>
<p>Links to third parties may be displayed on the Site.&nbsp; If you choose to click on 
a link, KACE may provide non-personally identifiable information to the third 
party.&nbsp; Also, the third party may use cookies or other technologies to collect 
information when you are visiting their web sites.&nbsp; The information advertisers 
or other third parties collect is governed by their individual privacy policies, 
not by KACE's privacy policy.&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Personally Identifiable Information.</u>&nbsp; While providing various services or features, we may ask you to provide personal 
information.&nbsp; For example, if you choose to register at the Site, you may be 
asked to provide your name, email address, telephone number, company, title, 
password and/or username.&nbsp; If you choose to use the Site, create a profile or 
post information on our forums, blogs, on-line bulletin boards, or user 
community, you may elect to provide information, such as your name, telephone 
number, street address, age, text, messages, feedback, images, suggestions, 
photos, birthday, icon, links to web sites, information regarding what products 
interest you, product information, bugs, and other comments, or other content 
("User Submissions").&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b>Use of the Information We Collect</b><br>
<u>Use of Non-Personally Identifiable Information.</u>&nbsp; KACE may use 
non-personally identifiable information collected to improve the quality of 
KACE's services; for example, by diagnosing service or technology problems, by 
assessing and maintaining security, by increasing ad placements on web sites 
that are generating more web traffic, by presenting you with information that we 
think you would be interested in seeing, or by allowing you to log in or access 
your profile information automatically.&nbsp; We may also use the information to 
count and recognize returning users. </p>
<p>
KACE may use non-personally identifiable information collected to determine user 
demographics, interests, and behavior and may market KACE products by sharing 
non-personally identifiable information with potential customers or partners.&nbsp; 
KACE also may provide your non-personally identifiable information to 
contractors so that they can perform services for us.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p><u>Use of Personally Identifiable Information.</u>
&nbsp; 
User Submissions, profile information, including without limitation your 
username, email address, and location may be viewable by others.&nbsp; KACE does not 
intentionally directly provide personally identifiable information to partners, 
except if you provide personally identifiable information as part of an inquiry 
about products or services provided by one of the partners.&nbsp; In that case, we 
will provide that information to that partner so that they may attempt to 
provide you with information regarding the products or services about which you 
inquired.&nbsp; KACE may use the personally identifiable information provided by 
users for internal purposes, such as marketing, administration, or sending you 
email messages.&nbsp; We may share personally identifiable information with third 
parties who provide KACE with administrative services and with reseller 
partners.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
If you provide us your email address when requesting information or when signing up 
for user communities, newsletters, or other services, we may send you email 
messages to communicate with you or to provide you information that we think you 
would like to see.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
If KACE shares any of the information collected from you with a third party, the 
third party's use of that information will then be governed by the third party's 
privacy policy. </p>
<p>If you provide personally identifiable information for your profile or other User 
Submissions, other users of the Site will have access to this information.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<b>Other Sharing of Information</b><br>
KACE may release any information about any user, including personally 
identifiable information, if in its sole discretion, release is appropriate to 
comply with the law, requests or orders from law enforcement, court order, or 
any investigation.&nbsp; KACE also may release information to protect its rights, 
property, or other interests, including those of its customers or users or to 
prevent illegal activities or violations of KACE's Terms of Service Agreement 
(available at www.kace.com/pdf/index_terms_of_service.php). &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
In the event that KACE, in whole or in part, establishes a partnership with another 
company, or is acquired by or merged with another company or enters bankruptcy, 
collected information may be transferred to the partner or the acquiring or 
merging company.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p><b>
Deletions/Corrections/Opt-Out</b><br>
You can delete your account and profile by contacting us directly at 
privacy@kace.com.&nbsp; You may also change your profile information by logging in to 
your user profile.&nbsp;</p>
<p>KACE also allows users who choose to provide personally identifiable information on 
their profile to edit their profile to ensure that it is correct and 
up-to-date.&nbsp; We may use your email address to send you messages notifying you of 
important changes to the Site, services, and special offers.&nbsp; If you do not want 
to receive such email messages, you may opt out by sending an email message to 
unsubscribe@KACE.com or by sending mail to the following postal address:</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marketing <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1616 North Shoreline Blvd., Suite B<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mountain View, California 94043<br>
<br>
Opting out may prevent you from receiving email messages regarding updates, 
improvements, or special offers.&nbsp; If KACE has provided any third party with your 
personal information under the KACE Privacy Policy, you will have to contact the 
third party directly with any opt out request.</p>
<p><b>
Child Protection</b><br>
KACE does not offer services to, or target, persons under the age of 13.&nbsp; In 
compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, any information we 
receive from people we believe to be children under 13 will be purged from our 
database. </p>
<p><b>International Users</b>
<br>
The Site is hosted in the United States and is intended for and directed to 
users in the United States.&nbsp; If you are accessing the Site from outside the 
United States, the laws or regulations governing personal data collection, use, 
and disclosure may differ from United States laws.&nbsp; Be advised that through your 
continued use of the Site, which is governed by U.S. law, this Privacy Policy, 
and our Terms of Services, you are transferring your personal information to the 
United States and you consent to that transfer.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Security</b>
<br>
KACE makes efforts to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the 
collected information.&nbsp; Be aware, however, that the Internet is not 100% 
secure.&nbsp; Therefore, we cannot ensure the security of any information transmitted 
over the Internet, and we accept no liability for any disclosure.&nbsp; Many areas of 
the Site are password-protected.&nbsp; To increase the security of the Site, please 
do not share your passwords with anyone.&nbsp; </p>
<p><b>
Links to Other Web Sites</b>
<br>
The Site may contain links to other web sites.&nbsp; In addition, User Submissions 
might contain links to other web sites.&nbsp; KACE is not responsible for the privacy 
practices or the content of any third party web sites that may be linked to the 
Site. </p>
<b>Modifications</b><br>
This privacy policy replaces any previous privacy policies formerly posted on 
the Site.&nbsp; We reserve the right to modify this privacy policy at any time by 
posting the changes on this web page and any such changes are immediately 
effective upon posting.&nbsp; We also may notify you about changes to the privacy 
policy by sending you a notice to your email address or by placing a notice on 
the Site. Please check the effective date at the top of this page to determine 
if the privacy policy has been modified since you last reviewed it.&nbsp; Your 
continued use of the Site following posting of this or any updated privacy 
policy will constitute your acceptance.
