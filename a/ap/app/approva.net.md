# Approva - Privacy Policy

Last Updated: March 15, 2008 

Approva Corporation respects your privacy, and is sensitive to concerns regarding the collection and use of personal data. Our goal is to provide you with information targeted to your industry, your role in your organization, and your specific preferences. In order to provide you with information that is relevant to your needs, and to fulfill specific requests on your part, we may occasionally request personal information from you. The information requested, and how it is used will vary across our website. 

Approva Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively, “Approva") have developed this Privacy Policy to explain why we collect particular information and how we will protect your personal privacy within our website (the “Site"). The following information summarizes Approva’s policy relating to the collection and use of information obtained from the Site. By using this Site, you consent to the collection and use of information about you in the ways described in this Privacy Policy. Approva reserves the right to change its Privacy Policy at any time by posting the new privacy statement at our website Homepage. By using the Site subsequent to such changes, you consent to them. The last date the Privacy Policy was revised is set forth above.   
Collection and Use of Personal Information 

Approva will only collect contact and other personally identifying information, such as your name, address, phone number, and e-mail address ("Personal Information"), when voluntarily submitted by you, such as when you contact us or complete an online form or request. If you do not want us to collect any Personal Information, do not submit it to us. 

Your Personal Information may be stored and used by Approva to provide services to you, to create a personalized experience for you, and to get in touch with you when necessary with respect to transactions conducted through the Site, material changes in our Site’s policies, new products or services that Approva may offer, or otherwise. If you do not wish to receive such materials, you may opt-out. (See the Opt-Out/Corrections section below for more information.) Except as described in this Privacy Policy, we will not sell, rent or disclose your Personal Information to our business partners, suppliers, vendors or other third parties without notifying you of our intent to share the information and giving you an opportunity to prevent your information from being shared. Approva reserves the right to disclose your Personal Information to its successors-in-interest or in connection with a merger or acquisition transaction or change of control or when required by law or necessary to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Approva, its customers and/or the public.   
Collection and Use of Non-Personal Information 

Demographic and profile data (e.g. job title, corporate function) may be collected at our Site. In addition, when you access the Site, our Web server may automatically collect certain information that is not personally identifiable, such as your IP address, pages viewed, length of time spent on the Site and other transactions performed on the Site. We store and use the foregoing information, in the aggregate only, to diagnose problems with our server, to improve and track the success of the Site and to provide content of interest to you. We may share the foregoing information with advertisers or other third parties, including our business partners, suppliers, and vendors, on an aggregated basis without revealing any personally identifiable information.
