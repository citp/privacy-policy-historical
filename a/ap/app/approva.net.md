## Scope and Consent

Each time you access this Site, you are consenting to the information practices described in this Privacy Policy. You accept this Privacy Policy when you purchase, access, or use the products or services offered on this Site. We may amend this Privacy Policy at any time by posting a revised version on this Site. The revised version will be effective at the time we post it. Therefore, we encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy to remain informed about how we are helping to protect the personal information we collect.

Infor honors your choices.

If we determine that your explicit consent is needed, we will obtain that consent before or at the time of data collection.

## EU-U.S. Privacy Shield

Infor, which includes its respective successors, subsidiaries, divisions and groups, participates in and has certified its compliance with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. Infor is committed to subjecting all personal data received from European Union (EU) member countries, in reliance on the Privacy Shield Framework, to the Framework's applicable Principles.  To learn more about the Privacy Shield Framework, visit the U.S. Department of Commerce's Privacy Shield List at [https://www.privacyshield.gov/list](https://www.privacyshield.gov/).

Infor is responsible for the processing of personal data it receives, and under Privacy Shield, we may subsequently transfer that data to a third party acting as an agent on our behalf. Infor complies with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of personal data from the EU, including the onward transfer liability provisions.

With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Framework, Infor is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain situations, Infor may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at <https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request>. 

Under certain conditions, more fully described on the Privacy Shield website [[https://www.privacyshield.gov](https://www.privacyshield.gov/)], you may invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted. 

##   
U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor 

Infor complies with the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of personal data from Switzerland. Infor has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement.

## How We Use the Personal information We Collect

  * distribute alerts concerning product upgrades, special offers, updated information, and other new products and services from Infor or our partners;
  * share relevant information with affiliates and third-parties; or
  * for such other purposes as required or permitted by law. 



## How We Share Personal information with Third Parties

Infor partners with and occasionally hires other companies to provide services on its behalf. Personal information may be shared with these companies; however, the use and amount of personal information shared is limited to the purpose for collection. These third parties are required to maintain the confidentiality of your personal information and are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose. 

We may also share your information as follows: 

  * with your consent;
  * and when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights or property; to protect your safety or the safety of others; to investigate fraud or respond to a government, judicial or other legal request; to comply with the law; or in connection with a corporate change, such as an acquisition or merger. 



## How We Protect and Store Personal information

We endeavor to protect the security of your personal information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to try to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, we store the personal information you provide on computer servers with limited access that are located in controlled facilities. Additionally, when we transmit sensitive personal information over the Internet, we protect it through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.

## How We Use Tracking Technologies
