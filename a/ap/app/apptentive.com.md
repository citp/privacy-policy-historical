# Privacy | Apptentive

## Privacy Statement

Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Statement applies to collection, use, and disclosure of personal information through all of the sites, products, services and developer modules offered by Apptentive Inc. or its subsidiaries or affiliated companies that link to this Privacy Statement, including [https://apptentive.com](https://apptentive.com/). It does not apply to sites or services that link to different privacy statements. Sometimes, we may post product specific privacy notices or Help Center materials to explain our products and related privacy policies in more detail.

This Privacy Statement does not apply to the activities of our customers that use our services to collect information from their end users (the “Apptentive Customers”). Each of the Apptentive Customers are responsible for establishing their own privacy statement that describes those activities. If you are interested in how the Apptentive products and services process your information as a part of a website or application operated by an Apptentive Customer, please review their privacy statement. Please see the Section “Information we collect and use on behalf of our customers” for more information.  


## Information we collect and how we use it

The personal information we collect depends on how you interact with us, the products you use, and the choices you make. We collect and process personal information about you with your consent and/or as necessary to provide the products you use, operate our business, meet our contractual and legal obligations, protect the security of our systems and our customers, or fulfill other legitimate interests.  
We collect information about you in various ways when you use our websites and services, including information you provide directly, information collected automatically, and third-party data sources:  


  * Information you provide – We collect information you provide to us. For example, when you sign up for an Apptentive Account, we ask you for personal information such as name, email address, and other information. If you choose to create your account using a third-party platform (e.g. Google or Github), we may collect your profile information from such third-party as described in their privacy statements. If you make a purchase, we also collect credit card numbers and other payment information. We also collect information you send to us, should you choose to contact us through our customer support or related contact information. When you are asked to provide personal information, you may decline. But if you choose not to provide information that is necessary for certain products or features, those products or features may not be available or function correctly.
  * Information collected automatically – As discussed further below under “Cookies and similar technologies”, when you visit certain sites or use certain products, some information is collected automatically. For example, when you visit our websites, our web servers automatically log your computer’s operating system, Internet Protocol (IP) address, access times, browser type and language, the website you visited before our site, and your activity on our websites.
  * Third-party sources – We may obtain information from third parties. We process information obtained from third parties as described in this statement, plus any additional restrictions imposed by the source of the information. These third-party sources include:  
  
– Data sources that provide us with marketing leads or customer referrals;  
– Applications and services, such as social networks, that make users’ information available to others;  
– Partners with which we offer co-branded services or joint marketing activities; and  
– Publicly-available sources, such as open government databases.

## Cookies and similar technologies

We use cookies and similar technologies to operate our websites and online services and provide features, personalize content and advertising, analyze traffic, and help to collect data. Cookies are small text files placed on your device to store data that can be recalled by a web server in the same domain that placed the cookie. The text in a cookie often consists of a string of numbers and letters that uniquely identifies your device, but it can contain other information as well. We use cookies on our websites to store your preferences and settings, enable you to sign-in, provide interest-based advertising, combat fraud, analyze how our products perform, and fulfill other legitimate purposes.   
Our web pages may also contain electronic images known as web beacons that we use to help deliver cookies on our websites, count users who have visited those websites, and gather usage and performance data. We also include web beacons in our email messages or newsletters to determine whether you open and act on them.

Our websites may include web beacons and cookies from third-party service providers. In some cases, that is because we have hired the third party to provide services on our behalf, such as site analytics. In other cases, it is because our web pages contain content or ads from third parties, such as videos, news content, or ads delivered by other ad networks. Because your browser connects to those third parties’ web servers to retrieve that content, those third parties are able to set or read their own cookies on your device and may collect information about your online activities across websites or online services. These third parties may combine this information with other information that you’ve provided to them or that they’ve collected from your use of their services.

The third-party analytics providers we use include: [Marketo](https://documents.marketo.com/legal/privacy/), [Hubspot](https://legal.hubspot.com/privacy-policy), [Bizible](https://www.bizible.com/privacy-policy), [Google](https://policies.google.com/privacy), [Crazy Egg](https://www.crazyegg.com/privacy), [New Relic](https://newrelic.com/termsandconditions/privacy), [Sumo](https://help.sumo.com/hc/en-us/articles/218958727-Privacy-Policy), and [Disqus](https://help.disqus.com/terms-and-policies/disqus-privacy-policy). Many third-party analytics providers allow you to opt-out from their collection or use. For more information, click on the links above.

Our third-party advertising partners include: [Adroll](http://www.adrollgroup.com/privacy), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/update), [Google](https://policies.google.com/privacy),[ Twitter](https://twitter.com/en/privacy), [G2Crowd](https://www.g2crowd.com/static/privacy), and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/preview/privacy-policy). You may find more information on each company’s practices, including the choices it offers, by clicking on the above. Many of them are also members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) or Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA), which each provide a simple way to opt out of ad targeting from participating companies., which you can access at <http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.aspx> and <http://www.aboutads.info/choices/>.

You can also use browser controls to limit how the websites you visit are able to use cookies. Instructions for blocking or deleting cookies may be available in each browser’s privacy or help documentation. Please be aware that if you choose to block cookies, certain website features that depend on cookies may no longer function. If you choose to delete cookies, settings and preferences controlled by those cookies, including advertising preferences, may be deleted and may need to be recreated. You can view a full list of cookies and their purpose, as well as update cookie consent [here.](https://www.apptentive.com/apptentives-cookie-policy/)

In carrying out these purposes, we combine data we collect from different sources to give you a more seamless, consistent, and personalized experience.

## Information we collect and use on behalf of Apptentive Customers

We make this information available to the particular Apptentive Customer that directed us to collect it. For more information about how this information is used by and on behalf the Apptentive Customers, please consult the applicable Apptentive Customer privacy statement.

    * Location – Apptentive offers location-enabled services, tied to its tools and services.

We use this information collected on behalf of our customers for the purposes directed by the applicable Apptentive Customer. 

## Information sharing

We share personal information with your consent or as necessary to complete your transactions or provide the products you have requested or authorized. For example, when you provide payment data to make a purchase, we will share that data with banks and other entities as necessary for payment processing, fraud prevention, credit risk reduction, or other related financial services. In addition, we share information in the following ways:

      * We provide information to our subsidiaries and affiliated companies. We may also share your information with other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of processing personal information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with our appropriate data protection, confidentiality, and security requirements and that they may not use personal information they receive from us for other purposes.
      * We may share information where we have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of your information is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, (b) protect our rights or property, including to enforce applicable Terms of Service or agreements, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Apptentive, its users or the public as required or permitted by law.

If you provide personal information to any of those third parties, or consent to our sharing personal information with them, that data is governed by their privacy statements.

## Retention of personal information

We retain personal information for as long as necessary to provide the products and fulfill the transactions you have requested, or for other essential purposes such as complying with our legal obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements. Because these needs can vary for different data types in the context of different products, actual retention periods can vary significantly based on criteria such as user expectations or consent, the sensitivity of the data, the availability of automated controls that enable users to delete data, and our legal or contractual obligations. 

## Location of Personal Information

The personal information we collect may be stored and processed in your country or region, or in any other country where we or our affiliates, subsidiaries, or service providers maintain facilities. Currently, we primarily use data centers in the United States. The storage location(s) are chosen in order to operate efficiently, to improve performance, and to create redundancies in order to protect the data in the event of an outage or other problem. We take steps designed to ensure that the data we collect under this statement is processed according to the provisions of this statement and applicable law wherever the data is located.  
We transfer personal information from the European Economic Area and Switzerland to other countries, some of which have not been determined by the European Commission to have an adequate level of data protection. When we do so, we use a variety of legal mechanisms, including, where appropriate, contracts, to help ensure your rights and protections. To learn more about the European Commission’s decisions on the adequacy of personal information protections, please visit: <https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/adequacy-protection-personal-data-non-eu-countries_en>.

If you cannot access certain personal information we collect via the customer portal or Apptentive products or services you use, you can always contact us as described at the bottom of this privacy statement.

See the “Cookies and similar technologies” section of this privacy statement for more details.

Advertising and analytics. Our third-party analytics and advertising partners typically provide options to opt-out of certain information collection or use. See the “Cookies and similar technologies” section of this privacy statement for more details. 

## Do Not Track

Some browsers have incorporated “Do Not Track” (DNT) features that can send a signal to the websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked. Our websites do not currently respond to browser DNT signals. Instead, you can use the range of other tools to control data collection and use, including the cookie controls and advertising controls described above.

## Privacy Shield Frameworks

Apptentive complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States, respectively.
