# Customer communication & feedback is important, as is privacy

Last modified: February 28, 2012

This Privacy Policy applies to all of the products, services and developer modules offered by Apptentive Inc. or its subsidiaries or affiliated companies. It does not apply to information we provide to the developer of your App. Each developer is responsible for establishing its own privacy policy. Sometimes, we may post product specific privacy notices or Help Center materials to explain our products and related privacy policies in more detail.

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please feel free to [contact us](https://web.archive.org/contact) through our website or write to us at:

## Information we collect and how we use it

We may collect the following types of information:

  * **Information you provide** – When you sign up for an Apptentive Account, we ask you for personal information. We may combine the information you submit under your account with information from other Apptentive services or third parties in order to provide you with a better experience and to improve the quality of our services. For certain services, we may give you the opportunity to opt out of combining such information.

  * **Cookies** – When you visit Apptentive, we send one or more cookies to your computer or other device. We use cookies to improve the quality of our service, including for storing user preferences and tracking user trends.

  * **Log information** – When you access Apptentive services via a browser, application or other client our servers automatically record certain information. These server logs may include information such as your web request, your interaction with a service, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser or your account.

  * **User communications** – When you send email or other communications to Apptentive or through Apptentive’s services to its customers (usually the developer of your App), we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our services. When you send and receive feedback messages to or from one of our services, we may collect and maintain information associated with those messages, such as the phone number, your email address, details about your device, your operating system, the wireless carrier associated with the phone number, the content of the message, and the date and time of the transaction. We may use your email address to communicate with you about our services and for our customers’ responses.

  * **Affiliated Apptentive Services on other sites** – We offer some of our services on or through other web sites. Personal information that you provide to those sites may be sent to Apptentive in order to deliver the service. We process such information under this Privacy Policy.

  * **Third Party Applications** – Apptentive may make available third party applications, such as gadgets or extensions, through its services. The information collected by Apptentive when you enable a third party application is processed under this Privacy Policy. Information collected by the third party application provider is governed by their privacy policies.

  * **Location data** – Apptentive offers location-enabled services, tied to its developer tools and services. If you use those services, Apptentive may receive information about your actual location (such as GPS signals sent by a mobile device) or information that can be used to approximate a location (such as a cell ID).

  * **Unique application number** – Certain services, such as Apptentive’s developer modules, include a unique application number. This number and information about your installation (e.g., operating system type, version number) may be sent to Apptentive when you give feedback or when that service periodically contacts our servers (for example, to request automatic updates to the software).

  * **Other sites** – This Privacy Policy applies to Apptentive services only. We do not exercise control over sites that include Apptentive applications, products or services, or links from within our various services. These other sites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you.




In addition to the above, we may use the information we collect to:

  * Provide, maintain, protect, and improve our services (including advertising services) and develop new services; and

  * Protect the rights or property of Apptentive or our users.




If we use this information in a manner different than the purpose for which it was collected, then we will ask for your consent prior to such use.

Apptentive processes personal information on our servers in the United States of America and in other countries. In some cases, we process personal information outside your own country.

## Choices

Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some Apptentive features and services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled.

## Information sharing

Apptentive only shares personal information with other companies or individuals outside of Apptentive in the following circumstances:

  * You’ve shared your information as a result of giving feedback within an application using Apptentive’s services. We only share this information with the developer of the application, in order to assist you and the developer in communicating.

  * We provide such information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies or other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of processing personal information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures we have put in place.

  * We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of your information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Apptentive, its users or the public as required or permitted by law.




If Apptentive becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will ensure the confidentiality of any personal information involved in such transactions and provide notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

## Information security

We take care to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, including encryption and physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data.

## Accessing and updating personal information

When you use Apptentive services, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort. Because of the way we maintain certain services, after you delete your information, residual copies may take a period of time before they are deleted from our active servers and may remain in our backup systems.

## Changes to this Privacy Policy

Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent. We will post any Privacy Policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of Privacy Policy changes). We will also keep prior versions of this Privacy Policy in an archive for your review.
