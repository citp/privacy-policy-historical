We have implemented this privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”) and practices to keep your personal information secure, and it describes how we collect and use such information, and the choices you have regarding our use.

## The Information We Collect

We may collect the following personal information during the registration process (e.g. name, email address, and company name) (“Personally Indentifiable Information” or “PII”). We also collect a variety of non-identifying visitor data, much of it automatically, such as IP addresses, browser settings and history, ISP information, referring/exit pages, operating systems, date/time stamps, search inquiries, and clickstream data (collectively “Non-Personal Information”). We use Non-Personal Information to analyze trends, to administer the site, to measure users’ activity on the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We do link this automatically collected data to PII. When referring to both PII and Non-Personal Information collectively, we will refer to it as “User Information”.

## Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Technologies

We may use the standard cookie feature of major browser applications and third-party provides, or employ internally developed cookies and tracking codes, that allows Apptopia to store a small piece of data on a User’s computer (or any other device used to access the Services, including a mobile device) about the User’s use of the Site. It’s a text-only string of information that allows us to distinguish you from other Users, but not in a personally identifiable way. We do capture PII in cookies or use cookies to mine PII.
