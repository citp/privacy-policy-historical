Your privacy is important to us, and so is being transparent about how we collect, use, and share information about you.  
We will NEVER sell your personal data to anyone.

Appleafs enables the visitors of its site, appleafs.com, to be in control of their personal data. We also provide controls that allow Appleafs users to have control over the privacy of personal data that is captured by our service. This Privacy Policy provides information about how Appleafs processes and protects this data.

We never sell personal data and we carry out all processing operations in strict compliance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) (specifically but not limited to Article 6(1)(b) to (f) and Article 28).

For the purpose of this Privacy Policy, personal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person; an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier etc. (the “Personal Data”).

In this policy, "we", "us", “Appleafs” and "our" refer to Louis Hunt.
