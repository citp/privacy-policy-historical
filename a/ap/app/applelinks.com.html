<h2>Privacy Statement for applelinks</h2>

<p><b>Applelinks </b> has created this privacy statement in order to
demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses
the information gathering and dissemination practices for this Web
site: <a href="http://www.applelinks.com/"> Applelinks.com</a> and
all the sites owned and operated by Coming Full Circle, Inc.

</p><p>&nbsp;

</p><h4>Information Automatically Logged (Traffic Data)</h4>

<p>We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server
and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is also used to
gather broad demographic traffic information.

</p><p>Traffic Data records the visitor's domain name or IP address of
the ISP from which the user is logged on. We use software to keep
track of traffic to our sites and derive such information as the
location from which the traffic originates and which particular pages
are being viewed and for how long. We may share information about
visitors and traffic results with advertisers, for example, the
number of visitors to our pages.<br>

<b><font color="#AF0000">(Summary: Our Web Server collects the IP
address of your ISP and lets us know how much traffic our site is
generating. The information we share with our advertisers is not your
individual information, but a general analysis of our web site's
traffic ).</font></b>

</p><p>&nbsp;

</p><h4>Cookies</h4>

<p><i><font color="#AF0000">Definition of a Cookie<br>

Data created by a Web server that is stored on a user's computer. It
provides a way for the Web site to keep track of a user's patterns
and preferences and, with the cooperation of the Web browser, to
store them on the user's own hard disk.</font></i>

</p><p><i><font color="#AF0000">The cookies contain a range of URLs
(addresses) for which they are valid. When the browser encounters
those URLs again, it sends those specific cookies to the Web server.
For example, if a user's ID were stored as a cookie, it would save
that person from typing in the same information all over again when
accessing that service for the second and subsequent time.</font></i>


</p><p>Our site uses cookies to keep track of your shopping cart User ID,
to limit voting to keep counts accurate, and to make sure you don't
see the same ad repeatedly. We also use cookies to deliver content
specific to your interests, and to save your password so you don't
have to re-enter it each time you visit our site.

</p><p>Sometimes we use an outside ad company to display ads on our site.
These ads may contain cookies. Other companies' use of their cookies
is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one. Advertisers
or other companies do not have access to Applelinks cookies.

</p><p>We <b>DO NOT</b> use cookies to view sites you visit other than
our own, to assess your "viewing habits."

</p><p><b><font color="#AF0000">(summary: Cookies are used to make the
reader's experience more enjoyable, so they do not have to enter the
same information over and over again.)</font></b>

</p><p>&nbsp;

</p><h4>Registration Forms, Surveys, Contests</h4>

<p>Contact information from the registration forms is used to inform
you about our company, and to send promotional material from some of
our partners to our customers. The customer's contact information is
also used to get in touch with the customer when necessary.

</p><p>Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the
<a href="http://search.applelinks.com/register/optout.lasso" target="blank">choice/opt-out section.</a>

</p><p>Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site.<br>

This information is shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis. We
use this data to tailor our visitor's experience at our site showing
them content that we think they might be interested in, and
displaying the content according to their preferences.

</p><p><b><font color="#AF0000">(summary: Registration requires that you
provide some personal information. The Demographic data that is
collected is used as a collective percentage from all our readers.
For example: 40% Female and 60% Male, not John Doe who lives in
Michigan makes 50,000 and drives a Ford)</font></b>

</p><p>&nbsp;

</p><h4>External Links</h4>

<p>This site contains links to other sites. <b> </b>Applelinks.com
and all the sites owned and operated by Coming Full Circle, Inc. are
not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web
sites.

</p><p>&nbsp;

</p><h4>Public Forums</h4>

<p>This site makes chat rooms, forums, message boards and/or news
groups available to its users. Please remember that any information
that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you
should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal
information.
