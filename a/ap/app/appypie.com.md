# Privacy policy

**Privacy Policy**

Effective as of April 18, 2019, Appy Pie LLC, Appy Pie Ltd & Appy Pie LLP collectively called (“Appy Pie”) have updated the Privacy Policy.

 **Introduction**

Appy Pie LLC, Appy Pie Ltd & Appy Pie LLP collectively called (“Appy Pie”) operates several websites including appypie.com (the “Websites”), as well as a number of mobile applications on behalf of our customers (collectively, the “Applications”). It is Appy Pie’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our Websites and Applications.

This Policy describes how Appy Pie collects, uses, shares, and secures the personal information you provide. It also describes your choices regarding the use, access, and correction of your personal information.

Your privacy is critically important to us. At Appy Pie we have a few fundamental principles:

We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can’t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)

We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights. We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services. In our social networking and mobile application products, we aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what’s visible to the public, seen by search engines, kept private, and permanently deleted.

 **EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield**

Appy Pie complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland to the United States in reliance on Privacy Shield. Appy Pie has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to such information. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield Frameworks, and to view our certification, visit the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield List[[1]](https://www.privacyshield.gov/list)

Appy Pie is responsible for processing of the personal data it receives under each Privacy Shield Framework, and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. Appy Pie complies with the Privacy Shield principles for all onward transfers of personal data from the EU and Switzerland, including the onward transfer liability provisions.

With respect to the personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Frameworks, Appy Pie is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain situations, we may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities for instance, meeting national security or law enforcement requirements.

If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at <https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request>.

Under certain conditions (described in detail on the Privacy Shield website [[2]](https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=How-to-Submit-a-Complaint) you may be entitled to invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.
