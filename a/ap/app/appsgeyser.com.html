                            of data that a Web site can send to your browser, 
                            which may then be stored on your computer as an anonymous

                            vendors, or other technologies to better serve you 
                            when you return to the Web site. You can set your 
                            browser to notify you before you receive a cookie, 
                            giving you the chance to decide whether to accept

                            If you do so, however, some Web sites may not work

                            service. These technologies may be in use on a number 
                            of pages across BESTTOOLBARS's Web sites. When a visitor accesses 
                            these pages, a non-identifiable notice of that visit 
                            is generated which may be processed by us or by our 
                            suppliers. These Web beacons usually work in conjunction 
                            with cookies. If you don't want your cookie information 
                            to be associated with your visits to these pages,

                            will still detect visits to these pages, but the notices 
                            they generate cannot be associated with other non-identifiable 
                            cookie information and are disregarded. </p>
