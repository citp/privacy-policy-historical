AP may also collect individual user information that you provide to us offline and AP will treat such information in the same manner as if it was collected off of this Web site.

AP, or third parties on our behalf, may also collect non-personally identifiable information via the use of cookies.

We may also use the information you provide to us to contact you for reasons related to your original communication to us. Additionally, we may periodically send you promotional e-mail about existing or prospective products and services offered by The Associated Press, as well as to obtain information to better understand our users. We may also use information you provide to better serve you, and, if you have given your consent for us to do so, to send you e-mails concerning offers from our partners and other third parties that we think may be of interest to you. We may disclose the information we collect about you to our affiliates and to nonaffiliated third parties that perform services on our behalf, including, without limitation, marketing services; provided, however, that we will not disclose any credit card numbers which may be provided by you except for the purpose of payment for services.

With regard to non-personally identifiable information, AP is currently using and has contracted with third party vendors to track and analyze usage and volume statistical information from our users to administer our content in order to improve our services. We may also perform statistical analysis of user behavior in order to measure interest in our online products and services for product development purposes.
