The Privacy Shield program is administered by the International Trade Administration (“ITA”) within the U.S. Department of Commerce. 

APICS has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles. APICS is committed to subject to the Principles all personal data received from the EU in reliance on the Privacy Shield.

We have appointed a data protection officer (DPO) who is responsible for overseeing questions in relation to this privacy policy.

    2. APICS Services to APICS ID Holders.

When you create an APICS ID, we may use information collected from technologies such as cookies, web beacons, and page tags, as described herein, to improve your experience of our website. For example, by saving information concerning the pages you visit and products you purchase, we will be able to provide you with information on other APICS goods and services that may be of interest to you. Furthermore, by creating an account with APICS, there is a possibility of receiving content from third parties through APICS, as discussed under Section 5.6, below.

APICS has entered into agreements with certain third parties with geographical affinity (“Local Partners”) with APICS ID holders in order to permit such Local Partners to provide APICS ID holders with benefits related to their affiliation with APICS at a local or regional level. APICS may share personal information with such Local Partners, and those Local Partners may share personal information with APICS in order to provide local and regional benefits to APICS ID holders. Furthermore, when such a Local Partner shares personal information with APICS in this way, an APICS ID will be created with that information, for use by the user whose information was used for that account.

Based on the information we gather, we may use targeted advertising from third party vendors, customized to reflect your interests. For example, if you purchase certain materials from APICS, APICS may display advertisements from vendors of similar materials. To accomplish this, we may use cookies and other technologies in order to recognize your computer at the time we display an advertisement to you. APICS may tailor advertisements based on your use of our website, such as tracking the pages you visit, the searches you make, or the goods or services your purchase. APICS does not correlate activities described in this section with your Personal Information, and we will not provide advertisers with your Personal Information when you view a targeted advertisement. However, through your interaction with a targeted advertisement, you consent that an advertiser may infer that you meet certain targeting criteria for the display of the advertisement. 

In creating an APICS ID, and as a condition of having an APICS ID, you expressly consent to APICS’ use of your Personal Information and non-personally identifiable information as described in this section. Moreover, in using an APICS ID you expressly acknowledge and agree to our collection and use of such information as described in this section.

    4. Certification Verification. 

APICS conducts Certification training and Certification testing (together “Certification Programs”) and permits registration for the certification programs on its website. APICS Certification Verification Tool (“CVT”) is an integral part of APICS Certification Programs. Through APICS’ CVT, third parties may request information related to an individual’s Certification status, in order to verify any APICS certifications resulting from its Certification Programs. Such third parties may include natural persons or business entities.

Certification Information may include, but is not limited to, your full name, your city and state of residence, any certification(s) if applicable, certification date(s), certification expiration date(s), and any certification status, if applicable. The CVT component of APICS Certification Programs is intended to safeguard the general public and ensure reliability and continuity in the supply chain industry by providing confirmation of certifications for qualified individuals successfully completing APICS Certification Programs. 

In applying for APICS Certification Programs and as a condition for receiving certification through one of APICS Certification Programs, you expressly agree and consent (opt-in) to APICS disclosure of Certification Information to third parties through the CVT. You further understand and expressly agree that the CVT is an integral part of APICS’ Certification Programs and that receipt of any APICS certification, and continued good-standing in the Certification Program is conditioned upon your agreement to such disclosure.

  8. Data retention
    1. We will only retain your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting requirements. We may retain your personal data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with you.
    2. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.
  9. APICS Email Uses

    2. After you create an online account with APICS, you will receive information about APICS products, services, and educational offerings that relate to your areas of interest unless you choose to opt-out.

    3. In your use of the website, you may have opportunity to send emails to recipients who are not APICS employees.

  10. How to Access or Change Your Personal Information

  11. Your Legal Rights. You have the right to: 
    1. Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
    2. Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
    3. Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
    4. Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.
    5. Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: 
      1. If you want us to establish the data's accuracy.
      2. Where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it.
      3. Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.
      4. You have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
    6. Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
    7. Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
  12. Verification

APICS will regularly self-assess its compliance with all applicable laws and the Privacy Shield Principles regarding Personal Information that is received from the EU. APICS statement on verification and related self-assessment procedures is available to you upon request.

  13. Recourse Mechanisms

APICS makes readily available independent recourse mechanisms by which your complaints and disputes are investigated and expeditiously resolved at no cost you.
