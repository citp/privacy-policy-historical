# APICS - Online Privacy Policy

APICS Online Privacy Policy

APICS respects the privacy of visitors to its Web site and has developed the following privacy policy to inform visitors about how information is handled once it has been submitted online. 

Personal, identifying information is not collected from visitors to our site unless this information has been voluntarily provided. All sensitive information sent to APICS is kept confidential. However, please be advised that the APICS Web site will query visitors browsers for certain information, such as

  * the domain you are accessing our site from   

  * the type of PC operating system you use   

  * the type of browser you use. 



This information is used solely to measure and improve our Web site and services and to better serve our members and customers. No individual session data is saved; APICS only uses aggregate statistical data to compile reports. 

When you order from our online bookstore, please be aware that the catalog uses "cookies" for temporary storage of individual items in your shopping cart during the ordering process; however, these cookies are deleted when you complete the order. 

When you request information or items related to the APICS CPIM and CIRM programs, your contact information (name, address, and APICS identification number) is automatically transferred to the test administrator. This information is required to be on file with our vendor to enable APICS customers and members to register for our certification exams. Please note: Information transferred to APICS' test vendor is not used or distributed in any other manner. 

After you create an online account with APICS, you will occasionally receive information about APICS products, services, and educational offerings that relate to your areas of interest unless you choose to opt-out. If you have questions or concerns about APICS’ online policy or wish to be removed from any APICS list, please contact APICS Customer Support at [service@apicshq.org](mailto:service@apicshq.org) or by telephone at (800) 444-APICS (2742) or (703) 354-8851.
