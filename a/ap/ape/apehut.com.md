apehut respects the privacy concerns of the users of its Internet Sites ("Sites"), and has created this privacy statement to explain what information we gather from your visit to our Sites, and how such information may be used.

For example, it may be used to tailor content and advertising to your interests. 

In special cases, apehut may disclose user information when there is reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to, or interference (either intentionally or unintentionally) with, apehut's rights or property, other apehut web site users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities.
