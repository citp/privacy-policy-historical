<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>apehut respects the privacy concerns of the users of its Internet Sites ("Sites"), and has created this privacy statement to explain what information we gather from your visit to our Sites, and how such information may be used.</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">Use of Information</p>
<p>As a general policy, no personally identifiable information, such as your name or address, is automatically collected from your visit to apehut. However, certain non-personal information is recorded by the standard operation of apehut's Internet servers. Information such as the type of browser being used, its operating system, and your IP address is gathered in order to enhance your online experience. For example, it may be used to tailor content and advertising to your interests. </p>
<p>In special cases, apehut may disclose user information when there is reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to, or interference (either intentionally or unintentionally) with, apehut's rights or property, other apehut web site users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities.

<p style="font-weight: bold;">Security for all personally</p>
<p>Identifiable information is extremely important to us. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

When you request pages from apehut Sites, our servers log your IP address. apehut collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, to report aggregate information to our advertisers, and to audit the use of our Site.
