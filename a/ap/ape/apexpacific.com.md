Agreement & Privacy Policy

Apex Pacific Pty Ltd has been doing business online since 1997. In order to demonstrate our firm's commitment to you, and protect your privacy, we'd like to share our policies on information gathering, customer privacy, security, returns, unsolicited email, and more.

**1. Refund Policies:**

We offer a "no questions asked" 30 days money return policy on all our products (except Dynamic Bid Maximizer and Dynamic Site Stats). If you're not 100% satisfied, please let us know ! **

Refund Requirements

**

  * Customers must make this claim within the first 30 days after purchase. There are no refunds after 30 day period.
  * Customer must agree, to delete our software from his/her computer and any all computers or servers where the software is installed.



**2\. Subscription for engine data update -** Your initial purchase includes 12 months engine data update subscription. To continue using the software after that period you are required to purchase renewal subscription periodically on a yearly basis. [Purchase the Engine Data Renewal here](https://www.apexpacific.com/shoppingcart/buy.asp?pdid=29).

**3**. **Upgrade Policy**  
**Dynamic Software™** products are **updated for life for free!** The term Life, refers to the life cycle of the product, not the life of the person who purchased it. The term Life Cycle, refers to the major version number of a product.  For example, the previous version of Dynamic Submission was **6.1.49\. **The three components of the version number are as follows: <Major Version Number>.<Minor Version Number>.<Hot Fix Number>. 

The software is updated and supported until the major version number is updated. We post minor version updates on our website and you may download and use them for free during a product's life cycle. When the major version number goes up, the previous version's life cycle is over. You may continue to use the software for as long as you wish, but the software will no longer have software updates posted on our website.

**4\. Dynamic BidMaximizer Subscription**  
Please note that monthly subscription accounts are automatically renewed in advance, prior the end of each billing period. In the case of a yearly subscription you will be required to renew your subscription at the end of this period (that is 12 months).

**Refund Subscription Policy:**  
**We offer 30-days money back guarantee.** That means, if you cancel within 30 days from the initial sign-up date, your credit card will be refunded 100% of the fee charged for the subscription. If you cancel after 30 days, you are not entitled for a refund. Please refer to the Cancellation Policy to terminate your account after 30 days from the initial sign-up date.

**Cancellation Policy  
To terminate your subscription you are required to give us notice, at least 5 business days **prior to the billing date. For termination to take effect, you must submit your request through the [online support form](http://www.apexpacific.com/support5.html). Your account will be terminated on the last day of your latest billing cycle.

**5\. Your Personal Information:** Our site uses forms for information requests and orders. Contact information from all forms ( **including** **name, address, email address, payment info, registration info etc**.) is used to process and deliver orders and mail information about our company to our customers. At no time do we share any of this information with any other person or company. Any financial information our customers submit, such as credit card number and expiration date is used only to charge the customer for the products and services they are purchasing.
