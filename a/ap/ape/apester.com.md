# Apester Privacy Policy – Apester ROAR

#### Effective as of December 12, 2016

This Privacy Policy applies to Apester.com and any of its affiliated websites, applications and other digital services in connection with which this Privacy Policy is linked or posted (collectively, “Services”). This Privacy Policy does not apply to information that is collected offline or by any third-party websites or services that you may access through the Services.

This Privacy Policy explains how Apester Ltd. and its affiliates (collectively, “Apester”) collects and uses data and information that identifies or can be directly associated with an individual person (“Personal Information”). Apester respects your right to privacy. Your ability to make informed choices about the uses of your information is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains Apester’s policy regarding the collection, use, disclosure and protection of any information we receive including your Personal Information.

Apester provides a platform where content publishers (“Publisher”) can create, embed and share interactive content units, including but not limited to: online quizzes, questionnaires, feedback applications or other features (“Platform”), that can be distributed and offered on the the content publisher’s website, application, mobile app or service (“Publisher Site”) and the end users of the Publisher Site can interact with (“End Users”). In this policy “ **Publisher** ” refers to any third party that downloads, implements or makes use of the Platform and/or the Services.

This Privacy Policy applies both to Personal Information collected from employees of Publishers (“Publisher Employees”) and End Users (collectively with Publisher’s Employees and those accessing the Apester.com website, “User” or “Users”).

#### Information Apester Collects from End Users

Apester uses the Platform and/or Services to collect information regarding End Users’ activities and operations that interact with the Platform or that interact with any content that may be available through the Platform. Such information includes IP-address, Session ID, browser type, mobile or desktop ID, referrer, user language and feedback or answers provided by the End User to any interactive content unit made available with the Platform. Such information may qualify as Personal Information in the End Users’ jurisdiction.

#### Information Apester collects from Publishers

In order to use the Platform or Services, Publishers have to enroll on Apester’s website and create an account by providing certain data, such as a user name and email-address and certain other information that may be provided from Publisher to Apester. Apester will also create a unique user ID to each Publisher. Where this data is attributable to a certain Publisher Employee, this may also qualify Personal Information that is collected by Apester.

#### Information Apester collects from visitors of the Apester.com website

When you access the Apester.com website, we may collect information from the computer or device that you use to access the Services, such as your operating system type, browser type, domain and other system settings, as well as the language your system uses and the country and time zone in which your computer or device is located.

#### How Apester Protects Information

Apester follows applicable laws and generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to Apester by implementing adequate technical and organizational protection measures, both during transmission and once Apester receives it. These measures will be continuously adjusted and updated in accordance with current industry standards. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while Apester strives to use commercially acceptable means to protect Personal Information, Apester cannot guarantee its absolute security.

#### How Apester Uses Information

Where required by applicable laws, Apester will only process, use or share User’s Personal Information with third parties with User’s explicit permission or as described in this Privacy Policy. Apester will only disclose Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy or where required by law, regulation, subpoena or court order. Apester uses Personal Information to the extent necessary for internal purposes – for example, in connection with offering the Services, to help diagnose problems with Apester’s servers, to make Apester’s Services more useful, or to improve the Platform.

Use of Publisher’s Employee Personal Information:  
Apester collects, processes and uses Customer’s Employee Personal Information for purposes of administering the Services, and to improve the experience of the Apester Services.

Use of End User’s Personal Information:  
Apester may use information it collects, including Personal Information, to provide the End User with the Services and in order to provide End Users with advertising that Apester reasonably believes may be more useful or interesting to the End User. The Personal Information collected by Apester will not be connected by Apester to any other personal information collected by third parties for advertisement purposes. In addition, by analyzing all information Apester receives, including all information concerning End Users and their interaction with the Platform and content made available through the Platform, Apester may irreversibly compile aggregated statistical information across a variety of mobile applications and End Users (“Statistical Information”). Statistical Information helps understand trends and customer needs so that new products and services can be considered and so existing products and services can be improved and tailored to customer desires. Statistical Information is anonymous and does not, in and of itself, identify any specific end user or customer of Apester. Apester may share such Statistical Information with its partners or any third party, without restriction, on commercial terms that Apester can determine in its sole discretion.

Personal Information is not transferred or disclosed to third parties other than as set forth in this Privacy Policy.

Any cookie will be deleted within one month after it has been placed unless configured otherwise. Most Web browsers are initially configured to accept cookies, but the User can change this setting so his browser either refuses all cookies or informs him when a cookie is being sent.

Cookies placed on End Users’ computers:  
Cookies placed on an End User’s computer will transmit the End User’s Personal Information as specified above to Apester for the purposes also specified above.

Cookies placed on Publishers’ computers:  
Apester also uses cookies to help personalize Publisher’s Apester experience. These could be  “persistent” cookies that may be used to help save Publisher’s settings and customizations across website visits. Also, if Publisher logs in to Apester, such a cookie will be used to recognize Publisher as a valid user so Publisher will not need to login each time using Apester.

#### Online Links to Other Sites

Apester may link to other websites of third-parties that provide useful information/services. Any information User provides on the linked pages is provided directly to this third-party and is subject to that third-party’s provider’s privacy policy.

After shortening the IP addresses, the collected data cannot be directly matched to a User. Google will process and use the collected information on behalf of Apester in order to analyze User’s use of the Platform and the Apester website, to compose respective reports and to provide certain other services to Apester related to the use of the Platform and the Apester website.
