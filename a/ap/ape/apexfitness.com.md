# Welcome to Apex Fitness Group

  
Privacy Policy 

Welcome to Apexfitness.com! 

We want Apexfitness.com to be your source for health and fitness information, products, services and tools. We know that your privacy is important to you, so your privacy as you use our site is very important to us. This privacy policy describes what information we gather from you, how we use that information and what we do to protect it. We hope that this privacy policy is straightforward and clear, but if you have any questions about it, please e-mail our [Chief Privacy Officer](mailto:jill@apexfitness.com).

  
**Information We Gather**  
_Personally Identifiable Information_  
In order to obtain access to certain portions of the Apexfitness.com website, we ask you to provide us with various pieces of information, some of which may enable us to distinguish you from other users. Certain other areas of the site may ask for additional information on your habits or health. If you are a licensee seeking to make purchases online, we may also ask for identifying information that will enable us to process your orders. This registration information is personally identifiable information because it allows us to contact you and distinguish you from other users.

Some users may also buy health products, supplements, or other items on our site. If you make purchases through Apexfitness.com, we need to gather information relating to the sale, including what you are buying, how you are paying and where you would like the products shipped. However, we will use that Transactional Information only to complete the transaction, to provide you with an order history and to facilitate future orders. We may also use information about the transaction for aggregate reporting (where we summarize the data in a report that does not contain your personally identifiable information).

Our "Supplement Solution" tool allows you to enter personally identifiableinformation and obtain suggestions from us as to which products might be of interest to you. Though we temporarily store this information on our servers in order to provide you with this tool, we will only use that information to provide you with our Supplement Solution tool. Again, we may use aggregated information concerning Supplement Solution tool users, but such use will not reveal your personally identifiable information.

We may receive additional personally identifiable information from you through communications with Apexfitness.com. If so, we will use that information to fulfill your request. For example, if you e-mail Apexfitness.com to ask about an article or tool, we will use that information to give you an answer, to make sure that you are satisfied with our answer, and to have a history of our service to you. We may also include your request or communication in an aggregated report of customer service activities in order to improve our service. However, as before such use will only be on an aggregated basis, without revealing any personally identifiable information.

  
_Other Information_  
In order to maintain and improve Apexfitness.com, we also gather some statistical data when you visit the site. The exact information we collect may vary, but can include the date and time of an access to our site, the Internet Protocol address of a computer requesting a page, the pages requested, and computer and connection information such as browser type and operating system. We do not associate this statistical information with your personally identifiable information.   
Also, if you respond to a poll, we will aggregate your responses with those of other Apexfitness.com members but we do not associate your response with any personally identifiable information.

**Cookies**  
Although we do not currently make use of "cookies," at some point in the future we may begin to do so. We will not begin such use without first posting the fact that we will do so pursuant to the User Agreement and this Privacy Policy, as appropriate. "Cookies," are stored on your computer and contain small amounts of information sent by Apexfitness.com to your computer and read by Apexfitness.com when you visit the different pages of our website. For example, cookies could allow us to remember your username and password as you navigate around our site. For more information about cookies, please visit The Privacy Foundation.   


**Children**  
Apexfitness.com is not designed for children. We do not knowingly collect any information from children under 18.

  
**How We Use That Information**  
As noted, we gather information for purposes of providing and improving Apexfitness.com for you. For example, we use the information to allocate system resources and communicate with you about updates and new features, among other things. We also aggregate information supplied by users during registration and information about their use of Apexfitness.com to maintain our services and describe our user base to potential partners, investors and advertisers. In providing this aggregated data about our community of users, however, we do not reveal any user's personally identifiable information.

We do not rent, sell, transfer or otherwise disclose your personally identifiable information to any third party, except in limited circumstances set forth here.   
We may employ other companies to perform functions on our behalf, such as fulfilling orders, delivering packages, providing customer service, sending mail, processing credit card payments, holding live chats, hosting message boards or other functions necessary for us to provide services to you. We may need to share your personally identifiable information with these companies. However, we will provide them with only the information necessary to perform their functions, and will not allow them to use that information for any other purposes.

To enhance our service, we may offer users the opportunity to participate in partnerships we may have with other businesses. If you choose to participate in one of these partnerships (for example, during the registration process), we may share with our partner the personally identifiable information it needs to offer its services to you. In such cases we'll post clear notices to identify the partner. If you're not comfortable with their privacy guidelines or for any other reason, you'll always have the choice not to use those features or services.

We may reveal your personally identifiable information as necessary, if we reasonably believe that you harming or interfering with other Apexfitness.com users, anyone else, or violating (either intentionally or unintentionally) our User Agreement, or infringing any of Apexfitness.com's rights, or trespassing on, damaging, or abusing any of Apexfitness.com's property.

Apexfitness.com will reveal information, including personally identifiable information, to the extent it believes it is required to do so by law. If we are asked by subpoena or other legal means to disclose any of your personally identifiable information we will, if permitted by law, attempt to notify you via any e-mail address we have on file for you at least ten days before we respond to the request.

Apexfitness.com may transfer any information, including any personally identifiable information, in connection with a sale of all or most of the assets of the company. 

**Policy Changes**  
If we change this privacy policy in any substantial way, we will notify you at least thirty days in advance by posting a notice of the change prominently on our Web site. Changes will not be applied retroactively to information obtained under a previous policy without your express consent.   


**Questions About This Policy**  
If you have any questions about this privacy policy or other privacy questions about us, please email our [Chief Privacy Officer](mailto:jill@apexfitness.com).
