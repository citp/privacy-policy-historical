### 2\. Information We Collect

    ** ** 2.1 **Information You Provide Us.** We collect information from you when you purchase a membership and other services from us. The information we collect includes personally identifiable information, such as your name, home address, telephone number and email address. You may also provide non-personally identifiable information, for example, demographic information such as gender and date of birth, or the name of your employer or school.

   The personally identifiable information we collect may include the following:  
   • Name  
   • Home address  
   • Home / mobile telephone number  
   • Email address  
   • Gender  
   • Credit, debit or other payment account number and related information     
   • Health-related information (as explained below)         
   • Date of birth  
   • For corporate sponsored program participants only: Name of Employer and employment verification  
   • For health insurance related program participants only: Insurance Information  
   • For school-related programs: name of School or Group       
   • For children enrolled in Kid’s Club: we collect from the parent/legal guardian, the name, date of birth, parent/legal guardian contact information, list of known allergies, and physical description (hair and eye color)

Guests are asked to provide certain contact and demographic information.

We also collect a limited amount of fitness, physical activity and health related information from you if you sign-up for personal training services or our Fitness Consultation service. This information (such as whether you suffer from a heart condition, dizziness, high blood pressure, and knee or back problems) helps you determine your eligibility to participate in our personal training and Fitness Consultation programs. If you participate in our training or consultation/orientation programs, we may also obtain certain measurements, height, weight and age from you. 

    2.2 **Cardless Check-in System.**  24 Hour Fitness has implemented a Cardless Check-In system in its locations. This allows members to check-in without their membership card, and by using a fingerprint scanner. By scanning your finger, we chart the distance between a few distinct points that are unique to you and come up with an identifying number based on those distances. **We do not store your fingerprints, nor can the data we store be re-created into a fingerprint image. Additionally, we do not sell, lease, rent, trade or otherwise transfer the data collected by the Cardless Check-In system to any third parties.  ** _Your identifying number and 10-digit check-in code are automatically deleted when your membership is terminated in our systems, or may be deleted at any time upon written request._

    2.3 **Other Sources.** We may receive information about you from other sources, such as public databases, commercially available sources, social networks, and other third parties.

    2.4 **Aggregated Information**. We may aggregate personally identifiable information.  Aggregated information is not personally identifiable information because it does not identify and is not associated with you or any other user.

   2.5 **In-Club Wireless Access.  **As a convenience to our members, internet access may be available in our facilities via wireless hotspots.  Any such in-club wireless access is provided by third parties and not by 24 Hour Fitness, and we do not collect any information in relation to your use of the in-club wireless access.  We are not responsible for such third party's privacy, information or other practices.
