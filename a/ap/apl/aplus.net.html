      <p align="left"><br><b>INTRODUCTION:</b> 
      </p><p align="left">A+Net (<a href="http://www.aplus.net">www.aplus.net</a>) has created this privacy statement in order 
      to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy issues. The following 
      discloses the information gathering and dissemination practices for A+Net. 
      </p><p align="left"><b>At A+Net, we are very committed to your privacy, so here is our 
      PRIVACY PROMISE TO YOU: A+Net will never sell, exchange, or release any 
      of your individual personal information to a third party without your 
      express permission. </b>
      </p><p align="left"><br><b>INFORMATION WE MAY COLLECT:</b> 
      </p><p align="left">Occasionaly, we may conduct online surveys or run a contest for 
      promotional purposes, during which, we may ask users for contact 
      information (like email addresses) and demographic information (like zip 
      code, age, or income level). We use contact data to send consumers 
      information about our company and, of course, to notify people if they win 
      the contest. 
      </p><p align="left">We understand, though, that you may want to participate in these 
      surveys or contests but may not want us to send you email. Accordingly, as 
      part of these surveys or contests, we will always give you the option of 
      declining to receive information from A+Net. Hey, if you don't want to 
      receive email, just let us know, and we won't send it. It is as simple as that. [Of 
      course, we will notify you if you win the contest.] 
      </p><p align="left">Like other web sites, your IP number is visible to us when you visit 
      our web site. What is an IP address, you may ask? It is a number 
      automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're connected the 
      Internet. Your IP number is visible to most of the websites that you 
      visit. Don't worry, though, at A+Net, we only use IP numbers to help 
      diagnose problems with our servers, to administer our Web site. Other 
      sites may use your IP number for marketing purposes. We don't. 
      </p><p align="left">From time to time, we may share with third parties aggregate 
      information-- such as, how many of our users are men, or how many A+Net consumers search on
      Internet-related topics. Such information will not contain any personal identifying 
      information. 
      </p><p align="left"><br><b>COOKIES</b> 
      </p><p align="left">Like many sites, A+Net uses cookies. Cookies are data files that are 
      stored on your computer. They contain identification information that 
      enables us to see how our users are interacting with our site and how 
      frequently they are returning. Cookies do not contain any personally 
      identifiable information. 
      </p><p align="left">We use cookies for the benefit of our users. Cookies let us know if we 
      have repeat visitors (a strong indication of happy consumers) and if we 
      are delivering a quality product to our consumers. We also use cookies to 
      identify which sites our repeat visitors are coming from, so that we can 
      place more of our online advertising on these sites. Essentially, it is an 
      anonymous way to survey how we are doing and to look for other consumers 
      who we think will like our site. 
      </p><p align="left">Also, speaking of cookies, you should know that A+Net employs an 
      outside ad company to display banner ads on our site. These ads may 
      contain cookies. Cookies from banner ads are collected by our ad partner, 
      and are used for purposes of tracking performance of the banner ads. A+Net
      may not have access to this information. 
      </p><p align="left">If you do not want to accept cookies from A+Net or other sites, your 
      browser software should allow you to not accept cookies. Look in the 
      Preferences (Netscape) or Internet Options (Microsoft Internet Explorer) 
      feature to do this. 
      </p><p align="left"><br><b>LINKS TO OTHER WEB SITES</b> 
      </p><p align="left">A+Net contains many links to other sites. A+Net is not 
      responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites.
      A+Net does not share any of the individual personal information you 
      provide A+Net with the sites to which A+Net links, although A+Net may share aggregate data with such sites (such as how many people use our 
      site). This includes other third party sites on the Internet for which
      A+Net provides search services. 
      </p><p align="left">Please check with those sites to determine their privacy policy. 
      </p><p align="left"><br><b>OPT-OUT</b></p><p align="left"><b>If you do not wish to receive future communications from us, you can 
      send an email to <a href="mailto:privacy@aplus.net">privacy@aplus.net</a></b></p><p align="left"><br><b>CONTACTING
