When Deluxe does share your Personal Data with third party service providers and/or subprocessors, Deluxe will:

  1. transfer such data only for limited and specified purposes;
  2. ascertain that the subprocessor is obligated to provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by these Principles;

Deluxe shall remain liable under the Principle of Accountability for Onward Transfer if its subprocessors process your Personal Data in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles, unless Deluxe proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

### c. Legal Obligations
