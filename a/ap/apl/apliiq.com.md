If you sign up for a promotion (e.g., a contest or sweepstakes offer) or enroll in a service we offer in partnership with a third party, we may provide information with your permission (such as your name, email address, and account activity) to such third parties.

Apliiq may disclose non-personally-identifiable information to third parties in aggregate form to potential business partners and investors.

### What about Children's Privacy?

Children under the age of 13 are allowed to upload graphics and images and to order products with their parent's consent. To order products, the child must submit his or her name and his or her mailing address and shipping address if different from the mailing address together with a valid credit card number. This is the only information collected from a child.

This information is used to fulfill the requested order; confirm shipment; complete record keeping including commissions entitlements and pay commissions fees, and to advise the child concerning new Apliiq products, services or policies.

Parents of children under the age of 13 have the option to consent to the collection of this information from their children or not. Such consent will not be used as consent for the dissemination of any of this information and the information will not be released by Apliiq to third parties without the parents' consent except as may be required by law or upon court order or as specified in our Privacy Policy.

Personal information at Apliiq is kept confidential and is disclosed only with the consent of the Apliiq user or as set forth in this Privacy Policy. We do not engage in the selling of the habits, behavior, buying patterns, or demographic information of our users. Apliiq does not condition a child's participation in any on-line activity on the granting of any unnecessary information beyond that actually needed in connection with that activity.

Parents can review any information Apliiq has received from a child and the parent can have that information deleted and the parent can forbid the collection of additional information from their child. If you want to review any information obtained from your child or if you want to have any information obtained from your child deleted from the Apliiq records or to forbid any use of such information, you may send a request to Apliiq Customer Support by emailing cs@apliiq.com. Alternatively, you may contact the Apliiq Child Privacy Representative by phone, email, or letter at:
