        <p>Information Collected by Cookies:</p>

        <p>Apliiq uses cookies on the Apliiq Website. A cookie is a small text
        file on your computer which a website sends to your computer to allow
        the website to store information which uniquely identifies our users.
        Apliiq's cookies do not collect or store personally identifiable
        information. Rather, the cookie stores a token which uniquely
        identifies a particular user. That token is then linked to the user
        information in our secured databases. You can always reset your browser
        to refuse all cookies or to display a message when a cookie is being
        sent. If you reset your browser, some of the Apliiq Website features
        and functionality such as personalization of information may not be
        available to you.</p>

        <p>Information Collected by Web Beacons and Log Files:</p>

        <p>Apliiq collects certain non-personally identifiable information
        through the use of web beacons and log files. Such information may
        include your IP address, browser type, site usage, and whether you
        opened emails you received from us.</p>

        <p></p>

        <h3>How do we secure your information?</h3>
        <p>

        </p><p>When you place orders or access your account information, we use
        commercially reasonable and generally-accepted technological safeguards
        to secure any information we collect about you. The secure server
        software (SSL) Apliiq uses encrypts all information you input before it
        is sent to us. In addition, your Apliiq account information is
        password-protected for your privacy and security. You should always
        take steps to protect the confidentiality of the password you
        select.</p>

        <p>We operate internationally and many of our computer systems are
        currently based in the United States. As a result, your personal data
        will be processed by Apliiq in the United States where data protection
        and privacy regulations may not offer the same level of protection as
        in other parts of the world, such as the European Union. If you create
        a user account with us, you agree to this privacy policy and you
        consent to the transfer of all information you provide to the United
        States.</p>

        <p></p>

        <h3>How do we use information?</h3>
        <p>

        </p><p>We use the personally identifiable information you provide to:</p>

        <ul>

            Website;</li>

            <li>provide notices about the results of sweepstakes, contest, and

        </ul>

        <p>We use your email address to communicate with you about your account
        and to send you certain notification emails.</p>

        <p>We use your email address or other personally identifiable
        information to send marketing messages and notifications from
        time-to-time. You may unsubscribe to email notifications communications
        by clicking</p>

        <p>We use non-personally identifiable information to monitor the use
        and performance of the Apliiq Website so that we can learn more about
        how people use the Apliiq Website and improve our products and
        services.</p>

        <p></p>

        <h3>Does Apliiq disclose the information it collects to outside
        parties?</h3>
        <p>

        </p><p>Generally, Apliiq does not share personal information about you with
        other people or nonaffiliated companies without your consent except
        that:</p>

        <p>Apliiq provides information to its agents and trusted service
        providers and contractors for limited purposes, such as: fulfilling
        customer orders and processing credit card transactions; offering
        certain products and services; communicating with customers; providing
        customer service; managing information on our behalf; and enhancing the
        Apliiq Website features and functionality. In such cases, we require
        that these parties agree to use the information solely for the purpose
        for which we provided it to them and in accordance with our privacy
        policy.</p>

        <p>If you sign up for a promotion (e.g., a contest or sweepstakes
        offer) or enroll in a service we offer in partnership with a third
        party, we may provide information with your permission (such as your
        name, email address, and account activity) to such third parties.</p>

        <p>From time-to-time, Apliiq may provide its sellers with the first
        name and city/state/country of residence of Apliiq customers who have
        purchased such seller's products.</p>

        <p>Apliiq may also release information (including your name, addresses,
        telephone number, and account activity) when we, in our sole discretion
        believe that such release is necessary or appropriate to:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>comply with law;</li>

            <li>comply with subpoenas, warrants, court orders, government
            investigations, or other legal process;</li>

            <li>enforce or apply the terms of any of our user or license
            agreements;</li>

            <li>
                <div>
                    investigate or respond to allegations of fraud,
                    intellectual property infringement, or other unlawful
                    activity
                </div>
            </li>

            <li>investigate fraud or similar claims</li>

            <li>
                <div>
                    protect the rights, property or safety of Apliiq, our
                    users, or others.
                </div>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>In the event that Apliiq is acquired by, or merged with, another
        company Apliiq reserves the right to transfer all information we have
        collected from our users in connection with such acquisition or merger
        and to inform the new owner of the privacy policy in place at the time
        the information was given.</p>

        <p>Apliiq may disclose non-personally-identifiable information to third
        parties in aggregate form to potential business partners and
        investors.</p>

        <p></p>

        <h3>What about Children's Privacy?</h3>
        <p>

        </p><p>Children under the age of 13 are allowed to upload graphics and
        images and to order products with their parent's consent. To order
        products, the child must submit his or her name and his or her mailing
        address and shipping address if different from the mailing address
        together with a valid credit card number. This is the only information
        collected from a child.</p>

        <p>This information is used to fulfill the requested order; confirm
        shipment; complete record keeping including commissions entitlements
        and pay commissions fees, and to advise the child concerning new Apliiq
        products, services or policies.</p>

        <p>Parents of children under the age of 13 have the option to consent
        to the collection of this information from their children or not. Such
        consent will not be used as consent for the dissemination of any of
        this information and the information will not be released by Apliiq to
        third parties without the parents' consent except as may be required by
        law or upon court order or as specified in our Privacy Policy.</p>

        <p>Personal information at Apliiq is kept confidential and is disclosed
        only with the consent of the Apliiq user or as set forth in this
        Privacy Policy. We do not engage in the selling of the habits,
        behavior, buying patterns, or demographic information of our users.
        Apliiq does not condition a child's participation in any on-line
        activity on the granting of any unnecessary information beyond that
        actually needed in connection with that activity.</p>

        <p>Parents can review any information Apliiq has received from a child
        and the parent can have that information deleted and the parent can
        forbid the collection of additional information from their child. If
        you want to review any information obtained from your child or if you
        want to have any information obtained from your child deleted from the
        Apliiq records or to forbid any use of such information, you may send a
        request to Apliiq Customer Support by emailing cs@apliiq.com.
        Alternatively, you may contact the Apliiq Child Privacy Representative
        by phone, email, or letter at:</p>
