We do not share, without your permission, personally identifiable information collected on our A+ Web sites about you and other members of your household with [ outside parties](https://web.archive.org/web/20071011062911id_/http%3A//www.aplus.com/about/pri.asp#OutsideParty) who might use the information to market their products or services to you.

As a necessary part of our business of providing auto and home insurance, we do share such information with selected [agents](https://web.archive.org/web/20071011062911id_/http%3A//www.aplus.com/about/pri.asp#Agent), [ contractors](https://web.archive.org/web/20071011062911id_/http%3A//www.aplus.com/about/pri.asp#Contractor) and outside parties, including our trade association partners, who provide services that support core functions our company performs in the course of operating our auto and home insurance business, including sales, marketing, underwriting, claims and premium collection.

We require our agents and contractors to hold the personally identifiable information we share with them in the strictest confidence, and to agree not to disclose any personally identifiable information except to carry out the purposes for which we disclosed the information to them.

Exceptions are as follows: 

  1. We submit individual claim information to insurance database services that maintain automobile and property claims data. These database services make this historical claims data available to participating insurers for underwriting purposes and fraud detection. 
  2. Where we are unable to collect earned premium due us, we will authorize, on a customer by customer basis, our collection agency vendor to submit personally identifiable information including name, address, policy number and past due premium amount to one or more of the following credit reporting agencies: Equifax, Experian, TransUnion.
