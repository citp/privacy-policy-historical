# Privacy Policy | aplus.com

A Plus operates several websites including [aplus.com](https://aplus.com/). It is A Plus’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.

## Website Visitors

Like most website operators, A Plus collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. A Plus’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how A Plus’s visitors use its website. From time to time, A Plus may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

A Plus also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses and email addresses.

## Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

A Plus may collect personally-identifying information such as email address or name for some of its users. Certain visitors to A Plus’s websites choose to interact with A Plus in ways that require A Plus to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that A Plus gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for an account at [aplus.com](https://aplus.com/) to provide a username and email address. Other users may be asked to fill out a poll or survey. Those who engage in transactions with A Plus – by purchasing access to our service, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. A Plus does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

## Aggregated Statistics

A Plus may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. A Plus may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, A Plus does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

## Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

A Plus generally discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on A Plus’s behalf or to provide services available at A Plus’s websites. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using A Plus’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. In addition, A Plus may disclose personally-identifying information such as your email address to some of its partners. For example, one way that this may happen is if you fill out a poll or survey sponsored by an advertising partner, your responses to that poll or survey, such as your name and email address, may be provided to the advertising partner sponsoring the poll. In addition, A Plus may disclose potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when A Plus believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of A Plus, third parties or the public at large. A Plus may send you a newsletter, occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with A Plus and our products. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. A Plus takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

## Cookies

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. A Plus uses cookies to help A Plus identify and track visitors, their usage of A Plus website, and their website access preferences. A Plus visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using A Plus’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of A Plus’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

## Business Transfers

If A Plus, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that A Plus goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of A Plus may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.

## Ads

Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by A Plus and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.

## Privacy Policy Changes

Although most changes are likely to be minor, A Plus may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in A Plus’s sole discretion. A Plus encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. If you have an aplus.com account, you should also check your feed for alerts to these changes. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
