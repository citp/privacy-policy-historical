                    cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send
                    you an online advertisement and to compile non personally identifiable information about you
                    or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things,
                    deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This
                    privacy policy does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.
