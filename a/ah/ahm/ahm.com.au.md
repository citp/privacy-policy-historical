## The Spam Act 2003

The Spam Act 2003 provides the requirements for the sending of legitimate commercial electronic messages and prohibits the sending of unsolicited commercial electronic messages, whether by email, instant messaging, short messaging service (SMS), or multimedia messaging.

### Compliance

ahm Health Insurance has educated its staff on the requirements of the legislation and implemented guidelines for sending commercial electronic messages. We also has good security practice measures in place to ensure that our system or network is not “spoofed” or used by others to send Spam and to deal with messages that are sent by mistake. 

We do not use electronic address harvesting software or lists that have been generated using such software, in connection with sending unsolicited commercial electronic messages. We will only send you electronic messages with your consent, including consent inferred from our existing relationship. For example, as a member of the fund, where we communicate with you in relation to your membership.
