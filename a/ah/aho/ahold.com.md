# Privacy Policy

Koninklijke Ahold N.V. (“Ahold”), its subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates (together “Ahold Companies”) appreciate your interest in their products and services and your visit to this website (the "Site") and the sites of the Ahold Companies. To the extent any discrepancy exists between the respective privacy policies as applicable to such sites and this Privacy Policy, those policies prevail. We intend to give you as much control as possible over your personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) and it is important to us that you feel comfortable with visiting the Site. Any Personal Information that you give us, including but not limited to your email address, may be used in the following ways. If you give us Personal Information in order to receive information from us - for instance when submitting requests for annual reports or other information on Ahold Companies - we may collect and store your information as it enables us to fulfill your information request. We may also use that Personal Information for marketing and promotional purposes. If you do not want it to be used by us for these purposes, you can simply "opt-out" by emailing your request to us (at [communications@ahold.com](mailto:communications@ahold.com "mailto:communications@ahold.com")). Ahold sometimes sells a business to another company. Such sale could include the transfer of your Personal Information directly related to that business to the buyer. We will release Personal Information, to the extent required by law. Except as described in the previous sentence, Ahold will not sell or willfully provide your Personal Information to third parties who are not our subsidiaries, joint venture partners or associates allowing them to use your Personal Information for their own purposes. We will not share any Personal Information you provide, such as credit card information, with other parties, unless it is needed to handle your request, process your invoice or prevent or combat fraud. The Site may contain links to websites that are not related to Ahold Companies. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of the owners of such websites. 

If you review or download information, we may track the visit through the use of "cookies" (pieces of information that a web site transfers to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes). Our cookies do not contain any Personal Information. The use of cookies is common, and you will find cookies at most major websites. Cookies help us to tailor information to your preferences and to see which areas of the Site are frequented most. We never use cookies to retrieve from your computer information that was not originally sent by us in a cookie. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you prefer, you can change your browser settings to refuse cookies. However, in so doing, you may not be able to fully utilize the Site. To learn more about cookies, you may visit [www.cookiecentral.com](http://www.cookiecentral.com/ "http://www.cookiecentral.com"). If you visit the Site to browse, read, or download information, we collect and store some Personal Information from you, such as the name of the domain and host from which you access the Internet, the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer you are using, the date and time you access the Site and the internet address of the website from which you linked directly to the Site. We use this information to measure the traffic on the Site and to help us make the Site even more useful. We use security devices and procedures that are standard for websites of this type to protect your Personal Information. 

Once you have provided us with your Personal Information, you will have reasonable access to that information so you can change or delete it. You may do this by requesting your profile at the contact address listed above. Of course, you will always have the option to unsubscribe to any online contact from Ahold or change your personal profile.
