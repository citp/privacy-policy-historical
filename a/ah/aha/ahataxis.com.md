# Privacy policy | AHA Taxis

## Privacy

Your privacy matters to WAAH Taxis Private Limited (the "Company", "we", “AHA”, or "us"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, share and protect information about you. We also provide information regarding how you can access and update your information and make certain choices about how your information is used. 

The Privacy Policy covers both our “online” (e.g., web and mobile services, including any web sites operated by us such as www.ahataxis.com or mobile applications, however accessed and/or used, whether via personal computers, mobile devices or otherwise) and “offline” (e.g., collection of data through mailings, telephone, or in person) activities owned, operated, provided, or made available by the Company. Our “online” and “offline” activities are collectively referenced as the “Services.” 

This Privacy Policy also applies to your use of interactive features or downloads that:   
(i) we own or control;   
(ii) are available through the Services; or   
(iii) interact with the Services and post or incorporate this Privacy Policy.   
**BY USING OUR SERVICES OR BY OTHERWISE GIVING US YOUR INFORMATION, YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY.**

We may ask you to provide us with certain categories of information such as personal information, which is information that could reasonably be used to identify you personally, such as your name, e- mail address, and mobile number (“Personal Information”). We may collect this information through various forms and in various places through the Services, including account registration forms, contact us forms, or when you otherwise interact with us.

(b) INFORMATION WE COLLECT AS YOU ACCESS AND USE OUR SERVICES   
In addition to any Personal Information or other information that you choose to submit to us, we and our third-party TPSPs may use a variety of technologies that automatically (or passively) collect certain information whenever you visit or interact with the Services (“Usage Information”). This Usage Information may include the browser that you are using, the URL that referred you to our Services, all of the areas within our Services that you visit, and the time of day, among other information. We may use Usage Information for a variety of purpose, including to enhance or otherwise improve the Services. In addition, we collect your IP address or other unique identifier (“Device Identifier”) for your computer, mobile or other device used to access the Services (any, a “Device”). A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device used to access the Services, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier. Usage Information may be non-identifying or may be associated with you. Whenever we associate Usage Information or a Device Identifier with your Personal Information, we will treat it as Personal Information. In case of booking via call centre, AHA will record the calls for quality and training purposes. In addition, tracking information is collected as you navigate through our Services, including, but not limited to geographic areas. If you are travelling in a vehicle with GPS devices, these GPS devices or the driver’s mobile phone will send your GPS coordinates, during the ride, to our servers. Most GPS enabled mobile devices can define one’s location to within 50 feet. We collect this information for various purposes – including determining the charge for the transportation you requested via our Services, to provide you with customer support, to send you promotions and offers, to enhance our Services, and for our internal business purposes. Usage Information may be collected using a cookie. If you do not want information to be collected through the use of cookies, your browser allows you to deny or accept the use of cookies. Cookies can be disabled or controlled by setting a preference within your web browser or on your Device. If you choose to disable cookies or Flash cookies on your Device, some features of the Services may not function properly or may not be able to customize the delivery of information to you. You should be aware that the Company cannot control the use of cookies (or the resulting information) by third-parties, and use of third party cookies is not covered by our Privacy Policy. 

(c) INFORMATION THIRD PARTIES PROVIDE ABOUT YOU   
We may, from time to time, supplement the information we collect about you through our web site or Mobile Application with outside records from third parties in order to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you and to offer you opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe may be of interest to you. We may combine the information we receive from those sources with information we collect through the Services. In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to any Personal Information received, unless we have disclosed otherwise. 

(D) INFORMATION COLLECTED BY MOBILE APPLICATIONS   
Our Services are primarily provided through an application on your mobile, tablet computer or similar device (“Mobile Application”). You agree that we may collect and use technical data and related information, including but not limited to, technical information about your device, system and application software, and peripherals, that is gathered periodically to facilitate the provision of software updates, product support and other services to you (if any) related to such Mobile Applications. When you use any of our Mobile Applications, the Mobile Application may automatically collect and store some or all of the following information from your mobile device (“Mobile Device Information”), including without limitation:   
• Your preferred language and country site (if applicable)   
• Your phone number or other unique device identifier assigned to your mobile device – such as the   
International Mobile Equipment Identity or the Mobile Equipment ID number

• To customize the content or services on the Mobile Application for you, or the communications sent to you through the Mobile Application. 

With respect to geo-location data we track through your Mobile Device, we use that geo-location information for various purposes – including for you to be able to view the drivers in your area that are close to your location, for you to set your pick up location, so the drivers are able to find the location from which you wish to be picked up, to send you promotions and offers, and to allow you (if you choose through any features we may provide) to share this information with other people. Except as otherwise permitted in this Privacy Policy, we will not share this information with third parties for any purpose and will only use this information for the sole purpose of providing you with the ability to request transportation via AHA’s Mobile Application. You may at any time no longer allow our Mobile Application to use your location by turning this feature off at the Mobile Device level. We also provide some of your Personal Information (such as your name, pick up address, contact number) to the driver/partner who accepts your request for transportation so that the driver may contact and find you. The companies for which drivers work (that are providing the transportation service) are also able to access your Personal Information, including your geo-location data. We may associate your unique mobile Device Identifier or Mobile Application usage information with any Personal Information you provide, but we will treat the combined information as Personal Information.

The information collected is only linked to an anonymous cookie ID (alphanumeric number); it does not include any information that could be linked back to a particular person, such as their name, address or credit card number. 1 The information used for targeted advertising either comes from us or through third party website publishers.

We cannot guarantee the security of our databases, nor can we guarantee that information you supply won't be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet or wireless communication, and any information you transmit to the Company you do at your own risk.

We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.
