# Privacy Statement

|    


**Privacy Statement**

This is the American Heart Association's Internet Privacy Statement. Together with the Policy on Collection and Use of Personal Information, this privacy statement discloses the privacy practices for www.americanheart.org and my.americanheart.org. 

**Information Collection and Use**  
The American Heart Association is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways other than those outlined in this statement. The American Heart Association collects information from our users at several different points on our Web site. Personal info provided by users will be used by the AHA to improve the site and provide a more personalized experience for the user, but information which identifies a specific individual will not be disclosed to others without the user’s permission unless necessary to provide services which the user has requested.

**Registration**  
It is optional for a user to complete a registration form. If a user chooses to complete one, a user is required to give certain information (such as name and email address). This information is used to contact the user about the services on our site for which they have expressed interest. It is optional for the user to provide additional demographic information (such as income level and gender), but encouraged so we can provide a more personalized experience on our site.

**Cookies**  
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. Once the user closes the browser, the cookie simply terminates. For instance, by setting a cookie from our site,   the user would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If users reject the cookie, they may still use our site. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users as they visit different sections of our site.

**Log Files**  
We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track users' movement, and gather broad information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.

**Sharing**  
We will share aggregate information with our partners and advertisers. This aggregate information does not contain personally identifiable information and therefore cannot identify any specific individual.  We use an outside credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. We partner with other parties to provide specific services such as a secured site for financial transactions. When the user signs up for these services, we will share names, or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services, with the permission of the user. These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services.

**Links**  
This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that the American Heart Association is not responsible for the privacy practices of such sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. The AHA privacy statement applies solely to information collected by the American Heart Association Web site.

**Newsletter**  
If a user wishes to subscribe to our push email technology or newsletters, we ask for contact information such as name and email address.

**Surveys & Contests**  
From time to time our site requests information from users via surveys. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include demographic information (such as name and shipping address, zip code, or age level. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.

**Security**  
This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information. All of our users' information is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (e.g., our Finance department) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The servers used to store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment. If you have any questions about the security at our Web site, you can use our [contact form](https://web.archive.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=10000023).

**Supplementation of Information**  
In order for this Web site to enhance its ability to tailor the site to an individual's preference, we might combine information about the purchasing habits of users with similar information from other partners, to create a personalized user profile. The personalized user profile will be used to improve the site and provide a more personalized experience for the user, but will not be disclosed to others.

**Site and Service Updates**  
We also send the registered site users service announcement updates. Users are not able to unsubscribe from service announcements, which contain important information about the service. We communicate with the user to provide requested services and account information via email or phone.

**Correction/Updating Personal Information**  
If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as a zip code), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will make our best effort to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user's personal data from our records, but this may require additional effort as the Association works to synchronize all customer data sources. This can usually be done on the member information page or by emailing our [Customer Support](http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=10000046&title=Web%20Site%20General%20Questions). Users can also reach us at 800-AHA-USA1 (800-242-8721).

**Choice/Opt-out**  
Our users are given the opportunity to "opt-out" of having their personal information used by third parties for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for the information. For example, our informational email messages have an "opt-out" mechanism so users who register can change their mind and be removed form receiving future informational messages. In some instances AHA requires users to “opt-in” for their personal information to be used.

Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter or promotional materials from our partners may opt-out of receiving these communications by following the "unsubscribe" instructions in the email message. Users of our site are always notified when their information is being collected by any outside parties. We do this so our users can make an informed choice as to whether or not they should proceed with services that require an outside party. 

**Notification of Changes**  
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post changes on our home page so our users are always aware of the information we collect, the ways we use it, and any circumstances under which we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
