  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p>EFFECTIVE: May 1, 2013</p>

  <p>We'll try to make this as painless as possible, but the reality is that all Privacy
  Policies contain legalese.</p>

  <p>We respect your privacy and privacy is important to us. This policy sets out
  our privacy practices, explains how we handle the information we collect when
  you visit and use the Aha! website and services and
  use the documentation. When you use Aha! services, you are consenting to the
  collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure, and other uses of your
  information as set out in this Privacy Policy. Privacy is important so please
  read it carefully.</p>

  <p>If you have feedback or
  suggestions on how to make our Privacy policy better, please email us at
  <a href="mailto:support@aha.io">support@aha.io</a>.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>At Aha! Labs Inc.,
  we respect and protect the privacy of visitors to our website, 
  <a href="http://aha.io/">http://aha.io/</a> (together with the other
  websites we own and control, the "Aha! Labs Inc. Websites"), and our customers
  who use our on-demand product innovation management solution, tools and
  services offered on the Aha! Labs Inc. Websites (together with the Aha! Labs
  Inc. Websites, the "Service").  This Privacy Policy ("Policy") explains
  how we collect and use visitors' and customers' information, particularly
  personal information, as part of the Service. The information Aha! Labs
  Inc. collects and uses is limited to the purpose for
  which customers engage Aha! Labs Inc. and other purposes expressly described in
  this Policy. Any discussion of your use of the Service in this Policy is
  meant to include your visits and other interactions with the Aha! Labs Inc. Websites,
  whether or not you are a user of Aha! Labs Inc's on-demand product
  innovation management solution.</p>

  <h2>What do we mean by Personal Information?</h2>

  <p>In this Policy, "personal information" means information or an information
  set that identifies or could be used by or on behalf of Aha! Labs Inc. to
  identify an individual. Except as described in this Policy, Aha! Labs
  Inc. will not give, sell, rent or loan any personal information to any third
  party.</p>

  <p>Personal information does not include "Usage Data" which we define as
  encoded or anonymized information or aggregated data
  we collect about a group or category of services, features or users which
   does not contain personally identifying
  information Usage Data helps us understand trends in usage of the
  Service so that we can better consider new features or otherwise tailor the
  Service. In addition to collecting and using Usage Data ourselves, we may share
  Usage Data with third parties, including our customers, partners and service
  providers, for various purposes, including to help us better understand our
  customers' needs and improve the Service as well as for advertising and
  marketing purposes. We do not share Usage Data with third parties in a
  way that would enable them to identify you personally.</p>

  <h2>How Do We Collect, Use and Share Your Personal Information and Other Information?</h2>

  <h3>Information You Provide to Us</h3>

  <p>When you register for the Service, we ask for personal information such as
  your name, address, phone number, e-mail address
  and credit card information, as well as certain related information like your
  company name and product name. If you sign-up for a 30-day free trial
  account, you are not required to enter your credit card information unless and
  until you decide to continue with a paid subscription to the Service.
  Aha! Labs Inc. uses a third-party intermediary to manage credit card
  processing. This intermediary is not permitted to store, retain, or use
  your billing information for any purpose except for credit card processing on
  Aha! Labs Inc's behalf.</p>

  <p>Aha! Labs Inc. may use the personal information you provide to operate the
  Service and tailor it to your needs, for billing, identification and
  authentication, to contact and communicate with you about the Service and your
  use of the Service, send you marketing materials (subject to your opt-out
  option), for research purposes, and to generally improve the content and
  functionality of the Service.</p>

  <p>Aha! Labs Inc. may also share your personal information with its third-party
  service providers (such as its credit card processors and hosting partners) to
  provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and other
  services we use to operate the Service and maintain a high quality user
  experience. </p>

  <p>The Service does not support "do not track" requests.</p>

  <h3>Log Files</h3>

  <p>As is true with most websites, Aha! Labs Inc.
  gathers certain information automatically and stores it in log files. This
  information includes internet protocol addresses as
  well as browser, internet service provider, referring/exit pages, operating
  system, date/time stamp, and click stream data. Occasionally, we may connect
  personal information to information gathered in our log files, as necessary to
  improve the Service for individual customers. Otherwise, we generally use this
  information as we would any Usage Data, to analyze trends, administer and
  maintain the Service, or track usage of various features within the Service.</p>

  <h3>Cookies</h3>

  <p>A "cookie" is a small software file stored temporarily or placed on your
  computer's hard drive. The main purpose of a cookie is to allow a web
  server to identify your computer and web browser, and tailor web pages and/or
  login information to your preferences. Cookies help us promptly display
  the information you need to use the capabilities of the Service and other 
  information which we consider to be of interest to you.
  By gathering and remembering information about your website preferences
  through cookies, we can provide a better web and marketing experience.
  Cookies don't give us access to users' computers, and the information we
  collect through cookies doesn't include personal information.</p>

  <p>When you use the Service we utilize "session cookies," which allow us to
  uniquely identify your browser while you are logged in and to process your
  online transactions. Session cookies disappear from your computer when
  you close your web browser or turn off your computer. We also utilize
  "persistent cookies" to identify you as an Aha! Labs
  Inc. customer, agent or end user and make it easier for you to log into and use
  the Service. Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you close
  your web browser or turn off your computer.</p>

  <p>We utilize various categories of cookies, which are summarized below along
  with the options available to you to manage them.</p>

  <p><em>Essential:</em> Essential cookies are those that are
  critical to the functionality of the Service. We use these cookies to
  keep a user logged into the Service and remember relevant information when the
  user returns to the Service.</p>

  <p><em>Functional:</em> We use functional cookies to track
  users' activities in the Service, understand their preferences and improve
  their user experience. These cookies can also be used to remember
  configurations of the Service that you can customize.</p>

  <p><em>Marketing:</em> We may engage
  third party providers to serve a variety of marketing cookies that enable us
  track and analyze usage, navigational and other statistical information from
  visitors to the Aha! Labs Inc. Websites. This
  information does not include personal information though we may reassociate
   this information with personal information we
  have collected when it is received. Marketing cookies are also used to
  track the performance of our advertisements and are employed by third party
  advertising networks that we utilize. These ad networks follow online
  activities of visitors to the Aha! Labs Inc. Websites and use this information
  to inform, optimize and serve tailored advertisements on the Aha! Labs Inc.
  Websites or on other websites you visit that we believe would most effectively
  promote the Service to you. We also use third parties to collect
  information that assists us in other methods of "remarketing" our Service to
  visitors to the Aha! Labs Inc. Websites, including customized email
  communications.</p>

  <p>You can generally accept or decline the use of cookies through functionality
  built into your web browser.</p>

  <p>If you want to learn more about cookies, or how to control or delete them,
  please visit <a href="http://www.aboutcookies.org">http://www.aboutcookies.org</a>
  for detailed guidance. In addition, certain third party advertising networks,
  including Google, permit users to opt out of or customize preferences
  associated with your internet browsing. To learn
  more about this feature from Google, click <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/">here</a>.
  Please note that if you do elect to disable your web browser's ability to
  accept cookies, you may not be able to access or take advantage of many
  features of the Service.</p>

  <p>Many jurisdictions require or recommend that website operators inform users
  as to the nature of cookies they utilize and, in certain circumstances, obtain
  the consent of their users to the placement of certain cookies. If you
  are a customer of Aha! Labs Inc., it is your responsibility to inform the individuals
  with whom you interact using the Service as to the types of cookies utilized in
  the Service and, as necessary, to obtain their consent. If you require
  more specific information as to the nature of the cookies utilized in the
  Service for purposes of fulfilling these obligations, please contact us by
  email at <a href="mailto:support@aha.io">support@aha.io</a></p>

  <h3>Web Beacons</h3>

  <p>We may also employ web beacons to help us better manage content in the
  Service by informing us what content is effective. Web beacons are tiny
  graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used
  to track the online movements of internet users.
  Unlike cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, web
  beacons are embedded invisibly on websites. We tie the information
  gathered by web beacons to personal information we otherwise collect, and use 
  them in our HTML-based emails to learn which emails have been
  opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of
  our marketing campaigns as well as to operate and improve the Service.
  You can opt-out of these emails by following the unsubscribe instructions
  within such marketing emails.</p>

  <h2>Other Information Sharing</h2>

  <p>In addition to the purposes described above, we disclose personal
  information to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to
  establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. We may
  also share such information if we believe it is necessary in order to
  investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected
  fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any
  person, violations of our Terms of Service, or as otherwise required by law.
  </p>

  <h2>Links to Other Websites</h2>

  <p>The Service contains links to other websites and web applications that are
  not owned or controlled by Aha! Labs Inc. Please be aware that we do not
  determine and we are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of
  such other sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave the
  Service, and read the terms of service and privacy statements of other websites
  and web applications linked to the Service. This Policy applies only to
  information collected by the Service.</p>

  <h2>Public Forums</h2>

  <p>The Service (including the Aha! Labs Inc. Websites) offers publicly-accessible
   blogs or community forums. You
  should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may
  be read, collected, and used by others who access them.
  To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community
  forum, contact us at <a href="mailto:support@aha.io">support@aha.io</a>. In some cases, we may not be able to
  remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are
  unable to do so and why.</p>

  <h2>Customer Testimonials/Comments/Reviews</h2>

  <p>From time to time, we post customer testimonials on the Aha! Labs Inc. 
  Websites which may contain personal information. We obtain
  the customers; consent to post their names along with their testimonials.</p>

  <h2>Protection of Information</h2>

  <p>Aha! Labs Inc. is committed to ensuring the security of your personal
  information. We utilize precautions to protect the confidentiality and security
  of the personal information within the Service, by employing technological,
  physical and administrative security safeguards, such as firewalls and other
  security procedures. For example, when you enter sensitive information (such as
  login credentials and all your activity on our Service platform) we encrypt the
  transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).
  These technologies, procedures and other measures are used in an effort to ensure
  that your data is safe, secure, and only available to you and to those you
  authorized to access your data. However, no internet,
  e-mail or other electronic transmission is ever fully secure or error free, so
  you should take care in deciding what information you send to us in this way.</p>

  <h2>Safe Harbor Data Privacy Notice </h2>

  <p>Aha! Labs Inc. complies
  with the US &amp; EU and US &amp; Swiss Safe Harbor Frameworks for
  protecting the privacy of data flowing from the EU and Switzerland to the
  United States, as set forth by the US Department of Commerce.</p>

  <p>We frequently enter
  agreements with our EU customers to provide them access to our Service, which
  includes the processing of information relating their customers. In providing
  our Service, we do not own, control or direct the use of the information stored
  or processed on our platform at the direction of our customers, and in fact we
  are largely unaware of what information is being stored on our platform and
  only access such information as authorized by our customers or as required by
  law. Only you or your customers are entitled to access, retrieve and direct the
  use of such information. As such, we are only the "data processors" and not the
  "data controllers" of the information on our platform for purposes of the EU
  Directive on Data Protection (Directive 95/46/EC) and the Swiss Federal Act on
  Data Protection. Our EU or Swiss customers, who control their customer data and
  send it to Aha! Labs Inc. for processing, are the
  "controllers: of that data and are responsible for compliance with the
  Directive. In particular, Aha! Labs Inc.'s customers are responsible for
  complying with the Directive and relevant data protection legislation in the
  relevant EU member state before sending personal information to Aha! Labs Inc.
  for processing. We work with our customers to help them provide notice to their
  customers concerning the purpose for which personal information is collected.</p>

  <p>As the processors of
  personal information on behalf of our customers, we follow their instructions
  with respect to the information they control. In doing so, we implement
  appropriate technical, physical and administrative measures against
  unauthorized processing of such information and against loss, destruction of,
  or damage to, personal information.</p>

  <h2>Choice</h2>

  <p>If you are a Aha! Labs Inc. customer and would like
  to opt-out of getting marketing communications from Aha! Labs Inc. please
  contact us at <a href="mailto:support@aha.io">support@aha.io</a> or follow the unsubscribe instructions included in
  each marketing email. Please note that if you are a trial or paying customer,
  you can not opt out of service and system generated
  emails. Requests to opt-out of transfers to our third-party vendors will also
  be considered, but limitations on data sharing may make it difficult or
  impossible to provide the Service in this manner.</p>

  <h2>Correcting and Updating Your Information </h2>

  <p>Customers may update or change the personal information they have provided
  Aha! Labs Inc. by logging into the Service and providing such additional
  information where applicable. If you are our customer and would like to
  gain access to, or request deletion of information we have collected as "data
  controllers," please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@aha.io">support@aha.io</a>.</p>

  <h2>Data Retention</h2>

  <p>Aha! Labs Inc. will retain personal information we process on behalf of our
  customers for as long as needed to provide Service to our customers, subject to
  our compliance with this Policy. We may further retain and use this
  personal information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve
  disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>

  <h2>Changes to the Privacy Policy</h2>

  <p>We may make material changes to this Policy. We encourage you to
  periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy
  practices. Your continued use of the Service constitutes your agreement to be
  bound by such changes to this Policy. Your only remedy, if you do not accept
  the terms of this Policy, is to discontinue use of the Service.</p>
