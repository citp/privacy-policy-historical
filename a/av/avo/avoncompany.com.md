**NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION**

**Collection of Non-Personal Information.**   **"Non-Personal Information"** is any information that does not reveal your specific identity, such as:

  * Browser information
  * Information collected through cookies, pixel tags and other technologies
  * Demographic information and other information provided by you
  * Aggregated information



We and our third-party service providers may collect Non-Personal Information in a variety of ways.

For example, we

  * collect information such as your computer type (Windows or Macintosh), screen resolution, operating system version and Internet browser type and version.
  * collect demographic information, such as your location, education, profession, age, gender, as well as other information, such as special interests when you voluntarily provide this information to us. Unless combined with Personal Information, this information does not personally identify you or anyone else.



**Aggregating Information.** We may aggregate Personal Information so that the aggregated information does not personally identify you or anyone else. In some instances, we may combine Non-Personal Information with Personal Information (such as combining your name with your geographical location). If we combine any Non-Personal Information with Personal Information, the combined information will be treated by us as Personal Information as long as it is combined.

**Use and Sharing of Non-Personal Information.** Because Non-Personal Information does not personally identify you, we may collect, use and disclose Non-Personal Information for any purpose.

**COOKIES AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES**

**Cookies:** We and our third-party service providers may use "cookies" on the Site. Cookies allow a web server to transfer data to a computer for recordkeeping and other purposes.

We also allow vendors to use cookies on our website. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to decline the use of cookies. To learn more about cookies, please visit the following site, which is not affiliated with Avon: <http://www.allaboutcookies.org/>.

**Local Storage Objects:** We and our third-party service providers may use Flash Local Storage Objects ("Flash LSOs") in certain situations including to recognize you.

**Pixel tags and other technologies:** Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies.
