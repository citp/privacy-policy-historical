# Privacy Statement

INTRODUCTION; SCOPE 

New Avon LLC (“New Avon”, "us," or "we") has created this Privacy Statement to inform you about how we collect, use and disclose information.

This Privacy Statement applies to information collected through this website and any mobile sites, applications, widgets, and other interactive features that link to this Privacy Statement (the "Site"). Except as specifically provided below, this Privacy Statement does not apply to information collected by New Avon by or through any other means, such as information collected offline.

New Avon grants independent contractors selling rights to its products (hereinafter referred to as Independent Sales Representatives). Independent Sales Representatives are not employed by New Avon. Therefore, New Avon does not control, and is not responsible or liable for the collection, use or disclosure of Personal Information by Independent Sales Representatives, including for their marketing purposes. If you provide information to an Independent Sales Representative through the Site, New Avon will have access to it and shall treat it in accordance with this Privacy Statement. Independent Sales Representatives may provide New Avon with information regarding their customers, in which case New Avon will treat such information, once in its possession, in accordance with this Statement.

If you are the customer of an Independent Sales Representative, you should check with your Representative directly to learn about her data privacy practices.

**If you apply to become or are an Independent Sales Representative, in addition to the generally applicable provisions of this Privacy Statement, please review the **Independent Sales Representative** section at the bottom of this Privacy Statement to see important information about additional privacy practices that apply to you.**

If you opt in to participate in such an offer, we may disclose your Personal Information to such third parties for their direct marketing purposes. We recommend that you consult such third parties' privacy policies in advance if you wish to participate in these offers.

NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION 

**Collection of Non-Personal Information.** **"Non-Personal Information"** is any information that does not reveal your specific identity, such as:

  * Browser information

  * Information collected through cookies, pixel tags and other technologies

  * Demographic information and other information provided by you or our Independent Sales Representatives

  * Aggregated information




We and our third-party service providers may collect Non-Personal Information in a variety of ways. For example, we

  * collect information such as your computer type (Windows or Macintosh), screen resolution, operating system version and Internet browser type and version.

  * collect demographic information, such as your location, education, profession, age, gender, as well as other information, such as your hobbies and special interests when you voluntarily provide this information to us. Unless combined with Personal Information, this information does not personally identify you or anyone else.




**Aggregating information.** We may aggregate Personal Information so that the aggregated information does not personally identify you or anyone else, such as by using Personal Information to calculate the percentage of our customers who live in a particular area. In some instances, we may combine Non-Personal Information with Personal Information (such as combining your name with your geographical location). If we combine any Non-Personal Information with Personal Information, the combined information will be treated by us as Personal Information as long as it is combined.

**Use and Sharing of Non-Personal Information.** Because Non-Personal Information does not personally identify you, we may collect, use and disclose Non-Personal Information for any purpose.

COOKIES AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES 

**Cookies.** We and our third-party service providers may use "cookies" on the Site. Cookies allow a web server to transfer data to a computer for recordkeeping and other purposes. We use cookies and other technologies to, among other things, better serve you with more tailored information and facilitate your ongoing access to and use of the Site. We also allow vendors to use cookies on our website. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to decline the use of cookies. To learn more about cookies, please visit the following site, which is not affiliated with New Avon: <http://www.allaboutcookies.org/>.

**Local Storage Objects.** We and our third-party service providers may use Flash Local Storage Objects ("Flash LSOs") in certain situations including to recognize you and remember what is in your shopping cart. Flash LSOs are different from browser cookies because of the amount and type of data stored. In addition, you generally cannot control, delete or disable the acceptance of Flash LSOs from your browser.

**Pixel tags and other technologies.** Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. However, in contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer's hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on website pages. We may use clear GIFs (also known as web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags) in connection with the Site to, among other things, track the activities of our Site visitors and compile statistics about Site usage and response rates. We and our third-party service providers also may use clear GIFs in HTML-formatted e-mail messages to help us track e-mail response rates, measure the success of our marketing campaigns, and identify when our e-mails are viewed or forwarded.

**Site Analytics.** New Avon may work with third-party service providers who use the technologies described in this section to conduct website analytics to help us track and understand how visitors use our Site.

**Widgets, Applications and similar technologies.** If you choose to utilize technology provided by us (such as a widget), any Personal Information or other information you make available through such technology may become available publicly, for example, through social media and other websites and platforms on which you may make the applicable technology available. In addition, some technology may have the capability to be distributed "virally" in other locations (for example, a friend or a customer of yours may post the widget that contains your information to his or her blog). New Avon is not responsible or liable for the collection, use or disclosure of Personal Information and/or other information that is made publicly available.
