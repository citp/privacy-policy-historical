Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages and brochures, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing credit card payments, and providing customer service.

##### VI. How we retain Personally Identifiable Information

If you are a Member of [www.AvoyaTravel.com](http://www.avoyatravel.com/) , we store your PII in the account overview of each user's “My Account” profile. The “My Account” profile consists of address and contact information, marketing preferences, a travel preferences section, and a messaging and alert section for communications between you and Avoya Travel. You can access you account information via the “My Account” hyperlink from the homepage of our website, after logging onto the website as a registered Member.

In the "My Account" profile, Members can choose whether or not they’d like to continue to receive e-newsletters, and other communications we offer.

We will retain your PII in our databases in accordance with our records management policy and applicable laws. While this information may be periodically purged, the retention period may extend beyond the end of your relationship with us. We may also need to retain certain information to prevent fraudulent activity; to protect ourselves against liability, permit us to pursue available remedies or limit any damages that we may sustain; or if we believe in good faith that a law, regulation, rule or guideline requires it.

Your PII will be stored in secured locations and on servers controlled by Avoya Travel, located either at our offices or at the offices of service providers.

##### VII. How You Can Control the Use of Your Information

As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide PII. Guest browsing is available on the [www.AvoyaTravel.com](http://www.avoyatravel.com/) website, even though PII might be needed to make a purchase or to take advantage of certain Avoya Travel services.

Avoya Travel provides you with choice and control over the collection and use of your PII, as well as a means of updating, correcting, or removing any PII stored in your customer profile. As described above, log in to the website and access your “My Account” settings to view and update that information.

The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the website of its manufacturer.

Avoya Travel provides you with the opportunity to specifically choose the promotional marketing communications you wish to receive from Avoya Travel. For emailed newsletters and promotional messages, you may adjust your marketing preferences within the “My Account” settings, or this can be accomplished sending an e-mail to [CustomerCare@AvoyaTravel.com](mailto:CustomerCare@AvoyaTravel.com) that includes your full name, street address and e-mail address, and specify that you don't want to continue receiving either postal mail, email, or both. If you choose not to receive any of the promotional marketing services that Avoya Travel provides, then Avoya Travel will not send them to you.

To protect the confidentiality of your PII, Avoya Travel employs physical, administrative, and technical safeguards to help protect the confidentiality and integrity of the information and to reduce the risk of loss, misuse, unauthorized access disclosure or modification of PII.

##### IX. Changes to the Privacy Policy

We may change or supplement this Privacy Policy from time to time. We may also undergo a change of ownership. Privacy Policy changes will apply to the information collected from the date we post the revised Privacy Policy to the website, as well as to existing information held by us.

If we decide to change this policy in a material way, we will obtain the necessary consents required under applicable privacy laws if we seek to collect, use or disclose PII for purposes materially different than those to which consent has been obtained, unless otherwise required or permitted by law. If any proposed change is unacceptable to you, you may request that we remove your PII from our records, as described above.
