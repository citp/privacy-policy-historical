# Privacy Policy - The AVSIM Community

Your privacy is important to us. However, much of the protection of your privacy is provided by you. If you post information in the forums or Private Messages to others, or in any number of other locations on AVSIM that robots and spammers can access, then there is not much we can do to protect you. Posting your email address or personal, identifiable informaton is not something we can correct for you quickly enough to prevent "bots" from grabbing it. Practice safe Interneting; don't post personal or identifiable information here or anywhere else for that matter.

**Our Commitment to Children's Privacy**  
Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important to the AVSIM organization. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13. If you are a parent of a youngster who might be interested in flight simulation and AVSIM, we ask that you supervise their visits here and know what they are sharing and participating in.
