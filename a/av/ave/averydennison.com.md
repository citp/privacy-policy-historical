We believe our customers should have the right to decline disclosure of personal information that is collected on our databases. The records for those individuals who request that their personal information not be used for future mailings will be marked in our database so that their names will be excluded from any contact in the future.

Customers can request removal of their name and customer information by the following methods:

  * For Office and Consumer Products customers by calling the respective Avery Dennison Customer Service Centre, Monday to Friday between the hours of 10am - 4pm.
  * For our Materials and RBIS customers by contacting the local Marketing Communications contacts, details of which are to be found in the latest mailing you have received.



  
**_Avery Dennison Customer Information Sources_**

_Avery Dennison's customer information is collected when customers:_

  * Call Avery Dennison Customer Service Center (CSC). When customers call the CSC, we might ask for their names, address, phone number, and other customer profile information that helps us better serve their needs in the future. This information helps facilitate communication with our customers by allowing us to quickly and efficiently identify the customer.
  * Respond to various marketing campaigns (i.e., advertisements, business reply cards, offers, etc.). This customer information collected is completely voluntary. In most cases, customers are given a choice to have their names removed by checking the appropriate box on the questionnaire.



**_Email Processes_**

We would only use online email communication with customers who have given us permission to do so. When used, we will provide our customers with a mechanism through which they can request that Avery Dennison omit their email addresses from lists or databases. We will always provide our customers with an email address, postal address, and telephone number at which we can be contacted.
