## **What information do we collect?**

Personal information is any information that can be used to identify a living individual such as a name, date of birth, email address, postal address, and telephone number.

Any personal information that you provide us with is stored securely. We may collect this personal information when you contact us, give feedback through our comments boxes, submit a personal story, make a donation, register for our services (for example, to receive our newsletter), or otherwise give us personal information.

When making a donation, your financial information such as credit and debit card details, is stored by [Worldpay](http://www.worldpay.com/) only and Avert does not have access to this information.

## **How do we use this information?**

We use your personal information to provide you with the information or services you ask for. We may also use your information for administrative purposes, including letting you know about changes to our services and understanding more about how our website is used. In addition, we may handle any non-sensitive personal data for our legitimate purposes. We will not sell your details to any third parties or use your data in any other way than those listed above.

Avert regards the lawful and correct handling of personal information as important to the success of our work and to maintaining the confidence of those with whom we deal. This applies to any user of our services, irrespective of where they live.

We will ensure that anyone working for us uses personal information lawfully and correctly. To this end, we will ensure we fully comply with the EU General Data Protection Regulations.

Avert uses website analytics to track how the website is used. These tools use cookies to gather statistics about how people use the website. For example, to see how many people look at a particular web page and which country they are from.

This information allows us to improve the website and to keep it relevant to our users’ needs. We do not store any personal information for this purpose but simply use it to see how you use the website.

If you do not wish to have cookies stored on your computer, you can easily change your web browser’s settings to refuse cookies. Information about deleting or controlling cookies is available at [www.aboutcookies.org](http://www.aboutcookies.org/).

This personal data is shared with a third-party company based outside the EU called [MailChimp](https://mailchimp.com/), whose system we use to send email newsletters to our subscribers. Any data you provide is stored on secure servers by MailChimp.

MailChimp is compliant with the [EU-US Privacy Shield Framework](https://www.privacyshield.gov/), which means they comply with data protection requirements.
