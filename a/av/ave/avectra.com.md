We want you to feel confident visiting our Web sites and using our products. This Privacy Policy outlines our privacy practices regarding information collected by us at this Web site, and lists the types of data we collect, explains how we use and protect that data, and discloses our key procedures surrounding privacy. We encourage you to read this Privacy Policy so that you will understand both our commitment to you and your privacy and how you can participate in that commitment. We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time by posting a new version here, and the new version will become effective immediately.

**Public Forums.** Please remember that any information (including personal and business information) that you submit, post or otherwise reveal in a public forum (such as comments to a blog or product discussion forum) is not subject to this Privacy Policy, will be seen by third parties not related to Abila and may be used by them or Abila to contact you for any purpose.

**Business Information Collection and Use by Abila**  
Abila collects the Business Information necessary to enable us to respond to your requests for our products and services and to send you information regarding our products and services from time to time. Since most of the users of our products and this Web site are doing so in their capacity as employees or companies, most Business Information we collect will be in that capacity (rather than information about you individually, such as your personal tastes, etc.). For these purposes, we have defined “ **Business Information** ” as any information that identifies or may identify a company or an individual contact at a company or that allows others to contact a company or an individual contact at a company. When you visit our Web site, you may be asked to submit information such as e-mail address, company name, address, phone number, your product version and/or areas of interest. We may also ask you where you heard about our company or products, or for other information that will help us understand more about your needs or help us process your requests for information. In addition, we collect credit card and related payment information when you order products, services or support plans online. Our information collection and use practices are described in more detail below.

**Product Registration.** You may be asked, on behalf of your company, to complete registration/activation form(s) on this Web site or from within the products, with contact information for use by Abila in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Registration or activation information may include the name of your company, contact information, product information, customer ID, network and operating system, and other relevant information.

This information includes company name and contact information and other information about your company (for example, size, revenue, and number of employees), the products you may have licensed and other non-Abila products you may currently use. We use this information in accordance with this Privacy Policy to identify you, process your requests and administer your Abila account(s).

**Support.** We offer certain limited online support services at this Web site. If you access online support on this Web site, you may be asked for information such as customer ID, product name, product version and other information to help us determine what the technical issues are and how best to help you resolve them.

Abila wants your Business Information to remain as secure as reasonably possible.  We combine industry-standard technical safeguards with a code of conduct for those employees that are permitted to access our customers’ Business Information.  When you purchase a product or service online, Abila uses SSL encryption to encrypt your credit card information before it is sent to us in order to ensure the integrity and privacy of the credit card information that you provide to us via the Internet.

Many of our Web-based services are hosted on servers that are co-located at a third party facility with whom we have a contract providing for security measures.  For example, hosted Services Data is submitted via SSL encryption and stored on a server equipped with industry standard firewalls.  Only authorized Abila employees, agents or independent contractors are permitted to access your Business Information, Product Data or Web Services Data.

Those employees that violate our Privacy Policy are subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.

Despite these security measures, Abila does not represent or warrant that Business Information will be protected against loss, misuse, attacks, or alteration by third parties.
