**Notice to California Residents - Your California Privacy Rights:**

Effective January 1, 2005, under California Civil Code Section 1798.83 (known as the  **"Shine the Light"**  law), if an individual who is a California resident has provided personal information to a business in connection with a business relationship that is primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, and if that business has within the immediately preceding calendar year disclosed such an individual's personal information to a third-party and knows or should have known that such third-party used the information for its own direct marketing purposes, then that business is obligated to disclose in writing to such individual upon request, what personal information was shared and with whom it was shared. A business may comply with this law by: (1) having EITHER a published privacy policy of not sharing a customer's personal information for third-parties' direct marketing use unless the customer has first affirmatively opted in to such sharing OR a published privacy policy of not sharing a customer's personal information for third-parties' direct marketing use if the customer has opted out to prevent his/her personal information from being shared for direct marketing use; AND (2) notifying the customer of his/her right to opt out and providing a cost-free means for the customer to exercise that right.

Any request for a disclosure required under this law should be sent to us via mail to at Avery Products Corp., Attn: CSC/Opt Out, 50 Pointe Drive, Brea, CA 92821. Please note that under this law, Avery is not required to respond to a customer's request more than once in a calendar year, nor is Avery required to respond to any request that is not sent to the email address designated above.

You may also Opt-Out of Marketing Communications from Avery by sending an email to [Opt-Out@avery.com](mailto:Opt-Out@avery.com). Please include the email address of the account and the first and last name of the account owner.  We may contact you for clarifications as part of this process. 

Avery will endeavor to honor your request promptly after receipt.

### 1\. Types of Information We Collect

**Personally Identifiable Information ("PII")**  is any information that can identify or is linked to a specific individual, such as your name, mailing address, telephone number (including mobile number), email address, credit card number, debit card number, bank account number and other financial account information, birth date, gender, occupation, personal interests, demographic, location and household information, etc. To the extent you voluntarily provide your PII to us, we collect such information. For example, as permitted by law, Avery may collect PII from you when you:

  1. purchase one of our products or services, such as when you subscribe to our email contact list;
  2. register to participate in an event sponsored by Avery (such as a contest, sweepstakes, giveaway, promotion, survey, etc.);
  3. enter into a transaction with us, such as ordering a product from Avery through our online store;
  4. use or interact with a product or service of the Avery Interactive Network;
  5. provide or share information using a product or service of the Avery Interactive Network;
  6. send information via message, chat, blog, post or similar functionality using a product or service of the Avery Interactive Network;
  7. create, share or link personal profile using a product or service of the Avery Interactive Network, including linking or associating your profile on a third-party site or platform with your Avery account; and/or
  8. submit a request or inquiry to us via the Avery Interactive Network or otherwise, or
  9. print and save projects using Avery design and print tools (collectively,  **"Identification Activity"** ).



Engaging in an Identification Activity is a voluntary activity on your part. If you elect to engage in an Identification Activity, Avery may ask you for certain PII. Depending on the activity, some of the information Avery asks you to provide may be identified as mandatory and some may be identified as optional. If you do not provide the mandatory information for a particular Identification Activity which requires it, you will not be able to engage in that activity. In addition, if you use the Avery Interactive Network to send information to another person (e.g., a friend, a family member, etc.), Avery will also collect PII of that other person to the extent disclosed by you. 

**Aggregate and Anonymous Information ("AAI")**  is any information that cannot identify or be linked to a specific individual. For example, Avery may collect anonymous group data (demographics, online browsing habits, interests and preferences, etc.) about users of our printing tools and services, users and members of the Avery Interactive Network, etc. (collectively,  **"Users"** ). Avery also collects aggregate traffic data pertaining to the Avery Interactive Network, such as: total page views in a given time period; total impressions; average amount of time that Users spend on the Avery Interactive Network (or a part thereof) each time they visit; average amount of time that Users spend on each page of any one or more parts of the Avery Interactive Network; percentage of Users from a certain geographical area, etc. Moreover, Avery may combine "User Activity Information" (as described below) about you and other Users of the Avery Interactive Network to generate aggregate information that reflects activities, habits, preferences, interests, etc. about our Users as a group. Avery also collects location-based information such as zip code, city and state name. In addition, Avery may take PII and make it non-personally identifiable, such as by aggregating your information with information about other individuals, or by removing personally-identifiable elements (such as names) so as to "anonymize" or "de-personalize" your information.

### 2\. What We Do With the Information

As a general matter, Avery uses information (PII and AAI) collected from and/or about our Users to improve our products and services so that they are appealing to as many people as possible, to administer and maintain operations of the Avery Interactive Network, to offer, market and advertise products and services (including those from third parties outside Avery with whom we do business (collectively,  **"Business Partners"** )) to our Users, to administer and manage transactions and relationships with our Users, to personalize user experiences for our Users, and to build a strong community for our Users.

#### 2.1 Avery's Use of Information

**2.1.1 Transactional, Administrative, and Customer Relation Purposes**

If you provide information to Avery in connection with an Identification Activity, Avery will process and use your information for all purposes related to that activity, including communicating and interacting with you in relation to your activity. For example: (1) if you sign up for a product or service of the Avery Interactive Network, Avery will use your information to set up, administer, service, and communicate with you regarding your account; (2) if you register to enter one of our contests or sweepstakes, Avery will use your information to process your entry and to conduct and administer the contest or sweepstake (including communicating with you in the event you are selected as a winner); (3) if you join one of our mailing or contact lists, Avery will use your information to send you or contact you with information that you have requested or that may be of interest to you; and (4) if you order a product or service from Avery, your information will be used to process and fulfill your order, to communicate with you regarding the same, and to provide customer service to you. Also, if you provide your email address or mailing address to Avery, such address may be used to send you notices of a transactional, administrative or relationship nature or as required by law, such as notification of a material change in this Privacy Policy and/or the Terms of Use for the Avery Interactive Network, notification of an actual or suspected security breach that affects your information stored by or for Avery, public relations announcements, etc.

**2.1.2 Marketing & Advertising Purposes**

**(1) Interest-based advertising on the Avery Interactive Network:**  Avery may use your PII to provide to you interest-based ads (i.e., ads potentially relevant or tailored to your interests) about products and services of Avery and/or our Business Partners. For example, Avery may show ads inside and/or alongside the content you view on Avery.com. Sometimes, these ads are based on the types of products you have purchased or files you have downloaded. However, to make these ads as relevant as possible for you, Avery may infer your interests based on videos you have previously viewed on Avery.com, templates you have downloaded or printed, and may use this information to associate your browser with relevant interest categories and show you ads relevant to your inferred interests. For example, if your prior viewing habits on Avery.com suggest that you are interested in a particular category of products or services, you may see more ads related to that category while on Avery.com.

**(2) Email marketing:**  If you provide your email address or mailing address to Avery (such as by joining one of our mailing lists), such address may be used to send you product and service offers, promotions, and advertisements from Avery and/or from our Business Partners. See Section 3.2 below regarding how to opt out of Avery’s email marketing.

**(3) Mobile marketing:**  Subject to your  _prior opt-in consent_ , Avery may (i) send marketing and advertising messages via SMS (Short Message Service), MMS (Multimedia Message Service), etc., to your mobile device and/or (ii) send marketing and advertising emails to your wireless email account, to inform you about product/service offers, promotions, and advertisements from Avery and/or from our Business Partners. See Section 3.2 below regarding how to opt out of our mobile marketing.

**2.1.3 Market Research Purposes**

Avery may use AAI (including AAI derived from PII) to conduct market research and analysis for ourselves as well as for our Business Partners.

#### 2.2 Disclosure to Third Parties Outside Avery

**2.2.1 Disclosure to our Business Partners**

Except as set forth below, Avery will never knowingly disclose your PII to a third party.

**2.2.2 Disclosure to our Service Providers**

Avery may disclose PII and AAI to our outside vendors and contractors who need to access such information in order to perform services (including, without limitation, transaction/payment processing, order fulfillment, contests and sweepstakes administration and prize fulfillment, data research and analysis, data collection and processing, data storage, data security, hosting and technical support for the Avery Interactive Network, and marketing and advertising support) for us (collectively, "Service Providers"). Avery requires that our Service Providers use your information shared by Avery solely for the purposes of performing services for Avery and that they maintain the confidentiality, security and integrity of such information and not further disclose the information to others.

**2.2.3 Disclosure under other circumstances**

Avery may disclose PII and AAI to others if doing so is required by law or, in our good faith belief, is reasonably necessary to: (1) comply with legal process (including a court order or subpoena); (2) cooperate with law enforcement; (3) enforce this Privacy Policy and/or the Terms of Use for the Avery Interactive Network; (4) respond to an emergency; or (5) protect the rights, property or safety of Avery, one or more members of our Users, and/or the public. In addition, Avery may transfer PII and AAI as part of our assets if Avery (or parts of our businesses) are, sold or transferred to, merged with, or acquired by, a third party. Upon such transfer, the privacy policy of the acquiring entity may govern the further use of your information.

**2.2.4 Unrestricted disclosure of AAI**

Given the anonymous, non-personally identifiable nature of AAI, there are no restrictions under this Privacy Policy on how Avery may use, disclose, sell, or otherwise share such information. For example, Avery may freely share Aggregate and Anonymous Information (AAI) with our Business Partners who may use such data for their own marketing, advertising, research, or other business purposes. Avery may also freely share AAI with our Service Providers in order for them to perform services to Avery.
