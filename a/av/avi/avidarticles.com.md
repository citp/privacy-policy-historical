Avid Articles Privacy Policy

Avid Articles aims to provide services to authors and publishers as well as other parties who may have an interest in the material produced by our member authors. We use Internet technology to achieve this and we aim to provide an interactive and personalized experience.

We may use Personally Identifiable Information (including your name, e-mail address, postal address, telephone number) and it is our aim at all times to be guided by the terms of this privacy policy.

We will never disclose your email address to any third party unless that third party is providing Avid Articles with services on an out sourcing basis and in that event any such third party would be bound by the same procedures as we observe in house. Your email address and other personal details will never be disclosed to any other party except as directed by a court where all the correct formalities have been complied with.

How we gather information from users

How we collect and store information depends on the particular page you are visiting, the activities you participate in and the services we are providing you. You may for example provide us with registration information for particular services when you register for access to certain parts of our site or request certain facilities such as newsletters or at any such time as you make a purchase. 

You may provide information when you participate in contests or competitions, forums or chat rooms and other interactive areas of our site. In common with most Web sites, Avid Articles also collects information automatically and through the use of technologies that may not be obvious to our visitors. 

To improve the quality of your visit we may log the name of your Internet Service Provider or use cookie technology to recognize you and hold certain information regarding your visit. The cookie may among other things store your user name and password which is designed to spare you from having to re-enter that information on every occasion that you visit, or possibly control the number of times you encounter particular promotional material while visiting our site. With the uptake of additional technology, we may in the future gather information by other means. You may be able in certain cases to choose not to provide us with information - for example by setting your browser to not accept cookies but if you were to do this you may be unable to access certain parts of the site or you may be asked to re-enter your user name and password. In addition, we may no longer be able to customize the site's features according to your preferences.

What we do with the information we collect

Like other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance your visit and deliver more individualized content and advertising. We respect your privacy and do not share your information with anyone. 

Aggregated Information (information that does not personally identify you) may be used in many ways. We may combine information about usage patterns by one or more users to help improve our site and services (such as to determine pages visited or features that users find most attractive). Aggregated Information may occasionally be shared with advertisers and business partners. This is anonymous information and does not allow anyone to identify you individually.

We may use your Personally Identifiable Information to discuss with you:

* your registration and customization preferences 
* our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy 
* services and products offered by Avid Articles
* other areas we think you might find of interest. 

Personally Identifiable Information collected by Avid Articles may also be used for other purposes. This may include but is not limited to site troubleshooting, administration, transaction processing, administration of competitions and various other matters. Trusted third parties who provide technical services for the operation of our site (our web host for example) may access such information. We will use your information only as permitted by law. 

In addition, as we continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner with other businesses. When this type of activity takes place, user information may be among the transferred assets. We may also disclose your information in response to a court order, whenever we believe we are reasonably required to do so by law, in connection with the collection of monies you may owe to us, and or to law enforcement agencies authorities whenever we believe it to be appropriate or necessary to do so. Please note we may not be permitted to provide you with notice prior to or after disclosure in such cases.
