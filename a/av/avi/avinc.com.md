I. Types of Information we collect and how we collect it**

In discussing the types of information we collect from customers and visitors to our websites we use the term “Customer Information” as a broad, general term that refers to any information relating to you and your AeroVironment products or service, including Account Information, Service & Performance Information, Commerce Information, and Website Information. 

The following are specific types of Customer Information that we collect from customers and visitors to our websites:

 **“Account Information”** means information about your AV account, including, but not limited to, your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, credit card information, and appointment scheduling information. We collect Account Information directly from you when you activate or change your account, or purchase products or services from us.  We may combine information we obtain from third parties with Account Information we collect.  
**  
“Commerce Information”** means personally identifiable information about you that enables a commerce partner to fulfill your request to participate in a business transaction. From time to time, we may present on-screen offers or enable you to buy goods and services from us or third parties. We will only collect and send on your behalf information such as your name and address and your interest in a specific offer or transaction to the commerce partners that are sponsoring the promotion or transaction if you take advantage of such an offer or engage in a transaction. In addition to fulfilling your request, such commerce partner may also use your Commerce Information to send you other information in which you might be interested, consistent with its own privacy policies.
