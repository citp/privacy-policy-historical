We use these tools to gather non-personal information about users to help us improve our Services and user experiences. These analytics providers may use cookies and other technologies to perform their services and may combine the information they collect about you on our Sites with other information they have collected for their own purposes. This Privacy Policy does not cover such uses of data by third parties.  
Behavioral Targeting and Remarketing. We may use various advertising platforms to display ads as part of our advertising campaigns.
