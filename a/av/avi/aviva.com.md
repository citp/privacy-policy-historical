You’ll find more privacy notices when you use our apps and platforms such as Drive or MyAviva. This Policy supplements – but doesn’t override – them.

We’ll keep this Policy up to date with the latest legal requirements, so please check back here for the current version.

**Sensitive information**

Sometimes we’ll ask about your **health** , details of **offences and convictions** or other sensitive information about the person(s) who is/are being insured and their family members. We know how sensitive that data is, so protecting it is a top priority.

They will use your data to decide whether to provide reinsurance and insurance cover, assess and deal with reinsurance and insurance claims and to meet legal obligations. They will keep your data for the period necessary for these purposes and may need to disclose it to other companies within their group, their agents and third party **service providers** , law enforcement and regulatory bodies.

We can supply on request further details of the reinsurers and insurers we provide your data to and how this information may be used. If you require further details contact us.

##### **2.7 Using personal information to create profiles and create better products**

Where we **underwrite** products, we use an automated underwriting engine to **process** the **personal information** you provide as part of your application **process** , together with information provided by third party sources (this could include sensitive information such as **health information** and **offences and convictions** ) along with the amount of cover you wish to obtain. Other data may be used to calculate these decisions such as **telematics data** which may have been collected from your vehicle (for motor insurance) or your device. We do this to calculate how much that cover will cost you. Without this information we’re unable to provide a price that is relevant to your individual circumstances and needs.

We regularly check the way our underwriting engine works and before using data obtained from third parties we rigorously test it to identify whether the data provides any actionable insight. This is done using the bare minimum amount of hashed or obscured data we hold about our customers. We do this in order to continually improve the quality of our services, the efficacy of our algorithms and to help us to continue to be fair to our customers.

If you are making a **claim** , we may use **profiling** or other forms of automated processing to assess the probability that your **claim** may be fraudulent or suspect in some way.

Where **sensitive personal information** is relevant to the **profiling** , such as medical history for life insurance or **offences and convictions** for motor insurance, your **sensitive personal information** may also be used in the **profiling** models.

You have certain rights in respect of this type of **automated decision making**. To learn more about your rights click here.

##### **2.8 Retaining personal information in our systems**

We generally only keep **personal information** for as long as is reasonably required for the reasons explained in this privacy policy. We do keep certain transactional records - which may include **personal information** \- for more extended periods if we need to do this to meet legal, regulatory, tax or accounting needs. For instance, we’re required to retain an accurate record of your dealings with us, so we can respond to any complaints or challenges you or others might raise later. We’ll also retain files if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation.

To support us in managing how long we hold your data and our record management, we maintain a data retention policy which includes clear guidelines on data deletion.

We may also retain personal information where we have identified a legal basis for doing so in an aggregated form which allows us to continue to develop/improve our products and services.

##### **2.9 Protecting information outside the UK**

Some of the organisations we share information with may be located outside of the European Economic Area ("EEA"). We’ll always take steps to ensure that any transfer of information outside the EEA is carefully managed to protect your privacy rights:

  * transfers within the Aviva Group will be covered by an agreement entered into by members of the Aviva Group (an intra-group agreement) which contractually obliges each member to ensure that your **personal information** receives an adequate and consistent level of protection wherever it is transferred within the Group;
  * where we transfer your data to non-Aviva Group members or other companies providing us with a service, we’ll obtain contractual commitments and assurances from them to protect your **personal information**. Some of these assurances are well recognised certification schemes such as standard contractual clauses and the EU - U.S. Privacy Shield for the protection of **personal information** transferred from within the EU to the United States of America
  * we’ll only transfer **personal information** to countries which are recognised as providing an adequate level of legal protection or where we can be satisfied that alternative arrangements are in place to protect your privacy rights; and
  * any requests for information we receive from law enforcement or regulators will be carefully validated before **personal information** is disclosed



You have a right to ask us for more information about the safeguards we have put in place as mentioned above. To learn more, please read your rights section.

3\. Your rights
    

You have legal rights under data protection laws in relation to your **personal information**. Click on the links below to learn more about each right you may have.

#####  3.1 Accessing personal information  
3.2 Withdrawing consent  
3.3 Correcting/erasing personal information  
3.4 Restricting our use of personal information  
3.5 Objecting to use of personal information  
3.6 Requesting a transfer of personal information

We may ask you for proof of identity when making a request to exercise any of these rights. We do this to ensure we only disclose information where we know we’re dealing with the right individual.

We’ll not ask for a fee, unless we think your request is unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Where a fee is necessary, we’ll inform you before proceeding with your request.

We aim to respond to all valid requests within one month. It may however take us longer if the request is particularly complicated or you have made several requests. We’ll always let you know if we think a response will take longer than one month. To speed up our response, we may ask you to provide more detail about what you want to receive or are concerned about.

We may not always be able to do what you have asked, for example if it would impact the duty of confidentiality we owe to others, or if we’re otherwise legally entitled to deal with the request in a different way.

##### **3.1 Accessing personal information**

You can ask us to:

  * confirm whether or not we have and are using your **personal information**
  * get a copy of your **personal information**



##### **3.2 Withdrawing consent**

Where we’ve asked for your consent to use your **personal information** , you’ll always have the right to withdraw such consent. Please contact us if you want to do this. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products and services to you. If this is the case, we’ll tell you at the time you ask to withdraw your consent.

##### **3.3 Correcting / erasing personal information**

You can ask us to:

  * correct any information about you which is incorrect. We’ll be happy to correct such information but will need to verify the accuracy of it first
  * erase your **personal information** if you think we no longer need to use it for the purpose we collected it from you
  * erase your **personal information** if you have either withdrawn your consent to us using your information (if we originally asked for your consent to use your information), or exercised your right to object to further legitimate use of your information, where we have used it unlawfully or where we’re subject to a legal obligation to erase your **personal information**



We may not always be able to comply with your request, for example, if we need to keep using your **personal information** in order to comply with our legal obligation or where we need to use it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.

##### **3.4 Restricting our use of personal information**

You can ask us to restrict our use of your **personal information** in certain circumstances, for example, where:

  * you think the information is inaccurate and we need to verify it
  * our use of your **personal information** is not lawful but you do not want us to erase it
  * the information is no longer required for the purposes for which it was collected but we need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or
  * you have objected to our use of your **personal information** but we still need to verify if we have overriding grounds to use it



We can continue to use your **personal information** following a request for restriction if we have your consent to use it; or you need to use it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims, or we need to use it to protect the rights of another individual or a company.

##### **3.5 Objecting to use of personal information**

You can object to any use of your **personal information** which we have justified on the basis of our **legitimate interest** , if you believe your fundamental rights and freedoms to data protection outweigh our **legitimate interest** in using the information. If you raise an objection, we may continue to use the **personal information** if we can demonstrate that we have compelling **legitimate interests** to use the information.

You can also object to use of your **personal information** for **direct marketing** purposes. We explain in the marketing section of this privacy policy more about our approach to direct marketing and how you can easily manage your marketing preferences.

##### **3.6 Requesting a transfer of personal information**

You can ask us to provide your **personal information** to you in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format, or you can ask to have it transferred directly to another **data controller** (eg another company).

You may only exercise this right where we use your **personal information** in order to perform a contract with you, or where we asked for your consent to use your **personal information**. This right does not apply to any **personal information** which we hold or **process** based on our **legitimate interest** or which is not held in digital form.

##### **3.7 Contesting decisions based on automated decision making**

If we made a decision about you based solely by automated means (ie with no human intervention), and our decision produces a legal effect concerning you (such as the rejection of your **claim** ), or significantly affects you, you may have the right to contest that decision, express your point of view and ask for a human review. These rights do not apply where we’re authorised by law to make such decisions and have adopted suitable safeguards in our decision-making processes to protect your rights and freedoms.

##### **3.8 Obtaining a copy of our safety measures**

You can ask for a copy of, or reference to, the safeguards we have put in place when your **personal information** is transferred outside of the European Economic Area.
