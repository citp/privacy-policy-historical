<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Avid Articles Privacy Policy</span></p>
<p>Avid Articles aims to provide services to authors and publishers as well as
other parties who may have an interest in the material produced by our member
authors. We use Internet technology to achieve this and we aim to provide an
interactive and personalized experience.</p>
<p>We may use Personally Identifiable Information (including your name, e-mail
address, postal address, telephone number) and it is our aim at all times to
be guided by the terms of this privacy policy.</p>
<p>We will never disclose your email address to any third party unless that third
party is providing Avid Articles with services on an out sourcing basis and in
that event any such third party would be bound by the same procedures as we
observe in house. Your email address and other personal details will never be
disclosed to any other party except as directed by a court where all the
correct formalities have been complied with.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">How we gather information from users</span></p>
<p>How we collect and store information depends on the particular page you are
visiting, the activities you participate in and the services we are providing
you. You may for example provide us with registration information for particular
services when you register for access to certain parts of our site or request
certain facilities such as newsletters or at any such time as you make a
purchase. </p>
<p>You may provide information when you participate in contests or competitions,
forums or chat rooms and other interactive areas of our site. In common with
most Web sites, Avid Articles also collects information automatically and through
the use of technologies that may not be obvious to our visitors. </p>
<p>To improve the quality of your visit we may log the name of your Internet
Service Provider or use cookie technology to recognize you and hold certain
information regarding your visit. The cookie may among other things store your
user name and password which is designed to spare you from having to re-enter
that information on every occasion that you visit, or possibly control the
number of times you encounter particular promotional material while visiting
our site. With the uptake of additional technology, we may in the future
gather information by other means. You may be able in certain cases to choose
not to provide us with information - for example by setting your browser to
not accept cookies but if you were to do this you may be unable to access
certain parts of the site or you may be asked to re-enter your user name and
password. In addition, we may no longer be able to customize the site's
features according to your preferences.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">What we do with the information we collect</span></p>
Like other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance your visit and
deliver more individualized content and advertising. We respect your privacy
and do not share your information with anyone.<p></p>
<p>Aggregated Information (information that does not personally identify you)
may be used in many ways. We may combine information about usage patterns by
one or more users to help improve our site and services (such as to determine
pages visited or features that users find most attractive). Aggregated
Information may occasionally be shared with advertisers and business partners.
This is anonymous information and does not allow anyone to identify you
individually.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">We may use your Personally Identifiable
Information to discuss with you:</span></p>
<li>your registration and customization preferences </li>
<li>our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy </li>
<li>services and products offered by Avid Articles</li>
<li>other areas we think you might find of interest. </li>
<p>Personally Identifiable Information collected by Avid Articles may also be used
for other purposes. This may include but is not limited to site troubleshooting,
administration, transaction processing, administration of competitions and
various other matters. Trusted third parties who provide technical services for
the operation of our site (our web host for example) may access such information.
We will use your information only as permitted by law. </p>
<p>In addition, as we continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge
or partner with other businesses. When this type of activity takes place, user
information may be among the transferred assets. We may also disclose your
information in response to a court order, whenever we believe we are reasonably
required to do so by law, in connection with the collection of monies you may
owe to us, and or to law enforcement agencies authorities whenever we believe
it to be appropriate or necessary to do so. Please note we may not be permitted
to provide you with notice prior to or after disclosure in such cases.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements</span></p>
<p>Avid Articles expects all persons or businesses with whom we deal to respect
the privacy of our users. You must understand, however, that third parties
including our advertisers, partners, affiliates and other content providers
accessible through our site may have their own privacy and data collection
policies and practices. For example, during your visit to our site you may view
content that is actually created or hosted by a third party. Also, through Avid
Articles you may be introduced to or be able to access information or services
offered by other parties. Avid Articles is not responsible for the actions or
policies of such third parties and therefore you should check the applicable
privacy policies of those third parties when providing information on a feature
or page operated by a third party.</p>
While on our site, any of our business partners may use cookies or other
technology to attempt to identify some of your preferences or retrieve
information about you. Some of our advertising is served by third
parties and may include cookies that enable the advertiser to determine
whether you have seen a particular advertisement before. Other features
available on our site may involve third parties and may use cookies or
other technology to gather information.<p></p>Avid Articles does not
control the use of this technology or the resulting information when
operated by other parties and Avid Articles is not responsible for the
actions or policies of such third parties.<p></p>You should also be
aware that if you voluntarily disclose Personally Identifiable
Information on forums or in discussion areas, that information can be
viewed publicly and can be collected and used by third parties without
our knowledge and may result in unsolicited messages from other
individuals or third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of
Avid Articles and this policy and you should exercise appropriate
caution.<p></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Children</span></p>
<p>Avid Articles does not knowingly collect or solicit Personally
Identifiable Information from or about children under the age of 13. If
we discover we have received any information from a child under 13 in
violation of this policy, we will delete that information immediately.
Please remember that rules concerning the processing of data vary from
country to country. If you believe Avid Articles has any information
from or about anyone under 13, please contact us via our support desk.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Contacting Us</span></p>
<p>We can be reached by leaving a message at our support desk. (* LINK*)</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changes to this Policy</span></p>
<p>Avid Articles reserves the right to change this policy at any time. Your
continued use of our site following the posting of changes to these terms
will indicate that you accept the alterations. Please check this page
periodically for changes. Information collected prior to the time that any
change is notified will be used in accordance with the rules and laws that
applied at the time that the information was collected.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Governing law</span></p>
<p>This policy and the use of this Site are governed by English law. This
statement and the policies outlined herein are not intended to and do
not create any contractual or other legal rights in or on behalf of any
party.</p>
