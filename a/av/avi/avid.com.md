#### GENERAL INFORMATION

#### IP Addresses and Cookies

Generally speaking, you may visit the site while remaining anonymous and not revealing any personal information.

Our websites automatically log your IP address and domain name, and non-personal information such as the type of web browser you use, to help us administer the sites and to compile statistics such as the number of visitors.

Our websites use cookies to identify you over multiple visits to the site, for example to remember your country and provide country-specific content. Cookies are optional, and you can block or delete them. However, some parts of our websites (e.g. chat pages, Online Store) will not work without cookies. Cookies may also be used to track visitor behavior on the website, which allows visitors to be retargeted with digital advertising that reflects their past behavior on the site.

Persistent cookies: Persistent cookies may stay on your disk for a long time after the session is ended. These cookies may hold data such as login details, contact information and account numbers, so that you don’t have to type them in every time you use the site.

Avid also permits third-party advertising partners to use cookies and other technology to collect information about your browsing activities over time and across different websites when you use our site. Through a process called “retargeting,” each service places a cookie on your browser when you visit our site so that they can identify you and serve you ads on other sites around the web based on your browsing activity.
