AVG Technologies, including our offices (subsidiaries and affiliates) abroad to which your personal data are made accessible, retain the personal information collected through AVG Technologies website, including your personal information that you submit through a registration process, for as long as you are registered at any AVG Technologies website through a user account or are a user of AVG Technologies products, and for a reasonable time thereafter, unless and until you have recalled your consent with the processing of your personal information. 

## Security

We have taken security measures, consistent with international information practices, to protect your personal information. These measures include technical and procedural steps and measures to protect your personal information from misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, loss, alteration, or destruction. All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. Credit card information is transmitted using secure socket layer (SSL) encryption. We use industry-standard encryption to enhance the security of data transmissions and have implemented commercially available technologies to guard against unauthorized access to any personal information that is stored electronically by AVG Technologies. We restrict access to personal information about you to those AVG Technologies employees who need to know the information for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.

Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our website, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone. If you share a computer with anyone, always log out before leaving a website or service to protect access to your information from subsequent users.

Unfortunately, no transmission of information over the internet can be guaranteed to be completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to our website from your PC or the Internet Service Provider, and any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to ensure its security on our systems and to try to prevent unauthorized access.

## With Whom Do We Share Your Information?

Except as described in this Privacy Policy, we will not disclose users’ personal information outside of AVG Technologies and its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates without your consent. AVG Technologies will expend the maximum effort to protect users' personal information against misuse and will refrain from disclosing it to third parties. 

Through some AVG Technologies websites, by selecting a region (language) option, you may be asked to share your personal information, such as your e-mail contact, with selected local AVG Technologies partners, such as distributors (the full list of which is available at our local websites) so that they can contact you, on our behalf, about AVG Technologies products, services or offers that we believe are important to you or your business and to provide you a local technical and customer support. We encourage you to read our partners' privacy policies before providing your personal information.

AVG Technologies retains the services of outside contractors to provide limited services on our behalf us, such as shipping products or handling order processing, processing transactions (including credit card transactions), or performing statistical analysis of our services. It may be necessary to share user personal information with these contractors in order to allow them to provide their services. You have the right not to provide the requested information, but in such case you may not be able to receive these services. Those contractors will be permitted to obtain only the personal information they need to deliver the service and we require that they keep the personal information of our customers secure and confidential and comply with the Act. We also require that these contractors use our customers' personal information only on behalf of AVG Technologies and do not disclose them to third parties or use them for any other purpose.

Please be advised that in certain instances it may be necessary for AVG Technologies to disclose your personal information if we believe such action is necessary to:  
(a) comply with law or legal process served on AVG Technologies;  
(b) protect and defend the rights, property or legitimate interests of AVG Technologies (including the enforcement of our agreements); or  
(c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of AVG Technologies services or members of the public.
