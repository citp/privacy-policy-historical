There are a number of legal bases for using personal data. This section sets out more information on the main legal bases which the Club relies on. For further information on when each legal basis applies, please see section 4.

**_Performance of a contract with you_**

If we have entered into a contract with you, or are about to enter into a contract with you, we may need to process your personal data so that we can honour that contract. For example, if you buy tickets online we need to know your name and contact details so that we can send those tickets to you.

If you do not provide personal data that we need to perform a contract with you, we may not be able to perform that contract. This means that, where the contract is to provide you with a product or service, we may not be able to process your order or provide you with that product or service.

**_Legitimate interests_**

We may process your personal data where it is necessary for our interests (or those of a third party). We will only do this where: 

  * those interests are legitimate; AND
  * those interests are not overridden by your interests and fundamental rights.



You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data where we are processing that personal data as necessary for our legitimate interests. For more information, please see section 10.

When doing this, please ensure that you provide sufficient information so that the Club can verify your identity and clearly state what you are withdrawing your consent to.

The Club may also need to share your personal data with a regulator or to otherwise comply with the law.

**_Transfers outside the European Economic Area (EEA)_**

This may occur when the third party that we share your data with is situated outside the European Economic Area (which is made up of the countries forming the European Union, plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway), or they use servers or other cloud services based outside the EU. If the Club does so, the Club will do its best to ensure a similar degree of protection in respect of your personal data as if the transfer was made within the EEA.

**_Ensuring security when transferring personal data to third parties_**

All of the Club’s third-party service providers and other entities in the Club’s group are required to take appropriate security measures to protect your personal data in line with the Club’s policies and the law and to treat the information confidentially. The Club does not allow the Club’s third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes. The Club only permits them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with the Club’s instructions. 

**6\. Change of Purpose  ** ** **(Back to Top)********

The Club will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless the Club reasonably considers that it needs to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If the Club needs to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, the Club will notify (by updating this Privacy Policy) and explain the legal basis for doing so. 

Please note that the Club may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.

**7\. Automated Decision-Making  ** ** **(Back to Top)********

The Club does not currently operate any automated decision-making. 

Please note that Zebra Finance, the company which offers a finance solution for the Club’s season ticket purchasers may use automated decision-making when deciding whether or not to offer you credit. The Club has no influence or involvement in this. Please refer to Zebra Finance’s website for further information. Zebra Finance’s Privacy Notice can be found [HERE](http://www.zebrafinance.com/privacynotice) (please note this will take you to a third party website – the Club is not responsible for Zebra Finance’s website).

**8\. Data Security  ** ** **(Back to Top)********

The Club has put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, the Club limits access to your personal data to those employees, agents, consultants and other third parties (referred to in section 5) who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on the Club’s instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality. 

The Club has put in place procedures to deal with any data security breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where the Club is legally required to do so.

**9\. How long will the Club keep your information for?  ** ** **(Back to Top)********

The Club will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes it collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. The Club has in place a Data Retention Policy which includes recommended data retention periods for your personal data. 

In some circumstances the Club may anonymise your personal data so that it can no longer be associated with you, in which case the Club may use such information without further notice to you. 

  * We keep information related to your Official AVFC Website account for as long as your account remains active. To delete your Official AVFC Website Account, please contact the Club using the details provided in section 2.
  * We keep supporter personal data in our Club database for the longer of: 
    * 2 years from the supporter’s last known interaction with the Club; or
    * in the case of Club ticket purchases, 5 seasons since the last purchase.
As we review our databases on a quarterly basis, personal data may be retained for slightly longer than the periods specified above, until the next quarterly review. 
  * Where you have opted in to receive marketing, we retain details of your consent and shall continue to market to you in accordance with your preferences for a period of 2 years from your last interaction with the Club or until you opt out, whichever is earlier.
  * For the purposes of retaining personal data, we currently regard the following as interactions with the Club: attending a Club match; logging into your online account; purchasing a product from the Club’s Online Store; opening an email from the Club. We may update this from time to time, depending on the data available to the Club to capture interactions.
  * We keep information which may relate to accidents or injuries for a period of 3 years from the date of the last entry in the log in which it is recorded (or, where the accident involves a child/ young adult, until that person reaches the age of 21, if longer). We do this in case there are any queries and to respond to any claims in relation to that incident. If we are aware that claim or legal action is or ongoing in relation to an accident or injury, we will keep relevant information until that claim or legal action has concluded.
  * We keep other information which may relate to a claim or legal action for a period of 7 years (or longer, if a claim or legal action is in progress). We do this in case there are any queries and to respond to claims in relation to that incident.
  * We keep CCTV footage for a period of 28 days following the recording (or longer if required in connection with an ongoing issue or if required by law).



**10\. Your legal rights  ** ** **(Back to Top)********

It is important that the personal data the Club holds about you is accurate and current. Please keep the Club informed if your personal data changes. 

Under certain circumstances, by law you have the right to:

  * Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data the Club holds about you and to check that it is lawfully processing it.
  * Request correction of the personal data that the Club holds about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information the Club holds about you corrected.
  * Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask the Club to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for it continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask the Club to delete or remove your personal data where you have exercised your right to object to processing (see below).
  * Object to processing of your personal data where the Club is relying on a legitimate interest (see section 3 for those circumstances) (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground. We may be able to continue processing even if you object (if we have compelling legitimate grounds which override your interests, rights and freedoms or if in connection with legal claims).
  * Object to processing where the Club is processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. 
  * Request the restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask the Club to suspend the processing of personal data about you, for example if you want the Club to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it.
  * Request the transfer of your personal data to another party. 
  * Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent or of any processing that is lawfully carried out for another purpose (for example, to comply with a contract or a legitimate interest). If you withdraw consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.



If you want to review, verify, correct or request erasure of your personal data, object to the processing of your personal data, or request that the Club transfers a copy of your personal data to another party, please contact the Club in writing using the contact details given in section 2. Please ensure you give us details of your identity and contact details so we can identify you and the personal data in question and contact you in relation to your query.

You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, the Club may charge a reasonable fee if your request for access is clearly unfounded or excessive. Alternatively, the Club may refuse to comply with the request in such circumstances.

The Club may need to request specific information from you to help it confirm your identity and ensure your right to access the information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.

11\. Children under the age of 16  ** ** **(Back to Top)********
