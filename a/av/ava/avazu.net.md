##### Avazu's Guidelines for the Use of Cookies and NPRI

Avazu's technology requires the use of cookies so we can promptly deliver advertisements to our Advertiser's Prospects on our Partner's sites or apps. This form of marketing is designated as Retargeting; this enhances an Advertiser's potential revenue by specifically re-targeting those whom are interested in the products. When a Prospect visits one of Avazu's Advertiser's websites, an Avazu pixel on that site sets an Avazu cookie on the browser of the Prospect. Therefore after the cookie is planted when a Prospect visits one of Avazu's Partners' websites; our Partner's website will identify the cookie on browser of the Prospect and recognize that they previously visited our Advertiser's website.

The Prospect will then be shown an advertisement from that Advertiser. In this instance, Avazu will know that the Prospect first visited our Advertiser's website, and then our Partner's website. This information is all that is used in reporting our Prospects to advertisers and therefore in no way can be used to specifically identify an individual.

The NPRI data collected by Avazu in the above outlined process of Retargeting will be kept by Avazu's database for the period of one year only. After one year all data is routinely destroyed. This information is only used for the purpose of re-targeting and in no way is personal information. You may Opt-Out of Avazu's services with ease by following the instructions listed below.
