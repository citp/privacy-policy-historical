The Prospect will then be shown an advertisement from that Advertiser. In this instance, Avazu will know that the Prospect first visited our Advertiser's website, and then our Partner's website. This information is all that is used in reporting our Prospects to advertisers and therefore in no way can be used to specifically identify an individual.
