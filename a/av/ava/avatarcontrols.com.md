**Information About Avatarcontrols On-Line Visitors**

You can visit Avatarcontrols on the Site without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself. Our web servers collect the domain names, not the e-mail addresses, of visitors.

In general, we gather information about users of the Site collectively in order to determine, for example, which areas users access more frequently and which materials users access the most.

This information helps us to determine what is most beneficial for our users, and how we can continually create a better overall experience for our users by improving the content of the Site.

There are times however, when we may need information from you, such as your name and address. Customarily, the personal information Avatar Controls obtains is used only to respond to inquiries, to process orders, for product registration, or to allow you to access specific account information.

We may also ask you to voluntarily provide us with information for market research such as your interests, demographics, and experience with our products.

Occasionally, we may make the e-mail addresses of those who provide information available to other reputable organizations whose products or services we think you may find interesting.
