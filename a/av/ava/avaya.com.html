<strong>Avaya Inc. abides by the EU (European Union) Safe Harbor framework as set forth by the Department of Commerce regarding collection, use, and retention of personally identifiable information from customers and/or potential customers from the European Union through the Avaya.com domain.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Avaya Inc. and its worldwide affiliates (collectively 
"Avaya")</strong> have long recognized that individuals with whom we conduct 
business value their privacy. However, in order to conduct global business in 
this increasingly electronic economy, the collection of Personal Data is often 
necessary and desirable. It is Avaya's goal to balance the benefits of 
e-business with the right of individuals to prevent the misuse of their personal 
data. </p>
<p>
<strong>The Collection of Personal Data</strong>
</p>
<p>
In order to access and use certain Avaya websites or parts of websites, Avaya will request Personal Data from you, like your name, e-mail address, company name and telephone number ("Personal Data"). Avaya uses this information to customize your experience on our web site and provide you with a password to use these web sites, or for the purposes stated at the time of collection, such as participation in a promotion.</p>
<p>
By registering on the Avaya web site, you will be deemed to have consented to the use, transfer, export and retention of your Personal Data as set out in this privacy statement. Consequently, after registering, Avaya may use this submitted information for other business purposes, such as alerting you to products and services that can assist you in your business, promoting site registration, and assisting in order processing. Avaya will maintain Personal Data in a secure environment through a secure connection/encryption to ensure confidentiality. Avaya aims to ensure that any Personal Data held by Avaya it processes is accurate.  <strong>You may update or amend your Personal Data held by Avaya by changing your profile information on the site(s) for which you have registered or by contacting Avaya at:</strong> <a href="mailto:executiveoffic@avaya.com" s_oc="null">executiveoffic@avaya.com</a> or submitting a request by <a href="http://www.avaya.com/gcm/master-usa/en-us/tasks/connect/contacts/corpcontact/corpform/contactavaya.htm" s_oc="null">contacting Avaya</a>. </p>
<p>
Avaya may also use third party sources of information to qualify 
clients, potential clients, resellers and distributors.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Tell-A-Friend</strong>
</p>
<p>
If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our 
site, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address.  We will 
automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the 
site.  Avaya does not store this information.<br>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Transfer of Personal Data.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>WHEN YOU SUBMIT Personal Data TO AVAYA, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND 
AGREE THAT AVAYA MAY TRANSFER MY Personal Data TO, AND RETAIN AND PROCESS MY 
Personal Data IN, THE UNITED STATES, REGARDLESS OF THE COUNTRY IN WHICH YOU 
REGISTERED. IF YOU DO NOT APPROVE OF SUCH TRANSFER, PROCESSING AND/OR RETENTION, 
DO NOT SUBMIT Personal Data TO AVAYA.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Collecting Domain Information.</strong>
</p>
<p> Avaya also collects 
domain information (e.g. IP address and referring URLs) as part of its analysis 
of the use of this site. This data enables us to become more familiar with which 
customers visit our site, how often they visit and what parts of the site they 
visit most often. Avaya uses this information to improve its web-based 
offerings. This information is collected automatically and requires no action on 
your part. We do not tie Personal Data to domain information, except as 
necessary to prevent abuse or fraud on our site.</p>
<p>
<strong>Disclosure to Third Parties.</strong>
</p>
<p>
If you request something from the Avaya Web site, for example, a product or service, a callback, or specific marketing materials, we will use the information you provide to fulfill your request. To help us do this, we may share information (with the exception of account, credit card and ordering information) with others, who can alert you about new products and services to improve your competitive edge. These business partners act as service providers on our behalf to fulfill the services you have requested to receive.
</p>
<p>
From time to time, we use other third parties to provide services on 
our behalf, such as for marketing purposes. We share information with these 
third parties as necessary to provide that service on our behalf. In such cases, 
the organizations are not permitted to use your information for any secondary 
purposes. These third parties are prohibited from using your personally 
identifiable information for any other purpose. We will offer you the 
opportunity to choose whether or not to have your information used in this way. 
If you do not wish to be contacted by Avaya, contact Avaya at:

<p>
Avaya may disclose aggregate statistics about our site visitors, 
customers and sales in order to describe our services to prospective partners, 
advertisers and other reputable third parties and for other lawful purposes, but 
these statistics will include no personally identifying information. Avaya may 
disclose Personal Data if required to do so by law or if it believes that such 
action is necessary to protect and defend the rights, property or personal 
safety of Avaya, the site or its visitors. Avaya may disclose your Personal Data 
in the event of any sale or transfer of its business or assets. For information 
on changes in use of your information in the event of such a sale or transfer,
