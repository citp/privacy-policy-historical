  <div class="hd"><h2>8. How Avago Technologies Uses Cookies</h2></div>
  <div class="indent">
    <p>A cookie is a piece of information either stored temporarily in your browser's memory space (session cookie) or placed on your computer's hard drive (stored cookie). Cookies allow a web application to respond to you as an individual, but without the need to identify you explicitly. Session cookies are destroyed when you terminate your browsing session by shutting down your browser. Stored cookies often have a predetermined expiration date after which they disappear from your hard drive. Cookies can be removed explicitly through functionality built into most web browsers. You may also set your web browser (e.g. Microsoft Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator) to notify you of cookie placement requests, ask for permission to accept them, or decline cookies completely.</p>
<h3>Adjusting Browser Cookie Settings</h3>
<p>For information on how to adjust your browser regarding cookies, please visit:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Microsoft Internet Explorer: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/info/cookies.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/info/cookies.htm</a></li>

</ul>
<h3>Cookie Usage</h3>
<p>On occasion Avago Technologies may use cookies to help us analyze web traffic or to improve your web navigation experience. To facilitate the analysis, an ID is assigned to help us uniquely identify you each time you return to our web site. One of the major concerns about stored cookies is the fear that they contain personal information and information identifying you that could be accessed by other web sites. Avago Technologies only stores a randomly chosen unique ID number and a context, both of which are meaningless to others, but help us uniquely identify you.</p>
<p>By gathering and remembering information about your preferences, the web application can:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Tailor its operation to your needs, likes and dislikes</li>
    <li>Provide an automated log-in process as a convenience for previously registered customers. This insures that you will be accurately identified and linked with your registration data.</li>
    <li>Be placed on your computer to ensure you are not surveyed multiple times during your visit(s) to an Avago Technologies web site. This cookie has a limited life span and will not personally identify you.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cookies help us provide a better web experience by letting us monitor what's working and what isn't through site traffic analysis. Avago Technologies wants to be sure you understand that accepting a cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any personal information about you, other than the data you chose to share with us. This practice is strictly enforced. While acknowledging the concerns that some visitors have about cookie usage, we believe that the benefit our webpage visitors gain from the use of cookies is worthwhile.</p>

  <div class="hd"><h2>10. Customer Satisfaction Studies &amp; Market Research Activities</h2></div>
  <div class="indent">
    <h3>Product &amp; Market Research @ Avago Technologies</h3>
<p>The market research process at Avago Technologies includes quantitative and qualitative studies on a wide range of topics. Quantitative studies may include surveys focused on overall markets, regions, applications, customers, or resellers. Qualitative studies include in-depth interviews, traditional in-person focus groups, or the use of online discussion boards or Blogs.</p>
<p>The idea behind all these processes is <strong>to learn what is important to you</strong> and tailor Avago Technologies products, systems, services, and support to <strong>exceed your expectations</strong>. If you are invited to participate in a research study for Avago Technologies, you may be asked, for example, to evaluate prototype technologies, share impressions of marketing communications materials, or discuss aspects of our web site.</p>
<h3>Measuring Customer Satisfaction @ Avago Technologies</h3>
<p>The Avago Technologies Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) program is an ongoing, systematic study of customer experiences at key touch points across the global Avago Technologies organization. The term customer refers to: current, former, or potential customers of Avago Technologies, visitors to Avago Technologies’ web site, and resellers or channel partners working with Avago Technologies.</p>
<p>CSAT surveys are conducted at regular intervals using state-of-the-art web survey methodologies. Surveys are offered in multiple languages, and are designed to run smoothly on multiple operating systems and browsers.</p>
<p>CSAT measures your satisfaction after a recent interaction or transaction with one of Avago Technology’s customer touch points. <strong>If you recently received a survey invitation it is because you:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Contacted the <a href="mailto:support@avagotech.com" target="">Avago Technical Response Center</a></li>
    <li>Contacted the Avago Business Center</li>
    <li>Visited the Avago web site, or</li>
    <li>Had recent contact with the Avago account team that supports your organization.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Why Avago Technologies surveys its customers</h3>
<p>The process of inviting customers to complete surveys is done with one overriding goal in mind: to enhance your experience with Avago Technologies.</p>
<h3>How often are Avago technologies CSAT surveys conducted?</h3>
<p>Each Avago Technologies touch point is studied twice a year so managers have up-to-date information on the customer or visitor experience at those touch points, and a clear picture of what to do to enhance your satisfaction when you interact with Avago Technologies personnel at those touch points. In research conducted with our customers on the issue of survey frequency, customers told us receiving survey invitations as often as twice a year was deemed "acceptable".</p>
<p>It is not our intention to survey you EVERY time you interact with one of our touch points. We use random sampling procedures and database tools to help keep the number of survey invitations sent to you under control. We understand few people actually enjoy completing surveys, but we know surveys are a valuable link between you and Avago Technologies management, and we want to keep that link open. The survey mechanism provides you a unique opportunity to speak your mind about how we are performing. Furthermore, you control whether you identify yourself or submit your comments anonymously.</p>
<p>At Avago Technologies, it’s always your call whether to respond when invited to participate in a survey.</p>
<p><strong>Avago Technologies ascribes to the Marketing Research Association’s <em>Ethical Guidelines for the Use of the Internet for Conducting Opinion &amp; Marketing Research</em>.</strong></p>
<p>Avago Technologies is a member of the Marketing Research Association and follows the MRA Guidelines for web-based research, whose provisions include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Your cooperation will be voluntary</li>
    <li>Our identity will be disclosed</li>
    <li>Your rights to anonymity will be safeguarded</li>
    <li>Our privacy policy statements will be posted online (See items 1 through 9, above)</li>
    <li>Data security is maintained</li>
    <li>Unsolicited e-mail is not sent to those who have opted out of receiving such e-mail</li>
    <li>For details on these Guidelines, or more information on the MRA, click here: <a href="http://www.mra-net.org/">http://www.mra-net.org</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Survey FAQ’s</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        <h3>If I agree to take this survey, will I be bombarded with more surveys from Avago Technologies?</h3>
        <p>No. Avago Technologies is working closely with our survey research partner to limit the number of survey invitations related to a given touch point in a 12-month period.<br></p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>If I complete an Avago Technologies survey, will my contact information be sold or given to other companies for marketing or sales purposes, or used by Avago Technologies for its own marketing or sales purposes?</h3>
        <p>No. At Avago Technologies, we take your concern for privacy seriously. Survey databases containing names and identifying information of persons who have had recent contact with Avago Technologies are never merged with marketing databases, nor shared with other parts of the Avago Technologies organization. These data are not released to third-party organizations or individuals outside the Avago Technologies organization, except to be provided to the CSAT survey research vendor who, as part of their contract with Avago Technologies, manages the process of mailing e-mail invitations to you. The CSAT vendor operates under a PERSONAL DATA CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT (PDCA) with Avago Technologies, which includes the following provision, “(Vendor) may not disclose Personal Information to any other third party without the prior written consent of Avago Technologies. Under no circumstances may Participant sell, rent or lease Personal Information to any third parties.”</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>I was asked if I wanted to receive an Avago Technologies newsletter and opted out. Why then am I getting a survey from Avago Technologies?</h3>
        <p>Before sending you a newsletter or marketing-related information about new Avago Technologies products or services, Avago Technologies will ask you to opt-in to confirm your interest in this information. If you elect to opt out of this type of information, no further marketing-related information will be sent to you.</p>
        <p>The CSAT survey is a separate form of communication with our customers and channel partners, and is not classified as a marketing-related communication. It is often the concluding step in a process that began with a recent transaction or interaction with Avago Technologies. As such, the prior opt-in requirement is not relevant.</p>
        <p>Having said that, survey participation is still voluntary. You can elect not to respond to a given survey. Our survey e-mail invitation also provides you with an means to opt-out of the entire survey process. However, if you exercise this option, you will no longer have an opportunity to share your opinions or ideas with Avago Technologies senior management through the CSAT program.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>How do I know you won’t publish my name along with my responses to the CSAT survey?</h3>
        <p>Your name or identifying data such as e-mail address, is NEVER published in CSAT reports. However, there are three scenarios where your name may appear in CSAT documents or communications, or where you may wish to provide your name in the course of completing the survey:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If, in the course of completing the CSAT survey, you ask Avago Technologies to follow up with you—to address a matter of concern to you, you then give our research vendor permission to forward your name and contact information to the appropriate manager at Avago Technologies to facilitate immediate follow-up and action.</li>
            <li>At the conclusion of the survey, you are asked if you want to give Avago Technologies permission to “share your individual responses.” Most of our survey respondents give us permission to do so. Even when you give us permission to share your individual responses, we do not publish your name or personal identifying information in reports of findings. CSAT reports typically report findings on a touch point, regional, job-category, applications area, or product-category basis.</li>
            <li>At the conclusion of some CSAT surveys, respondents are invited to provide their name and contact information for the purposes of a gift drawing, as a thank-you for completing the survey. This information is used only to make a random selection among those providing information, and to locate the winners to do gift fulfillment. Beyond these purposes, names and contact information are not released.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
