Availity Web Privacy and Security Statement

Commitment to Confidentiality

Confidentiality is a top priority at Availity. We are committed to maintaining the highest level of confidentiality with all of the information we receive from our policy owners, including the information received from this Web site.

Personal Information

At Availity we are very aware of the privacy concerns of our customers and others who visit the Availity Web site. In fact, we share your concerns and will not solicit personal information from you as you tour our site, though you may provide that information voluntarily. If you do elect to provide personal information to us, in no case will we sell, license, or transmit that information outside of Availity for any reason, unless you authorize us to do so.

There are instances in which Availity might internally use the personal information you voluntarily submit. These instances include identifying and registering you for the Customer Service Center portion of our site. In addition, we may disclose your personal information (as described below) to our agents, affiliates and subsidiaries to enable them to perform certain functions for us. We may also use your Secret Prompt, Secret Response, and Birth Date to later identify you in case you forget or misplace your User ID/Password.

"Personal" information is described as data that is unique to an individual, such as a name, address, telephone number, social security number, and date of birth (DOB). At times, we may request personal information from you through our sites in order to deliver requested materials to you, respond to your questions, or deliver a product or service and will use the information for such purposes.

  
What You Should Know

The information contained on this Availity Web site is provided for general informational purposes, as a convenience to the customers of Availity subsidiaries and as a public service. The material is not a substitute for obtaining professional advice from a qualified person, firm, or corporation. Consult the appropriate professional advisor for more complete and up-to-the minute information. Availity is not engaged in rendering any legal, medical, or professional services by placing this general informational material on this Web site.

_In no circumstances will Availity be liable to any party for any direct, indirect, special, or other consequential damages arising out of any use of this web site, or any other hyper-linked web site. This includes, without limitation, any lost profits, business interruption, loss of programs or data on your equipment, or otherwise, even if Availity is expressly advised of the possibility or likelihood of such damages._

Information may be changed or updated without notice. Therefore, information contained on our sites may be out of date at any given time. Availity may also make improvements and/or changes to the products and/or programs described on our sites at any time without notice.

E-mail

Should you send us your questions and comments via e-mail to any mail box provided on any of our affiliated Web sites, we will share your correspondence with our Customer Service representatives and those employees or agents most capable of addressing your questions and concerns. We will retain your communication until we have done our very best to provide you with a complete and satisfactory response. Ultimately, we will either discard your communication or, in some cases, archive it.

Please note that, unless we expressly advise you otherwise, the e-mail facilities on our Web site do not provide a means for completely secure and private communications between Availity and you, the User. Although every attempt will be made to keep your information confidential, from a technical standpoint, there is still a risk. For that reason, please do not use e-mail to communicate information to us that you consider to be confidential. If you wish, you may contact us instead via telephone at the Customer Service toll-free number.
