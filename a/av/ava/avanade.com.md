Data We Collect

We collect personal data of our workers, job candidates, suppliers, business contacts, shareholders and website users. We will always try to give individuals appropriate notice of what data will be collected and how it will be used. Whatever happens, we will only process that data if we consider it fair and lawful to do so. Except for certain information that we are required to collect by law, your decision to provide any personal data to us is voluntary. However, please note that if you do not provide certain information, we may not be able to accomplish some or all of the purposes outlined in this privacy statement. The data we collect may include information about you or your experiences with Avanade. For example, name and contact information; relationship with Avanade; and device data.

The personal data we process has been obtained from you or from certain third parties. Such third parties may include our affiliates, public authorities, public websites and social media, suppliers and vendors.

If you provide us with personal data of another person (for instance, a potential employee/referral), you are responsible for ensuring that such person is made aware of the information contained in this privacy statement and that the person has given you his/her consent for sharing the information with Avanade.

The above-mentioned categories of personal data have been obtained either directly from you (for example, when you provide information to sign up for a newsletter or register to comment on a forum website) or indirectly from certain third parties (for example, through our website’s technology). These third parties may include our affiliates, public authorities, public websites and social media, suppliers and vendors.

Information Sharing

We may transfer personal data to our service providers, professional advisors, public and governmental authorities or third parties in connection with a (potential) corporate or commercial transaction. Such outside parties may be located in other countries. Before we do so, we take steps to ensure that your personal data will be given adequate protection as required by relevant data protection laws and Avanade’s internal policies.

In the limited cases where we do seek to collect such data, we will do this in accordance with local data privacy law requirements. If you choose to provide us with unsolicited sensitive personal data, you consent to our using the data, subject to applicable law as described in this privacy policy.

The term "sensitive personal data" refers to the various categories of personal data identified by European and other data privacy laws as requiring special treatment, including in some circumstances the need to obtain explicit consent.

Together, these ensure that appropriate data privacy safeguards are in place across our organization.

Regarding your use of our websites, you should understand that the open nature of the Internet is such that information and personal data may flow over networks connecting you to our systems without security measures, and your data may be accessed and used by people other than those for whom the data is intended.

From time to time, our site may contain links to and from the sites of our partner networks, advertisers and affiliates. If you follow a link to any of these sites, please note that these sites have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies or sites. Please check these policies before you submit any personal data to these sites.
