# ABN AMRO - Security on the internet

Security is a top priority for ABN AMRO. We know that you want your financial transactions to be safe and secure, especially when they're done over the internet.

ABN AMRO has extensive security methods and technologies in place to protect the transactions and details that you transmit over the internet, but no system can ever be guaranteed as 100% safe. 

Rapidly advancing technology and the open nature of the internet, for example, make it difficult to achieve watertight security. This is why you too must **keep an eye on your own safety** , especially when downloading files and supplying personal details on the internet. It's wise for you to take some personal precautions, so we can both ensure that any risks related to internet banking are kept to a minimum.

**E-mail fraud and bogus websites**

You may have heard of the term 'phishing'. It refers to fraudsters 'fishing' for your personal and financial details to use for criminal purposes.

Criminals do this, for instance, by making identical copies of the websites of large reputable enterprises such as ABN AMRO. They may also send scam e-mails in the hope of tricking you into surrendering your personal information. Remember: **ABN  AMRO will never ask you for confidential information** in this way! Some frequently asked questions about this topic are listed below.

**How can I recognise a bogus website?**

Whenever you are uncertain of whether the website on your screen is genuine, check the exact internet address, or URL. The URL of the corporate internet site of ABN AMRO is http://www.abnamro.com. If the address on your screen does not correspond with this, and you see 'abnarmo' or 'abnamor', for instance, then you are literally at the wrong address and should break the connection with this site. To make sure you have the correct URL, you can type it in yourself. That way, you avoid being directed to a bogus address by a misleading banner or link.

**What are the websites of ABN  AMRO and its subsidiaries?**

Links to the websites of a selection of ABN AMRO's major brands and units can be found on our links page: [www.abnamro.com/com/about/links.jsp](https://web.archive.org/web/20071218223332id_/http%3A//www.abnamro.com/about/links.cfm)

**How can I recognise a scam e-mail?**

Without using additional measures such as a digital signature, it is easy for fraudsters to imitate e-mails. But that doesn't mean you can't recognise scam e-mails. Cyber-criminals often place alarming, enticing or exciting subjects in their e-mails with the hope of tempting you to respond impulsively and divulge the requested information. So, always take your time to read the e-mail carefully. In case of doubt, it is better not to respond. If you do choose to respond, always first check that the mail is genuine by contacting the company that is the apparent sender by telephone, for instance.

Remember: ABN AMRO will **never** ask you via e-mail to supply confidential information such as your PIN code.

**Must I keep sensitive information confidential?**

Always be careful when asked for sensitive information such as account numbers, card numbers, PIN codes and address details. ABN AMRO will **never** ask you for this via e-mail! ABN AMRO always handles your personal information and security with the utmost care. We also urgently advise you never to share user names, passwords and PIN codes with anyone else.

**What is phishing?**

'Phishing' refers to the practice of fraudsters 'fishing' for your details in order to find out and misuse sensitive personal and financial information. Criminals may, for instance, make identical copies of existing corporate websites, or send scam e-mails to elicit a response from you and trick you into divulging your personal information.
