# Privacy Policy for the University of Aberdeen Web Site

This policy explains what information is gathered from web clients visiting the University of Aberdeen's central web server, and how that information is used. 

## Information Collected

Information is gathered from clients via several methods that are outlined below:

### 1\. Logfiles 

The University of Aberdeen's central web server1 tracks requests made of it to centrally held log files. Log files can contain any or all of the following types of data:

  * The date and time of connection
  * Identification of the file(s) requested
  * Whether the request was successful
  * The size (in bytes) sent in response
  * The referring page (where the client came from), as supplied by the client browser
  * The software used to access the server, as supplied by the client browser



Information gathered is used for server system administration, identifying broken links, and for producing usage statistics. Logged information may be kept indefinitely. Log files do not contain any personal information.

The University of Aberdeen also uses the following log reporting services on its web site to measure and analyse visitor information.

  * _SiteStat_ service from Nedstat2. For more information on Nedstat and the kind of information that SiteStat collects and processes, please visit  [Nedstat’s web site](http://www.nedstat.com/) and its [SiteStat privacy policy](http://siteview.nedstat.nl/html/5.00/downloads/sitestat_privacy_policy_EN.pdf).
  * _Net Community_ service from Blackbaud3
  * _Analytics_ service from Google4



Examples of data collected automatically from all users include:

  * the Internet protocol (IP) address; 
  * computer and connection information such as browser type and version, operating system, and platform; 
  * Uniform Resource Locator (“URL”) click stream data, including date and time, and content viewed or searched for on the Site. 



The University also generates statistics5 on which operating systems are in use on PCs across campus

### 2. Cookies

Cookies are small files that are sent from the web server to the client's computer via the client's browser. They are then stored in the client's computer as text files and passed back to the server. Cookies are generally used to identify users and on occasion, prepare customized Web pages for them. Cookies may remain on the client's computer merely for the duration of the session (visit) or they may remain indefinitely. Most standard web browsers may be configured to refuse cookies.

The University of Aberdeen does not use cookies extensively on its servers at present. Such cookies that are used, other than in specific projects as outlined in section 5 below, do not contain any personal information and cannot be used to identify an individual user.

### 3\. Web forms

Forms on the University of Aberdeen web site may request clients to supply personal details, bank details and/or credit card details in order to receive goods or services, or in order to make donations. Where appropriate, such forms operate over secure connections so that data is safeguarded.

By supplying such information the client consents to the University storing the information for period of time appropriate to the supply of the goods or services requested.  Personal information provided will only be used for the purpose stated and will not be sold, licensed or traded to third parties.

Personal information collected and/or processed by the University is held in accordance with the provisions of the Data Protection Act 1998.

### 4\. Discussion fora, chat rooms, conferencing facilities, bulletin boards and mailing lists

Tools for synchronous and asynchronous web based communication that are hosted on the University of Aberdeen web site may request clients to supply details such as names and email addresses for registration purposes. 

By supplying such information the client consents to the University storing the information in a manner appropriate for administration of the tool. Information provided will only be used for the purpose stated and will not be sold, licensed or traded to third parties.

Our Alumni6 and Giving7 sites contain profile forms which allow you to share some or all of the personally identifying information you supply with us and with other members. You may update this information at any time.

If you supply information via these forms, we may use your contact details to send you further information about our organisation or to contact you when necessary. You may opt-out of such mailings at any time, or you may choose to receive only specific communications. 

Personal information collected and/or processed by the University is held in accordance with the provisions of the Data Protection Act 1998.

### 5\. Specific research projects

On occasion, staff involved in certain research projects and clinical trials may wish to gather data from respondents in a more specific manner than those outlined above. In such instances, terms and conditions for the collection and use of information will be stated separately and made explicit to respondents in advance of data collection.
