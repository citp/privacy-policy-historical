Cookies are small files that are sent from the web server to the client's computer via the client's browser. They are then stored in the client's computer as text files and passed back to the server.

Cookies may remain on the client's computer merely for the duration of the session (visit) or they may remain indefinitely. Most standard web browsers may be configured to refuse cookies.

The University of Aberdeen does not use cookies extensively on its servers at present. Such cookies that are used, other than in specific projects as outlined in section 5 below, are transient, do not contain any personal information and cannot be used to identify an individual user.
