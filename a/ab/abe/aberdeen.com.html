    <p>When you access our research products, we require that you i.) establish an account with us on our website, ii.) indicate to us your business interest information and iii.) take action to indicate your express consent (sometimes referred to as "opt-in") to share your information with third parties and send you information relevant to your business interest.

Upon receipt of your withdrawal, or "opt-out" request, your personal information will no longer be available to Aberdeen clients. We will only share your information consistent with your consent and note that if you decide to "opt-in," you can always subsequently "opt-out" as illustrated elsewhere in this statement. However if you do not want your information shared with other parties, do not access our research products or use our website, products or services. In the event you do not want your information shared with others yet still wish to access our research content, you may purchase such content by contacting Account Services as described below.</p>

    <p>In order to operate our website and provide services to you, we may provide personally identifiable, aggregate, and other information associated with our website to third parties that provide services on our behalf, including services such as shipping, payment processing, database management, and Internet services. We endeavor to require our service providers confirm that their privacy practices are consistent with this privacy statement. We may also share your information with our affiliates (such as a parent or sister company, or a subsidiary of our company) in furtherance of our operations, or those of our affiliates, as well as any requests that you may make (such as responding to advertisements or do-not-contact requests).</p>

    <p>In the event of a merger or acquisition of our company, the sale of substantially all of its assets related to the operation of our website, or other change of corporate control or in any line of business sale, all information concerning you, and other registered website users, may be transferred to or controlled by the surviving or successor entity.  In such a case, your information, and the use of such information, remains subject to the privacy statement as in effect from time to time.</p>

    <p>As our privacy statement provides you with information on how you may "opt- in" or "opt-out" from our information sharing activities and marketing services, we do not maintain or disclose a list of parties which may have received your personal information. If you wish to request additional information about how to exercise your third party disclosure choices, please contact us. </p>


    <br>
    <h2 class="green">We Work to Keep Information Secure</h2>
    <p>We implement administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to address the logical and physical security of information we collect and our electronic systems consistent with industry standards.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, no security methodology is 100% safe and we cannot guarantee information security.  Therefore it is also important for you to protect yourself against the unauthorized access to your information.  Be sure to take simple steps, such as signing off and logging out after each use of a shared computer, keeping your passwords in a secure location, and not sharing your passwords with any third party.</p>

    <p>Our website and applications may contain links to other websites that are not owned or controlled by us. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of other such websites, and this privacy statement applies only to information collected by us in connection with our websites and applications.</p>
