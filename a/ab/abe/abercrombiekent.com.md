# Privacy Statement & Security | Abercrombie & Kent

Abercrombie & Kent USA, LLC (referred to in this Privacy Statement as "A&K") respects your privacy and is committed to protect the personal information that you share with us. This Privacy Statement applies to abercrombiekent.com, akphilanthropy.org and/or any Website owned, operated, licensed or controlled by Abercrombie & Kent USA, LLC (referred to in this Privacy Statement as the "Site"). This Site is intended for use by persons who are residents of the United States of America and who are over 18 years of age. By using this Site, you accept the practices described in this Privacy Policy.

## Information Collection

When you browse the Site and have not registered for any online service from A&K, you browse anonymously.  Personal Information is not collected as you browse. "Personal Information" is defined as any information that identifies or can be used to identify, contact, or locate the person to whom such information pertains, including but not limited to a first and last name; email address; a home, postal or other physical address; or other contact information. When you register for or request any Site service, or when you complete the Guest Information Form online after you have reserved a journey, you may be asked to provide us with Personal Information which is used to enhance your Site experience, expedite communications, allow you to receive electronic/postal mailings from A&K, or help facilitate your travel with A&K. Additionally, we may request your destination and travel interests, which allows us to further personalize your Site and email messages.

We may also use this Personal Information in aggregate to generate market research reports. Demographic data such as age, gender and interests provided by Google are collected and used to analyze our Site visitors through Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting. Google Remarketing ads are advertised to Site visitors that have visited specific pages on the Site. If you wish to opt-out of either of these, please [click here](http://www.google.com/settings/ads) for more details.

We may share Personal Information with law enforcement agencies if there is a criminal investigation or suspected illegal activity, to protect the rights and property of A&K; to investigate reports of fraud or of users sending material using a false email address or users sending harassing, threatening, or abusive messages; to protect against misuse or unauthorized use of the Site; or during emergencies, such as when we believe someone’s physical safety is at risk.

## Use of Information

We may use Personal Information you have given us with any of our group of companies (including our parent companies and any of our subsidiaries or commonly owned companies) to, for example, provide a service, ensure proper booking, measure consumer interest in our various products and services and inform you about products and services.

## Registration for Online Products & Services

In order to service you on the Site, we may request that you voluntarily supply us with Personal Information for purposes such as correspondence, Site registration, or participating in Site surveys and/or contests. If you are known to us as a registered user of an A&K Site, we may combine information about your use of Site products or services with certain other online and offline information we have about you as an A&K customer as well as information available from external sources in order to customize your Site experience and present you with relevant online and offline communications.

## Cookies

If you use the Site, we utilize "cookies" that enable us to monitor traffic patterns and to serve you more efficiently if you revisit the Site. A cookie does not identify you personally but it does identify your computer. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie and this will provide you with an opportunity to either accept or reject it in each instance.  There are two types of cookies, session cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies are temporary cookie files, which are erased when you close your browser. When you restart your browser and go back to the Site, the Site will not recognize you. You will have to log back in to your account and select your preferences. A new session cookie will be generated, which will store your browsing information and will again be active until you leave the Site and close your browser. 

Persistent cookies are just that: persistent. These files stay in one of your browser’s subfolders until you delete them manually or your browser deletes them based on the duration period contained within the persistent cookie’s file. Persistent cookies permit you to visit the Site over and over again and be recognized as a previous visitor and may permit you to access your account without having to log in over and over again. The information saved by the cookies, such as the server your computer is logged onto, your browser type, and whether you entered the Site from a website or email hyperlink, is collected and tracked in aggregate. This information is used for the purpose of measuring response rates to Web page and email hyperlinks as well as overall Site activity and performance. 

## IP Addresses

A&K collects the IP addresses (the Internet Protocol address, which is a numerical label assigned to each device on the Internet) used to access our Site and the dates and times of access. This information is used to analyze trends, administer the Site, track a user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not personally linked to identifiable information.

## Email

A&K may send you emails based on Personal Information you provided, both online and through your transactions with us. These emails may come directly from A&K or from a company we have engaged on our behalf. You can opt-out of receiving marketing email from A&K as described below in the section entitled: "Declining Email." When we send you email, we may use your email address to identify information about your receipt of the email, including whether the communication was opened, how many times it was viewed and whether you clicked on an embedded hyperlink to reach a particular web page. This information is used to measure response rates to email communications as well as enhance your Site experience. 

A&K does not provide your Personal Information to our business partners. However, we may send you offers on behalf of our business partners. If you take advantage of an offer from an A&K business partner and become their customer, they may independently wish to send emails to you. In this case, you will need to inform them separately if you wish to decline receiving future emails from them.

## Declining Email

A&K provides all recipients with a means to decline receiving marketing email. At any time, you may request to discontinue receiving email from A&K by following the opt-out instructions included at the bottom of all A&K marketing email and informing us of your preference. You may also [click here](https://web.archive.org/legal/manage_email_preferences.cfm) to manage your email preferences. If you would like to be removed from all A&K communications, please call 800 323 7308 and speak to a Travel Consultant.

## Forward/Email this Page or Send Electronic Postcards

Site users can choose to request that a Site Web page be sent electronically to another person. When you elect to do this, you will be required to enter your email address and name, the recipient's email address and name, a subject line, and a text message that will go to the recipient. This will generate a pre-formatted email message that will go from you to the recipient’s mailbox with your message embedded in the text of the email. This feature is completely voluntary and, therefore, you will have a choice whether or not to disclose the required information.

## Contests

When you enter a contest or other promotional feature on the Site, we may ask for your Personal Information so that we can administer the contest and notify winners. Participation in these contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose the required information. In addition, these contests and promotions will be subject to the rules and requirements that accompany them.

## Online Surveys

We value opinions and comments from A&K customers, and you may have the opportunity to give us your feedback through Site surveys. In conducting these surveys, we may ask for your Personal Information so that we can appropriately identify you. Survey and Personal Information collected will be aggregated and used to make improvements to the Site and improve A&K products and services. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose the required information.

## Children

This Site is not used to knowingly solicit Personal Information from or market to children under the age of 13. This Site is intended for use by persons who are over 18 years of age. Therefore, we request that children under the age of 13 not submit any Personal Information to us through the Site. If we learn that we have inadvertently gathered Personal Information from children under the age of 13, we will promptly remove such information from our records.

## Customer Information

If you would like information about your account, believe that A&K has not complied with this Privacy Statement with respect to your Personal Information, or you have other related inquiries or concerns, you may write to:

Abercrombie & Kent USA, LLC  
Attention: Marketing  
1411 Opus Place, Executive Towers West 2, Suite 300  
Downers Grove, IL 60515-1098, USA

In your letter, please describe in as much detail as possible the nature of your inquiry or the ways in which you believe that the A&K Privacy Policy has not been complied with. A&K will investigate your inquiry or concern promptly.

## Linked Internet Sites

You should be aware that other Internet sites to which you link to from this Site may contain privacy provisions that differ from the provisions of our Privacy Statement. A&K is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of other such sites. We encourage Site users to be aware when they leave the Site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Website which they visit to determine their privacy practices and whether the site collects personally identifiable information. This Privacy Statement applies solely to information collected by this Site.

## Security

A&K uses Secure Socket Layers (“SSL”), a reasonable security measure for transferring information to process your orders. The SSL encrypts, or translates, your order information into a highly indecipherable code, which is processed immediately. When you begin the transaction process, you will move into the secure area of our Site. A warning window may pop up to notify you that you are entering this "safe" area. Once you have entered, the page address (“URL”) will change from http to https, to let you know you are in a secure area. You will remain in this secure zone for the entire transaction process. We maintain the data you provide, along with a record of your purchases, in a secure database. We limit the information we provide to outside companies with whom we contract to only what they need to carry out their responsibilities. We also encourage our partners and service providers to adopt and follow stringent consumer privacy policies.

## Special Notice to California Residents

Under California Civil Code Section 1798.83, California residents have the right to request and receive from us, once per year and free of charge, information about the personal information we have disclosed (if any) to third parties for their marketing purposes during the previous calendar year, and a description of the categories of personal information shared. To make such a request, please send an email to [webchat@abercrombiekent.com](mailto:webchat@abercrombiekent.com "webchat@abercrombiekent.com") including the phrase “California Privacy Request” in the subject line, and provide us with your name, postal address and email address.
