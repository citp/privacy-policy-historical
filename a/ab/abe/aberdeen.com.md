# Aberdeen Group Web Registration Terms and Conditions/Privacy Policy

| 

****Aberdeen Group Privacy Policy****

This is a website of the Aberdeen Group Inc. (Aberdeen), a subsidiary of Harte-Hanks, Inc., a worldwide direct and targeted marketing company that provides marketing services and shopper advertising opportunities to local, regional, national and international consumer and business-to-business marketers. Aberdeen conducts research and performs key benchmark, best practices, and focus group studies for a variety of industries. On some occasions, Aberdeen performs research and prepares reports on behalf of its clients. On other occasions, Aberdeen does so independently, or in cooperation with other companies. 

This privacy policy applies to any information that may be obtained from you through our website. In addition, this privacy policy applies to information that Aberdeen may obtain from you in the course of its independent or cooperative research activities. Notably, however, when performing research or otherwise working on behalf of clients, Aberdeen operates in accordance with the relevant client’s privacy policies. Thus, this Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected, stored, or utilized in the course of performing research or otherwise acting on behalf of our clients.

Our Commitment to Privacy 

Aberdeen is committed to fair marketing practices, including respect for your privacy and marketing preferences. Among other things, Aberdeen voluntarily supports marketing industry privacy standards, including the Direct Marketing Association's Online Privacy Principles, Guidelines for Ethical Business Practices, the DMA Privacy Promise to the American Consumer and the DMA Commitment to Consumer Choice (see [www.the-dma.org](http://www.the-dma.org/)). We also participate in the U.S. Department of Commerce - European Union "Safe Harbor" program, and we actively monitor and refine our practices in keeping with the various laws and regulations that govern the marketing industry’s privacy and data security practices. 

Categories Of Information That We Collect, and How We Use That Information 

Website Usage Information 

For each visitor to our website, we may collect information concerning the usage of our website by that visitor, including the visitor’s Internet domain and/or IP address, information concerning the visitor’s browser, and other access-related information. We also may assemble aggregate information (i.e., information obtained by compiling information from many different visitors) as to which pages visitors access or visit on our website. This information is used to analyze our website's utility, and to enhance the areas and functionality within our site that appear to be of interest to various users. 

Also, we may use "cookies" or similar tools, which are typically small pieces of information that are delivered and received by our website servers and stored by your internet browser on your computer's hard drive. The information stored and transmitted by these tools may be used to facilitate the functionality of our website, to learn about your preferences and internet session information, to provide a more relevant online experience, to study the efficacy of marketing campaigns, and for other legitimate website operation and marketing purposes (although we do not use any of this information for behavioral, targeted advertising purposes). For more information about the use of cookies and other similar technology, please visit a not-for-profit information site such as [http://www.networkadvertising.org](http://www.networkadvertising.org/). 

Please note that Aberdeen does not currently use ad serving companies to place banner ads from other firms on its website, so there is no tracking by such third-party companies from any banner ads, bulletin boards or other interactive venues on this website. 

Personal Information 

We receive and collect personally identifiable information – such as name, telephone numbers, e-mail addresses, and postal addresses – from individuals when they (i) submit inquiries or requests to us, (ii) become registered users of our website, (iii) participate in our research activities, (iv) sign up to receive newsletters or bulletins from us, or (v) choose to provide information to us for some other reason. Any personally identifiable information you provide will be used by us or, our service providers in connection with providing our research services, or in connection with providing services to you and processing any requests or inquiries that you initiate. While you can choose not to provide your personal information, that decision may limit our ability to contact you and our ability to provide services to you. Also, please note that if you have provided us with a postal address, an e-mail address, or a telephone number, an Aberdeen representative may contact you unless you have requested that we put you on one of our do-not-contact lists. 

Research Information 

As stated above, information obtained during our research activities on behalf of clients are subject to the applicable client’s privacy policy, and not this privacy policy. Nonetheless, for all of research efforts, we typically aggregate information we obtain during our research activities in a manner that does not include any personally identifiable information, and we utilize that aggregated information within our research reports. Notably, however, when we are performing research in cooperation with another company, we typically share contact and other information obtained in the course of our research as part of our cooperative effort.. While you may choose not to participate in our research surveys at any time that decision may limit your access to valuable products or services that we or our clients provide. 

Supplemental Information 

We may obtain personally identifiable and other information about you from our parent, sister, and subsidiary companies and/or business partners and add it to information that you have previously provided to us in order to serve you better. From time to time, we may compare our contact lists to lists received from our parent, sister, and subsidiary companies or third party service providers to try to avoid sending you unwanted, unnecessary or duplicative messages. We may also utilize and incorporate information from other sources to update and supplement information concerning you. All such combined, updated, and supplemented information will be handled consistent with this Privacy Policy. 

Information Provided To Us, Stays with Us, Except for Intended Research and Study Purposes 

Except for the use of research information for the intended purposes described above, the information provided by you will not be sold, transferred, or traded to any unrelated third parties for the marketing of third parties’ goods or services without your consent. 

In the course of our website and research operations,, we may provide personally identifiable, aggregate, and other information to third parties that provide services for us, including services such as shipping, payment processing, database management, and Internet services. We endeavor to require such third-party service providers to confirm that their privacy practices are consistent with this Privacy Policy. On occasion, we may also share personally identifiable and other information concerning you with our affiliates (such as a parent or sister company, or a subsidiary of our company) in furtherance of our operations (and those of our affiliates), and we may also share with our affiliates any requests that you may make (such as do-not-contact requests). 

In the event of a merger or acquisition of our company, the sale of substantially all of its assets related to the operation of our website or research activities, or other change of corporate control, all research information as well as information concerning website visitors and registered website users would be transferred to or controlled by the surviving or successor entity. Such information would remain subject to the principles and guidelines set forth in our Privacy Policy. 

We also will transfer personal and non-personal information when we believe the transfer is necessary to comply with the law, to protect our rights and our safety, or to protect the rights and safety of anyone else. In addition, we may provide personally identifiable information to credit bureaus or collection agencies if we are permitted or required to do so by law. 

Aberdeen Works To Keep Information Secure 

Aberdeen follows generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal and other information covered by this Privacy Policy. We have training and other policies and procedures in place to cover and address the logical and physical security of our workplaces and the integrity and protection of electronic records stored in our systems and on our premises. 

Unfortunately, no data security methodology is 100% safe, and we cannot guarantee absolute security. It is also important for you to protect yourself against unauthorized access to your information. Be sure to take simple steps, such as signing off and logging out after each use of a shared computer, keeping your passwords in a secure location, and not sharing your passwords with any third parties. 

As with most websites, our website may contain links to other websites that are not owned or controlled by us. In addition, you may have linked to our website from another website that is not owned or controlled by us. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of other such websites, and this Privacy Policy applies only to information as described within this policy. 

Aberdeen, You, and Information Concerning You 

Upon your verifiable inquiry or request (using any of the contact methods below) concerning personally identifiable information pertaining to you, we will provide and/or correct such information that we may have in our database in reasonably obtainable form. You may also contact us (using any of the contact methods below) to express your preferences on how we communicate with you, or to request that you be removed from our database. 

Please note that, as a provider of marketing services, Aberdeen may hold information about you on behalf of another company that is an Aberdeen client. As stated above, such information is handled under the privacy policies of our client, not this Privacy Policy. 

This Website Is Not Intended For Children 

Our website is not intended for children. In addition, if you are between the ages of 13 and 17, you may use our website only with the permission of a parent or guardian.
