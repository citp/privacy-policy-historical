Please bear in mind that all the data you provide on our website and to AbeloHost B.V. is done at your own risk.

## **Registrar**

In order to register a domain name, ICANN (The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) requires us to collect data about the registrants. The purpose of this data collection is domain registration via the WHOIS protocol. Therefore, a third party may collect data about you, such as:

  * Domain name
  * Registrant name
  * Relevant contact information
  * Domain name server data



### **WHOIS Protocol**

In order to comply with GDPR, which will be in force as of May 25th, 2018, our company will implement the following changes that will protect your data:

### **Existing domains**

We will implement the GDPR WHOIS protection method. If any Registrant, Tech, Admin and/or Billing contacts are from EU, AbeloHost B.V. will mask the WHOIS output for the related domain name. The mask will be presented in the form of placeholder details, instead of your personal data.

Furthermore, domain names that have enabled Privacy Protection will still show Privacy Protection contact data in the output. In addition to that, the Privacy Protection has additional features:

  * It will enable registrants to receive emails, for example, domain sale inquiries, from http://privacyprotect.org/
  * They can also receive web-form emails from the same website



### **New Domain Registration, Transfers and Renewals**

  * Transfers and registrations from SuperSite will use customer contact information details established during the purchasing process for Admin, Technical, Registrant and Billing contacts.
  * If you are a customer, you can access the control panel and change or edit the default contact or all four contacts
  * If these contacts are from EU, GDPR WHOIS protection method will automatically be enabled for the domain name during your purchase. It will be implemented just as it was described in the previous paragraphs.
  * You will be alerted during the purchase flow that your personal data is under the WHOIS free protection.



Nevertheless, you can also layer Privacy Protection over the WHOIS protection if you want to get emails such as sale notifications.

EU customers’ WHOIS data will always be masked; no matter if they have Privacy Protection enabled or not.

In exemption to the terms stated above, access to PII of domain name registrants may be granted for technical reasons, e.g., if it is necessary to facilitate transfers, or if law enforcement requires the access to which it is legally entitled.

## **  
Privacy Policy Changes**

AbeloHost B.V. has the right to make amendments to its Privacy Policy. Once and if the changes are made, you will be notified via email.

The notification about these changes will also be posted on our website. Furthermore, the Privacy Policy page will reflect these changes as well. Hence, if you continue to browse, use and navigate, as well as order services from AbeloHost B.V., it will be assumed that you have agreed to the changes made to our Privacy Policy.

If AbeloHost B.V. goes through the process of selling its company, partially or in whole, you will be notified if your PII has to be transferred according to the sale agreement. Afterward, if you continue to use our products and services, your PII, as well as your other personal and non-personal data, will remain under the protection of the policy outlined on this page until further notice.
