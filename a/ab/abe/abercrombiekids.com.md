## Information Collected Online

### 1\. General Browsing

abercrombiekids.com gathers navigational information, which does not include any personal information, but tells us where visitors go on our Website. This information allows us to see which areas of our Website are most visited and helps us improve the quality of your online experience by allowing us to deliver more of the most desired features and services. We also collect information such as the browser version, and service provider relevant to the computer you are using.

### 2\. Collection of Personally Identifiable Information if You Are 13 or Older

With respect to our online information collection practices for those persons 13 and older, abercrombie kids collects personally identifiable information from you when you provide us with this information. You can provide us this personally identifiable information in many instances throughout our Website, including when you interact with the following opportunities: placing an order through the Website; establishing an account; adding information to your account such as by setting up a wish list, creating address book entries, or updating your "Quick Checkout" information; emailing an item, post card or wish list; adding a message in the gift wrap section or on an E-Gift Card; entering a contest or sweepstakes (note that some contests or sweepstakes may require the parent/guardian of an individual 13 or older but under 18 to submit an entry using the process described below in "Contest or Sweepstakes Entries"); taking a survey; contacting us with a comment or question; and signing up to receive emails about our products and services. While not personally identifiable information by itself, abercrombie kids also collects and retains information about purchases you make on the Website.

Categories of personally identifiable information collected online include name, address, email address, telephone number, payment card information, child's name, address and email address, recipient's name, address and email address, and any other information you choose to provide.

### 3\. Collection of Personally Identifiable Information For Children Under 13

Only visitors 13 and older are permitted to create an Account at abercrombiekids.com. If someone under 13 wants to sign up for email marketing or enter a contest or sweepstakes, we have implemented the following processes:

Mailing List Registration

With regard to the general "Mailing List" registration at abercrombiekids.com, we have a separate "Mailing List" registration process for kids who state that they are under the age of 13. Children under the age of 13 will only be asked to provide their first name, age, and parent's/guardian's email address. abercrombiekids.com will then send the parent/guardian an email notice and a request that the parent complete the "Mailing List" sign up for their child. After abercrombiekids.com sends the email notice to the parent to request that the parent complete the "Mailing List" sign up and consent, abercrombiekids.com does not add the child's name or age, or the email address of the parent provided by the child to its systems (however, if the parent has separately signed up for email at abercrombiekids.com, that email address may be in our systems). Before the child can receive emails and other promotional materials from abercrombiekids.com, the child's parent/guardian must consent by completing the child's "Mailing List" registration information. Whenever a parent/guardian completes and submits the child's "Mailing List" registration information, abercrombiekids.com will send the parent/guardian a confirmation email notification.

If a parent/guardian does not wish to consent by completing their child's "Mailing List" registration with abercrombiekids.com, the parent/guardian may decline completing the "Mailing List" sign up and consent. Should a parent/guardian initially consent to their child's registration by completing the "Mailing List" registration, they can cancel that consent at any time and request deletion of their child's personal information by emailing such a request to abercrombiekids.com at [Privacy_Policy@abercrombiekids.com](mailto:Privacy_Policy@abercrombiekids.com).

Contest or Sweepstakes Entries

For each contest or sweepstakes we conduct for children who indicate that they are under the age of 13 (or other age as specified in the official rules for the contest or sweepstakes), we will only collect a child's first name and a parent's/guardian's email address. abercrombiekids.com will then send the parent/guardian an email notice and a request that the parent complete the "Contest or Sweepstakes" sign-up for their child. After abercrombiekids.com sends the email notice to the parent to request that the parent complete the "Contest or Sweepstakes" entry form and consent, abercrombiekids.com does not add the child's name or age, or the email address of the parent provided by the child to its systems (however, if the parent has separately signed up for email at abercrombiekids.com, that email address may be in our systems). Before the child will be entered in the contest or sweepstakes, the child's parent/guardian must consent by completing the child's "Contest or Sweepstakes" registration information. 

If a parent/guardian does not wish to consent to their child's entry into the "Contest or Sweepstakes" with abercrombiekids.com, the parent/guardian may decline completing the "Contest or Sweepstakes" entry form and consent. The “Contest or Sweepstakes” entry form and consent may also allow a parent/guardian to register their child to receive ongoing emails and other promotional materials from abercrombie kids. Should a parent/guardian initially consent by completing the "Contest or Sweepstakes " entry form and consent or by electing to register their child to receive ongoing emails and other promotional materials from abercrombie kids, the parent/guardian can cancel that consent at any time and request deletion of their child's personal information by emailing such a request to abercrombiekids.com at [Privacy_Policy@abercrombiekids.com](mailto:Privacy_Policy@abercrombiekids.com).

Review of Information Provided About a Child

For parents/guardians who have completed their child's "Mailing List" or "Contest" or "Sweepstakes" registration, they can review the personally-identifiable information they provided about their child online by sending an email to Privacy_Policy@abercrombiekids.com, or a letter or postcard to the postal mailing address provided under "Contact Us" below. When making a written request to review such information, please be sure to include your email address and telephone number where we can reach you. To protect your child's privacy and security, we will take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting you access to the personal information that you provide and we maintain about your child.

### 4\. Information Collected Directly by Third Parties

If you apply online for an Abercrombie & Fitch credit card, or once opened, access your account online (to pay your account, view your statement or account status, add authorized buyers to your account, request a credit limit increase or update the personal information associated with your account) you leave our site and provide your personal information directly to the issuing bank for the Abercrombie & Fitch Card. However, your name, address, and email address, as well as information necessary for us to provide you with the bonuses and benefits of an A&F Card (which may include birth date, payment card number, and purchasing information), will be provided to us by the Abercrombie & Fitch Card issuer. We would suggest that you review the privacy policies of these third parties prior to providing them with your information.
