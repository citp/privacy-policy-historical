## KEEPING AND MAINTAINING PERSONAL DATA

How long we keep your personal data depends on the context in which you provide it and the purposes for which we use it, but we will only ever retain your personal data for as long as is necessary for these purposes. Specifically:

we will keep your personal data for as long as is necessary to provide you with products and/or services that you have requested or purchased;

You can request details of the personal data that we hold about you by contacting info@umusic.com and requesting the personal data that you would like access to. We may charge you a fee of up to £10 for this service. If you think any information we have about you is incorrect or incomplete, please write or e-mail us as soon as possible. If required, we will correct or update any information as soon as possible 

## SHARING PERSONAL DATA

As Universal Music is part of a worldwide group of companies, Universal Music may from time to time transfer your data to another Universal Music group company and your data will then be used within the Universal Music group of companies. By agreeing to this Privacy Policy, you consent to us providing your personal data to the Universal Music group companies (as such group companies may be updated from time to time).

Some Universal Music group companies are located in other jurisdictions (including but not limited to jurisdictions outside of the European Economic Area). Personal data will only be so transferred to these other jurisdictions in circumstances where it is necessary or appropriate to achieve the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy or the purposes made known to you at the time personal data is collected. For example, if a user opts in to receive information and promotions from Universal Music, we may transfer data to the Universal Music group company such other jurisdictions in order for the Universal Music group company to you with relevant information and promotions as described above. Communications may therefore come from local Universal Music group companies, be in your local language and promote localised events/promotions. You will be given the opportunity to opt out of those local communications on any email you receive from them.

Sometimes we will share your personal data with third parties outside of the Universal group and we may do this for the following reasons:

to provide you with a service and/or product, but your personal data will only be used to provide you with this service and/or product;  
to provide you with information about promotions and offers if you have given your consent to receive these communications in accordance with the section headed "Direct Marketing";  
where it is necessary to comply with law or to protect our or another person's rights, property or safety (including to prevent fraud and to reduce payment risk – see the section headed "Financial"); and/or in the event that we sell or buy any business or assets.

Where a relevant artist and/or its management company have entered into an agreement with Universal Music to have access to consumer data collected from the use of the website for future marketing purposes, we may allow access of your personal data to them. However, we will not do so unless they have confirmed to us that they are registered with the Data Protection Act. Should Universal Music and the artist part company, the artist may still directly contact you with future marketing regarding the artist in question going forward, but at all times you will be given clear guidance on their privacy policy and an option to opt out of future mailings from them. 

## TRANSFER OF PERSONAL DATA OVERSEAS

Generally we store and process your personal data within the United Kingdom, but sometimes we may transfer your personal data to a jurisdiction outside of the European Economic Area (including to Universal Music group companies as mentioned above) and your personal data will then be processed in these jurisdictions. Certain approved third parties appointed by us to collect and process personal data on our behalf may transfer personal data outside of the European Economic Area for the purposes of processing personal data where their servers are located outside of the European Economic Area. Please note that privacy laws in these other jurisdictions may not provide the same level of protection as those within the European Economic Area. By using this website you agree to this processing and transfer of personal data outside of the European Economic Area. We will take all steps that are reasonably necessary to ensure that your personal data is treated securely and is used in accordance with this Privacy Policy even when your personal data is transferred to, and processed in, a jurisdiction outside of the European Economic Area and no matter where your personal data is processed, this Privacy Policy will remain in effect. We shall take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that any third parties who transfer personal data outside of the European Economic Area as described above shall have the appropriate protections in place to satisfy the requirements of the Data Protection Act. 

## DIRECT MARKETING

## THIRD PARY COOKIES

Some of the advertisements you see on this and some artist sites are generated by third parties. Some of these third parties generate their own "anonymous cookies" to track how many unique users have seen a particular ad, and how many times they have seen it. These third party cookies cannot be used to identify an individual user, but only for statistical purposes, for example, in providing you with advertisements that are more relevant to your interests. Additionally, the companies that generate these cookies have their own, very strict, privacy policies but we don't have access to these cookies; other than allowing them to be served, we have no role to play in these cookies at all (although we may use statistical information arising from these third party cookies and provided to us by third parties, to improve the targeting of advertisements to users). We may also allow the artist and/or its management company to collect and process data (including personal data) from users via third party cookies or similar technologies used on this website for the purposes of statistical analysis and targeted advertising provided that they have confirmed to us that they are registered with the Data Protection Act. Where the artist and/or its management processes personal data collected via third party cookies they will do so in accordance with their own strict privacy policy and not this privacy policy. Again, we don't have access to these cookies; other than allowing them to be served, we have no role to play in these cookies at all Universal Music may also appoint approved third parties to collect and process data (including personal data) on our behalf using such third party's cookies or similar technologies for the purposes of targeted advertising.

SHARING DATA WITH THIRD PARTIES WORKING ON BEHALF OF UNIVERSAL MUSIC

Universal Music works with a number of carefully selected third party companies that provide a broad range of online solutions, from traffic analysis and advertising to user experience enhancements, such as enabling you to use the same login details across multiple websites.

It is sometimes necessary for Universal Music to provide these companies with access to limited personal information about our users. In such cases Universal Music will share only the personal data required to for these companies to perform their functions and will not allow them to use this data for any other purposes. A selection of these third party companies include:

APPRECIATION ENGINE:

Universal Music uses Appreciation Engine to provide single-sign-on functionality, social network integration and user analytics for a number of Universal Music websites and registration forms. This enables you to login to an artist website or register for artist updates by using your social media accounts such as a Facebook or Twitter account for example, rather than using an email address and password. If you do choose to use an email address and password, these credentials will allow you to access other Universal Music websites & forms as your unique ID will be stored via the Appreciation Engine login.

The Appreciation Engine collects personally identifiable information such as names and email addresses, demographic information, location and behavioural information in accordance with the preferences you gave when setting up your social account. Appreciation Engine may transfer the personal data outside of the European Economic Area for the purposes of processing personal data as Appreciation Engine's servers are located outside of the European Economic Area. Appreciation Engine is Safe Harbor certified and Universal Music shall take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that Appreciation Engine have the appropriate protections in place to satisfy the requirements of the Data Protection Act.

Universal Music will also have access to the data collected by Appreciation Engine on our behalf while facilitating user interaction with our websites and other online properties, such as apps. This may include personal and behavioural data, such as which websites on the Universal Music network a specific user has visited and the comments a user has made on Facebook about a Universal Music artist.

This data will be used as part of Universal Music's combined digital marketing strategy, which includes communication via email, SMS, social media and online advertising. You can find more information appreciationengine.com

COMUFY:

Comufy is a service that enables Universal Music to communicate with fans of our artists via Facebook notifications. If you provide us with your Facebook ID, by registering for one of our mailing lists or websites using Facebook, or any other means, we may provide Comufy with your Facebook ID and/or email address to enable us to communicate with you about your requested artist via Facebook apps, notifications and other channels. If you do not wish to receive these notifications, please log into Facebook and set the notification permission setting of the Comufy app to 'Never'. You can find more information at http://comufy.com

FACEBOOK:

Facebook allows companies like Universal Music to target specific users with advertising campaigns across their service. To enable Facebook to identify these users it is necessary for us to provide them with a 'hashed' non personally identifiable fingerprint of your email. Facebook will be able to match your email address if they already exist in their database (because the fingerprints will be the same).

This data is sent to Facebook over a secure connection and compared with their user database. Any non-matches are ignored while matches will be made available to Universal Music for targeted advertising campaigns across the Facebook service.

If we decide to include you in a list of users to be targeted with an advertising campaign on Facebook, we will use an interface managed by Facebook to hash your email into a non personally identifiable format before transmitting this to Facebook.

You can find more information about Facebook advertising here: https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/advertising
