<p><b>2. Our Mutual Responsibilities With Regarding To Your Information.</b><br>
<br>
It is our goal to use and handle information collected in a responsible manner. 
For one, we strive to limit our use of information that we collect as set forth 
herein. We also take measures to secure your information by physical, legal and 
technological means, such as storing your information on secure servers, located 
on premises that permit access to only authorized ABBYY personnel, encryption of 
data transfers, and protecting your accounts with passwords. In spite of such 
precautions, the security of your information cannot be absolutely guaranteed. 
First, we believe that no security system is impenetrable or fail-proof. </p>
<p>Further, ABBYY cannot control what information you choose to upload, or your 
handling or treatment of your information. Therefore, you must exercise sound 
judgment with regard to what information you choose to upload, including without 
limitation to forming your own assessments as to the propriety, risks and 
sensitivities with regard to the information you transmit. You are also 
encouraged to take steps to secure your information, such as not divulging your 
password to others. </p>
<p>By your use of the Site and Services, you agree that ABBYY will have no 
liability to you or any other party in connection with the information that you 
provide or is collected by ABBYY, including with limitation to any damages that 
may result from the handling or treatment of such information, and the 
disclosure or misuse of your information by third parties. You voluntarily and 
fully assume the risks for all consequences that relate to any and all 
information that you choose to upload or transfer. ABBYY assumes no obligation 
to ensure confidentiality or privacy of your information.</p>

As ABBYY continues to develop its business, ABBYY might sell or buy subsidiaries or business units. In such transactions as well as in the event ABBYY or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, personal information of the ABBYY Online Portal users will generally be one of the transferred business assets. We reserve the right to include your personal information, collected as an asset, in any such transfer to a third party. ABBYY, alone, has the right and sole discretion, to determine the location of the servers of the Site and Services.</p>
