## ABBYY PRIVACY NOTICE

ABBYY USA Software House, Inc. (“ABBYY,” “we” or “us”) has created this website (the “Website” or the “Site”) to provide a platform for sales, registration, and support for ABBYY's character recognition, data capture, linguistics, and translation products and services.

ABBYY is committed to maintaining your privacy. This Privacy Notice (“Privacy Notice”) outlines our privacy practices, including the types of information that you may provide to us, how we use such information and the choices you have regarding our use of that information. We may collect the information through our Website; when you purchase, register or use our products through computers or mobile devices; through our online support services; or through email messages that we send to you (collectively, including all online methods, the “Services”), or offline, such as when you attend one of our trade shows or contact our customer service line. Our Privacy Notice applies to (i) casual visitors to our Site, who do not participate in the Services (“Site Visitors”), (ii) individuals who purchase or register products through the Website or otherwise participate in our Services (“Registered Users”), (iii) users of our products and (iv) individuals whose information we obtain offline (collectively, including Site Visitors, Registered Users, users of products, and other individuals, “you”).

### 1\. NOTICE.

1.1. **The Types of Information You May Provide.** Information you may provide or that we may collect from you while visiting our Site or while participating in our Services falls into three broad categories: (i) Personally Identifiable Information, (ii) Activities Information, and (iii) Anonymous Information.

1.2. **Personally Identifiable Information.** We use the term “Personally Identifiable Information” to mean any information that could reasonably be used to identify you, including your name, address, e-mail address, payment card number, telephone number.

1.3. **Activities Information.** We use the term “Activities Information” to refer to information collected by so-called “persistent identifiers” such as cookies and web beacons. Unlike Personally Identifiable Information, Activities Information does not directly identify a particular person; the information, however, is or can potentially be linked to a particular computer or device.

1.4. **Anonymous Information.** “Anonymous Information” is information that does not identify you, and may include statistical information concerning, for example, your use of our products and Services, your access to content on our Website, or the pages on our Site that you visit most frequently.

### 2\. CHOICE AND CONSENT.

We have structured our Website so that you may visit our Site without revealing your identity or providing any Personally Identifiable Information. Please read this Privacy Notice carefully. Providing your Personally Identifiable Information to us through the Services confirms your agreement to be bound by this Privacy Notice.

2.1. **Receiving Electronic Communications from Us.** You can opt-out of receiving bulletins, updates, the ABBYY newsletter, or other marketing-related materials by clicking on the unsubscribe link here, [Unsubscribe](http://datasync.abbyyusa.com/unsubscribe), or on the bottom of each Marketing e-mail.

2.2. **Our Sharing of Your Personally Identifiable Information with Affiliates for Their Direct Marketing Purposes.** If you would prefer that we do not share your Personal Information on a going-forward basis with our Affiliates (as defined in Section 7.1 (ABBYY Affiliates)) for their direct marketing purposes, you may opt-out of this sharing by contacting the Privacy Officer as described in Section 16 (Contact Us). If you opt-out from this sharing, you will also automatically opt-out from receiving marketing communications from ABBYY.

2.3 **Exceptions.** Please understand that if you choose not to receive marketing-related messages from us, we may still send you important administrative messages, such as notices concerning operation of this Website or other Services, products you have purchased, downloaded or registered for, and legal and other related notices concerning your relationship with ABBYY and this Site. You cannot opt-out from receiving administrative messages.

### 3\. COLLECTION.

3.1. **Our Collection of Personally Identifiable Information.** We and certain service providers operating on our behalf collect Personally Identifiable Information from you. Personally Identifiable Information may be collected as part of the normal operation of our products and Services, for example, when contained in data that you or we capture, convert or translate using our products or in connection with your use of other features of our Services. The following further explains the Personally Identifiable Information that is collected:

3.1.1. **Registration Information.** If you choose to register with us in order to receive technical support, information and discounts on newer versions and updates for our products, and other benefits we may provide, (regardless of whether your purchase was made through ABBYY or one of our resellers or distributors), we will ask you to provide certain Personally Identifiable Information, such as name, email address, telephone number or other information. If you do not register your product with us, we will be unable to provide you with technical support. All information you provide in connection with the registration process is collected by one of our Affiliates and is shared with us.

3.1.2. **Purchase of Products and Services.** We collect Personally Identifiable Information, including contact information (such as name, email address, and shipping address) and financial information (such as payment card number, expiration date and security code), in connection with your orders and purchases through our Services using a credit or debit card.

You are free to choose whether you participate in a survey or questionnaire. We may ask that, in addition to providing your responses, you also provide Personally Identifiable Information. We advise you to use discretion in including any Personally Identifiable Information that would enable a third party reviewing your response to link the response to you.

3.1.5. **Offline.** We may collect Personally Identifiable Information from you offline, such as when you call us seeking customer service or technical support, attend one of our trade shows or place an order over the phone.

3.1.6. **Other Sources.** We may receive your Personally Identifiable Information from other sources, such as public databases, joint marketing partners, social media platforms, data brokers, from people with whom you are friends or otherwise connected on social media platforms, as well as from other third parties, including those who provide list enhancement services.

When you click one of these URLs, you pass through our web server before arriving at the destination web page. If you prefer not to be tracked simply do not click text or graphic links in the email.

3.2.4. Mobile App Usage. When you download and use one of our products designed for mobile devices (an “App”), we and our service providers may track and collect App usage data, such as the date and time the App on your device accesses our servers and what information and files have been downloaded to the App based on your device number.

3.3. Our Collection of Anonymous Information. We may collect Anonymous Information through features of the software supporting the Services and use this information as follows:

3.3.1. Site Visitors. As indicated above, you may use our Site without registering or submitting any information to us. In that case, the only information we collect from your visit will be Anonymous Information that does not identify you in any way.
