# Privacy Policy

ABBYY USA Software House, Inc. and its affiliates (hereafter “ABBYY”) recognize and respect the importance of protecting individuals’ privacy. Data-privacy laws protect the integrity of personally identifying information (“Personal Information”) that is transferred from a foreign country to the United States. 

**Scope**. This Policy applies to all Personal Information that ABBYY collects or receives outside the United States and transfers into the United States, whether manually or digitally processed. The Policy applies to Personal Information received during the course of ABBYY’s operations. 

At ABBYY, privacy on the Internet means that: 

  * ABBYY informs you how we use any personally identifiable information that is submitted to us online
  

  * ABBYY maintains confidentiality and security safeguards for personally identifiable information
  

  * You have control over the personally identifiable information you decide to submit to ABBYY
  

  * If you have elected to receive email promotions from ABBYY, you can opt-out from these at any time



**Terms of Use**. ABBYY values the privacy of those who provide private personal information to the Company. This policy summarizes what personally identifiable information we may collect, and how we might use this information. This policy also describes other important topics relating to information privacy. 

**Information Collection**. ABBYY only will collect personally identifiable information (such as name, title, company name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address) that is voluntarily provided through our website or e-mail correspondence. We will collect general information (such as the type of browser used, the files requested, and the domain name and country which requests information) to improve our website and better meet customer needs. 

**Use of Information**. ABBYY collects your information in order to record, support and facilitate your participation in the activities you select and to prevent fraud and unlawful use. If you subscribe to or register for Products and Services, for example, the information is used to register your rights, if any, to technical support or other benefits that may be made available to registered users. As another example, if you enter a contest, information is collected to qualify the entry and to contact you regarding the contest or prize awards. Your personal information may also be used to track customer preferences to provide a customized Site experience and keep you informed about product upgrades, special offers, and other products and services of ABBYY unless you have opted not to receive such communications or such communications are prohibited by law. 

Before we collect any personally identifiable information, we will provide an explanation for the possible use of the data. The information supplied will be used by ABBYY to respond to inquiries, supply requested information on ABBYY products and services, or track orders placed with ABBYY authorized third parties may be utilized by ABBYY to collect, track and process such information. If you have submitted personal information to ABBYY electronically and would like it removed or modified, please contact us. We will use reasonable efforts to comply with your request. Any marketing communications sent by ABBYY have an automatic opt-out link at the bottom of each communication. You may elect to remove yourself from further informational communications by selecting and confirming this link. 

ABBYY recognizes and appreciates the importance of responsible use of information collected on the Site and in connection with the Products and Services. ABBYY will respect your legal rights regarding access to, and correction and deletion of, your personal information. ABBYY may communicate information to you regarding products, services, and special offers available from ABBYY unless you have opted not to receive such communications or such communications are prohibited by law. 

There are other instances in which ABBYY may divulge your personal information, such as when required by law, regulation, or litigation. We may also disclose information about you if we determine that such disclosure should be made for reasons of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance. 

**Our Website and Cookies**. Some of ABBYY’s web pages will utilize “cookies” and other tracking technologies. A “cookie” is a small text file that may be used for setting a key on your browser that links to the current state of your web session. The purpose of the cookie is to let us know when Customers visit our site and where Customers visit. Some cookies and other technologies may be associated with Customers’ Personal Information provided during an earlier visit. Site functionality requiring a login will utilize cookies. Other tracking technologies may record information such as Internet domain and host names, internet protocol (IP) addresses (additional detail below), operating types, browser software, clickstream data and time frames of when the site is accessed. 

Most commercially available internet browsers allow users to block cookies. However, doing so may limit your ability to access certain portions of our site. 

When visiting our website, each file request is logged by our web server. The information gathered includes the name of the file requested, time of the request, and the IP address of the machine requesting the file. We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track site movement, and gather non-individually identifying demographic information. 

**Other Important Information**. The ABBYY website may contain links to other sites. We do not endorse or otherwise accept responsibility for the content or privacy policies of those sites. 

**Transfer of Personal Information**. Unless required by law, we do not disclose Personal Information to third parties other than our Partners and Resellers except as expressly set forth in this section. 

In order for us to provide Products and Services to our Clients, we may supplement the Personal Information we receive with information from third party sources. For example, if a Customer requests to purchase a product using a corporate purchase order, we may use the Customer’s business name and address to request a credit report. In order to maintain accurate records of Customers, we also may associate Personal Information we receive with records of existing Customers in our database, and update those records as needed. At times we may also contract the services of a third party to update Customer records with changes of address, phone number, email address, and other information. The third party uses this Personal Information only to provide the requested updates, and does not store, retain, or use the Personal Information for any other purpose. 

ABBYY also shares Personal Information with intermediaries such as credit card companies, banks or fulfillment centers. Intermediaries serve solely as links in the distribution chain, and do not store, retain, or use this Personal Information for any secondary purpose other than to provide the contracted service. We also may share Personal Information with other contractors or service providers, who use the information solely to provide the requested service to ABBYY and for no other purpose. 

Finally, we will disclose Personal Information as required to enforce or protect our legal rights with respect to a Partner or Reseller or, as required by court order, subpoena or other operation of law. 

**Access to Personal Information**. Individuals seeking access to Personal Information that we have collected must contact our Privacy Officer as directed below. We will make reasonable efforts to provide the requested information promptly if it is still available to us, although we reserve the right to charge the requester for the cost (in time and expenses) of retrieval. 

**Security**. ABBYY is committed to protecting personal information from loss, misuse, disclosure, alteration, unauthorized access and destruction. ABBYY takes all reasonable precautions to safeguard the confidentiality of personally identifiable information. The personal information that you provide in connection with registering yourself as a user of the Site or of the Products and Services is classified as Registration Information. Registration Information is protected in several ways. Access by you to your Registration Information is available through a password and unique customer ID selected by you. This password is encrypted. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. In addition, your Registration Information resides on secure servers that only selected ABBYY personnel. ABBYY encrypts your personal information as it is transferred to ABBYY and thereby strives to prevent unauthorized parties from viewing such information. 

**Enforcement**. Concerns regarding our adherence to this Policy should be raised first with our Privacy Officer as directed below. In addition, ABBYY submits to the JAMS dispute resolution and enforcement mechanisms to investigate and resolve any complaints and disputes arising from this Policy that our Privacy Officer cannot resolve satisfactorily. For more information about JAMS, please see its website at [www.jamsadr.com](http://www.jamsadr.com/ "www.jamsadr.com"). ABBYY’s compliance with this Policy is subject to the ultimate authority of the United States Federal Trade Commission, to which complaints that are not adequately resolved through these avenues also may be directed.
