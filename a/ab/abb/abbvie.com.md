You may contact AbbVie to ask questions, discuss your concerns, or report issues regarding our products.

## How we use Personal Information

We collect and use your Personal Information for the business and commercial purposes of providing  you the services you request, communicating with you, improving your experience on the AbbVie Services, and generally improving our products and services and for other internal business purposes, as described in more detail below.  


### Providing programs and services you request

If you choose to register for one of our AbbVie Services, we use the Personal Information that you provide through AbbVie Services to respond to your questions, provide you the services you request and offer an optimal customer experience, to perform our contractual obligations, or perform an action based on your consent.  


### Marketing

You may also choose to receive marketing information from AbbVie, such as offers regarding AbbVie’s products or services, invitations to participate in surveys about our products, or notifications about special promotions. In such cases, we will use your contact and other Personal Information to send you marketing information. Instructions on how you can opt-out from marketing communications are included in each marketing communication you receive. You can also email us at [privacyoffice@abbvie.com](mailto:privacyoffice@abbvie.com). You can opt-out at any time.

### Customized user experiences

The Personal Information that you provide may be used to create customized offers, information, or services tailored to your interests and preferences. Also, we may use your IP address and the data that we obtain automatically through the use of cookies or similar tracking technologies to make our AbbVie Services easier to use and navigate,  to personalize the content provided on AbbVie Services by anticipating the information and services that may be of interest to you, and to personalize and improve our interactions with you by making the information we provide more relevant to you. In some cases, we collect this information pursuant to your consent. In other cases, we collect this information for our legitimate business interest to optimize and customize user experiences.

### Business and product improvement

In order to discover new facts that could help AbbVie better understand customer needs and help improve, develop, and evaluate product services, materials, programs, and treatments, AbbVie analyzes the information that you have provided for its legitimate interests in business and product improvement.

### Site analytics and improvement

We may use the information that you provide and the information we collect automatically about your use of the AbbVie Services to monitor user traffic patterns and preferences for our legitimate business interests of improvement, analytics and optimization of the AbbVie Services.

### Data use and retention

We will only keep Personal Information as long as necessary for the fulfillment of the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice, except if otherwise required by applicable laws or legal orders.

[Top]

We only share your Personal Information with third parties as described below. We do not sell or rent Personal Information to third parties for their own marketing purposes.  


### Third-party advertising and online behavioral advertising

You may be provided with online advertisements of AbbVie products and services on third-party websites and mobile services that are tailored to you, for example, on the basis of information that you provide to AbbVie or a third-party website you are visiting, or of your browsing activity, purchases, or interests. These types of tailored online advertisements may come through several sources, as described in this section.

We may share with our advertising service providers certain device information that we have obtained from cookies and other tracking technologies on our AbbVie Services.

Some AbbVie Services participate in online behavioral advertising (this is also sometimes called re-target advertising or interest-based advertising). You can identify these sites by the “Advertising Choices” link in the footer. Our advertising network partners may place and use cookies on AbbVie websites and on other third-party sites to collect information about your activities in order to provide you with online advertisements that are based on your interests. When an AbbVie online behavioral advertisement is delivered to you, you will see an “[Ad Choices](http://info.evidon.com/pub_info/6678?v=1&nt=0&nw=false)” icon. Clicking on the icon or link will take you to a website where you can manage or opt-out of the use of data about your browsing history that is used for the delivery of online behavioral advertisements. If you opt-out, you may still see advertisements online, including advertisements from AbbVie that are based on other information (e.g., based on the content of the page being viewed rather than your prior clickstream activity). In some cases, data may still be collected about your browsing activity by these third-party advertisers, but they will not use this data to deliver advertisements that are based on your past online browsing behavior. You can also opt-out now by clicking [here](http://info.evidon.com/pub_info/6678?v=1&nt=0&nw=false).

You may also opt out of certain online behavioral advertising on the Digital Advertising Alliance’s consumer choice tool, which is available at [https://optout.aboutads.info](https://optout.aboutads.info/), and the Network Advertising Initiative’s tool, which is available at <https://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/>.  

Some web browsers may transmit “do-not-track” signals to web services with which the browser communicates. As of the effective date of this Privacy Notice, an industry standard has not yet been established on how to respond to these signals. Therefore, AbbVie does not currently respond to these signals. As discussed above, you can opt-out from advertisers that use your browsing history to deliver online behavioral advertisements.

### Affiliates, vendors and suppliers

We have relationships with various vendors and suppliers, including our affiliated companies, who help us operate our business and for whom it may be necessary to have access to your Personal Information in the course of providing services to AbbVie. We will not authorize these parties to use your Personal Information for any purpose that is not related to AbbVie’s business operation, and we require them to handle your Personal Information collected through the AbbVie Services in accordance with appropriate contractual privacy and security provisions.

### Co-branded services

We may partner with other companies to provide you with content or services on a joint or “co-branded” basis. At a co-branded site, you will see both the AbbVie logo and the logo of the co-branding partner displayed on your screen. To access the services available on a co-branded site, you may have to complete a new online registration form, and this registration information may be shared with AbbVie’s co-branding partners. You should read the individual privacy policies of our co-branding partners, as they may differ in some respects from ours. Reading these policies will help you to make an informed decision about whether to provide your information to a given site.

### Product reports

If you contact AbbVie regarding your experience in using one of our products, we may use the information that you provide in submitting reports to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and as otherwise required of us by law. We also may use the information to contact the prescribing physician to follow up regarding an unexpected event involving the use of our product.

### Legal rights and obligations

In certain limited circumstances, AbbVie may need to disclose your Personal Information in order to comply with a legal obligation or demand, such as to comply with reporting obligations to our governing regulatory authorities regarding the safety of our pharmaceutical products, or in connection with the sale or transfer of one of our product lines or divisions, which includes the services provided through one or more of the AbbVie Services. In such instances, we will take measures to protect your Personal Information to the extent possible. We also reserve the right to use Personal Information to investigate and prosecute users who violate our rules or who engage in behavior that is illegal or harmful to others or to others’ property.
