    <a name="content"></a><h1 class="pagetitle">Privacy Policy</h1><h2 class="subheading"><a id="1"></a>Abbott Laboratories Privacy Policy US Residents Only</h2>
<p>This Policy applies to residents of the United States. <a href="/global/url/content/en_US/10.40:40/general_content/Global_Locations.htm">If
you are a resident of another country, please click here for applicable
information</a>.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy explains how we handle the personal information that you
provide to us on web sites controlled by Abbott Laboratories (including its
subsidiaries and affiliates) which link to this Privacy Policy (referred to as
“Abbott web sites”).&nbsp; This Privacy Policy does not apply to personal
information collected from you offline, to Abbott web sites that do not link to
this Privacy Policy, to residents of countries other than the United States, or
to third-party web sites to which Abbott web sites may link.&nbsp; Your use of
Abbott web sites, which link to this Privacy Policy is subject to this Privacy
Policy and the <a href="/global/url/content/en_US/0:0/general_content/General_Content_00014.htm">Terms
of Use</a>.</p>

<p>Please read this Privacy Policy before using Abbott web sites or submitting
personal information to us.</p>

<p><strong>How does this Privacy Policy define "personal
information"?</strong><br>
“Personal information” means information that identifies you or could
reasonably be used to identify you and which is submitted to and/or collected
by Abbott web sites and maintained by Abbott in an accessible form.&nbsp;
Examples of personal information include your name, your postal address and
your telephone number.</p>

<p><strong>How does Abbott collect information online?</strong><br>
Abbott collects information in two ways:<br>
<br>
</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><em>Personal Information You Submit</em>:&nbsp;</strong> Abbott collects
personal information that you enter into data fields on Abbott web sites.&nbsp;
For example, you may submit your name, postal address, e-mail address, and/or
other information in order to receive information about various subjects,
register for Abbott programs, contact Abbott customer service, or respond to
Abbott surveys.&nbsp; To protect your privacy, you should not provide Abbott
with any information that is not specifically requested.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
</li>

<li><strong><em>Passive Collection of Unidentifiable Information</em>:</strong>&nbsp;
Abbott web sites may collect information about your visits to Abbott web sites
without you actively submitting such information.&nbsp; Unidentifiable
information may be collected using various technologies, such as cookies,
Internet tags, and web beacons.&nbsp; Your Internet browser automatically
transmits to Abbott web sites some of this unidentifiable information, such as
the URL of the web site you just visited and the browser version your computer
is operating.&nbsp; Passive information collection technologies can make your
use of Abbott web sites easier by allowing Abbott to provide better service,
customize sites based on consumer preferences, compile statistics, analyze
trends, and otherwise administer and improve Abbott web sites.&nbsp; Certain
features of Abbott web sites may not work without use of passive information
collection technologies.&nbsp; Information collected by these technologies
cannot be used to identity you without additional identifiable
information.<br>
<br>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>In what circumstances might Abbott collect and use personal
information?</strong><br>
Abbott will use the personal information you provide through Abbott web sites
to respond to your questions and to provide you with efficient customer
service.&nbsp; After you have entered personal information into a form or data
field on an Abbott web site, Abbott may use certain identifying technologies to
allow that web site to “remember” your personal preferences, such as sections
of that web site that you visit frequently and, if you choose, your user
ID.&nbsp;&nbsp; We may also use this personal information for other business
purposes, such as to offer you the opportunity to receive notices regarding
Abbott’s products or services, to invite you to participate in surveys about
our products, or to notify you about special promotions.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Does Abbott consolidate personal information?</strong><br>
Abbott may consolidate the personal information of customers who use Abbott web
sites.&nbsp; We use this information to help us better design Abbott web sites
and Abbott products, to communicate information to you, to enhance our
marketing and research activities, and to facilitate other business
functions.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What choices do I have about how Abbott collects and uses personal
information about me?</strong><br>
You may always limit the amount and type of personal information that Abbott
receives about you by choosing not to enter any personal information into forms
or data fields on Abbott web sites.&nbsp; Some of our online services can only
be provided to you if you provide us with appropriate personal
information.&nbsp; Other parts of Abbott web sites may ask whether you wish to
opt out or opt into our contact lists for offers, promotions and additional
services that may be of interest to you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You may also be provided with preference questions or preference boxes
allowing you to indicate that you do not want Abbott web sites to use tracking
technologies, such as cookies, to “remember” your personal information, such as
user IDs or mailing addresses, on return visits.&nbsp; However, Abbott web
sites that use tracking technologies to collect unidentifiable information do
not generally provide you with the ability to opt out of the tracking
technologies.&nbsp; Some Internet browsers allow you to limit or disable the
use of tracking technologies that collect unidentifiable information.</p>

<p><strong>Who will have access to personal information about
me?</strong><br>
Personal information can be accessed by a restricted number of Abbott
employees, by certain companies with which Abbott may conduct joint programs,
and by individuals and entities with whom Abbott contracts to carry out
business activities for Abbott.&nbsp; We train our employees about the
importance of privacy and how to handle and manage customer data appropriately
and securely.&nbsp; Also, it is Abbott’s practice to notify you if you are
registering for a program which is conducted in conjunction with another
company that may require access to your personal information.&nbsp; In
addition, Abbott’s practice is to require its contractors to keep your personal
information confidential and to use personal information only to perform
functions for Abbott.</p>

<p><strong>Does Abbott share personal information with third
parties?</strong><br>
As a general rule, Abbott does not share your personal information with third
parties, unless it is necessary to conduct a joint program or to carry out a
program or activity through a contractor.&nbsp; Where required by law, Abbott
will not disclose your personal information to third parties for those third
parties’ marketing purposes, unless you have been provided with an opportunity
to opt into or opt out of this disclosure.&nbsp; However, if Abbott sells one
of its product lines or divisions, your personal information may be transferred
to the buyer so that the buyer can continue to provide you with information and
services.&nbsp; If Abbott provides your personal information to individuals and
entities which assist us with our business activities, it is Abbott’s practice
to require those individuals and entities to keep your personal information
confidential and to use your personal information only to perform functions for
Abbott.&nbsp; Abbott reserves the right to disclose your personal information
to respond to authorized information requests from government authorities, to
address national security situations, or when otherwise required by law.</p>

<p><strong>How does Abbott secure personal information?</strong><br>
It is Abbott’s practice to secure each web page that collects personal
information; however, the confidentiality of personal information transmitted
over the Internet cannot be guaranteed.&nbsp; We urge you to exercise caution
when transmitting personal information over the Internet, especially personal
information related to your health.&nbsp; Abbott cannot guarantee that
unauthorized third parties will not gain access to your personal information;
therefore, when submitting personal information to Abbott web sites, you must
weigh both the benefits and the risks.&nbsp; In addition, Abbott web sites
covered by this Privacy Policy will display a warning whenever you link to a
web site that is not controlled by Abbott or subject to an Abbott privacy
policy; you should check the privacy policies of such third-party web sites
before submitting personal information.</p>

<p>Abbott has policies, which provide for the proper use and protection of
Social Security numbers obtained in the course of doing business with
Abbott.&nbsp; Abbott’s policies require that Social Security numbers be
appropriately secured to avoid loss, misuse or unauthorized access of Social
Security numbers.&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlike this Privacy Policy, which applies only to
on-line personal information, Abbott’s policies governing Social Security
numbers apply to both on-line and off-line collection and use of Social
Security numbers.</p>

<p><strong>How does Abbott protect the privacy of children?</strong><br>
Abbott does not knowingly collect or use any personal information from children
(we define "children" as minors younger than 13) on Abbott web sites.
We do not knowingly allow children to order our products, communicate with us,
or use any of our online services.&nbsp; If you are a parent and become aware
that your child has provided us with information, please contact us using one
of the methods specified below, and we will work with you to address this
issue.</p>

<p><strong>How may I correct personal information or delete it from current
customer records?</strong><br>
You may request to remove your personal information from our current customer
records or to amend your personal information.&nbsp; Please notify us of your
wishes by contacting us in one of the ways specified below.&nbsp; For our
record keeping purposes, we will retain certain personal information you submit
in conjunction with commercial transactions.</p>

<p><strong>How can I contact Abbott?</strong><br>
If you have questions about the use, amendment, or deletion of personal
information that you have provided to us, or if you would like to opt out of
future communications from an Abbott business or a particular Abbott program,
please contact us by clicking on the “Contact Us” link on the web site you are
visiting or by e-mailing us at <a href="mailto:webmaster@abbott.com">webmaster@abbott.com</a>. Alternatively, you
may send a letter to the following address:</p>

<p class="indent50">Abbott Laboratories<br>
Attention: Public Affairs, Department 383<br>
100 Abbott Park Road<br>
Abbott Park, IL 60064-6048</p>

<p>In all communications to Abbott, please include the e–mail address used for
registration (if applicable), the web site address or the specific Abbott
program to which you provided personal information (e.g. Abbott.com,
Humira.com, etc.), and a detailed explanation of your request.&nbsp; If you
would like to delete or amend your personal information and are contacting us
by e-mail, please put “Deletion Request” or “Amendment Request”, as applicable,
in the subject line of the e-mail.&nbsp; We will do our best to respond to all
reasonable requests in a timely manner.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>How will I know whether Abbott has updated this
policy?</strong><br>
Abbott reserves the right to amend this Privacy Policy without prior notice to
reflect technological advancements, legal and regulatory changes and good
business practices.&nbsp; If Abbott changes its privacy practices, a new
Privacy Policy will reflect those changes and the effective date of the revised
Privacy Policy will be set forth in this paragraph.&nbsp; This Privacy Policy
was last updated on October 2, 2008 and is effective as of that date.</p>
