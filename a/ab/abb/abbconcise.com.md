Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.

One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize **ABB** pages, or register with the **ABB** Service, a cookie helps **ABB** to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same **ABB** Service, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the **ABB** features that you customized.

### _Credit Card Payment and Payment Information_

The transactional ordering process of the Service utilizes a payment gateway (CyberSource) wherein Secure Acceptance accepts payments from the web and mobile browsers without you having to enter payment data into the Service. Payments are accepted using Point-to-Point Encryption (P2PE) and Payment Tokenization thus avoiding the storing of payment data on the Service. Payment Authorization Tokens are held until payment settlement. The specific terms governing payment and the purchase of any products or services via the Service are set forth under the Terms of Sale.

### _Password Policy_

We protect your password information using technical and administrative security measures which are designed to reduce the risks of loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure and alteration of passwords. Some of the safeguards we use are strong password validation, temporary password reset procedures, and encryption of passwords when stored.

Passwords must be a minimum of 8 characters in length, contain a mix of upper case, lower case, at least one numeric and at least one special character.

If more than six failed login attempts are made to an Account, a password lockout threshold is reached and the Account will be locked for twenty (20) minutes. After twenty (20) minutes the Account is reset and the failed attempts are cleared. During the lockout period you will NOT be able to login or reset your password.

Password reset requires User Account validation wherein an email is sent to the email address on file with a temporary password. The temporary password is valid for a set period of time during which a User must login to their account and reset their password.

### _User Password Management_

  * Users should never share their passwords with anyone else.
  * Users should never share their passwords with any outside parties, including those claiming to be representatives of a business with a legitimate need to access user information.
  * Users should take steps to avoid phishing scams and other attempts by hackers to steal passwords and other sensitive information.
  * Users must refrain from writing passwords down and keeping them accessible.
  * Users should not use password managers or other tools to help store and remember passwords.
  * **If you are an entity who has permitted representatives or personnel to manage your Service or Account or given access to your Account to such persons, and if that representative or personnel should no longer have access to your Account or your Log-in Information (because the relationship with that person has terminated or otherwise), _you are strongly encouraged to immediately change your Log-in Information._ You are and will be responsible for any and all activities which occur on or in connection with your Account.**
