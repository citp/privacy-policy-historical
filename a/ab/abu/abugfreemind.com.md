  **Cookies**

We use cookies on this site to ensure the integrity of the registration process and to personalize the site. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server.

One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenient feature to save you time. For example, if you personalize a web page, or navigate within a site, a cookie helps the site to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of delivering relevant content, eases site navigation, and so on. When you return to the web site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the site's features that you customized.

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to deny cookies if you prefer. If you choose to deny cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of this or other web sites you visit.

  **Changes to This Privacy Statement**

We may occasionally update this privacy statement. When we do, we will also revise the 'last updated' date at the top of the privacy statement. For material changes to this privacy statement, we will notify you either by placing a prominent notice on the home page of our web site or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to periodically review this privacy statement to stay informed about how we are helping to protect the personal information we collect.
