This data is used for business purposes such as providing more relevant ads and content, and market research. The Company may also use these technologies and other similar tools to relate your use of the Services to personal information obtained from you or a third party. For example, cookie, click stream or other data about your activities using the Services may allow us to limit the content provided to you through the Services to items we think you will find interesting and relevant to you, based on your prior online activities and preferences.
