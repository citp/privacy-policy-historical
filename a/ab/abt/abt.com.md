# Abt Privacy Policy

Abt respects each and every one of our customers' right to privacy. We have built our reputation on service and taking care of our customers beyond their expectations, and we will continue to provide these levels of service for many years to come.

This notice describes the privacy policy applicable to Abt.com. It addresses: 

  1. What information is being collected from you through the website, how it is used, and with whom it is shared. 
  2. What choices you have regarding the use of your information. 
  3. The security measures we have instituted to protect your information. 
  4. What you may do if you have concerns about us honoring this policy. 



## **Information Collection, Use, and Sharing**

We are the sole owners of the information collected on this website. We will not sell this information to anyone. We will not share your information with any third party, other than as described in this policy. Unless you ask us not to, we may contact you via e-mail to tell you about our company, products, and services.

Please see the following details. 

### Orders

We request information from you when you place an order. At our checkout, you must provide contact information (like name and shipping address) and financial information (like credit card number and expiration date). 

Contact information is used to fill your order, notify you of its status, and contact you if we have questions regarding your order. The financial information that we collect is used only to bill you for products that you purchase. 

### Cookies

Our site uses "cookies." A cookie is a small piece of data that your browser holds in memory or stores in a special file on your hard drive. These small pieces of data equip us to improve our customers' experience on Abt.com through helping our server remember you. More information about the use of cookies on our site is available here (<http://www.abt.com/help/secure-shopping-guarantee>). 

Additionally, this website uses Mouseflow, a third-party analytics tool, to track page content and click/touch, movement, scroll, and keystroke activity. You can opt out at <http://mouseflow.com/opt-out>. 

Most internet browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether.
