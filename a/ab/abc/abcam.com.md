# Privacy policy | Abcam

### Introduction

Abcam is committed to protecting your privacy. Any information we collect is stored on servers owned by Abcam which are held in physically secure locations and are protected by firewall and password based security measures. 

The policy below sets out what information we collect, why we collect it and how we use that information. 

### Basic information and creating an account

When you browse the Abcam website, we establish a minimal "user profile" for you on the Abcam website which is tracked via a cookie (see 'Cookies' section below). This contains basic information such as how you first found us, IP address, and ISP host. If you decide to create an account with us, this profile is then associated with the email address you then provide. 

Creating an account with us means we can personalize your use of the website and contact you with information that we believe will help you with your research i.e. new and updated products related to your interests, or new services that Abcam is offering. 

You can update your account details by clicking on the 'sign in or register' links at the top of any page, including configuring the nature of contact from Abcam. 

### Information we collect for ordering

If you place an order with Abcam, we ask you to sign in or create an account and then prompt you for address and contact details that will allow us to accurately fulfil and invoice you for the items you order. Except for credit card details that you may provide, we will record this information into your user profile so that next time you order you do not have to re-enter these details. Should you wish to review details of an order placed with us, you can see these by logging into your account. 

### Personally identifiable information

Any personally identifiable information (including credit card information) is passed over a secure encrypted (SSL) connection and we provide a third-party certificate which can be used to verify the credentials of the Abcam server you are supplying the details to. See Abcam's website security page for more information. 

### Other information we may collect

Our site can be used to contact other researchers in the following ways:

  * To email customers who have published reviews on Abcam products (Abreviews)
  * To share product information with your contacts via email



For Abreviews, we do not reveal the reviewer's contact details on the website but will forward your message (including your email reply address) directly to them. This is designed to enable you to get in touch with the reviewer without compromising the security of their personal information. 

In both cases, we monitor who the email was sent to/from and the original message to ensure compliance with our ISP's abuse policy. If we think there is information of general benefit to our customers we may contact you for permission to publish some or all of its content. 

Visitors of the site using this functionality agree to adhere to its intended purpose as outlined above. 

We sometime offer the chance to enter competitions; this is usually by answering survey questions. In this case sensitive personal data will only be used to aggregate responses. 

### Statistical website usage information

Abcam also uses data collected from our website logs and standard JavaScript tools to spot general patterns of use of our website - this information is handled in aggregate form. 

We do this in order to understand what users are interested in on our website and to help us improve the design of our website or product offerings. 

### How Abcam uses cookies

Cookies are very small text files saved to your computer that are used to track user navigation around a website. Cookies enable us to identify you or the device you are on when you have logged in. 

We use cookies that are necessary to enable you to see certain features on our site, such as price and stock availability for your country. We also use cookies to help us improve the performance of our site providing you with a better user experience. This includes collecting standard information about visitor behaviour patterns. We do this to find out things such as the number of visitors to the site and collect this information in a way which does not personally identify anyone. 

We do not sell the information collected by cookies nor do we disclose information to third parties. When we want to collect personally identifiable information (for things like email sign ups), we will be explicit about this. 

Users have the ability to accept or disable cookies by modifying the settings in their browser. Disabling cookies, however may mean that some functionality may be affected. To find out more about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set and how to manage and delete them, visit [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/). 

We may advertise on the Google content network using Google's remarketing technology. Google place a unique ad-serving cookie on your computer and will use non-personal information about your browser and your activity at this site to serve ads on their content network. 

Google AdWords Remarketing allows us to tailor our marketing to better suit your needs and only display ads that are relevant to you. [You can opt out here](http://www.google.com/settings/ads)

### Disclosure of personal information to third parties

Abcam respects your right not to be contacted unless you want to, and we do not sell, trade, give, or rent information that can identify you personally to any third party except as detailed below.  
Abcam does use third parties in order to fulfil certain functions on its behalf. Examples of this are: 

  * in order to ship a package to you, we have to tell the shipping company your name and address and possibly phone/fax number
  * we have commissioned market research and customer satisfaction surveys with sections of our customer base



in these cases we only disclose the information necessary to perform that specific function. 

### Your consent

By using the Abcam website, you are consenting to us collecting and using the information as stated above. 

If we change our privacy policy, we will post the changes here so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we disclose it.
