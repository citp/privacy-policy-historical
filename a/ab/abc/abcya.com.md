### SHARING INFORMATION

Although we share aggregate demographic data with our partners and advertisers, this data is not linked to any personal information identifying any individual person. Abcya.com may share aggregate, non-personally identifiable demographic information with its partners and advertisers. 

Abcya.com will not share your personal information with any non-affiliated companies except in furtherance of providing you goods or services that you have specifically requested.  We use an outside shipping company to ship orders, and a credit card processing company to bill you for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. We sometimes partner with another company to provide specific services. When you sign up for these services, we will share names, or other contact information that is necessary for the companies to provide these services to you. These companies are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services.

When we share your personal information with non-affiliated companies, we do so only under the terms of a confidentiality agreement which prohibits the non-affiliated companies from sharing your personal information with others.  We may also share your personal information in response to subpoenas, court orders, or in exercise or defense of our legal rights.  In the event Abcya.com merges with another company, your personal information shall be transferred to such other company.

This information is used for billing purposes and to fill your orders. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with you.

### SECURITY

This Website utilizes several security measures to prevent the loss, corruption or unauthorized dissemination of the information collected on this Website. Regardless of the security measures undertaken, however, no Website operator can guarantee the security or privacy of data collected.
