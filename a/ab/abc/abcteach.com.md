            supervision, and direction of the parents, educators, and other adults who are
            visitors, members, or subscribers to the Site. As used in this Terms of Service
            and Privacy Policy, "you" refers to such visitors, members, or subscribers.

            We may, solely at our discretion, modify or revise these terms and conditions

            modifications or revisions. You should visit this page periodically to review
            the terms. From time to time, we will require that you confirm your agreement
            to the terms.
    
    2.  Usage
    
        2.1 Sharing of password or login information is strictly prohibited. Suspension
            of account access may result from sharing of this information. 
    
        2.2 Worksheets and other materials available on abcteach, including clip art,
            may be printed or otherwise duplicated for use in your home or your
            classroom(s). Clip art on abcteach is intended as a resource for you in
            creating lessons and teaching materials and the like within your permitted
            usage of the Site.  If you are a paid member, our clip art may be: placed on
            another publication as clip art, or distributed individually on a third-party
            authorship site, if you as a member give abcteach credit for any clip art
            intended to be redistributed.  Giving credit to abcteach requires you to
            mention our name and website on any publications in which you use our clip art
            for redistribution. You may not use our clip art in the design or content of
            another website; or distribute our clip art electronically or by email or text
            or by any other media or social media. Furthermore, Members are prohibited from
            packaging our clip art into their own collections for sale, each clip art
            illustration used for resale, must be used individually, again giving credit to
            abcteach.com.
    
        2.3 The abcteach copyright appears on every page; we require that this
            copyright remain in place on all reproductions. 
    
        2.4 Except as provided in section 2.7 below, all of the worksheets and other
            materials available on abcteach are intended for non-commercial educational
            purposes.
    
        2.5 You may place links to abcteach from your own education website; however,
            copying or uploading abcteach resources and documents to your own site is a
            copyright violation and will be treated as such. Deep linking is not permitted.
            (A "deep link" is a hyperlink that bypasses a website's home page and takes the
            user directly to an internal page. For example, instead of linking to the home
            page of a newspaper, a deep link might take the user directly to a newspaper
            article within the site.) At abcteach, linking directly to a content page
            rather than the home page or a directory page is considered deep linking and is
            not permitted.
    
        2.6 Under no circumstances may any of the documents, resources, clip art,
            worksheets, or other materials (including text, images, or website design) on
            abcteach be re-sold or re-distributed without the express permission of
            abcteach.
    
        2.7 We may permit you to use abcteach materials in your creation and sale of
            educational materials produced by you individually, on sites such as Teachers
            Pay Teachers, upon your payment of a separate additional fee and your
            submission of an executed agreement as stated elsewhere on the Site. This would
            offer you a limited non-exclusive license to use abcteach materials within the
            scope of the separate agreement; such permission being terminable at any time
            by abcteach in our sole discretion; you agree that you will immediately cease
            the use, or offering for sale, or sale, of any such educational materials in
            the event we take such action. By using any materials, you acknowledge that
            other members may be acting under similar permissions and creating similar
            materials. 
    
        2.8 If you desire to use abcteach materials in any other manner, or if you have
            any questions about permissible uses that are not specifically addressed
            here, you should address your inquiry to support@abcteach.

            creation of user-generated word lists, puzzles, worksheets, and other
            resources. The user-selected content of such user-generated materials is your

            other documents created with this abcteach tools, resources, and

            content.
    
        3.3 If you share an abcteach document or user-generated document, by any means
            including any of the sharing features or applications or tools found on the
            Site, you are solely responsible for the content of the transmitted materials
            or documents.
    
        3.4 If any sensitive materials or information or documents from the Site, or
            user-generated materials, are shared or provided to a child under the age of
            13, you agree that you will first obtain express consent from the child's
            parent or guardian(s) to share such documents with the child, and obtain
            permission and/or releases for the use of any user-generated information
            concerning the child or the child's family that may be contained in such
            documents.

            or PayPal accounts or other payment mechanism, all of which information is
            retained and used according to secure procedures of the third-party payment
            providers. 
    
        5.3 Depending on the plan you choose, you will be charged a fee automatically
            through our renewal system. By becoming an abcteach member, you are agreeing
            that we are authorized to charge you the membership fee associated with the
            type of membership (monthly, yearly, or bi-yearly) that you chose during
            registration. You agree that we are authorized to charge you the membership fee
            at the then-current rate to the payment method you provided during
            registration. Please note that prices and charges are subject to change without
            notice. Fees each month may be modified using credit card, debit card, PayPal,
            or other payment methods available through your account. This includes:
            promotional discounts advertised in our weekly member newsletters, or on-brand
            promotional ads. Each renewal payment will take place on or about the
            anniversary of the original date of account registration. If all eligible
            payments methods we have on file for you are declined, you must provide us a
            new payment method promptly or your membership will be canceled. If the renewal
            of your membership fails for any reason, we will attempt to process your
            renewal for a period up to thirty (30) days.
    
        5.4 Membership Cancellation. You may cancel your membership any time by
            visiting Your Account and adjusting your settings. If you choose to cancel
            your subscription or fail to pay any fees, we may stop your membership. If you
            cancel your membership or are no longer a paid user, you have the option to
            continue use as a free user.  
    
        5.5 UNLESS YOU NOTIFY US BEFORE A SUBSCRIPTION PAYMENT THAT YOU WANT TO CANCEL
            OR DO NOT WANT TO AUTO RENEW, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOUR ABCTEACH MEMBERSHIP
            WILL AUTOMATICALLY CONTINUE AND YOU AUTHORIZE US TO COLLECT THE THEN-APPLICABLE
            MEMBERSHIP FEE AND ANY APPLICABLE TAXES, USING ANY/ALL ELIGIBLE PAYMENT METHODS
            WE HAVE ON RECORD FOR YOUR ACCOUNT.
    
        5.6 ALL FEES ARE NON-REFUNDABLE. Termination of your account  may include
            removal of your access to all offerings of the website; including password,
            information, files, and user content associated with your account, and barring
            any further use of abcteach membership services and tools. 
    
        5.7 We may terminate your membership at our discretion without notice. If we do
            so, we will provide a prorated refund based on the number of days/months
            remaining in your membership. However, we will not give any refund for
            termination related to conduct that we determine, in our discretion, violates
            these terms or any applicable law, involves fraud or misuse of the membership
            agreement, or is harmful to our interests or another use.
