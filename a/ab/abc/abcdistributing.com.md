# Welcome to Online Shopping with abc!

  


If you request a catalog, we will need your name, the name of the company you work for (since abc distributing, LLC only sells to businesses) and an address where we should send the catalog. We will also ask for a phone number we can use to contact you if any of the information provided is incorrect (for example, if there is a typographical error.) If you wish to set up an account and purchase merchandise from us, we may ask for additional information. 

We also track the total number of visitors to our site in an aggregate form to allow us to update and improve our site; personally identifiable information is not extracted in this process.
