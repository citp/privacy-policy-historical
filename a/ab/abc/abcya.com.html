<p>This section describes the <strong><a href="#personal_info">Personal Information</a></strong>, <strong>&nbsp;</strong>and <strong><a href="#other_info">Other Information</a></strong>, the Site collects from visitors.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong><em><a name="personal_info" id="personal_info"></a>Personal Information</em></strong></p>
<p>The Site does not ask for or collect “<strong>Personal Information</strong>.” which is information that could reasonably be used to contact you or to identify you personally (for example, first and last name, mailing address or telephone number), from visitors who play games on the Site. However, on limited occasions, the Site may collect <br>
first name and online contact information (typically, an e-mail address) of Children solely for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>for one-time use of that information, such as to respond directly to a specific request (for example, answering a question submitted through the Site). We delete the contact information provided from our records once it is used to fulfill the specific one-time purpose and will not use it to re-contact the Child; OR&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>For the sole purpose of any of the following: to protect the security or integrity of the Site; to take precautions against liability; to respond to judicial process; and, to the extent permitted under other provisions of law, to provide information to law enforcement agencies or for an investigation on a matter related to public safety.</li>
</ul>
<p>(2) If the Site offers a feature that collects Personal Information in addition to first name and online contact information as described above, ABCya will provide the Child's Parent prior notice of the Site’s privacy practices and obtain the Parent's consent to the collection of the Child's Personal Information. </p>
<p>Please note that, as required by law, we will not condition a Child's participation in an activity on the Site on the Child's disclosing more than is reasonably necessary to participate in such activity. &nbsp;We use Personal Information only for the purpose that it was provided and for internal purposes. <br>
