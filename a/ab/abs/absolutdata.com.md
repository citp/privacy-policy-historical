  3.  **Information You Actively Submit**


  1.  _Generally_



If you visit and / or sign up on our Sites for our blog/newsletter, you may provide contact information such as your name, email address, mailing address and company affiliation.

If you use our/Sub-contractor Sites as a Respondent, you will provide demographic information about yourself and answer questions at your choice which may include political opinion, sexual orientation, health and genetic data. In each such case, you know what information you provide and we collect, because you will actively submit the information.

  2.  _General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)_



In order to deliver the services, we require opt-in consent from European Union Respondents prior to the collection and processing of your Personal Data. The various modes of collection of data are stated below:

    *  **Panels**  
When you consent to our collection of your Personal Data, we act as a Controller of that data whether collected on our Sites from you or received from our panels. Our customers may receive Personal Data collected pursuant to your opt-in consent on our Sites and as such, our customers are Joint Controllers of that data. In addition, we may share Personal Data collected on our Sites with our customers when performing the Managed Services below; when our customers receive such Personal Data, they are Joint Controllers of that data.
    *  **Managed Services**  
We also offer managed services to our customers. With regard to the control and processing of your Personal Data when we’re performing these managed services, Absolutdata is the Processor and our customers are the Controllers. Our customers provide instructions to us for the processing of your Personal Data, which typically includes using our panels to perform those managed services. In addition, our customers may instruct us to collect your Personal Data from panels to share with our customers; we are relying on the consents given to your panels to allow this processing. You should rely on our customers for obtaining your consent to process your Personal Data as part of the surveys conducted off the panels.


  4.  **Combination & Synchronization**  
We may combine and synchronize information that your device transmits, information that you actively submit and information that we obtain from third party sources (including suppliers of market research sample and data marketing platforms that may direct you to our Sites to answer demographic questions about yourself in preparation for your completion of surveys, and web publishers, advertisers, data brokers and online service providers that may have obtained information from you or your devices via cookies, pixels,  and other tracking technologies).


  5.  **Business Information**  
We do collect employee contact names, addresses, phone numbers and email addresses of our business partners, including buyers, suppliers and vendors, for the administration of our business relationships. If you feel that your personal data or personally identifiable information is being collected inappropriately, please notify us at [ _privacy@absolutdata.com_](mailto:privacy@absolutdata.com).

On Absolutdata.com, all visitors are given an option to opt-in or opt-out of cookies. If you opt-out, your information won’t be tracked when you visit Absolutdata.com. A single cookie will be used in your browser to remember your preference not to be tracked.


  7.  **Information Tracking Technologies**  
We may use, and allow third parties to use, Pixels (sometimes called web beacons) on our Sites (or other third-party sites) to monitor the effectiveness of survey qualifications. Pixels may be linked to your Personal Information, and they collect the IP address of the device to which the web beacon is sent (for geolocation lookup), the URL of the page the web beacon comes from, the user agent string (for device lookup), and the time it was viewed. We may also use third-party devices, links or electronic mail, to deliver surveys to you during which additional Personal Information may be collected. These third-party surveys or devices may use cookies, web beacons or other technology to collect information about your visits to our Sites (or other third-party sites) in order to present surveys that may be applicable to you. We may collect traffic information and data on and from the use of third-party sites on behalf of our customers. Absolutdata may use a Pixel or cookie to examine what is happening on third-party websites, including programs and sites with marketing and advertising partners, to improve the understanding of site traffic at a granular level, market research effectiveness and other services provided.Respondents that are hosted on, accessed by or routed through the third-party sites should consult the privacy policy and other policies of third parties through whom they are providing information. These third-parties may collect and use data that has been augmented by our services for their own services, which may include marketing and ad targeting, among other uses.


  8.  **Do Not Track**  
Some browsers have a “do not track” feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. These features are not yet uniform, and our website is not currently set up to respond to those signals for tracking on our website.


  4.  **Purpose & Use of Collected Personal Information**



We use your information to operate, evaluate and improve our business (including developing new products and services; enhancing and improving our services; managing our communications; and analyzing our products).

If you provide us with your name and contact information, we will use this information to answer requests from you, communicate with you regarding any services we are providing to you as well as inform you about new products and services (unless and until you opt-out of marketing information).

If you come to our Sites as a “Respondent” to qualify for or take surveys, we use the demographic information you provide to make your survey answers more meaningful to us and our clients. We may also use information derived from cookies, pixels and other technologies to determine your interests in particular surveys, advertisements and other communications.

  4.  **Information Retention & Accuracy**



We take reasonable steps to ensure that Personal Information we receive, process, or maintain is accurate, complete, and reliable for its intended use. We rely on the accuracy of the information provided directly to us but accept responsibility for the management and confidentiality of the Personal Information collected.

In general, we keep Personal Information only as long as we need it to provide you the services you requested. We may also process data on behalf of third parties who have engaged us. We keep Personal Information processed on behalf of third parties for as long as needed to provide services to third party in question. However, we reserve the right to retain Personal Information for any period required by law or to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

  5.  **Data Minimization**



We take every reasonable step to ensure that your user Information that we process is limited to the User Information reasonably necessary in connection with the purposes set out in this Policy or as required to provide you services or access to the Services.

  6.  **Sharing of Personal Information and Accountability for Onward Transfer**



Information associated with your name we share only as follows:

  * With your consent.

  * In a reorganization or sale of our company or assets, your data may be transferred, subject to the acquirer accepting the commitments made in this Privacy Policy and in compliance with applicable law.



We share aggregated demographic information about our users with third parties. This information is linked to randomly assigned user IDs and survey responses. Your user ID is linked to demographic information about you (excluding your first name and last name) that potentially could include Special Categories of Data. You consent to us collecting and sharing this information with our customers and other third parties.

Additionally, Absolutdata may share your Personal Information, without your prior consent, for the limited purposes noted below:

When Absolutdata does share your Personal Information with third party service providers and/or sub-processors, Absolutdata will:

  1. transfer such data only for limited and specified purposes;
  2. ascertain that the sub-processor is obligated to provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by these Principles;
  3. take reasonable and appropriate steps to ensure that the sub-processor effectively processes the Personal Information transferred in a manner consistent with the organization’s obligations under these Principles;
  4. require the sub-processor to notify Absolutdata if it makes a determination that it can no longer meet its obligation to provide the same level of protection as is required by these Principles;

  6. provide a summary or a representative copy of the relevant privacy provisions of its contract with that sub-processor to the Department of Commerce upon request.



Absolutdata shall remain liable under the EU-US Privacy Shield Principle of Accountability for Onward Transfer if its sub-processors process your Personal Information in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles, unless Absolutdata proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

If you are visiting this website from a country other than the country in which our servers are located, your communications with us will result in the transfer of information across international boundaries. By visiting this website and communicating electronically with us, you consent to such cross-border transfers.  In the case of data transfers from the EEA and Switzerland, the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks apply.

Absolutdata is responsible for the processing of personal information it receives, under each Privacy Shield Framework, and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. Absolutdata complies with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of personal information from the EU and Switzerland, including the onward transfer liability provisions.

With respect to personal information received or transferred pursuant to a Privacy Shield Framework, Absolutdata is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain situations, Absolutdata may be required to disclose personal information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to satisfy national security or law enforcement requirements.

Under certain conditions, more fully described on the Privacy Shield website, you may invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.

In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, Absolutdata commits to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your personal information. If you have questions or complaints regarding our Privacy Policy or practices, please contact us here.

  6.  **Protection of Personal Information**



Absolutdata uses reasonable security measures in an effort to prevent loss, misuse and alteration of information under our control. However, we cannot guarantee the security of information on or transmitted via the Internet. We rely on various security procedures and systems to ensure the secure storage and transmission of data, including encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties, to effect secure transmission of confidential information. Additionally, we have absolutely no control over the security of other sites you might visit, interact with or do business with.

If we learn of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. Absolutdata may post a notice on the Absolutdata Site if a security breach occurs. We may also send an email to you at the email address you have provided to us in these circumstances. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive a free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice) you should notify us.

  7.  **Limits to Your Privacy**
