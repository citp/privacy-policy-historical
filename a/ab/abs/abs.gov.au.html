<b><i>Statistical collections</i></b><br>
<br>
As part of its statistical collections, the ABS collects data from individuals, households and businesses, as well as from administrative sources. These collections support activities related to the compilation, production and analysis of statistics on a wide range of social, population, environmental and economic matters.<br>
<br>
The ABS collects, compiles, analyses and disseminates nationally representative statistics on a wide range of social, environmental and economic matters. The personal information collected as part of these activities varies with the collection topic and the collection unit. Most individual and household collections include basic demographics; some collect personal characteristics and personal opinions. Most business collections include point of contact details; some include details that relate to employees, sole traders and partnerships. Various administrative collections usually include basic demographics and may include personal characteristics relating to individuals and their family.<br>
<br>
All survey, Census and research data, including data from administrative sources, is collected by the ABS under the authority of the Census and Statistics Act, unless explicit approval for the collection is provided by the Australian Statistician. In a small number of collections, data is collected under the authority of the ABS Act. This is usually done on a contractual basis to allow the clients to access unit record survey data for the purpose of producing statistics. Any collection of data under the ABS Act is on an overtly voluntary basis. <br>
<br>
Personal information collected under the Census and Statistics Act remains confidential and is used for statistical purposes only.  For further information about the privacy of survey data, please see <a href="http://www.abs.gov.au/websitedbs/D3310114.nsf/Home/Survey+Participant+Information">Survey Participant Information</a>.<br>

·	participant contact for education and training activities<br>
·	client contact for statistical consultancy work<br>
·	volunteer contact for survey testing to assist in the development of surveys <br>
