**Why the ABS collects and uses personal information  
**

The ABS only collects personal information in order to carry out its functions as the national statistical authority for all Australian governments and the Australian community. 

The ABS primarily collects and uses information for statistical and research purposes. Information collected for these purposes will never be used for compliance or regulatory activities. 

**Protecting your privacy**

The ABS handles personal information with utmost care and in a manner that adheres to or exceeds the requirements of the Privacy Act and the APPs and the Census & Statistics Act. 

The ABS has a range of measures in place to ensure that the information provided is safeguarded. These measures include strong encryption of data, restricted access on a need to know basis, physical security of premises and data lock-ups, monitoring access and use, and regular audits. 

ABS staff are personally bound to protect identifiable data. It is an offence for any ABS staff, past or present, to divulge, directly or indirectly, any information collected under the Census & Statistics Act. Breaching this requirement can result in heavy penalties, including fines and imprisonment. 

**Privacy Impact Assessments**

The ABS may conduct or commission a Privacy Impact Assessment to assess the potential impact of an ABS project on the privacy of individuals, and document and assess the processes in place to manage, minimise, or eliminate that impact. See [ABS Privacy Impact Assessments](https://web.archive.org/websitedbs/D3310114.nsf/home/ABS+Privacy+Impact+Assessments) for a listing of Privacy Impact Assessment reports, and the ABS response to any recommendations contained within those reports, that have been published on the ABS website.

**Accessing and correcting your personal information**

In most cases, the ABS must give you access to the personal information which has been collected from you and take reasonable steps to correct it if the ABS considers it to be incorrect 

Exemptions apply for personal information which has been collected for statistical purposes. Personal information provided to the ABS through a survey can only be accessed in special circumstances. 

Please see the [Main ABS Privacy Policy](https://web.archive.org/websitedbs/D3310114.nsf/Home/Privacy+Policy) for more details. 

**How to make a complaint**

If you believe that the ABS or one of its contracted service providers has not dealt with your personal information in accordance with the APPs or the Privacy Act, you can make a written complaint to the ABS, clearly outlining the nature of your complaint and the outcome you are seeking. 

If you are not satisfied with our response to your complaint, you may refer your complaint to the [Office of the Australian Information Commissioner](https://www.oaic.gov.au/)
