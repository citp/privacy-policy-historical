Professional Assist Corporation, DBA Associated Bodywork & Massage Professionals, and including subsidiaries Associated Skin Care Professionals, Associated Hair Professionals, and Associated Nail Professionals (collectively "ABMP," “we,” “our,” “us”) recognizes the significance and importance of your information and online security and is committed to ensuring the information you share on our website is handled carefully and with consideration. To that end, we have created the following Privacy Policy that describes how we collect, use, disclose, and secure the information that you share with us when you use our website or services (collectively, the “Services”).

## What Information Do We Collect?

We may collect personal information about you, meaning information that can uniquely identify you, from various sources, such as:

  * Directly from you when you use the Services, such as when you register for an account, access certain features or content, or order products; and
  * From our subsidiaries, affiliates, service providers, business partners, and other third parties.



The personal information we may collect about you may include, without limitation:

When you use the Services, we may also collect certain information by automated means, such as cookies.

We may also use third-party analytics tools (such as Google Analytics) that collect information about use of the Services and user traffic. The information we may collect by automated means may include, without limitation:

  * Information about the devices you use to access the Services (such as the IP address and the type of the device, operating system, and web browser);
  * Dates, times, and duration of use of the Services (including whether you are a repeat or first-time visitor); and
  * Information on actions taken when using the Services (such as page views and website navigation patterns).



This information helps us to improve and personalize our Services, including by enabling us to identify and authenticate members. To the extent that we associate it with personal information, we will treat it in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

We also may use the information we obtain about you in other ways for which we provide specific notice at the time of collection.

We may disclose aggregated information about our members, and information that does not identify any individual member, without restriction. We may disclose personal information about you:

We also reserve the right to transfer your personal information to a buyer or other transferee in the event of a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, sale, or other transfer of some or all of our assets.  Should such a sale, merger, or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to direct the transferee to use your personal information in a manner that is consistent with our Privacy Policy.

## How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals

Your web browser may let you choose your preference as to whether you want to allow the collection of information about your online activities over time and across different websites or online services. At this time, the Services do not respond to the preferences you may have set in your web browser regarding such collection of your information, and the Services may continue to collect information in the manner described in this Privacy Policy.

## How Secure is the Visitor Information?

To safeguard your personal information when engaging in monetary transactions, we use Transport Layer Security (TLS) software, which encrypts information you input. This is designated in your browser address field by "https" and a padlock icon at the bottom right of each page. We have implemented measures intended to protect your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration and disclosure. Please note that the electronic transmission of information is not completely secure. We cannot guarantee that the security measures we have in place to safeguard personal information will never be defeated or fail, or that such measures will always be sufficient or effective. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk.

You may also send us an email at [expectmore@abmp.com](mailto:expectmore@abmp.com?subject=Privacy%20Policy%20Request) to request access to, correct, or delete any personal information that you have provided to us. We may not accommodate a request to change information if we believe the change would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect.

## Your Rights

We offer you the following choices about the information we collect from you and how we communicate with you:

## Cookies

Most browsers will tell you how to stop accepting new cookies, how to be notified when you receive a new cookie, and how to disable existing cookies. Please note, however, that without cookies you may not be able to take full advantage of all of the features of the Services.
