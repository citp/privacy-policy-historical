### Online entry

Applicants from the UK, Singapore and Malaysia have the option of entering exam candidates online.  In order to use this service, applicants must first register by providing us with the following personally identifiable information:

  * Country
  * Applicant Number
  * Full name
  * Details of any music degrees or diplomas held by the applicant
  * Postal address including postcode
  * Contact telephone number
  * Email address



^Go to Top

We also request financial information from online applicants (such as credit card number and expiry date).  This information is used to process payments for examination entries. The online entry form is held on a secure HTTPS site (demonstrated by the padlock logo visible)

**Payment via the online form for UK applicants** is processed via the Solve SE program and paid to the Associated Board via Barclays Merchant Services. Card details are held on the secure server for three days and then discarded.

**Payment via the online form for Singapore and Malaysia applicants** is processed via the Korvac Payment Gateway and paid to the Associated Board via Barclays Merchant Services.

All exam entries are stored on an intermediate ISP server (ie held neither by Korvac nor ourselves) Once uploaded to The Associated Board via encrypted files, all exam entries are then held on our AS400 system in the same way as postal entries. All online information is held purely for the purpose of exam entries, and is retained on this secure server so that applicants can view their past entries.

We use the contact information supplied by applicants to ensure that examination schedules, results and certificates are forwarded to the correct address.  In the event of any problems or complications with exam entries, this information is also used to contact the applicant.  Finally this information is used to keep accurate records of applicant and candidate exam history, which allows us to provide a quicker and more effective service to our applicants.

**Information regarding exam entries and candidates is strictly confidential and is not disclosed to external organisations.**

## Links

This website contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we, The Associated Board, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.  We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information.  This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this website.

## Security

The Associated Board website takes every precaution to protect our users’ information.  When users submit sensitive information via the website, their information is protected both online and off-line.

When our online examination entry form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and expiry date), that information is encrypted and is protected with industry-standard Secure Socket Layer software.  While on a secure page, such as our online entry form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when users are just ‘surfing’.

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line.  Personal information given by users beyond their name and address is restricted in our offices and made available only to the appropriate departments.  All employees are provided with a unique username and password in order to gain access to this information. Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are password protected and held in a secure environment, in a locked facility. Regular back ups are made of this data, and these are stored off site.

If you have any questions about the security on The Associated Board website, please send [an email to the Associated Board IT department](https://web.archive.org/web/20060616125857id_/http%3A//www.abrsm.org/%3Fpage%3Dhelp/privacyPolicy.html?page=process/contactform.html&id=28&contact=QXNzb2NpYXRlZCUyMEJvYWQlMjBJVCUyMERlcGFydG1lbnQ).
