### Administration of the ABR

The Registrar of the Australian Business Register is responsible for administering the ABR.

This responsibility includes:

  * registering new Australian business number (ABN) applications
  * registering and maintaining details about representatives of businesses that are registered under the _A New Tax System (Australian Business Number) Act 1999_ for the purpose of facilitating electronic dealings by businesses with government agencies
  * maintaining integrity of the register by ensuring records are current and accurate
  * providing the community with access to public data to assist them to verify core business identity and tax registration information, for example, whether an entity is registered for goods and services tax (GST)
  * providing eligible government agencies with access to details of registered ABN holders.



The Registrar is also the Commissioner of Taxation.

### Information we collect from you

We will request information from you when you: 

  * register for an Australian business number (ABN)
  * register for a non-individual tax file number (TFN)
  * apply for various tax roles, or
  * apply to register a representative on the ABR to obtain an AUSkey. 



We are authorised to do so by one or more of the following Acts on the basis that we are using the information to help us administer those Acts: 

  * _A New Tax System (Australian Business Number) Act 1999_
  * _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_
  * _A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999_
  * _A New Tax System (Wine Equalisation Tax) Act 1999_
  * _A New Tax System (Luxury Car Tax) Act 1999_
  * _Fuel Tax Act 2006_
  * _Energy Grants Credits Scheme Act 2003_
  * _Product Grants and Benefits Administration Act 2000_
  * _Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986_
  * _Taxation Administration Act 1953_
  * _Superannuation Industry (Superannuation) Act 1993._



We are authorised by the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ and by the _A New Tax System (Australian Business Number) Act 1999_ to ask for a tax file number (TFN) for identification purposes.

While you do not have to provide a TFN, your online application may fail if you don’t.

If there are other implications in not quoting your TFN in one of our online forms, we will let you know at the time you are completing the form.

If we request information from you by email, we will record your email address and it may be disclosed to our partner agencies, or be used for service of notices in relation to your ABR registrations.

### Information available to the public

Unless you apply to have your _[ABN suppressed](https://web.archive.org/content/17604.htm)_, some of your _[ABN details](https://web.archive.org/content/17859.htm)_ are available for anyone to search, free of charge, through ABN Lookup (a search facility hosted by **_[www.business.gov.au](https://web.archive.org/externalsite.asp?url=http://www.business.gov.au/)_**). 

### Information available to other government agencies

Government agencies may be given access to your _[ABN details](https://web.archive.org/content/17859.htm)_ (in accordance with the law). Each agency must properly justify the need for access to your details and enter into a partnership agreement with the Registrar of the Australian Business Register. _[ABR partners](https://web.archive.org/content/21035.htm)_ may use your ABN details for various purposes including registration, reporting, compliance, validation or updating of their databases.

Information relating to entities that have been refused an ABN is not made available to other government agencies.

### Information available to your business

People with an Administrator AUSkey or an ATO primary digital certificate for your business can access and update details at **[_www.abr.gov.au_](https://web.archive.org/externalsite.asp?url=http://www.abr.gov.au/)**

  * name
  * email
