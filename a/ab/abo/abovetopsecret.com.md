Nothing is more important to the owners and staff of AboveTopSecret.com, ATSnews.com, media.AboveTopSecret.com, BelowTopSecret.com, AbovePolitics.com, AboveNetwork.com and any other website(s) owned and operated by The Above Network, LLC (collectively the "Websites") than making every effort to protect the privacy, of all members. To better protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. 

This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the Websites. On some pages, you can specify personal profiles that may be viewable by other registered members of the Website. However, at no time do we collect your personal information such as name, address, or phone number, and we only require a functioning e-mail address for membership. At no time do we attempt to reconcile any information you provide (including your IP address as indicated below) with offline identity or other personal information. 

The Way We Use Information: 

We use the information you provided about yourself at registration to authorize your access when you post messages on our discussion forum. We also record the IP address you're using at the time of each posted messages. 

We use the e-mail address you provided to confirm your discussion board password and to notify you of any violations of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (hereinafter "DMCA") by one or more of your posts. Your address is not used for any additional purpose other than registration for the Website and/or email newsletter and will never be shared with outside parties and is not viewable by unregistered members. 

To receive newsletters and administrative emails (other than DMCA notifications), you must first respond in the affirmative to the opt-in notification email you will receive soon after joining the site or subscribing to the email newsletter service. If you do not opt-in, you will receive no newsletters or promotional emails. You may opt-out of the emails at any time by clicking the opt-out link in each email, replying to the email with the subject line "unsubscribe." 

We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our registration form, but we would never disclose anything that could be used to identify any specific individuals. 

The non-identifying aggregate information is not stored on any server owned by the Websites as we do not collect or store any log files of activity on our websites. Instead, we employ the Google Analytics software (which does set a cookie) to obtain traffic analysis data. 

Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above. Your profile information is protected from web-spiders that search for e-mail addresses and other personal information. We reserve the right to disclose any personally identifiable information associated with your account and/or posting history as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on The Above Network, LLC.

Affiliate Relationships and Service Providers: 

Certain partner websites (such as Cafepress.com and DisInfo.com) may provide additional content, features, and even shopping cart services for products carrying the Websites identity and/or content. While the URL subdirectory or subdomain for partner sites such as these may contain "abovetopsecret," you must be aware that these are separate companies with privacy policies that may be different from ours.

Our Commitment To The Privacy Of Children: 

Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.

Members are provided with a private messaging system as part of their account privileges.
