                        <p>Through its  National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign, the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) 
						created the AbovetheInfluence Web site to help teens become more aware of and assess influences around them, including drugs. We take 
						your privacy very seriously. In compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, and the online privacy guidelines of the 
						White House Office of Management and Budget, we do not sell, share or rent any personally identifying information about you.</p>
							
						<p><strong>COPPA</strong><br>
						We will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under  the age of 13, to remain consistent with the Children's 
						Online Privacy  Protection Act (COPPA) of 1998.</p>
						
						<p><strong>Information You Submit</strong><br>
						The information we receive depends upon what you do when visiting this site. If you  want to send us your comments, you will be asked to enter 
						a nickname or handle. </p>
						
						<p>If you choose to submit a request to the "Contact Us" submission page, we will request your  e-mail address only for the purpose of 
						responding. We do not store or share these e-mail  addresses and it is not required that an email address be entered here. </p>
						
						<p>If you  choose to submit a Creative Submission (message, photo, poetry, video etc.) to  the MOX section of the site, AbovetheInfluence.com will 
						adhere to the following  guidelines: </p>
						
						<p><strong>I.</strong> In order to submit a Creative Submission, we require following information: <br>
						Screen Name  (which is a nickname, NOT your legal name) <br>
						* If you  are an AOL user, please be sure to alter the screen name you submit to us,  because AOL screen names function as e-mail addresses too. <br>
						Age<br><br>
						The following registration information is optional: <br><br>
						State of Residence </p>
						
						<p>E-mail  address<br>
						(So we can  notify you if we publish your Creative Submission.)</p>

						<p>Please  note, none of the information we require through the registration process is  personally identifiable information. </p>
						
						<p><strong>II.</strong> To upload (electronically submit) your Creative Submission, you will not have  to reveal personally identifiable information. </p>
						
						<p>While your screen name and your state of residence may be collected if you upload a  creative submission to AbovetheInfluence.com, submissions that incorporate 
						any personally identifiable information will be immediately removed from consideration  for online posting. For the MOX photo and video submissions, AbovetheInfluence 
						may require an additional parental release to be signed.</p>
							
						<p>Any company  that helps us to run this Web site has signed an agreement indicating that they  will only use the anonymous information collected in aggregate for the 
						purposes  for which they were hired. </p>
						
						<p><strong>Information Collected and Stored  Automatically</strong><br>
						We do not  use cookies on the AbovetheInfluence Web site. (A "cookie" is a file  placed on your hard drive by a Web site that allows it to monitor your use of 
						the site, usually without your knowledge.) </p>
						
						<p>If you do  nothing during your visit but browse through the Web site, read pages, or  download information, we will gather and store certain information about your visit 
						automatically. This information does not identify you personally. We  automatically collect and store only the following information about your  visit. </p>
						
						<ul>
                          <li>The Internet domain (for example, "xcompany.com" if you use a private Internet access account, or "yourschool.edu" if you connect from a university's 
						  domain) and IP address (an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web) from which you access our Web site; </li>
						  <li>The type of browser and operating system used to access our site;</li>
						  <li>The date and time you access our site; </li>
						  <li>The pages you visit; and </li>
						  <li>If you linked to AbovetheInfluence.com from another Web site, the address of that Web site. </li>
					    </ul>
						
						<p>We use this  information to help us make our site more useful to visitors — to learn about  the number of visits to our site and the content accessed most frequently on 
						the Web site.</p>
						
						<p>On certain  Web pages, we may use a certain type of "cookie" - what is known as a "session"  cookie - to help you use our Web site interactively. Cookies 
						are data a Web  site can send to your browser. Session cookies (also known as session  variables) are kept in your browser's memory and are purged after your browser  session is over. 
						Session cookies are used to keep track of passwords,  preferences, orders, and various other aspects of a user's "session" within a  Web site. We may use session cookies to 
						improve your interaction with selected  pages on the site. We do not use session cookies to track or personally  identify users. Further, we do not make use of "persistent cookies" - 
						another  type of cookie that, when used, are stored on your hard drive and can be used  to track Web users over time and across Web sites. </p>
						
						<p>To protect  your privacy, be sure to close your browser completely after you have finished  conducting business with a Web site that uses cookies. If you are concerned  about the potential use 
						of information gathered from your computer by cookies,  you can set your browser to prompt you before it accepts a cookie. Most Internet  browsers have settings that let you identify and/or reject 
						cookies. These  settings are usually located under "Tools" on your browser toolbar.</p>
						
						<p><strong>How to Change or Modify Your Permission at Any Time</strong><br>
						If you wish  to remove your online submission from our Web site, you may e-mail us at <a href="mailto:contactus@abovetheinfluencemail.com" target="_blank">contactus@AbovetheInfluenceMail.com</a> or 
						write to AbovetheInfluence Coordinator:  1615 L Street NW, Suite 1000   Washington, DC   20036. Be sure to  clearly indicate your screen name, and a brief description of your submission. We will  retain 
						your e-mail address and any other information you provide only until  we've removed your submission. If we have questions about your correspondence  to our "remove submissions" mailbox, we may 
						write back to you one time for  further clarification. </p>
