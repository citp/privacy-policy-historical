# Privacy Policy - above the influence

Through its National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign, the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) created the AbovetheInfluence Web site to help teens become more aware of and assess influences around them, including drugs. We take your privacy very seriously. In compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, and the online privacy guidelines of the White House Office of Management and Budget, we do not sell, share or rent any personally identifying information about you.

**COPPA**   
We will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13, to remain consistent with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) of 1998.

**Information You Submit**  
The information we receive depends upon what you do when visiting this site. If you want to send us your comments, you will be asked to enter a nickname or handle. 

If you choose to submit a request to the "Contact Us" submission page, we will request your e-mail address only for the purpose of responding. We do not store or share these e-mail addresses and it is not required that an email address be entered here. 

If you choose to submit a Creative Submission (message, photo, poetry, video etc.) to the MOX section of the site, AbovetheInfluence.com will adhere to the following guidelines: 

**I.** In order to submit a Creative Submission, we require following information:   
Screen Name (which is a nickname, NOT your legal name)   
* If you are an AOL user, please be sure to alter the screen name you submit to us, because AOL screen names function as e-mail addresses too. 

Age

The following registration information is optional: 

State of Residence 

E-mail address  
(So we can notify you if we publish your Creative Submission.)

Please note, none of the information we require through the registration process is personally identifiable information. 

**II.** To upload (electronically submit) your Creative Submission, you will not have to reveal personally identifiable information. 

While your screen name and your state of residence may be collected if you upload a creative submission to AbovetheInfluence.com, submissions that incorporate any personally identifiable information will be immediately removed from consideration for online posting. For the MOX photo and video submissions, AbovetheInfluence may require an additional parental release to be signed.

Any company that helps us to run this Web site has signed an agreement indicating that they will only use the anonymous information collected in aggregate for the purposes for which they were hired. 

**Information Collected and Stored Automatically**  
We do not use cookies on the AbovetheInfluence Web site. (A "cookie" is a file placed on your hard drive by a Web site that allows it to monitor your use of the site, usually without your knowledge.) 

If you do nothing during your visit but browse through the Web site, read pages, or download information, we will gather and store certain information about your visit automatically. This information does not identify you personally. We automatically collect and store only the following information about your visit. 

  * The Internet domain (for example, "xcompany.com" if you use a private Internet access account, or "yourschool.edu" if you connect from a university's domain) and IP address (an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web) from which you access our Web site; 
  * The type of browser and operating system used to access our site;

Session cookies (also known as session variables) are kept in your browser's memory and are purged after your browser session is over. Session cookies are used to keep track of passwords, preferences, orders, and various other aspects of a user's "session" within a Web site. We may use session cookies to improve your interaction with selected pages on the site. We do not use session cookies to track or personally identify users. Further, we do not make use of "persistent cookies" - another type of cookie that, when used, are stored on your hard drive and can be used to track Web users over time and across Web sites. 

To protect your privacy, be sure to close your browser completely after you have finished conducting business with a Web site that uses cookies. If you are concerned about the potential use of information gathered from your computer by cookies, you can set your browser to prompt you before it accepts a cookie.
