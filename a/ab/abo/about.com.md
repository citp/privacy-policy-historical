# Privacy Policy | Dotdash

### Privacy Policy

Updated May 2, 2019

At Dotdash, we take online privacy seriously and we respect the privacy  
concerns of our community of users.  In this policy (the “Privacy  
Policy”), we describe how we collect, use, and share information obtained  
through your use of dotdash.com and its affiliated websites, email properties,  
and other online services, including without limitation, Verywell.com (and its  
affiliated websites), TheBalance.com (and its affiliated websites), Investopedia.com,  
Lifewire.com, TripSavvy.com, Byrdie.com, MyDomaine.com, TheSpruce.com (and its  
affiliated websites), liveabout.com, aboutespanol.com and ThoughtCo.com (collectively, the  
“Sites”), all of which are owned and operated by About, Inc.  
(“Dotdash”,  “we”, “us”, or “our”), to help you make informed  
decisions about how you share information when you visit or use the Sites as  
well as your rights in determining what we do with the information that we  
collect or hold about you.

This Privacy Policy only applies to properties we own and operate and  
does not cover any information collected via any other website, application, or  
service. We are not responsible for the privacy policies or privacy practices  
of third parties.  By using the Sites, you explicitly agree to the  
terms of this Privacy Policy. 

**Understanding How Information Is Collected:**

**Information You May Choose to Provide to Us**

We may collect information, including personal information, from you if  
you choose to provide that information. For example, you may provide us with  
your name and contact information (such as an email address), date of birth, or  
other details of that nature, when you sign up for our newsletters, participate  
in contests, sweepstakes, or other promotions on the Sites, or apply for a job  
with Dotdash.

You also may choose to provide personal information about yourself when  
you participate in surveys, forums or discussions, or other Interactive  
Services on the Sites. Please be aware that information you post may be viewed  
or captured by anyone who visits the Sites, therefore you should avoid posting  
sensitive or personal information that you would not want to be available to  
the public.

**Information That Is Automatically Collected  **

When you access the Sites, we and our third-party partners and service  
providers may automatically collect certain information from your device or  
web-browser about your visit using tools such as cookies, web beacons, and  
other data collecting and tracking technologies, to help us understand how our  
users use the Sites and to target advertising messages to you. We and our  
third-party partners and service providers may also collect and track  
information about your online activities over time and across different websites,  
applications, and devices using certain data matching techniques. The  
information collected automatically when you visit the Sites may include your  
IP address, characteristics of your operating system, information about your  
browser and system settings, data about the computer or mobile device you use  
to access the Sites, unique device identifiers, clickstream data (which shows  
the page-by-page path you take as you browse the Sites), and other information  
that generally is not considered personally identifiable.

**Cookies and Tracking Technologies** ** **

**Cookies**  are small files that many websites and other online services use to  
store information about users on the users’ own devices or computers. The Sites  
use cookies (such as HTTP and HTML5 cookies and Flash cookies), as well as  
other types of local storage in order to provide useful features to our users.  
For more information about cookies, you may visit [http://www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/). See the section below regarding Your choices to learn more  
about how you may limit or disable cookies on your computer. If you choose to  
disable cookies, that could affect your ability to use certain features of the  
Sites that use cookies to enhance their functionality. 

To manage our automatic data collection, we, and our third-party  
partners and service providers, use cookies or similar technologies on our sites to  
collect information that helps us improve the quality of sites and the online  
experience of our visitors and users. 

**Web** ******beacons**  are small files that link web pages to particular web servers and their  
cookies, and they may be used for a variety of purposes, such as counting the  
number of visitors to the Sites, analyzing how users navigate around the Sites,  
assessing how many emails that we send are actually opened and which articles  
or links are viewed by visitors.

We also use third-party web analytics services, such as Google  
Analytics, on the Sites to provide us with statistics and other information  
about visitors to the Sites.  [Click  
here to learn more about Google Analytics and how you may opt out.](http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html)

Finally, companies that provide certain third-party apps, tools,  
widgets, and plug-ins that may appear on the Sites (for example, Facebook  
“Like” or “Share” buttons), also may use automated means to collect information  
regarding your interactions with these features. This information collection is  
subject to the privacy policies or notices of those third parties. 

**“Do Not Track” Signals** **.**  Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a  
“do not track” signal to websites and online services you visit. At this time  
there is no consensus among industry participants as to the meaning of “do not  
track” in this context. Like many other websites, the Sites are not configured  
to respond to “do not track” signals from browsers. [Click here to learn more about “do not  
track” signals.](https://allaboutdnt.com/)

**Information We Obtain From Other Sources**

We may supplement the information we collect with information from  
third-party partners and service providers, including data brokers, customer  
acquisition vendors, and other companies that collect contact and consumer  
information such as demographic and interest data, in order to learn more about  
our users, better tailor the content and offers we make available to you, and  
for other lawful business purposes.  We may combine the information  
we receive from those other (online and offline) sources with information we collect  
through the Sites. 

**Social Network and Platform Integration**

The Sites may be integrated with social media networks and other  
platforms whereby information may be shared between us and those platforms. For  
instance, if you interact with our Sites through a social media feature such as  
a plug-in, then you may be granting us on-going access to certain information  
from that social media account.  If you do not want a social media  
platform to collect or share information about you, please review the privacy  
policy and privacy settings of the applicable social media property before  
using such features on our Sites. 

**How We May Use Information We Collect**

We, and our  
third-party partners and service providers, may use the information gathered on  
the Sites for various purposes, including the purposes listed  
below.  For example, if you were to contact us with a question and  
provide your email address, we would use the email address you provided to  
respond to your inquiry. In addition, we use information we collect from you  
and through the Sites to:

address and use such match to deliver custom offers or emails to you on the  
Sites and elsewhere online; 

·      With third parties who  
provide services on our behalf to help with our business activities such as commenting
