# Privacy & Policy guidelines of AboutSSL.org

This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how their ‘Personally identifiable information’ (PII) is being used online. PII, as used in US privacy law and information security, is information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context. Under the EU’s GDPR this is just referred to as personal data. Please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your Personally Identifiable Information/Personal Data in accordance with our website.

## Privacy Policy Statement: AboutSSL.ORG

**What personal information do we collect from the people that visit our website?**  
We do not collect any information from site visitors outside of anonymized analytics data. We do collect personal data from writer submissions, either via email or the forms on our website.

**When do we collect information?**  
We collect information when you submit an SSL review, either using one of the forms on the website or via email.

**How do we use your information?**  
We may use the information we collect from in the following ways:

• To personalize user’s experience and to allow us to deliver the type of content you are most interested.  
• To improve our website in order to better serve you.

**How do we protect visitor information?**  
In addition to abiding NIST and CAB Forum best practices for security, your personal information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of persons who have special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential.

We implement a variety of security measures when a user enters, submits, or accesses their information to maintain the safety of your personal information.

**Do we use ‘cookies’?**  
Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the site’s or service provider’s systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information. We use cookies under the basis of our legitimate interests to help us compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future.

You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser (like Internet Explorer) settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser’s Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies.

If you disable cookies, some features will be disabled and some of our services will not function properly.

**Third Party Disclosure**  
We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information.

**Third party links**  
Occasionally, at our discretion, we may advertise third-party products or services on our website. These third-party sites have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our site and welcome any feedback about these sites.

**Google**  
Google’s advertising requirements can be summed up by Google’s Advertising Principles. They are put in place to provide a positive experience for users.

We have not enabled Google AdSense on our site, but we may do so in the future.

**California Online Privacy Protection Act**  
CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. See more at: <https://consumercal.org/about-cfc/cfc-education-foundation/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa-3/>

**According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:**  
Users will be notified of any privacy policy changes:  
• On our Privacy Policy Page  
Users are able to change their personal information:  
• By emailing us

**How does our site handle do not track signals?**  
We honor do not track signals and do not track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.

**COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)**  
When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 13, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, the nation’s consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children’s privacy and safety online.

We do not specifically market to children under 13.

**Your Right to be Forgotten**  
We extend the data rights provided by the GDPR to all customers and clients. That means that you have the right to modify or delete the personal data we have collected about you. Typically, you can modify or delete the personal data we have stored on you by logging into your reseller account. Failing that, simply email us, either requesting a copy of the information we have collected about you – which can then be revised and returned – or the deletion of it. We will handle the request within 72 hours.

**Contacting Us**
