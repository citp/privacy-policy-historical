## Privacy Policy

AboutOne’s Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand how we collect and use the personal information you decide to share and help you make informed decisions when using AboutOne, located at go.aboutone.com. By using or accessing AboutOne, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy.

## 

## Collection of Personal Information from Site Users

You must provide your email address to create your AboutOne account.

Once you have registered, we collect other personally identifiable information about you in order to set up your account and serve you. You will be able to add additional information about yourself such as your name, gender, and marital status. You will be able to add information to your profile regarding your house (including the year it was built, size, bedrooms, phone number, date purchased, price, and the realtor). You may provide education information about yourself or your child (including the school attended and the type of education). You also have the option to upload a photo of yourself and each of your family members. **Please note that all content you enter or upload to the site cannot be viewed by anyone other than yourself or another user you choose as an administrator of your data (such as a spouse or caregiver).**

You are able to provide information about your family members as you start adding them to your profile. We collect your family member’s name, gender, relationship to you, and marital status. Adding information about yourself or family members is optional and you may correct, update or delete this information at any time. Please see “Access to and Ability to Correct Personal Data” section below.

If you sign up for our Premium or Premium Plus services, we will collect your name, email address, billing address, and credit card information including credit card number, expiration date, and CVV code. We use this information for the sole purpose of billing for your membership. Although we are PCI compliant, we do not store billing details; we leverage a third party provider (PayPal). Prior to billing cycles, we will send you an alert that it’s time to renew your membership (monthly or yearly).

#### Your Birth Information

Within the Birth Information section of the site, you are able to enter your birth name, date of birth, weight, length, time of birth, blood type, eye color, hair color, where you were born, and the doctor who delivered you. You also have the option to upload a baby picture of yourself. We collect this information for the sole purpose of allowing you to store it within your profile and optionally print to a hard copy baby book.

#### Collecting Third Party Personal Information from Users

You have the opportunity to add contacts within your account. You can store their name, email address, date of birth, wedding anniversary, business contact information, photos, addresses, notes, and any linked documents. The AboutOne team does not have any access to this information and cannot use this information in any way. The information is collected for the sole purpose of allowing you to store it in your account.

Like many web sites, we may also automatically receive general information that is contained in our server log files such as your IP address and cookie information. Subject to the foregoing, AboutOne.com may collect or track (1) the home server domain names, type of client computer, files downloaded, search engine used, operating system, and type of Web browser of visitors to the Site, (2) information knowingly provided by the visitor in online forms, registration forms, e-mail, and other online avenues (including, without limitation, demographic and personal profile data), and (3) aggregate user-specific information regarding which pages Site visitors access. AboutOne.com may place Internet “cookies” on visitors’ hard drives. Internet cookies save data about individual visitors, such as the visitor’s name, password, user-name, screen preferences, and the pages of a site viewed by the visitor. This information is collected solely for use when revisiting our site to ease data entry. No data will be shared. When the visitor revisits the site, go.aboutone.com may recognize the visitor by the Internet cookie and customize the visitor’s experience accordingly. Visitors may decline Internet cookies, if any, by using the appropriate feature of their web client software, if available. When a visitor performs a search within the go.aboutone.com, go.aboutone.com without limitation, may record information identifying the visitor or linking the visitor to the search performed such as their IP address. go.aboutone.com may also record limited demographic information for every search request and use that information to solve technical problems with the services available directly or indirectly in connection with the Site and to calculate overall usage statistics.

The use of cookies by third parties is not covered by our privacy statement. We do not have access or control over these cookies. These third parties use session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site.

#### Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)

Our third party advertising partners and affiliates may employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information.

Aggregate data on visitors’ home servers may be used for internal purposes, and individually identifying information, such as names, postal and e-mail addresses, phone numbers, and other personal information which visitors voluntarily provide to go.aboutone.com, may be added to go.aboutone.com’s databases and used for future calls and mailings regarding site updates, new products and services, and upcoming events. go.aboutone.com also may use site visitor data to contact the site visitors regarding account status and changes to the subscriber agreement (if applicable), Privacy Policy, and any other policies or agreements relevant to site visitors. AboutOne employees do not have access to your individual data, but can run summarized user reports as a way to better offer you services. go.aboutone.com employees will never, under any circumstance, have access to any of the data in your go.aboutone.com Lock Box.
