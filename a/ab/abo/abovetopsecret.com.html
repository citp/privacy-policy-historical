 <br>
Our member's privacy is important to us.  To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the
choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. <br>
 <br>
The Information We Collect:  <br>
 <br>
This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the AboveTopSecret.com website. On some pages, you can specify personal profiles that
may be viewable by other registered members of this website. However, at no time do we collect your personal information such as name, address, or
phone number, and only require a functioning e-mail address for membership. <br>
 <br>
The Way We Use Information:  <br>
 <br>
We use the information you provide about yourself when you post messages on our discussion forum. We record IP addresses at the time of each posted
messages. <br>
 <br>
We use the e-mail address you provided to confirm your discussion board password and to send you notifications that someone has responded to messages
for which you have subscribed.  Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.  <br>
 <br>
We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser
that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our registration form,
but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify any individuals.  <br>
 <br>
Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above. Your
profile information is protected from web-spiders that search for e-mail addresses, and AboveTopSecret.com will never release your e-mail address
unless specifically asked by law enforcement. <br>
 <br>
Our Commitment To Data Security  <br>
 <br>
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical,
electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.  <br>
 <br>
Our Commitment To Children's Privacy:  <br>
 <br>
Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important.  For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those
we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.  <br>
 <br>
How You Can Access Or Correct Your Information  <br>
 <br>
You can access all your profile information that we collect online and maintain by AboveTopSecret.com. We use this procedure to better safeguard your
information. Use the "Control Panel" link in the top-right of the discussion board menu-bar. <br>
 <br>
To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.  <br>
 <br>
How To Contact Us  <br>

Should you have other questions or concerns about these privacy policies, please send us an email at simon.gray@abovetopsecret.com for the website
