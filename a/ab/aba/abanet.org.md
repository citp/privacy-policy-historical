# Privacy Policy

## American Bar Association

The American Bar Association (ABA) respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how the ABA collects, uses and safeguards information on _www.americanbar.org_ , and any other websites operated by the ABA from time to time (the “Site” or “Sites”).  This Privacy Policy applies **only** to information collected by the ABA through its Sites.

### Changes to the Privacy Policy

As the ABA, its membership and benefits change from time to time, this Privacy Policy is expected to change as well. We reserve the right to amend the Privacy Policy at any time, for any reason.  The date of the last revision to the Privacy Policy will be indicated by the "Last updated" date at the bottom of this page.

If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, please email us at [customercare@americanbar.org](mailto:customercare@americanbar.org).  Please note that we cannot process opt-out requests sent to this e-mail address.

### What information we collect and how we use it

 **Information we collect** – When you browse the Sites and do not interact for any online service or product from the ABA, we do not collect personally identifiable information, such as your name, address, phone number and e-mail address.

When you become a registered user on our Sites or provide personally identifying information on our Sites, such as subscribing to ABA publications, purchasing an ABA product, applying for ABA membership, participating in online surveys, submitting questions or comments or requesting information or materials, we will retain certain personal information from you.  The type of personal information collected will vary but may include name, address, phone number, birth date, billing and delivery information, e-mail address, credit card or other financial account information and other demographic information. The type of information you provide will determine the personal information that is collected.

 **Tracking activity on our Sites** – We use your IP address, cookies and tags to track user behavior on our Sites and to make usability improvements.  We also use cookies to maintain user session identity, and, in some non-member areas, to store your username and password locally for ease of access.

  * "Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in the future.
  * A unique number called an IP address identifies every computer on the Internet. Each time you connect to the Internet your machine is assigned an IP address. An IP address is a number that identifies each sender or receiver of information that is sent in packets across the Internet.
  * “Tags” refer to scripts that are used to track a visitor’s activity on our Sites by web analytics software.  A visitor’s activity is anonymous if he/she is not logged in.  If she/he has logged in using their username and password, additional information is passed through these tags.  Tags are used for, but not limited to, determining effectiveness of the Sites design, information architecture, and consumption of information and services provided via the Sites.



 **How we use personal information** – Once collected, we may use your personal information (except for e-mail address, which is described below) for the following purposes:

  * Register you for programs and services you have requested
  * Process, fulfill and follow up on your orders or membership application
  * Answer your e-mails or on-line requests
  * Send information that you requested
  * Send and process surveys
  * Ensure the Sites are relevant to your needs
  * Deliver ABA services such as newsletters, meetings or events
  * Communicate general substantive information about the ABA
  * Notify you about new products/services special offers, upgrades and other related information from the ABA and other approved third parties. 



 **Publication of your personal information for Membership Directories and Registration Lists** – As a professional organization representing the legal profession, the personal information you provide may be published on the Sites and in print form in a variety of ways to allow other lawyers and the public to find you, including, but not limited to directories, membership lists, and other types of registration lists for ABA program and events (“Directory Lists”).  Directory Lists will not include financial information, such as credit card or bank information, or social security numbers. 

 **E-mail Policy** – Your e-mail address will only be used within the ABA and its entities. We do not sell or rent e-mail addresses to anyone outside the ABA.  For some e-mail messages distributed by the ABA and its entities, specific information on recipient response is collected. For example, we sometimes review how many recipients open and subsequently choose to click through to links provided in an e-mail message. We use this information only for the purposes of analyzing areas of interest, improving our products and enhancing the usefulness of our Sites for ABA members and other visitors. None of this information is sold or distributed outside of the ABA in any manner.

 **How To Manage the Communications You Receive By E-mail** – You can manage your E-mail preferences, including opting out, by [going here](http://apps.americanbar.org/aba_timssnet/demographics/aba_addressupdate.cfm) or by calling our Service Center at 1-800-285-2221.

 **With whom we may share information** – The ABA may share personal information with our business associates in order to provide them an opportunity to offer products or services that may be of interest to you. The ABA also occasionally hires other companies to provide limited services on our behalf including, but not limited to, packaging, mailing and delivering purchases and promotional offers, answering customer questions about products or services, consulting services, data modeling, printing, sending postal mail and processing event registration. We will only provide those companies the information they need to deliver the service.   

The ABA may disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process served on the ABA; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of ABA; or (c) protect the personal safety of ABA personnel or members of the public in urgent circumstances.

 **How To Manage the Communications You Receive By Regular Mail –** The ABA makes a list of names and addresses available to carefully screened companies and organizations, which helps contribute to non-dues dollars to the ABA. However, if you prefer to receive mailings only from the ABA and have your name and address removed from the list provided to these companies and organizations, please call the ABA Service Center at 1-800-285-2221 or write to:  321 North Clark Street, Chicago, IL 60654-7598. 

 **Banner advertisements on our Sites** – Online advertisements on the Sites do not collect any personally identifiable information on individual visitors. The ABA does collect aggregate data on visitors such as time of day and Web browser type. Such information may be shared with advertisers to determine their advertising effectiveness.

### Children 

 ****We do not knowingly solicit data online from or market online to children under the age of 13.

### Information security 

The ABA implements commercially reasonable security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. We restrict access to personal information to the ABA’s business partners who may need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations. ****

### User ID and password 

Certain areas of the Site require the use of a user ID, email address and password as an additional security measure that helps protect your information.

When you have finished using a secure area of a Site, make sure you always click on the "Sign Out" link which appears on every secure page. When you click on the "Sign Out" link, your secured session will end. No further secure transactions can be conducted without re-entering your user ID and password. You should be aware that browser software often "caches" a page as you look at it, meaning that some pages are saved in your computer's temporary memory. Therefore, you may find that clicking on your "Back" button shows you a saved version of a previously viewed page. Caching in no way affects the security of your confidential user ID or password.

### No guarantee

 ****Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Accordingly, and despite our efforts, the ABA cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, or to or from our online products or services.

###  **Linking to other Internet sites**  

You should be aware that other Internet sites that are linked from the Sites or from an ABA e-mail message may contain privacy provisions that differ from the provisions of this Internet Privacy Policy. To ensure your privacy is protected, we recommend that you review the privacy statements of other Internet sites you visit from the ABA.

### How you can access and change information

 ****If you are a registered user of the Site, subscriber to ABA publications, purchaser of ABA products and services or an ABA member, you may review and update/correct your information by using your user ID or email address and password or by contacting the ABA Service Center at 1-800-285-2221.
