Abazias.com will only use your email address or contact information to notify you or to provide valid information about your potential purchase. Your email address or contact information will never be sold to another company or used for unsolicited (SPAM) email.

Security measures

Abazias.com is committed to ensuring a safe ordering process to protect you from identity theft and illegal purchases. Whenever you are asked to input sensitive information such as your contact information or credit card number, we use SSL encryption to ensure that your data is protected. While visiting an SSL encrypted web page, a lock icon will appear at the bottom of your browser. You can click on this lock icon to learn more about our site and the measures that we are taking to ensure your privacy.

Fraud protection

During our checkout process, we employ several methods to protect you against online fraud and identity theft. First, we use the latest Address Verification System (AVS) to ensure that the address entered during checkout is the same as the address you have listed with your bank. We also employ the use of CVV2 code verification (your credit card identification code) to ensure that the credit card used is present during the time of purchase. Most importantly, however, is that we always contact and discuss the order with you before we capture any funds. We will never capture any funds during our online order process. We only authorize the card for available funds at the time of order. **We will never charge your credit card or ship an order without discussing it with you first.**
