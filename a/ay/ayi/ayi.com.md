Some of the personal information that you provide may include sensitive personal information, such as race or ethnicity or sexual preferences (such as whether you are looking for a male or female to connect with).

**THIS IS WHAT WE DO WITH THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU**

We primarily use personal information you provide to help other users find and connect with you and to help you connect with other users. If you want to update this information you can visit [your profile](https://www.firstmet.com/my-profile/) at any time to do so. If you specifically desire, we will use your social networking data to allow you to create an account with data you have on another site.

**LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING PERSONAL INFORMATION (EEA FIRSTMET USERS)** ** **

If you are a FirstMet service user from the European Economic Area, our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.

However, we will normally collect personal information from you only (i) where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you (i.e. to provide the FirstMet services), (ii) where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your rights, (iii) where you have made the personal information public, or (iv) where we have your consent to do so. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you or may otherwise need the personal information to protect your vital interests or those of another person (e.g. if we become aware that an individual is contemplating self-harm or harm to others).

If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information).

If we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), this interest will normally be to operate our platform and communicate with you as necessary to provide our services to you and for our legitimate commercial interest, for instance, when responding to your queries, improving our platform, undertaking marketing, or for the purposes of detecting or preventing illegal activities. We may have other legitimate interests and if appropriate we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.

If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information, please contact us using the contact details provided under the “Contacting us is easy and we want to hear from you” heading below.

**FOR USERS IN THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA, HERE ARE YOUR RIGHTS** ** **

We think it is important that you are able to control your personal information.

_For our users in the European Economic Area who are protected by the General Data Protection Regulation (or “GDPR”):_

You have the right to ask us not to process your personal information for marketing purposes. You can exercise your right to prevent such processing at any time by contacting us at [here](https://app-eu.onetrust.com/app/#/webform/ce30a1ff-80a5-47fc-a691-c10d6eb31666).

[View Data Subject Access Request Form](https://app-eu.onetrust.com/app/#/webform/ce30a1ff-80a5-47fc-a691-c10d6eb31666)

The GDPR gives you the right to request a copy of the personal information we hold about you. We may request additional information about you to verify your identity before we do such. We will supply, correct or delete personal information about you on our files. In addition, you  can object to processing of your personal information, may request rectification, portability or erasure of personal information as well as the restriction of processing of your personal information. We will comply with your requests in accordance with the GDPR and applicable local law in Europe.

If we have collected and process your personal information with your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.

If you have a complaint about the processing of your personal information you have the right to complain to a data protection authority. However, if you do have a complaint, you can always contact us so we can try to resolve your complaint.

**ARBITRATION FOR USERS OUTSIDE OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA**

If you are a user who is not in the European Economic Area, any disputes under this Privacy Notice will be resolved in accordance with binding arbitration as outlined in the [Terms of Service](https://www.firstmet.com/terms-of-service/).

**DATA RETENTION**

We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements).

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

_For our users outside of the European Economic Area who are not covered under GDPR:_

You may contact our support staff at [help@firstmet.com](mailto:help@firstmet.com) who will work with you to answer questions and take action to protect your privacy.

**THIRD PARTY WEBSITES ACCESSED FROM FIRSTMET** ** **

FirstMet may contain links to and from the websites of third parties. If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites will have their own privacy notices which will govern use of any personal information that they process. Please check these notices carefully before you click on any links and/or submit any personal information to these websites.

**CHANGES TO OUR POLICY**

Any changes we may make to this Privacy Notice will be posted on this page. Where it makes sense because the changes are material, we will notify you by e-mail or in another appropriate manner such as when you next interact with FirstMet.

**TARGETING AND TRACKING**

We may use Tracking Technologies to deliver content, including ads, relevant to your interests on the Services and third party sites based on how you interact with our advertisements or content, and to track the content you access.

To better understand your purchasing preferences, we may also use third party vendors that provide tracking tools that recognize and collect usage and interest information across the sites you’ve visited from your various Devices. When you visit the Services on a specific Device, a unique ID is created for that Device which may be based on your hashed (de-identified) email address. This allows us and our third party vendors to deliver relevant product recommendations, personalized content and advertising to you based on your interests gathered across multiple sites. This data may be combined with the same information from another browser or Device if you use multiple browsers or Devices. Third party tracking tools might also obtain information about other applications that you have downloaded to your mobile Device, the websites you visit and other information about you or your Device in order to analyze and serve anonymous targeted advertising on the Services and elsewhere.

**INTERNET ADVERTISING**

We or our advertising partners may use Tracking Technologies to collect Information about your visits over time and across the Services and other third-party websites, and combine that information with other information received from other sources, in order to serve more targeted advertising to you. For example, we use Google interest based cookies to serve personalized ads to you. Our ad partners automatically receive your IP address or Device identifier when this happens. Their tools may also limit the number of times you see the same ad and help measure the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns. These third parties may also use information gathered from your use of the Services to serve targeted, interest based advertisements from other advertisers to you on third-party websites and applications.

The Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) has also made available for consumers tools on which you can register your choices not to be tracked by participating advertising networks or companies in the collection and use of your online activities. These are (1) The DAA [Consumer Choice Page for Mobile Web ](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/)(at [http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ ](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/)) and (2) DAA [AppChoices ](http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices)(at <http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices>), which is a mobile app that allows you to opt out of the collection and use of cross-app data, other than for permitted uses, by listed third-party AppChoices participants. You may opt out of mobile-app targeted advertising ads from any or all of the listed participating advertising networks. You can download the free mobile app from an app store available on your mobile platform. When you opt out with a particular participating advertising network, the mobile app adds your device identifier to that participant’s opt-out list. The participant advertising network is then notified to block the device identifiers on the opt-out list.

You can also prevent your receipt of interest-based ads on websites by deleting and declining cookies in your browser(s). Note that your opt-out choice is applied only to the browser from which you make the choice.

Some newer mobile device operating systems allow you to limit the use of information to deliver interest-based advertising in mobile applications, or your mobile web browser may provide a “Do Not Track” browser setting which will notify those ad servers and networks who recognize the signals to refrain from sending you interest based ads to your mobile device. You can check the settings on your device for such options in your device’s operating system. Alternatively, you may wish to download the TrustE mobile application and/or the Digital Alliance “App Choices” mobile application and follow the instructions provided.

If you opt-out of receiving targeted ads on our Services, you may continue to receive advertising and promotional messages after you opt-out, but they will not be customized or personalized to you based on your use of our Services.
