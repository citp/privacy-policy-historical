At ARI, we take the privacy of our visitors and members very seriously. Please read this Privacy Policy to learn more about how we treat personally identifiable information. We provide this Privacy Policy because you have a right to know what information we collect and with what methods, how it is protected and used and the circumstances under which it may be disclosed.

**DATA PRIVACY BEST PRACTICES IN THE UNITED STATES**

While there is no comprehensive framework in the United States regulating data privacy practices on the Internet, ARI has modeled its Privacy Policy on the data privacy best practices promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission's Fair Information Practice Principles, currently available [here](https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/reports/privacy-online-fair-information-practices-electronic-marketplace-federal-trade-commission-report/privacy2000text.pdf), the Generally Accepted Privacy Principles (GAPP), available [here](http://www.aicpa.org/interestareas/informationtechnology/resources/privacy/generallyacceptedprivacyprinciples/downloadabledocuments/gapp_bus_%200909.pdf), and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD) Guidelines on the Protection of Data Privacy, available [here](http://www.oecd.org/internet/ieconomy/oecdguidelinesontheprotectionofprivacyandtransborderflowsofpersonaldata.htm). 

**DATA PRIVACY BEST PRACTICES IN THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU)**

Since before the new EU Privacy Shield, ARI modeled its Privacy Policy on the data privacy best practices promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission's Fair Information Practice Principles, currently available [here](https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/reports/privacy-online-fair-information-practices-electronic-marketplace-federal-trade-commission-report/privacy2000text.pdf), the Generally Accepted Privacy Principles (GAPP), available [here](http://www.aicpa.org/interestareas/informationtechnology/resources/privacy/generallyacceptedprivacyprinciples/downloadabledocuments/gapp_bus_%200909.pdf), and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD) Guidelines on the Protection of Data Privacy, available [here](http://www.oecd.org/internet/ieconomy/oecdguidelinesontheprotectionofprivacyandtransborderflowsofpersonaldata.htm). 

As of October 6, 2015, the European Court of Justice invalidated the Safe Harbor Framework in the decision _Maximillian Schrems v. Data Protection Commissioner_ (Case C-362/14).

On February 2, 2016, the EU and US announced a new data transfer deal, the EU-US Privacy Shield. As ARI receives further information on compliance with this new program, ARI will ensure it meets its standards. ARI retains and reiterates its commitment to Internet user privacy for users across the globe.

The following are ARI’s promises to each User:

(1)     **Notice.** When ARI collects your personal information, we give you timely and appropriate notice describing what personal information we are collecting, how we will use it and the types of third parties with whom we may share it. This notice is located in this policy. 

(2)     **Choice.** ARI will give you choices about the ways we use and share your personal information, and we will respect the choices you make. Please recognize that ARI is a system that provides many links to third party sites and, as such, we advise and encourage them to take appropriate action with respect to their own privacy standards.

(3)     **Relevance.** ARI will collect only as much personal information as is required to meet the specific, identified purposes as listed in this Policy, and we will not use it for other purposes without obtaining your consent.

(4)     **Retention.** ARI will keep your personal information only as long as we need it for the purposes for which we collect it, or as permitted by law.

(5)     **Accuracy.** ARI will take appropriate steps to make sure your personal information in our records is accurate, as much as is within the power of ARI.

(6)     **Access.** ARI will provide ways for you to access your personal information as quickly as possible upon request, as required by law, so you can correct inaccuracies. Please use the address below to request access to your information.

(7)     **Security.** ARI will take appropriate physical, technical and organizational measures to protect your personal information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration, and destruction. 

(8)     **Sharing.** Except as described herein, ARI will not share your personal information with third parties without your consent. 

(9)     **International Transfer.** If ARI is used to transfer your personal information to another country, ARI will take appropriate measures to protect your privacy and the personal information transferred.

(10)     **Enforcement.** ARI will regularly review how we are meeting these privacy promises, and we provide an independent way to resolve complaints about our privacy practices (see below).
