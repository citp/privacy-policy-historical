    * **User hosted data** – In providing a Service we host or may have access to user data, in the context of providing customer support services to users about their network environment. Such data is processed only under instructions of the user who remains the data controller to the extent any personal data is processed.



_Cookies and similar technologies:_

Auvik uses cookies and other similar technologies such as pixel tags, web beacons device-IDs (together “cookies”) to collect and store certain information. Cookies are small data files that are saved to your Device when you visit the Site and use the Services. Auvik may use both “session” cookies and “persistent” cookies. A session cookie is only active while you are on the Site or Service and is deleted once you close your browser. Unlike a session cookie, a persistent cookie is not deleted when you close your browser and will persist on your Device for longer.

Auvik uses cookies to identify when you return to the Site, save login information (but never passwords) associated with authenticating access to a Service, track usage statistics, and store your preferences across the Site and the Service. By default, most browsers will automatically accept cookies, but by altering your browser’s settings, you can either disable cookies completely or be prompted prior to a cookie being loaded. Consult each individual browser’s “help” feature for more information.

We use cookies and similar technologies where they are necessary on the grounds of the performance of a contract with you where we are authenticating you as an authorized user of a Service provided by us on behalf of your organization as our customer or because using cookies is in our legitimate interests, (where we have considered that these are not overridden by your rights) in the case of cookies that are strictly necessary for the operation of our Site and Services and in other cases where you have consented to their use as described further below:

_Strictly necessary cookies:_ These are cookies that are required for the operation of our Site or our Services under our terms with you. They include the cookies that enable you to log-in to our Services or secure areas of our Site.

_Analytics:_ Portions of the Site and Services also use analytical tools (collectively, “ **Analytical Tools** ”) that are operated by us and third-party providers, such as Google Inc., which may use cookies, web beacons, scripts, and similar means for the purpose of collecting information and analyzing how you use the Site and our Services. Information collected using Analytical Tools will be transmitted and stored on servers located in the United States. The third-party providers of Analytical Tools may also transfer this information to other third parties (such as governmental authorities) where they are required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on their behalf. As some Analytical Tools rely on cookies to perform their functions, you can opt out of Google Analytics. [tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout](http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

_Google Display Advertising:_ The Site also uses Google Display Advertising. Google Display Advertising enables features in the Google Analytics service that are not available through the standard implementation. These additional features enable Retargeting with Google Analytics, Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting, Google Display Network Impression Reporting and the DoubleClick Campaign Manager integration.  
Implementing Retargeting with Google Analytics means that third-party vendors, including Google, may show our ads on websites across the internet. Auvik and third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to inform, optimize, and serve ads to you when you are visiting other websites based on your past visits to our Site.

Implementing Google Display Network Impression Reporting and the DoubleClick Campaign Manager means that Auvik and third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to report how our ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to visits to our Site.

The data we gather from Google’s Interest-based advertising or third-party audience data (such as age, gender, and interests) through Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting is used to better understand the demographic to which our services appeal so that we can display our ads to those who would benefit from our Services and not to those who would not benefit.

If you would like to opt out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising and customize Google Display Network ads, you can do so by going to [www.google.com/settings/ads](http://www.google.com/settings/ads).

You can also learn more about turning off advertising cookies by visiting [www.youronlinechoices.eu](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/)
