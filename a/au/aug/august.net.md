# InReach :: DSL, VoIP, Data and Internet Services for Business and Residential

|  | 

To provide your business with Internet services, we need to have certain confidential information to establish and maintain your account. We keep your information secure and confidential through a number of different safeguards. This notice will explain the kinds of information we keep, how we protect it, and who may see it.

## The Information We Have, Where We Get It And How We Use It

You provide us with most of the information we need to establish your account. This may include, but is not limited to, name, address and credit card numbers or automatic bill payment information. We use this information mainly to create a customer record, helping us to provide the various services you have selected when you call our office with questions and service requests.

We may also use our internal records to suggest adjustments to your account, as well as suggest additional products and services that could ultimately save you money.

## Internet Privacy

Our website enables you to access and pay your bill online, as well as view and verify your contact information. We may collect certain non-personally identifiable information when you visit our website such as the type of browser you are using and the type of operating system you are using. 

Like most company websites, we utilize "cookies," which are text files placed in your computer's browser to store your preferences. Your e-mail address or other personally identifiable information may be linked to the data stored in your cookies. This helps us to understand how our website is used and improves our content by using cookies to personalize your experience. 

We may also use cookies to suggest adjustments to your account and offer new products and services. 

## Restricting Access To Your Information

We have strict policies that govern employee access to customer records. We utilize customer information for authorized business purposes only and make sure that your records are accessed only by employees whose specific jobs require them to access such records. In addition, we instruct our employees about their duty to maintain the privacy of customer information.

## Disclosure of Your Information

We keep the records of services you purchase private and will not disclose such information to third parties without your permission. We do not sell mailing list information or e-mail addresses to third parties and you can be assured that all of your credit card and banking numbers are kept private and secure. However, certain circumstances require us to disclose customer information without your permission. For example, we will release customer information when cooperating with local and national law enforcement officials during investigations of fraud, harassment and other forms of criminal activity and we may provide information about current and former customers to collection agencies for the purpose of recovering amounts due to us that are in arrears. We will also disclose information to protect our rights or property and to protect others from fraudulent, abusive or unlawful use of our services.
