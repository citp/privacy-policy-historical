# Augusta.com - Ulitmate source of news, information, and entertainment for Augusta, Georgia.

**Privacy Policy**

**An Overview:**  
  Augusta.com is strongly committed to protecting the privacy of users of its interactive products and services. The purpose of this privacy policy is to inform what kinds of information we may gather about you when you visit our products, how we may use that information and whether we disclose it to anyone.  
   In general, our service automatically gathers certain usage information like the numbers and frequency of visitors, very much like television ratings that tell the networks how many people tuned in to a program. We only use such data in the aggregate. This collective data helps us determine how much our customers use parts of the site, so we can improve our site to assure that it is as appealing as we can make it for as many of you as possible. We do not collect personally identifiable information to tell us who you are or what your e-mail address is.  
   We also may provide statistical "ratings" information, never information about you personally, to our advertising partners about how our members, collectively, use Augusta.com. We do this so they too can understand how much people use their areas and our site in order for them to provide you with the best possible Web experience as well. 

**Information About You:**  
   Sometimes, we may specifically ask for information about you when you sign up to use a service or when you order a product. We will need certain information -- such as name, e-mail address, billing address, credit card number -- in order to provide that service or product to you. We may also use that information to let you know of additional products and services about which you might be interested. For example, if you sign up for our "Nothing But Net" college NCAA contest one year, we may e-mail about a similar service. You can choose not to receive such information any time by e-mailing a request to [webmaster@augusta.com](mailto:webmaster@augusta.com). 

**Disclosure :**  
  We do not use or disclose information about your individual visits to or information that you may give us, such as your name, address, email address or telephone number, to any outside companies, with one exception. We have to provide the information you provide us when you order a product to the business that will fulfill the order.
