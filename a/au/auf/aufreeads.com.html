<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p><b>General</b></p>

<p>USNetAds LLC takes your privacy
seriously. We utilize safe, secure technology to protect your personally
identifiable information. This Privacy Policy describes how we treat the personal information
that we collect and receive through our websites.
We value your trust in us and will work hard to earn your confidence, so that you

<p><b>Information We Collect and How It Is Used</b></p>

<p>Like most standard web servers, our websites use log files to

are interested in your products or services. You may put your contact
information inside your ad description. However, you understand that ad

when other users view your ad details, and that our website pages may be linked by third party
websites or search engines. You agree that we may send you email using your email
address if provided when the users viewing your ad want to contact you by using
our email system.</p>
