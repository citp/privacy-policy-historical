These cookies are used to collect information about traffic to our Sites and how users use our Sites. The information gathered may include the number of visitors to our Sites, the websites that referred them to our Site, the pages they visited on our Sites, what time of day they visited our Sites, whether they have visited our Sites before, and other similar information.  We use this information to help operate our Sites more efficiently, to gather broad demographic information, monitor the level of activity on our Sites, and improve the Sites.

Targeted and advertising cookies

These cookies track your browsing habits to enable us to show advertising which is more likely to be of interest to you.

## Data Transfers

We are a U.S.-based company. Although we do not have an establishment within the European Economic Area (“Europe”), because we target the Site at individuals who are located in Europe, the GDPR (which is a European piece of data protection legislation) applies to us.

For this reason, we take appropriate steps to ensure that when we process your Personal Data (despite the fact that we are not based in Europe) we do so in accordance with the GDPR. 

In addition, where we transfer your Personal Data to any of the third parties outlined above, we also take appropriate steps to ensure that we have implemented appropriate safeguards to ensure that such protection is maintained and is not undermined as a result of that disclosure.

Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal information out of the EEA.
