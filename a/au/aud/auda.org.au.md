Background

Published 16/09/2019

au Domain Administration Ltd (ABN 38 079 009 34) (auDA) recognises the importance of protecting the privacy and the rights of individuals in relation to their personal information.  This document sets out auDA’s privacy policy and tells you how we collect and manage your personal information in the course of performing our functions and activities as the administrator and self-regulatory policy body for the Australian country code top-level domain (.au ccTLD).

We respect your rights to privacy under the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (Act) and other applicable laws that protect your privacy. We are committed to complying with these laws including in particular the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) which are set out in the Act and regulate how we must handle your personal information.

## What is personal information?

The Act provides for the protection of “personal information” which is information or an opinion, whether true or not and whether recorded in a material form or not, about an individual who is either identified or reasonably identifiable. When used in this privacy policy, the term “personal information” has the meaning given to it in the Act. In general terms, it is any information that can be used to personally identify you.  If the information we collect personally identifies you, or you are reasonably identifiable from it, the information will be considered personal information.

## What personal information do we collect and hold?

The types of personal information we may collect about you include:

  * name;
  * mailing or street address;
  * email address;
  * telephone number;
  * payment details;
  * age or birth date;
  * profession, occupation or job title;
  * IP Address;
  * any additional information relating to you that you provide to us directly through our websites or indirectly through use of our websites or online presence, through our representatives or otherwise;
  * information you provide to us through our Compliance Department or membership surveys;
  * information collected through cookies or tracking technologies (including IP address);
  * any other information collected to become an accredited registrar or reseller
  * any other information collected for an auDA event
  * any other information collected as part of a submission for Policy change
  * any other information collected as part of a job application; and
  * any other information collected for a new employee.



We may also collect some information that is not personal information because it does not identify you or anyone else.  For example, we may collect anonymous answers to surveys or aggregated information about how users use our website.

## Sensitive information

Sensitive information is a subset of personal information that is generally afforded a higher level of privacy protection, such as health, racial or criminal record information. auDA only collects sensitive information where it is reasonably necessary for our functions or activities and either:

  * the individual has consented; or
  * we are required or authorised by or under law (including applicable privacy legislation) to do so.



For example, we may collect information about whether the directors, officers or relevant staff of a registry operator appointment or registrar accreditation have been convicted of a criminal offence.

## How auDA Collects Personal Information

We collect your personal information directly from you unless it is unreasonable or impracticable to do so.  When collecting personal information from you, we may collect it in various ways including:

  * when you complete your Associate Membership application;
  * when you complete an application to become an accredited registrar or reseller;
  * when you apply to attend an auDA event;
  * when you participate in an auDA submission for policy change;
  * through your access and use of our website;
  * written communications;
  * during conversations between you and our representatives;
  * recordings of auDA public forums;
  * auDA Foundation grant applications;
  * job applications; and
  * new employee onboarding.



We may also collect personal information from third parties including:

  * from third party companies such as credit reporting agencies, law enforcement agencies, other government entities, and contractors or subcontractors acting on our behalf; and
  * your employer, where you are nominated as a contact for the entity as part of an application, submission or other communication.



### Cookies

In some cases, we may also collect your personal information through the use of cookies.  When you access our website, we may send a “cookie” (which is a small summary file containing a unique ID number) to your computer.  This enables us to recognise your computer and greet you each time you visit our website without bothering you with a request to register.  We also use cookies to measure traffic patterns, to determine which areas of our website have been visited.  We use this to research our users’ habits so that we can improve our online services.  If you do not wish to receive cookies, you can set your browser so that your computer does not accept them.

We may log IP addresses (that is, the electronic addresses of computers connected to the internet) to analyse trends, administer the website, track user movements, and gather broad demographic information.

## What happens if we can’t collect your personal information?

If you do not provide us with the personal information described above, some or all of the following may happen:

  * we may not be able to provide you with an Associate Membership to auDA;
  * we may not be able to provide you with updated information about auDA and the .au namespace;

  * we may not be able to provide you with other services that you may request.

  * Information shared with contractors or serviced providers will be specific to performing tasks on behalf of auDA and will be bound by confidentiality arrangements in place with the respective parties; and

## Direct marketing materials

We may send you direct marketing communications and information about our services that we consider may be of interest to you.  These communications may be sent in various forms, including mail, SMS, fax and email, in accordance with applicable marketing laws, such as the Spam Act 2003 (Cth).  You consent to us sending you those direct marketing communications by any of those methods.  If you indicate a preference for a method of communication, we will endeavour to use that method whenever practical to do so.  In addition, at any time you may opt-out of receiving marketing communications from us by contacting us at [privacy@auda.org.au](mailto:privacy@auda.org.au)

## How can you access and correct your personal information?

You may request access to any personal information we hold about you at any time by contacting us at [privacy@auda.org.au](mailto:privacy@auda.org.au)   Where we hold information that you are entitled to access, we will try to provide you with suitable means of accessing it (for example, by mailing or emailing it to you).  We may charge you a fee to cover our administrative and other reasonable costs in providing the information to you. We will not charge for simply making the request and will not charge for making any corrections to your personal information.

There may be instances where we cannot grant you access to the personal information we hold.  For example, we may need to refuse access if granting access would interfere with the privacy of others or if it would result in a breach of confidentiality.  If that happens, we will give you written reasons for any refusal.

If you believe that personal information, we hold about you is incorrect, incomplete or inaccurate, then you may request us to amend it.  Amendment requests should be forwarded to [privacy@auda.org.au](mailto:privacy@auda.org.au)
