<h1>Privacy Policy (2002-10)</h1>
<p>
  <a href="/pdf/auda-2002-10.pdf ">PDF version</a>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Policy No: 2002-10 <br>Publication Date: 11/06/2002 <br>Status: 
  Current </strong>
</p>
<p>
  1. BACKGROUND 
</p>
<p>
  1.1 This document sets out auDA's privacy policy, drafted in response to the <em>
Privacy Amendment (Private Sector) Act 2000</em> to codify auDA's commitment 
  to the responsible collection and use of personal information by auDA. 
</p>
<p>
  1.2 auDA strongly advocates the protection of all personal information, and 
  believes that the adoption and implementation of this policy represents good 
  business practice. auDA's commitment to this policy ensures that individuals 
  are made aware of: 
</p>
<p>
  a) when information about them is being collected; 
</p>
<p>
  b) the purpose for which it is being collected; 
</p>
<p>
  c) whether the information may be passed on to third parties; and 
</p>
<p>
  d) the rights of individuals to have some control over the way any 
  information about them is handled and maintained. 
</p>
<p>
  1.3 This policy has been drafted to adhere to the National Privacy 
  Principles outlined in the Privacy Act. More information about the Act is 
  available on the Australian Privacy Commissioner’s website at 
  http://www.privacy.gov.au or on the Privacy Hotline number 1300 363 992. 
</p>
<p>
  1.4 This policy applies only to the collection and use of personal 
  information by auDA. It does not apply to the collection and use of personal 
  information by members of the domain name industry operating within the .au 
  domain. Under auDA's Registry Licence Agreement and Registrar Agreement, 
  registry operators and registrars are required to develop their own privacy 
  policy in accordance with the requirements of the Privacy Act. 
</p>
<p>
  2. COLLECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION 
</p>
<p>
  2.1 The personal information held by auDA is collected for the purpose of 
  meeting its objectives as the manager of the .au domain, and providing the 
  services necessary for meeting those objectives. 
</p>
<p>
  2.2 In the course of managing the .au domain, auDA may collect personal 
  information in order to: 
</p>
<p>
  a) appoint and license registry operators; 
</p>
<p>
  b) accredit and license registrars; 
</p>
<p>
  c) field and deal with consumer enquiries and complaints; 
</p>
<p>
  d) refer persons to appropriate bodies according to the nature of the 
  person's inquiry; and 
</p>
<p>
  e) canvas stakeholders for their views, opinions and suggestions in relation 
  to the .au domain. 
</p>
<p>
  2.3 auDA limits the collection of personal information to that which is 
  required to perform the functions listed above. auDA may also collect 
  personal information in order to process applications for membership of, or 
  employment with, auDA. 
</p>
<p>
  2.4 auDA does not require or collect personal information which would be 
  considered "sensitive" under the Act. 
</p>
<p>
  2.5 auDA's website does not utilise "cookies" or other technology to collect 
  user information or track usage. auDA's website may feature links to other 
  websites. auDA is not responsible for the content and privacy practices of 
  other such websites. 
</p>
<p>
  3. USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION 
</p>
<p>
  3.1 The way in which auDA uses personal information is dictated by the 
  purpose for which the information was collected. As most information is 
  collected directly from the relevant individual, that individual will 
  normally be aware of the purpose of the collection. 
</p>
<p>
  3.2 auDA will only use personal information for a purpose other than the 
  primary purpose (ie. a secondary purpose) where: 
</p>
<p>
  a) that individual has consented; 
</p>
<p>
  b) the secondary purpose is directly related to the primary purpose and the 
  individual would reasonably expect auDA to use or disclose the information 
  in such a way; or 
</p>
<p>
  c) we are permitted or required by law, or it is in the interests of public 
  safety to do so. 
</p>
<p>
  3.3 People who subscribe to one of auDA's mailing lists (such as the auDA 
  Announcements List) may decide at any time to unsubscribe from the list. 
  Instructions for unsubscribing will appear in the footer of all list emails, 
  as well as on the auDA website. 
</p>
<p>
  4. PROTECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION 
</p>
<p>
  4.1 Access to personal information held by auDA is limited to those 
  employees who specifically require it to carry out their work 
  responsibilities. This extends to protecting personal information from 
  misuse and loss, as well as from modification and disclosure. 
</p>
<p>
  4.2 Commercially sensitive information (for example, information provided by 
  a prospective registrar for the purpose of accreditation) will held by auDA 
  staff and will not be disclosed to any director of the auDA Board. 
</p>
<p>
  4.3 All personal information will only be retained for a reasonable period 
  of time. auDA endeavours to maintain the security and integrity of all 
  facilities by which personal information is stored. 
</p>
<p>
  5. ACCESS TO PERSONAL INFORMATION 
</p>
<p>
  5.1 auDA is committed to processing personal information promptly and 
  accurately. As part of this commitment, individuals who have provided 
  personal information to auDA may request access to their information in 
  order to verify that it is accurate, complete and up-to-date. 
</p>
<p>
  5.2 Requests for access or correction to personal information should be 
  directed to auDA's Chief Policy Officer. auDA reserves the right to refuse a 
  request if it is vexatious or frivolous, or if we are legally entitled to do 
  so. 
</p>
<p>
  6. REVIEW OF POLICY 
</p>
<p>
  6.1 auDA reserves the right to revise this policy at any time and those 
  people who volunteer their personal details to auDA are deemed to 
  acknowledge and be bound by this policy and any changes made to it. This is 
  no way affects the protection afforded under the relevant laws, according to 
  which this policy was developed.
