<h1 class="pagetitle">Privacy Policy (2002-10)</h1>

<p><a href="/pdf/auda-2002-10.pdf">PDF version</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p>   <p>   <strong>Policy No: 2002-10 <br></strong> Publication Date: 11/06/2002 <br> Status: Replaced by <a href="/policies/auda-2010-02/" title="Privacy Policy (2010-02)">Policy No 2010-02</a>   </p>   <p>   1. BACKGROUND  </p>   <p>   1.1 This document sets out auDA's privacy policy, drafted in response to the <em> Privacy Amendment (Private Sector) Act 2000</em> to codify auDA's commitment    to the responsible collection and use of personal information by auDA.  </p>   <p>   1.2 auDA strongly advocates the protection of all personal information, and    believes that the adoption and implementation of this policy represents good    business practice. auDA's commitment to this policy ensures that individuals    are made aware of:  </p>   <p>   a) when information about them is being collected;  </p>   <p>   b) the purpose for which it is being collected;  </p>   <p>   c) whether the information may be passed on to third parties; and  </p>   <p>   d) the rights of individuals to have some control over the way any    information about them is handled and maintained.  </p>   <p>   1.3 This policy has been drafted to adhere to the National Privacy    Principles outlined in the Privacy Act. More information about the Act is    available on the Australian Privacy Commissioner’s web site at    http://www.privacy.gov.au or on the Privacy Hotline number 1300 363 992.  </p>   <p>   1.4 This policy applies only to the collection and use of personal    information by auDA. It does not apply to the collection and use of personal    information by members of the <dfn title="internet address, eg, www.yourbusinessname.com.au">domain name</dfn> industry operating within the .au    domain. Under auDA's Registry Licence Agreement and Registrar Agreement,    <dfn title="The database of domain names registered in each 2LD. For more information go to http://www.auda.org.au/registry/">registry</dfn> operators and <dfn title="auDA-accredited companies who handle domain name licence applications and renewals. The list of auDA-accredited registrars can be found at http://www.auda.org.au/registrars/">registrar</dfn>s are required to develop their own privacy    policy in accordance with the requirements of the Privacy Act.  </p>   <p>   2. COLLECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION  </p>   <p>   2.1 The personal information held by auDA is collected for the purpose of    meeting its objectives as the manager of the .au domain, and providing the    services necessary for meeting those objectives.  </p>   <p>   2.2 In the course of managing the .au domain, auDA may collect personal    information in order to:  </p>   <p>   a) appoint and license registry operators;  </p>   <p>   b) accredit and license registrars;  </p>   <p>   c) field and deal with consumer enquiries and complaints;  </p>   <p>   d) refer persons to appropriate bodies according to the nature of the    person's inquiry; and  </p>   <p>   e) canvas stakeholders for their views, opinions and suggestions in relation    to the .au domain.  </p>   <p>   2.3 auDA limits the collection of personal information to that which is    required to perform the functions listed above. auDA may also collect    personal information in order to process applications for membership of, or    employment with, auDA.  </p>   <p>   2.4 auDA does not require or collect personal information which would be    considered "sensitive" under the Act.  </p>   <p>   2.5 auDA's web site does not utilise "cookies" or other technology to collect    user information or track usage. auDA's web site may feature links to other    web sites. auDA is not responsible for the content and privacy practices of    other such web sites.  </p>   <p>   3. USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION  </p>   <p>   3.1 The way in which auDA uses personal information is dictated by the    purpose for which the information was collected. As most information is    collected directly from the relevant individual, that individual will    normally be aware of the purpose of the collection.  </p>   <p>   3.2 auDA will only use personal information for a purpose other than the    primary purpose (ie. a secondary purpose) where:  </p>   <p>   a) that individual has consented;  </p>   <p>   b) the secondary purpose is directly related to the primary purpose and the    individual would reasonably expect auDA to use or disclose the information    in such a way; or  </p>   <p>   c) we are permitted or required by law, or it is in the interests of public    safety to do so.  </p>   <p>   3.3 People who subscribe to one of auDA's mailing lists (such as the auDA    Announcements List) may decide at any time to unsubscribe from the list.    Instructions for unsubscribing will appear in the footer of all list emails,    as well as on the auDA web site.  </p>   <p>   4. PROTECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION  </p>   <p>   4.1 Access to personal information held by auDA is limited to those    employees who specifically require it to carry out their work    responsibilities. This extends to protecting personal information from    misuse and loss, as well as from modification and disclosure.  </p>   <p>   4.2 Commercially sensitive information (for example, information provided by    a prospective registrar for the purpose of accreditation) will held by auDA    staff and will not be disclosed to any director of the auDA Board.  </p>   <p>   4.3 All personal information will only be retained for a reasonable period    of time. auDA endeavours to maintain the security and integrity of all    facilities by which personal information is stored.  </p>   <p>   5. ACCESS TO PERSONAL INFORMATION  </p>   <p>   5.1 auDA is committed to processing personal information promptly and    accurately. As part of this commitment, individuals who have provided    personal information to auDA may request access to their information in    order to verify that it is accurate, complete and up-to-date.  </p>   <p>   5.2 Requests for access or correction to personal information should be    directed to auDA's Chief Policy Officer. auDA reserves the right to refuse a    request if it is vexatious or frivolous, or if we are legally entitled to do    so.  </p>   <p>   6. REVIEW OF POLICY  </p>   <p>   6.1 auDA reserves the right to revise this policy at any time and those    people who volunteer their personal details to auDA are deemed to    acknowledge and be bound by this policy and any changes made to it. This is    no way affects the protection afforded under the relevant laws, according to    which this policy was developed. </p>  <p class="lastupdated">Last Updated: 25/06/2010 14:00</p>	</div><!-- end #midsection-->
