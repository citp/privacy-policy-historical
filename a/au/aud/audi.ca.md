Privacy Policy
    

It is our sincere hope at Audi Canada that what is now a purely digital relationship will evolve into a more personal one. A relationship built on trust. Our policy on privacy is simple and unwavering. We would also remind you that audi.ca is a private, copyrighted site and intended solely for personal use. And now that we've taken care of the business that our attorneys advised us had to be stated, let's get back to something more exciting, more promising: Audi and you.

Should you have other questions or concerns about this privacy policy, please email us at:

A Word On "Cookies"
    

"Cookies" are small items of data that some websites either write to your hard drive upon your visit to their site(s) or store in the browser. These data files contain information the site can use to organize the pages you have visited on a particular website. Some of our websites may use "cookie" technology to measure site activity and tailor information to fit your personal interests. In this way, we can deliver tailor-made information suiting your personal interests upon your next visit to our site(s). Our use of "cookie" technology is, thus, to provide you with a more individualized delivery of information and an optimal viewing experience.

Pixel Tags
    

We may use "pixel tags", which are small graphic files that allow us to monitor the use of our websites. A pixel tag can collect information such as the IP (Internet Protocol) address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the tag appears; the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) of the page on which the pixel tag appears; the time the page containing the pixel tag was viewed;the type of browser that fetched the pixel tag; and the identification number of any cookie (please see A word on "Cookies") on the computer previously placed by that server. When corresponding with you via HTML capable email, we may use "format sensing" technology, which allows pixel tags to let us know whether you received and opened our e-mail.

Our Commitment To Data Security
    

Because your privacy is important to us,  we use additional technologies and measures to prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, maintain data accuracy, and ensure appropriate use of this information.

At that time, we will note and abide by your preference.

At any time, subject to legal restrictions, you may withdraw or change your consent to our use of your information, request us to delete it from our files, or notify us if you do not wish us to use your information for any purpose other than for the purposes specifically identified when you provided it to us (See How to Contact Us, below).
