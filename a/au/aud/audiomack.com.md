A cookie is a small file placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website which helps our site and our 3rd party advertising and data partners recognize your device the next time you visit the site. Cookies are essential for many simple functions such as recognizing a repeat visitor as logged in, and providing access to your account, favorites, playlists, and profile. Audiomack utilizes two common types of cookies - session based cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay active until deleted or deactivate after a set period of time). Other technologies include pixel tags (transparent images which help us determine if a page or email has been viewed by a user), web beacons (also known as web bugs, which serve a similar function to pixel tags), and web storage. Additionally, mobile users may be tracked using Device ID and/or hashed data to identify repeat mobile usage. These combined technologies are used both by Audiomack and our 3rd party partners to ensure essential Platform functionality; target, serve, measure, and track advertising delivery, targeting, optimization, and performance; measure Platform analytics and usage; and to measure user and audience behavior, trends, demographics, and location.
