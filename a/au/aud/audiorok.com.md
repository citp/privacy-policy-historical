We use third-party services such as HiStats, Statcounter, Google Analytics - for the purposes of understanding the visitors on this website and how we can further improve ourselves. For example, you may visit this website on a mobile device and we will use that information to make future updates to this website, so that it is easier to navigate , another example is that users visit this site from all corners of the world, so we use this information to understand where most users come from & how we can improve our services for you.

Please note that opting out of an advert-network does not mean you will no longer see online advertising. Instead, it means that you will no longer see targeted/behavioural advertising (i.e. advertising tailored to your browsing history, preferences and usage patterns) via the network from which you have opted out. 

**Server Log Files**  
Log files are maintained and analysed of all requests for files on this website's web servers. Log files do not capture personal information but do capture the user's IP address, which is automatically recognised by our web servers. Information from Proxies are also recognized on the webserver.

Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.

We also continue to work on features to keep your information safe in addition to things like full-site encryption, encryption of files at rest, and alerts when new devices or apps are linked to your account (using an API) 

**Retention.**  
We'll retain information you store on our Services for as long as we need it to provide you the Services. If you delete your account, we'll also delete this information.
