# Privacy Policy for Online, Offline and Electronic Use | Audubon

The National Audubon Society respects our visitors’ privacy interests and is committed to honoring your preferences.  This privacy policy governs the way we collect and use your information both offline and online, including at [www.audubon.org](http://www.audubon.org/) and its subdomains, websites accessed through your mobile devices, our downloadable mobile applications and Audubon’s own social media sites (“Media”).  Your use of Media or provision of personal information to Audubon constitutes your acceptance of the terms of this policy.

## **The Information We Collect**

We collect and use the information you provide when you interact with Audubon offline and through Audubon Media.  This information falls into two categories: 1) Personal information, which includes items such as your name and address, which you provide when you become a member, make a donation, fill out a survey or participate in an activity; 2) Non-Personal Information, which includes your IP address or website browsing patterns, which we collect through technology.  For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, personal information does not include the information Audubon employees share in connection with their employment. 

### **Personal Information**

In most cases, you may use Audubon’s Media without registering or submitting any personal information.  However, some Media sites require that you supply certain personal information, such as a verifiable email address, to register or to fully use the site. 

You also may choose to log in, create an account or enhance your profile through a third party authentication service (like Facebook Connect or Twitter).  By doing this, you are asking the authentication service to send us certain information from your profile, and you are authorizing us to collect, store, and use this information.  After you’ve connected, some services, like Facebook Connect, will send us additional information from your profile, such as information that allows us to display a Facebook module on the Media pages you view.

Depending on the nature of your interaction with us, the personal information you are asked to provide may include your name, billing and shipping addresses, telephone and mobile phone numbers, and email addresses.  Audubon does not store sensitive financial information, such as credit card numbers or banking information.

**Audubon may share your Personal Information within the Audubon network, with its service contractors, with select not-for-profit organizations, and, with your specific permission, with some commercial vendors.   Except as described below, you may opt-out from receiving communications from Audubon by contacting Audubon’s Member Services at [audubon@emailcustomerservice.com](mailto:audubon@emailcustomerservice.com).**

_Participate in an Action Alert_  
When you take action to support conservation, such as participating in an Action Alert or sending a letter to your Senator, Audubon may send your personal information, such as your name and residential address, to the target of the action (e.g., a member of Congress, a government agency).

_Engage on a Blog or Other Social Media Site_  
Audubon maintains presence on several social networking and blogging platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter, and we also incorporate some third party social networking features onto our Media.  This policy applies to our use of information you submit to us, but it does not apply to what Facebook or any other third party platforms do with your information.  Those platforms have their own privacy policies, and we encourage you to read them.

_Mobile Text Messaging_  
Audubon collects your mobile telephone number when you opt in to receive messages from us via your mobile device.  Every text message Audubon sends contains information on how to opt-out from receiving text messages.

Audubon collects personal information of participants in citizen science and conservation activities such as the Christmas Bird Count, the Great Backyard Bird Count, Hummingbirds at Home or in our Important Bird Areas program.  Your participation in these programs becomes part of the historical record.  Participants’ names may be displayed publically in reports, on the Audubon website, or in summary articles.  Audubon collects your personal information if you submit a digital photo through our websites to any of the programs listed above, and displays your name in proximity to any image you submit.  Audubon also collects location specific data when you use mobile apps associated with our citizen science programs.  This information is stored in our database in proximity to your personal information and any scientific bird observations you submit.

The Great Backyard Bird Count (GBBC) is a collaboration of Audubon, Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology and Bird Studies Canada.  Any data submitted to the GBBC databases, including bird observations and photos, is governed by the GBBC privacy policy: <http://gbbc.birdcount.org/privacy-policy/>
