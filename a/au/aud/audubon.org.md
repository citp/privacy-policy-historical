# Audubon: Privacy Policy

####  June 2001 

This policy covers Web sites owned or operated by Audubon. We encourage you to take the time to read this privacy policy and those of any Web site you visit.

The National Audubon Society is one of the largest, most effective environmental organizations dedicated to the protection and preservation of birds, other wildlife and their habitats. Since our founding in 1905, we have approached environmental issues in a manner reflected by nature itself –- with balance. Our web site is designed as a tool for those interested in the environment to become more involved in our mission. 

Audubon is concerned about our visitor’s Internet privacy and is committed to honoring our constituents’ privacy preferences. We recognize that visitors to our site may be concerned about the information they provide to us and how Audubon treats that information. Be assured, Audubon will never misuse the information you provide.

Consumer Choice

**

Audubon believes a visitor to our site is the one to best determine: 

  * Whether -- and under what conditions –- a visitor should provide "personally identifiable information" (e.g. data that may be used to identify, contact, or locate a person). 
  * Whether Audubon should share such information with anyone. 

**

Informed Consent

**

If Audubon needs to collect personally identifiable information, a visitor to our site will be alerted and given an opportunity to restrict our use of the information. Every visitor has the right to:

  * Know when Audubon is collecting personal information.

  * Expect the opportunity to choose whether or not personal information will be provided to third parties. 
  * Expect reasonable steps to be taken to protect personal information from unauthorized use.

PRIVACY POLICY

**

You can visit most portions of audubon.org without telling us who you are and without revealing any personal information. The only information we collect from a typical web site visit does not identify you. Rather, it is the name of your Internet service provider ("ISP"), the browser and type of machine you are using, the web site that referred you to us, the pages you request and the date and time you request them. We use this information to generate statistics and measure site activity to improve the usefulness of the site to our visitors.

Audubon does not sell or otherwise disclose such user information outside the organization. 

**

Personal Information Collected

**

In general, when you visit our Web sites and access information you remain anonymous. We do not require you to register or provide personal information to us to view our site. 

There are occasions, however, when we will ask for additional information. We do this to better understand and respond to your needs, and provide you with services that may be valuable to you. Audubon collects email addresses and other personally identifiable data about you when such data is voluntarily submitted. For example, personally identifiable information will be collected in order for you to become a member of Audubon or to register as an environmental activist online. Contact information from order forms is used to send orders, invoices and information about Audubon to you. Some of the activist functions of our site also require registration of personal information. We use this information to track the usage of these features and to help you gain access to the information you need to most benefit the environment. All such information is collected and stored in a manner appropriate to the nature of the data. Audubon makes every effort to insure the secure collection and transmission of sensitive user information using industry accepted data collection and encryption methodologies.

Finally, you may decide to send Audubon personally identifying information, for example, in a message containing information about membership. We will only use this information to identify you and to determine how to respond to the electronic mail. We will not use this information for any purpose other than to resolve the matter identified in the email.

Cookies may contain information about your ISP, operating system, browser type, screen resolution and number of colors, your computer’s processor type, your ISP’ss server, your Internet protocol address, and what server you were last on. Other information can be added to a cookie, but only information that you give to us.

Audubon uses cookies written by our site, but not to obtain information on other Web sites that you may visit. Cookies help us by providing some history about the parts of our sites that you have visited. This enables us to help you navigate our site more easily, to determine what pages are most attractive to our visitors, and to alert you to related pages on our site that may interest you.

We provide links to third party sites. Because we do not control those Web sites, we encourage you to review the privacy policies posted on these third party sites.
