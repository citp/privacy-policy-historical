**Information that Audio Advice collects and how it is used**  
Audio Advice collects certain information to enable you to take full advantage of our offerings when you register at our site, order products or services, participate in our contests, surveys, promotions, or activities, or otherwise communicate with us. If you choose, you can visit Audio Advice's website without providing us with any information about yourself. Audio Advice collects both personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information from users of its website.

Personally Identifiable Information When you register with Audio Advice, we require you to give us contact information (such as your name, e-mail address, and physical address) and demographic information (such as your age and gender).

When you order products or services from our site, we also may need to collect some additional purchase information from you, including credit card information, description of your repair or installation, and information about your home (e.g., number of rooms, size and age of house, and lawn size).

We may require additional information for specific promotions or contests run on our site.

We use the customer contact information we collect to connect you with a service provider, and to send you, if you so choose, information about our company, newsletters, promotional materials, and information from the service provider network.

We may also use the information we collect, in combination with outside records, to notify you about important changes to the website, new Audio Advice services and products, and special offers and information we think you'll find valuable. We may send you information in conjunction with third-party partners that we think is relevant to your interests.

We use information gathered at the time of purchase to process your order, to enable the provider to fulfill your order, and to notify you of your order status. A customer care representative or service provider may contact you in order to fulfill a service you purchased or to provide information you requested.

Non-personally Identifiable Information We may collect certain non-personally identifiable information about you when you visit our site, such as the type of browser you are using (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you are using, the referring site from which you came (e.g., a partner site), and the domain name of your internet service provider (e.g., America Online, Earthlink).

We use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect in the aggregate to improve the design and content of our site. We also use this information to analyze site usage.

**Disclosure of information to outside parties**   
To process your requests for products or services, we will need to share some of the personally identifiable information you provided (e.g., contact information and information about particular service needs) with service providers in the provider network.

If you choose to receive promotions, newsletters, and/or other types of correspondence from us, the correspondence that you receive will originate from Audio Advice or the provider network, and your personally identifiable information will continue to be solely maintained by Audio Advice. 

If you registered with Audio Advice through a third-party website or if you registered with a third-party website through Audio Advice, we may need to report certain information to that website, as is necessary.

If you come to Audio Advice via a co-branded partner and transact business with us, the information you provide may be collected and used by Audio Advice, as well as by the co-branded partner from which you came. Audio Advice is not responsible for the use that the co-branded partner makes with this information.

To help you identify when you are on the Audio Advice website, we place our logo in the upper left corner to indicate that you are within Audio Advice's website.

Audio Advice may be obligated to disclose personally identifiable information to law enforcement or agencies, even though such agencies may not comply with the terms of our privacy policy. Audio Advice will disclose information to such agencies in response to legal process or when we believe in good faith that the law requires it, for example, in response to a court order, subpoena, or a law enforcement agency's request.

Finally, Audio Advice may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related site information to reputable third-party vendors, partners, service providers, or to the press. Aggregate statistics contain only non-personally identifiable information.

**Information that partners collect**  
Our site contains links to other websites whose information practices may be different than ours. You should consult the other sites' privacy policies, as we have no control over information that you may submit or that the third parties collect on those sites.

We may offer promotions or content that is sponsored by, or co-branded with, identified third parties. By virtue of these relationships, these third parties may obtain personally identifiable information that you submit. Audio Advice has no control over the third party's use of this information.

**Commitment to the security of your information**  
When you place orders or access your account information, we use a secure server. The secure server software, SSL (Secure Sockets Layer), encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. Furthermore, digital certificates protect all of the customer transactional data we collect against unauthorized access. The Home Service Center's digital certificates are issued by VeriSign, one of the most established issuers of digital certificates. Additionally, we use firewall security and limit data access to protect your personally identifiable information.

**How to update/change your preferences**  
Audio Advice may send communications, promotional information, and/or newsletters to our registrants. You can choose to not receive communications from us. We provide the following options for reviewing and updating the personally identifiable information that we collect and maintain, including options for communications, news, and special offers.

**Changes to our privacy policy**   
If we materially change our privacy policy, we will post changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it. We will also post a notice on our homepage that our privacy policy has been changed.
