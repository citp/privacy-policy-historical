# Audi privacy statement | Audi USA

##### Last Modified September 11, 2018

This statement applies to Model Year 2019 vehicles and newer, unless a more specific privacy statement applies to an individual model.

At Audi of America, Inc., an operating division of Volkswagen Group of America, Inc. (“AoA,” “We,” or “Us”), we value your privacy and your desire to know how your information will be handled and used.  To better protect your privacy, we provide this Privacy Statement, which explains our information practices.  This statement applies to information we obtain from and about individuals interacting with AoA and its websites, mobile applications, vehicles, products and services; however, it does not apply to job applicants or AoA employees.

This Statement does not apply to Audi Financial Services (“AFS”) or its products, contracts and related services. AFS has its own privacy statement, which can be found _[here](https://www.audifs.com/Public/PrivacyPolicy)_.

Below we provide a summary of the general information we collect, how we use it and with whom it is shared.  Because we don’t collect all of the information described below in all circumstances, we have separately identified the information that is collected when you choose to purchase or use additional products or services available with your Audi vehicle (such as myAudi, or Audi connect services beyond Connect CARE, which include Connect PRIME, and Connect PLUS).  For more information, please see the detailed sections for each of these services.

If you are a California resident, please view the “Your California Privacy Rights” section of the full privacy statement for more information on your California privacy rights.

If you set up a myAudi account, additional information will be collected, including:

  * Information regarding your myAudi settings, such as preferred Audi dealer, and preferred contact for service notifications
  * Additional data you provide for use of particular applications or for direct communications

If your vehicle is equipped with an Event Data Recorder (“EDR”), crash or near-crash information about the vehicle or driver’s behavior will be recorded in the vehicle.  EDR data are recorded by your vehicle only if a non-trivial crash situation occurs, not under normal driving conditions. For information about your vehicle’s EDR data or other crash or near crash information collected and how we might receive and use it, please see your owner’s manual.

Audi vehicles may be equipped with Audi connect CARE, which does not require any action from you to activate and is automatically enabled and active before purchase or lease. Audi connect CARE cannot be disabled in equipped vehicles, without significantly impacting the impacting the user experience and function of the infotainment system. This plan includes some or all of the following services:

  * Automatic and manual Audi emergency call (in the event of an airbag deployment or if you contact us directly through the ‘SOS’ button to notify us of an emergency, an emergency service center, contracted by AoA, will respond);
  * Stolen vehicle locator (at your request, we will attempt to locate your stolen vehicle in coordination with law enforcement authorities); and
  * Online roadside assistance (non-emergency roadside assistance when requested, including through use of the “wrench” button).
  * Remote Lock/Unlock functions



The Connect CARE plan requires the collection and use of information from you (which may include a phone call to discuss the situation and assistance needed, which is recorded and monitored) and your vehicle (including your vehicle’s GPS location and other vehicle data that will help us get emergency responders to you or help us dispatch appropriate service providers). GPS location data that is collected for the purpose of providing Connect CARE services is only available and used by us upon our receipt of an automatic notification from your vehicle, when the SOS button is pushed or when you request other online roadside services through the “wrench” button.

Although Connect CARE is automatically activated in equipped vehicles, to utilize the Audi Service Request and Remote Lock/Unlock functions of Connect CARE, you must register a “key user.”  The data collection practices around key user registration and Audi Service Request functionality are discussed in separate sections below.

We may use your information in a number of ways, including:

  * **To provide you with products and services,** such as **** to provide products and services you may request; support your vehicle, products and services; diagnose, repair and track service and quality issues; communicate with you about your vehicle, products or services; install and configure changes and updates to your services; authenticate users of our products and services; or verify your eligibility for certain programs or benefits ****
  * **For our own internal business purposes** , such as to evaluate the usage, performance and safety of our vehicles, products and services; improve the quality of our vehicles, products and services and design new products and services; operate the AoA website and digital properties and customize the content; or maintain internal records
  * **For legal, safety or security reasons,** such as to comply with legal requirements; protect the safety, property or rights of AoA, owners, registered users, drivers, passengers or others; or prevent and detect fraud or misuse of the vehicles, products or services
  * **For marketing.   **However, please note that GPS location data will not be used for AoA marketing purposes or shared with unaffiliated third parties to use for their own purposes without your affirmative consent. ****
  * **In an anonymous or aggregated format.**   We may also use or share your information in an anonymized or aggregate manner for any purpose.



We may share your information (a) within the Volkswagen Group family of companies, which includes parents, corporate affiliates, subsidiaries, business units and other companies that share common ownership, including Audi AG; (b) with third-party service providers working on behalf of AoA (such as advertising agencies and third parties that provide marketing services, marketing research, and other analytics for marketing purposes) and third party content providers; and (c) Audi Dealers for sales, leasing, and customer service purposes, such as responding to quote requests, vehicle diagnosis, maintenance and repair, scheduling service appointments, and contacting you and providing the requested services. Some of our service providers, including Audi AG, are located outside of the United States.

We also share your information with emergency responders and service providers (such as police, ambulance providers, and towing providers) and law enforcement for purposes of offering Connect CARE.

We also share information with your vehicle’s satellite radio and/or wireless service provider, if applicable, to enable those service providers to contact you with important information about your vehicle’s satellite or wireless services and for their own marketing purposes.

With your express permission, we also will share your information with selected third parties you choose, to enable services that use your information but are not provided directly by AoA. These services could include, but are not limited to, remote package and fuel delivery, or usage-based insurance or tolling pricing, or other mobility-based services.

In addition, we may share your information with third parties, law enforcement or other government agencies to comply with law or legal requirements; to enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other agreements; and to protect our rights and the property or safety of our users or third-parties. We also may disclose information about you and your vehicle when we have reason to believe that someone is causing injury to or interference with our rights or property, other users of the websites or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities.

If we or some or all of our assets are acquired by another company, including through a sale in connection with bankruptcy, we will share the information that we hold with that company.

We also share your information with other carefully selected companies with whom we may partner to provide you with information about products or services we think may be of interest to you. 

We may also use or share your information in an anonymized or aggregate manner.

Most Audi vehicles are equipped with technology that tracks, and shares with AoA, information about the vehicle as described above, including numerous data points about the vehicle’s usage, performance, safety, status, and **_GPS location_**.  AoA uses and shares this information for the purposes described above.

Your vehicle may be equipped with a “Privacy Mode” that allows you to control what information is collected from the vehicle, including the ability to discontinue any sharing of vehicle data except for emergency call purposes. Please see the “Audi Connect” or “Data Privacy” sections of the owner’s manual for your vehicle to determine if your vehicle has Privacy Mode. You may also find a list of vehicle models equipped with privacy mode **_[here](https://www.audiusa.com/content/dam/audiusa/Innovation/Intelligence/Intelligence_Audi_Connect/Audi-connect-Vehicles-equipped-with-Privacy-Mode_9.10.2018.pdf)_**.  Please note that disabling the data sharing capabilities will inhibit AoA’s ability to provide you with Audi connect services and other functionalities. Please see your owner’s manual for a description of what services will be disrupted and what will still be available when privacy mode is enabled. Vehicle models that offer limited connected services from third parties only (such as online traffic and infotainment), but not any remote services from Audi (TT, R8, A3, and Q3 models) are not equipped with Privacy Mode because Audi does not collect data from such vehicles.

AoA maintains reasonable safeguards to protect your information.  Some services, including Audi connect services, may involve the transmission of voice and data from your Audi vehicle over wireless and cellular telephone networks and therefore, we cannot guarantee the privacy and security of conversations or data transmitted to and from your Audi vehicle.

##### **If You Create a myAudi Account**

You can choose to create a myAudi account to access and use AoA personalized services, applications and programs relating to your vehicle.  In addition to the information practices described in the AoA Full Privacy Statement, this statement describes how we collect, use and share your information during registration and use of your myAudi account and the applications, program and services available through myAudi.  You can create a myAudi account without choosing to use Audi connect services.  If you also choose to utilize Audi connect services, we have provided additional information below about information collection, use and sharing for those services.

In addition, you may choose to access your Audi Financial Services (AFS) account through your myAudi portal.  If you do so, the details of your financial transactions (e.g. account balance, automatic payments, bank account information) will not be shared with AoA, its affiliated entities or the third parties identified in this Privacy Statement. Such information will be used strictly in accordance with the AFS Privacy Statement available _[here](https://www.audifs.com/Public/PrivacyPolicy)_.  Information shared between Audi and AFS will be limited to general vehicle purchase information such as VIN, make, model, year, dealer, date of purchase or lease, purchase/lease price, vehicle equipment, and service history—even if you choose to access your AFS account through your myAudi portal.

In addition to the general information identified above, we collect the information that you provide in your myAudi account in the course of or subsequent to registration and verification. This includes:

  * Data that you provide when setting up a myAudi Account, such as gender, salutation, preferred language, usernames and passwords
  * Data regarding your personalized settings for your Audi connect services accessed through you myAudi account, such as preferred Audi partners, preferences for using e-mail, mailing address or text messages for sending service or application function notifications, vehicle catalogues, newsletter or other direct communications
  * Additional data you choose to share to help tailor your myAudi account content and services



In addition to the uses identified above, we use the information provided through your myAudi account registration and use to: activate the account; allow you to access your myAudi account; allow you to use the available applications, services and programs available through your myAudi account; perform desired customer services; and maintain information relevant to your myAudi account. We may also use or share your information in an anonymized or aggregate manner.

You can register an Audi vehicle in your myAudi account by entering and saving your vehicle identification number (“VIN”). The VIN is required to access and use certain applications in your vehicle and to use the vehicle management application in your myAudi account.  By using the vehicle management application, your vehicle's equipment details can be automatically populated by entering your vehicle identification number.

The data you enter into your myAudi account are saved and made available to your registered vehicle on demand. We save the data until you delete it from your myAudi Account or you delete your myAudi Account.

##### **If You Choose to Use Audi connect Services**

You can choose to use your myAudi account to access and use available Audi connect services, which include Connect PRIME and Connect PLUS (Connect CARE is automatically provided).  Certain vehicles may be equipped with Audi connect CARE, which does not require any action from you to activate and is automatically enabled and active before purchase or lease. Connect CARE data collection and use practices were discussed above.  If you activate a free trial or paid subscription to Audi connect services, additional information will be collected.  In addition to the information identified in the full AoA Privacy Statement above, we collect, use, and share information about you and your registered Audi vehicle during your free trial or paid subscription services available through Audi connect.  Some Audi connect vehicles are not equipped to offer all of the Audi connect services mentioned in this Privacy Statement.  To find out what services are available in your vehicle, see www.audiusa.com/audiconnect.

The Audi connect services include offerings from various third-party content providers, such as Google, Twitter, etc. (“Content Provider”).  AoA does not create or control the content offered by these Content Providers.  The Content Providers are exclusively responsible for the content and the availability of the content accessible through Audi connect.  However, AoA does collect and share certain information with these Content Providers in order for you to receive the content requested.  For a complete list of the Audi connect Content Providers and their respective contact information, please see “Content Providers” below.

Please note that through Audi connect services, including Connect PLUS, you can purchase additional services or offerings from us or other third parties.  Certain services or offerings from third parties will be subject to their Terms of Service and Privacy Statement, not ours.  This includes Wi-Fi hotspot service, provided by a wireless carrier that contracts directly with you.  In the course of providing wireless services, the provider may collect information about you, your Audi vehicle, and your use of Audi connect services, including information that allows the provider to determine the location of your vehicle.  The provider’s collection, use, and sharing of the information it collects is governed by its own privacy policy, not ours.  You should read the privacy policy that your wireless provider has made available to you because the provider’s practices may differ from ours.  If you are not the subscriber for this vehicle’s Audi connect services, you should ask the vehicle’s subscriber to tell you about any third party providers contracting directly with the subscriber, including which carrier is providing this vehicle’s wireless services.

Please note that the information stored in your Audi vehicle may be accessible to others who use your Audi vehicle or mobile device, and thus may be deleted, altered, or transferred.  Please see your vehicle’s owner’s manual for information about how to remove the information stored in your Audi vehicle.

We do not store the content of any messages (such as social media messages) that you transmit or access through Audi connect and we do not access or retain information about the locations associated with any information requests (such as information feeds, travel information) that you submit through Audi connect, other than information requests for location based services.

Such information will be used strictly in accordance with the AFS Privacy Statement available **_[here](https://www.audifs.com/Public/PrivacyPolicy)_**.  Information shared between Audi and AFS will be limited to general vehicle purchase information such as VIN, make, model, year, dealer, date of purchase or lease, purchase/lease price, vehicle equipment, and service history—even if you choose to access your AFS account through your myAudi portal.
