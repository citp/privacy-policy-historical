<i>Effective June 9, 2009</i><br>
<br>
<br>

<b>Our Commitment To Privacy</b><br>
<br>

We at AudioEnglish.org are committed to providing you with excellent service. Your privacy is important to us, and have developed this Privacy Policy to inform you about our privacy practices for the entire AudioEnglish.org Web site and all its subdomains. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.<br>
<br>

Privacy is of great concern to most users of the Internet, and is a critical part of an enjoyable and satisfactory user experience. We at AudioEnglish.org are sensitive to the privacy concerns of our subscribers and other visitors to our Web sites. Whether you are a subscriber or a visitor to our site, we assure you that we do not collect personal information from you unless you provide it to us. If you are subscribing to our services, you may be asked to provide certain personal and credit card information. Please note, however, that we are asking for this information for the limited purposes of managing your subscription and we do not get and/or store any credit card information, as this is entered by customers on the server of our payment gateway provider and not on our servers. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted using secure socket layer technology (SSL). You should also be assured that we do not provide or sell information about our customers or site visitors to anyone except as required by law.<br>
<br>

Our Web site may contain links to other sites. Please note that we are not responsible for the privacy practices, privacy statements, or content of these other sites.<br>
<br>



<b>Personal Information</b><br>
<br>

Personal information for purposes of this policy is defined as information that identifies you, individually, and includes your name, home address, home telephone number, and e-mail address.<br>
<br>

We only collect personally identifiable information about you after you have specifically provided such information to us. By voluntarily submitting this information to us when using our Web site, you are consenting to the collection and use of Your personal information by us for that online activity.<br>
<br>

If you participate in an online activity which requires you to provide personal information, such information will only be used for the purposes of that online activity, unless you consent otherwise.  By way of example and not limitation, we may collect and use personal information for some or all of the following reasons:<br>
- To provide you with access to our subscription-based services.<br>
- Responding to questions or comments forwarded to us by you.<br>
- To provide you with notices related to your subscriptions or to communicate with you regarding billing, payment and other issues related to your subscriptions.<br>
- To provide you with notice of upcoming promotions.<br>
<br>

We do not collect any personal information from a visitor to our sites unless that visitor explicitly and intentionally provides it. Under no circumstances do we collect any personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, health, or sex life. If you are simply browsing our Web site, we do not gather any personal information about you.<br>
<br>



<b>Subscriptions</b><br>
<br>

If you choose to subscribe to our services, we will request certain personal information from you. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to provide those online services.<br>
<br>



<b>How You Can Correct Your Information</b><br>
<br>

You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable information by sending us a request that credibly shows error. To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.<br>
<br>




<b>Statistical Information about your Visit</b><br>
<br>

When you visit our sites, our computers may automatically collect statistics about your visit. If you are not a subscriber, this information does not identify you personally, but rather about your visit to our sites. We may monitor statistics such as how many people visit our sites, the user's IP address, which pages people visit on our sites, from which domains our visitors reach our sites, and which browsers people use. We use these statistics about your visit for aggregation purposes only. These statistics are used to help us improve the performance of our Web sites. If you are a subscriber, we may monitor your online activity on our Web site so as to verify that you comply with the terms of use of the services we provide you.<br>
<br>



<b>Use of Cookies</b><br>
<br>

A "cookie" is a piece of information that our web sites send to your browser, which then is stored on your system. A user can use our web sites without cookies; however, our systems need cookies in order to identify you as a subscriber. You may disable or delete the cookies at any time. Many users prefer to use cookies in order to help them navigate a Web site as seamlessly as possible.<br>
<br>

You should be aware that cookies contain no more information than you volunteer, and they are not able to "invade" your hard drive and return to the sender any personal or other information from your computer.<br>
<br>




<b>Third Party Advertising</b><br>
<br>

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html" rel="nofollow">click here</a>.<br>
<br>

Advertisements that appear on AudioEnglish.org are sometimes delivered (or "served") directly to users by third party advertisers. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. These third party advertisers may also download cookies to your computer, or use other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content.<br>
<br>

Google, as a third party advertising company, uses cookies to serve ads on our site. Google's use of the <a href="http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/faq.aspx" rel="nofollow">DoubleClick DART cookie</a> enables it to serve ads to our Web site's visitors based on their visit to our sites and other sites on the Internet. Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html" rel="nofollow">Google ad and content network privacy policy</a>.<br>
<br>

Google and third-party advertising companies may also store, access and/or collect other information from your browser, computer or mobile device in connection with the ads they provide, such as information about your options for cookie management, device-specific information, location information or other information on your device in connection with the advertising they provide. By continuing to use this Web Site, you give your express consent to the storing and accessing of such information by Google and other third-party advertising companies.<br>
<br>

Visitors are advised to take all usual precautions before entering into any agreement with the advertiser and to satisfy themselves as to the suitability of the products or services offered by the advertiser.<br>
<br>

Third party advertisers have no access to your personal information stored on our servers unless you choose to share it with them.<br>
<br>

<br>

Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.<br>
<br>





<b>Our Commitment To Data Security</b><br>
<br>

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. Only our staff and the staff of third parties providing hosting services to us may have access to servers where personal information of our subscribers is stored. We do not get and/or store any credit card information belonging to our customers, this is encrypted using secure socket layer technology (SSL) and sent by customers direct to our payment gateway provider.<br>
<br>




<b>Disclosure by Law and Protection of Our Intellectual Property Rights</b><br>
<br>

If we are required by law to disclose certain information to local, state, federal, national or international law enforcement authorities, we will do so. We will also disclose information to third parties as necessary in order to comply with applicable laws and regulations. In addition, we may share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities or suspected fraud, or enforce or apply our agreements.<br>
