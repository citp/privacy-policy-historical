			<h2 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
			<p>
			We at Audiodraft Ltd ("We", "Us") think that privacy and the protection of personal data are an important element of the user experience of www.audiodraft.com (the "Service"), as described in our <a class="link" href="https://www.audiodraft.com/legal/terms.php">Terms of Use</a>.  In this Privacy Policy, the term "personal data" means information that relates to an identified or identifiable natural person. This Privacy Policy tells you about the ways in which we protect your privacy and personal data we process about you.
			</p>
			<p>
			We know that you, the user of the Service, are concerned about how we use and disclose personal data.  We are dedicated to openness regarding the ways in which we use and disclose personal data, and we are committed to complying with data protection and privacy laws that apply to us. Importantly, we want to give you control over personal data that we process about you when you use the Service.
			</p>
			<p>
			We wish to remind you that this Privacy Policy applies to personal data that we process when you use the Service.  It does not apply to any links to third parties' websites and/or services that you may encounter when you use the Service. We encourage you to carefully familiarize yourself with privacy policies applicable to any websites and/or services operated by third parties. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of any third parties.
			</p>
			<p>
			Please be careful when sharing personal data about you generally in the Service and with other users of the Service.  When you communicate with other users in the Service, be careful about sharing personal data with them.  Also, submitting personal data relating to other individuals, such as pictures or contact information, may violate their privacy and data protection rights.  Thus, please obtain consent from the individual whose personal data you are about to submit to the Service before you submit such data.
			</p>
			
			<hr class="separator margin-bottom">
			
			<h2 id="the_data_we_collect">2. The Data We Collect</h2>
			<p class="super-strong">Personal data you provide to the Service</p>
			
			<p class="strong">a) When You Register with the Service</p>
			<p>
			When you register with the Service we only require you to enter your e-mail address and your password.  However, if you use a third party service, such as Facebook Connect, for signing into the Service, we may collect personal data, such as your user ID, name, and e-mail address, that are available in your public profile with the third party service you use for signing into the Service.
			</p>
			
			<p class="strong">b) When You Create Your Profile</p>
			<p>
			We do not require you to provide additional personal data beyond what is required to register with the Service.  Please be aware, however, that certain elements of the Service, such as creating a contest or participating in a contest, may not be accessible without a profile and/or additional personal data.  If you voluntarily choose to create a profile, you may enter certain data that we collect, to the extent that you feel comfortable doing so.  Such data may include your name, your picture, your address, your country of origin, and your telephone number as well as data you enter in the "Info" section.
			</p>
			
			<p class="super-strong">Data Collected Automatically</p>
			<p>
			When you use the Service, we automatically collect data that may in certain circumstances constitute personal data.
			</p>
			
			<p class="strong">a) Log Data</p>
			<p>
			When you use the Service, the logging technology we use automatically collects the URL of the site from which you came and the site to which you are going when you leave the Service.  We also collect the Internet protocol (IP) address of the device you use to access the Service, information about the operating system of your device, as well as the name of your Internet Service Provider.
			</p>
			
			<p class="strong">b) Cookie Files and Other Similar Technologies</p>
			<p>
			We may place a "cookie" on the hard drive of the device that you use to access the Service.  Cookies are text files that are saved on the hard drive of your device by means of your browser, enabling us to recognize your browser for purposes such as saving your preferences and directing relevant content to you.  Most of the currently available browsers give you the option of managing cookies by, for example, disabling them entirely, accepting them individually, and deleting saved cookies from your hard drive.  Google Analytics is also an element of the Service.  By using cookies, Google Analytics collects and stores data such as time of visit, pages visited, time spent on each page of the website, the Internet Protocol address, and the type of operating system used in the devices used to access the Service.  By using a browser plugin <a class="link" href="http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/plugin/" target="_blank">http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/plugin/</a> provided by Google, you can opt out of Google Analytics. Finally, in the "Create Contest" section of the Service we use Olark, a service that provides a live chat feature in the Service that monitors and analyzes any chats that you may participate in in the Service.
			</p>
			<p>
			We would like to remind you that if you completely disable cookies on your browser, you might not be able to use some features of the Service.
			</p>
			
			<p class="strong">c) Your Use of the Service</p>
			<p>
			When you use the Service, our system collects certain information about the activities associated with your use of the Service.  Such information may include, but is not limited to, the contests you join, the contests you have created, and the quantity and type of content you submit to the Service.
			</p>

			The security of personal data is important to us.  For example, your user account is protected by a password, and the servers we use are secured and protected by a firewall.
