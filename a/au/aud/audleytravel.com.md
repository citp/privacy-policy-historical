# Privacy Policy | Audley Travel

We work very hard to keep the information you give us safe. We follow strict security procedures on how your personal information is stored and used, and who sees it, to help stop any unauthorised person getting hold of it.

#### Personal Information

We collect personal details, such as your name, address and email address only when you use our website to send us an enquiry, order a brochure, register with us for competitions, promotions or sign up to receive email newsletters from us. We will only use that information to respond to your message and to help us get you the information or services you have requested. Remember that email is not necessarily secure. You should never send sensitive or personal information by email. Where we use forms to collect sensitive data, the page will be clearly marked as being secure and a “padlock” icon will display in your browser (usually bottom right).

We collect personal information from you in two main ways:

#### Automatically Collected Information

We collect and temporarily store certain technical information about your visit for use in site management and security purposes. This information includes:

  * The Internet domain from which you access our Web site
  * The type of browser (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer) used to access our site
  * The operating system (Windows, Unix) used to access our site
  * The date and time you access our site
  * The URLs of the pages you visit
  * The URL of the website or link you used to access our website



This information is only used to help us make our site more useful for you. With this data we learn about the number of visitors to our site and the types of technology our visitors use. No attempts are made to identify individual users or their usage habits. Raw data logs are retained temporarily as required for security and site management purposes only.

#### Information Collected for Tracking (Cookies)

We use “cookies” to store and collect information regarding your usage of the website. Cookies are small files placed on your computer’s hard drive, or in your browser memory, when you visit our website. Your computer will only share the information in the cookie with the website that provided it, and no other website can request it. There are two types of cookies, session and persistent. Session cookies last only as long as your web browser is open. Once you close your browser, the cookie disappears. Persistent cookies store information on your computer for longer periods of time - typically up to 3 months. Audley’s websites may use both types of cookies.

At no time is your private information, whether stored in persistent cookies or elsewhere, shared with third parties who have no right to that information. If you do not wish to have session or persistent cookies stored on your machine, you can turn them off in your browser.

#### Telephone Calls

We may record telephone calls to ensure quality of service and for training purposes.

We reserve the right to modify this privacy policy from time to time. You should visit our Web site periodically to review any changes.
