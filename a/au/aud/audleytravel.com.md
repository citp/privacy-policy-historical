# Privacy Policy | Audley Travel

We work very hard to keep the information you give us safe. We follow strict security procedures on how your personal information is stored and used, and who sees it, to help stop any unauthorised person getting hold of it.

## Personal Information

We collect personal details, such as your name, address and email address only when you use our website to send us an enquiry, order a brochure, register with us for competitions, promotions or sign up to receive email newsletters from us.

We will only use that information to respond to your message and to help us get you the information or services you have requested. If you contact us, your email address may be used to send you our email newsletter from time to time, and you are free to unsubscribe from this at any time using the links provided. Your personal details, including your email address, will never be made available to a third party for the purposes of sending you marketing information. Remember that email is not necessarily secure. You should never send sensitive or personal information by email. Where we use forms to collect sensitive data, the page will be clearly marked as being secure and a "padlock" icon will display in your browser (usually bottom right or in your browser bar).

### We collect personal information from you in two main ways:

#### 1\. Automatically collected information

At no time is your private information, whether stored in persistent cookies or elsewhere, shared with third parties who have no right to that information. If you do not wish to have session or persistent cookies stored on your machine, you can turn them off in your browser.
