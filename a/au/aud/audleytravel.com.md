# Privacy policy | Audley Travel

When you travel with us, we want you to have the experience you’ve been imagining. And, when you’re looking for inspiration and help on planning your next trip, we want to give you the ideas you’re looking for. To help us do this, we need to ask you for a little personal information. But, we know how important it is to keep your personal information safe, and we’ll always be open with you about how we collect and keep it.

We’ll ask you for information such as your name and contact information, your email address, and, if you travel with us, your passport details. We collect your personal data for three main reasons:

  * When you visit our website or use our mobile and/or tablet apps, to give you the best possible experience, based on what you want to find out and which device you’re using.

  * So we can contact you successfully, if you get in touch or ask us for information.

  * And, when we’re planning your trip, to ensure that we make the right arrangements for you.




If you’re travelling with us, we’ll ask you to tell us a little more about yourself, such as any health conditions. We only do this so we can plan your trip around any special requirements you might have.

## How we share your personal information

We’ll only either ask you for personal information directly or, with your permission, gather it by tracking how you use our website or our mobile and/or tablet apps. We won’t share your personal information with third parties for any marketing activities.

When we do share your personal information, it’s always so we can provide you with a better service when you’re travelling with us.

## Safeguarding your personal information

We keep your personal information securely, and we only keep it for limited and appropriate amounts of time. If you’d like to stop receiving our email marketing, you can click ‘unsubscribe’ at any time. 

## Your rights to your personal information

You can contact us at any time if you have questions, concerns, comments, requests or complaints regarding our privacy policy or your personal information.

Please email us at [dataprotection@audleytravel.com](mailto:dataprotection@audleytravel.com).

If you have any comments regarding this privacy policy or the way we handle your personal information, you can also contact the UK Information Commissioner on telephone number 0303 123 1113 or by visiting <https://ico.org.uk/>.

## Changes to our privacy policy

From time to time, we might review our privacy policy and make changes to it. If we do this, we’ll always highlight it on our website and, where appropriate, let you know by email.

## 3\. How we share personal information

**3.** 1 In order to make sure that we run our business efficiently, and to make sure that you get the service that you expect, we will need to share your personal information, from time to time, as necessary, with the following third parties:

**(a)** Members of our group, which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding companies and their subsidiaries (including Audley Travel US, Inc.), as we share operations with some members of our group.

**(b)** Selected trusted third party business partners (such as the local businesses we partner with in the locations our customers travel to) and service providers (such as Campaign Monitor and Travelport) to perform services related to the contracts we enter into with you.

**(c)** Prospective buyers of our business or assets, which may include your personal information.

**(d)** Any other third parties if necessary to comply with legal obligations or enforce agreements, for example, we are required to provide airlines with a passenger mobile phone number and email contact details under IATA Resolution 830d for the airline to inform the passenger of any operational difficulties.

**(e)** Any other third parties if this is necessary to protect our or your rights, property, or safety and/or those of others.

**3.2** We do not share your personal information with third parties for them to use for the purposes of sending you marketing information or for those third parties to use your information for their own purposes.

## 4\. Automated decisions and profiling

**4.1** In performing certain of the functions above, we rely on technology that makes automatic and instantaneous decisions based on the criteria we determine to be relevant and the personal information we collect about you when you make an enquiry or request a brochure from us. We routinely test our software to improve the accuracy of these decisions and to prevent unintended bias. These decisions may affect the routing of and responses to your enquiries or requests, but we do not otherwise tailor our services based on the results of any automated decisions.

## 5\. Where we transfer and store personal information

From time to time we may process (or ask or permit a third party to process) your personal information outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) where local laws may not provide legal protection for your information in the same way as is applicable in the EEA.

For example, when you book a trip, we will need to provide your information to local accommodation or service providers. In other cases, we may need to share your information with an overseas service provider such as our local partners who host you during your safari experience, the provider of a cruise or experience train journey.

Whenever we send (or permit a third party to send) your personal data outside of the EEA, we will make sure that we take steps necessary to protect your data as required by applicable laws. For example, we may require the overseas recipient to enter into particular contract terms, or we will make sure that the information that we give to them will be limited to what is needed to perform our contract with you.

If you wish to learn more about the safeguards in place to protect your personal information when we transfer it outside of the EEA, please contact us using the details in section 10 below.

The personal data that we collect from you will also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. This includes staff involved in, among other things, providing support services.

## 6\. Security of your personal information

**6.1** We take the security of your information very seriously and have put physical, technical, operational and administrative strategies, controls and measures in place to help protect your personal information from unauthorised access, use or disclosure as required by law and in accordance with accepted good industry practice. We will always keep these under review to make sure that the measures we have implemented remain appropriate.

## 7\. Retention of personal information

**7.1** We will keep your personal information for limited and appropriate periods of time only and the applicable retention periods will always be linked to our purposes for processing your personal information. This means that the retention periods will vary according to the type of personal information. For example, some transaction information will be kept for a number of years in order to comply with various finance and tax related obligations. If you need more information on this, please contact: dataprotection@audleytravel.com
