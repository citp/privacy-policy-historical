Personal information is information or an opinion about an individual from which they can be reasonably identified. Depending on the circumstances, we may collect personal information from an individual in their capacity as a student, contractor, volunteer, stakeholder, job applicant, alumni, visitors or anyone else that comes into contact with the University.

In the course of American University of Sharjah activities, we may collect and hold:

• **Personal information** that includes, amongst other things, the name, address and other contact details, date of birth, next of kin details, attendance records, financial information and professional memberships.

• **Sensitive personal information** that includes, amongst other things, government identifiers (such as Emirates ID), religious beliefs, nationality, country of birth, photographic images, professional memberships, court orders and criminal records, and health information such as medical records, allergies, disabilities, immunization details and psychological reports.

As part of our recruitment processes for employees, contractors and volunteers, we may collect and hold:

• **Personal information** that includes, amongst other things, the name, address and other contact details, date of birth, next of kin details, attendance records, financial information, professional memberships, employment references, regulatory accreditation, media, directorships, property ownership, and driver's license information.

Generally, we will seek consent from a person in writing before we collect their sensitive personal information.

The collection of personal information depends on the circumstances in which American University of Sharjah is collecting this information. If it is reasonable and practical to do so, we will aim to collect this personal information directly from the individual.

## Solicited information

American University of Sharjah, where possible, standardizes the collection of personal information by using specifically designed forms (e.g. an Enrolment Form or Health Information Disclosure Form). However, we also receive personal information by other methods such as email, letters, notes, via our website, over the telephone, in face-to-face meetings, through financial transactions and through surveillance activities such as the use of CCTV security cameras or email monitoring.

We may also collect personal information from other people such as a third-party administrator, referees for prospective employees or from any other sources. However, we will only do so where it is not reasonable and practical to collect the personal information from an individual directly.

We may collect information based on how people use our website. We use ‘cookies’ and other data collection methods to collect information on website activity such as the number of visitors, the number of pages viewed and the internet advertisements which bring visitors to our website. This information is collected to analyze and improve our website, marketing campaigns and to record statistics on web traffic. We do not use this information to personally identify individuals.
