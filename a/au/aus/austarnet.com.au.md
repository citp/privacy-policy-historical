# AUSTARnet - privacy statement

AUSTAR cares about your privacy 

We appreciate that your privacy is important to you and AUSTAR will continue to protect the personal information you entrust to us. AUSTAR has compiled this brochure to advise you of how your personal information is handled. 

Privacy 

AUSTAR is committed to protecting your personal information and we agree to comply with the National Privacy Principles (NPPs) set out in the Federal Privacy Act and administered by the Federal Privacy Commissioner.

What are the National Privacy Principles? 

The NPPs regulate the way that organisations can collect, use, keep secure and disclose personal information. It also gives individuals the right to know what information an organisation holds about them and a right to correct that information if it is wrong. 

Why does AUSTAR need your information? 

The type of information we collect from you will depend on what AUSTAR products and services you use. When you become an AUSTAR customer you will need to provide certain details so that we can establish and manage your customer account. This includes information such as your name, contact details and information for identification purposes. AUSTAR may also request your credit card or bank account details and information to help us assess your credit application where this is relevant. We may also require information about your premises in order to assist with the installation of AUSTAR’s services. AUSTAR may offer products or services which will be supplied by other organisations and we will collect the relevant details in order to provide you with the products, services or information requested.

Use of Information by AUSTAR 

AUSTAR may use your information for purposes which you would reasonably expect, such as managing your account, billing, contacting you or providing customer support. AUSTAR also collects and uses information about your use of our services for monitoring and evaluation purposes so that we are able to provide our customers with improved and more relevant products. AUSTAR may use your information to notify you about new services or promotions from time to time. If at any stage you no longer wish to receive these communications from AUSTAR you can contact us and make this request. 

What information will AUSTAR disclose? 

The information we collect from you is strictly confidential. AUSTAR will not disclose your personal information to any third parties, other than those who are contracted to us to keep the information confidential. Some circumstances where contractors may be used to assist in the delivery of services include the installation and servicing of equipment and mailing houses. We may disclose information where you would reasonably expect us to do so or where the disclosure is for an activity related to the purpose your information was collected for in the first place. For example, AUSTAR may provide your information to organisations associated with the provision of AUSTAR’s services for marketing and analysis purposes, such as one of our TV channel providers. Again, if you do not wish to receive these communications you can contact us and make this request. AUSTAR may disclose personal information to a credit reporting agency for the purpose of assessing a credit application. Your information may also be disclosed to enable AUSTAR to ensure you meet your obligations under your agreement. There may be some exceptional circumstances for disclosing your information, such as when there are grounds to believe that the disclosure is necessary to prevent a threat to life or health, or for law enforcement purposes. 

How you can access your personal information? 

You are entitled to access personal information AUSTAR holds about you and to amend that information if it is incorrect. To do this, please write to, or email us at the address noted below and include your account details.
