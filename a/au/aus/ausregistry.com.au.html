		Privacy Policy</a>
		</h2>








<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>AusRegistry Pty. Ltd. (ACN 092 242 209) (AusRegistry, we, us or our) believe that privacy is an important individual right and is important to our own business and to our clients.</p>
<p>We are committed to ensuring the privacy of individuals and we will endeavour to abide by the National Privacy Principles, as set out in the Privacy Act (Cth) 1988.</p>
<p>This Policy sets out how we collect, use and manage personal information that we receive about individuals, and deals with the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Privacy Act 1988</li>
<li>Collection, use and disclosure of personal information</li>
<li>Protection of personal information</li>
<li>Your rights of access to personal information we hold about you</li>
<li>How to contact us</li>
</ul>
<p>These are set out below.</p>
<p><strong>Privacy Act 1988</strong></p>
<p>The Privacy Act 1988 (the Act), regulates the way in which many private sector organisations in Australia collect, use, store and disclose personal information.</p>
<p>Personal information is defined under the Act as:</p>
<p>“...information or an opinion (including information or an opinion forming part of a database), whether true or not, and whether recorded in a material form or not, about an individual whose identity is apparent, or can reasonably be ascertained, from the information or opinion.”</p>
<p>The Act aims to give people greater control over the way information about them is handled, by requiring organisations to comply with ten National Privacy Principles or to establish an approved privacy code.</p>
<p>The National Privacy Principles cover areas such as collection, use and disclosure of personal information, data quality and security and access and correction rights for individuals.</p>
<p><strong>How we collect personal information</strong></p>
<p>We generally collect personal information directly from the relevant individual but in some cases we may collect it indirectly from a third party, for example from domain name Registrars to whom you have given registration information. There may be other circumstances in which we may collect personal information about an individual, such as the operation of our website <a href="http://www.ausregistry.com.au" target="_blank">www.ausregistry.com.au</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Information about individuals</strong></p>
<p>Personal information collected by us generally comprises name, address, date of birth, gender and contact details (including telephone, facsimile and e-mail). Personal information is only accessible by authorised AusRegistry personnel or authorised service providers who use the information accurately to administer the business of AusRegistry or to provide you with our products and services.</p>
<p><strong>Why do we need your personal information?</strong></p>
<p>The personal information that we collect is used by us to conduct our business and is also used in conjunction with the provision of goods and services to you by AusRegistry.</p>
<p>Personal information may also be used in connection with:</p>
<ul>
<li>administering our customer relationships;</li>
<li>monitoring and evaluating products and services;</li>
<li>assisting customers with queries;</li>
<li>taking measures to detect and prevent fraudulent conduct; and</li>
<li>performing and responding to obligations that we have to regulatory or governmental authorities, for example displaying WHOIS information.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Third party service providers</em></p>
<p>There are other organisations that are connected to the services we provide to you and which may have access to your personal information. They include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Auditors and Legal Advisers – organisations that ensure we are complying with legislation and contractual obligations.</li>
<li>Insurance companies – organisations which provide insurance cover for our assets.</li>
<li>IT service providers – organisations maintaining our information technology systems and providing information technology services.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will only disclose personal information to these organisations to enable them to undertake specified management and administration services. We require our service providers to adhere to strict privacy guidelines and not to keep this information or use it for any unauthorised purposes.</p>
<p><em>Legal disclosure requirements</em></p>
<p>We will also disclose personal information in circumstances where we are required by law to do so. This includes disclosure to certain courts, tribunals and regulatory authorities as authorised or required by law.</p>
<p><em>Other people authorised by you</em></p>
<p>Where a person authorises another party to receive information and/or undertake transactions, the authorising person must notify us in writing.</p>
<p><em>Use of general statistical information</em></p>
<p>From time to time we may use general statistical information for future planning so that we can improve our business. If you do not consent to us doing so, please let us know.</p>
<p><em>Direct communication</em></p>
<p>We may send communication material to you from time to time, such as direct communications (which may include information from third parties) about special offers and promotions that are available for you, where you have elected to be included in our mailing list.</p>
<p>If you do not want us to use your personal information to send you direct marketing material, then please phone +61 3 98663710. In the case of e-mail communications, you may also use the “unsubscribe” facility contained in our e-mails. Once you have unsubscribed from our mailing list, we will refrain from contacting you unless we are directed to do so by any governmental or regulatory authority or in the case of an emergency situation.</p>
<p><em>WHOIS Lookup</em></p>
<p>We are required by the Australian regulator of domain names .au Domain Administration Ltd (auDA) to facilitate the WHOIS Lookup service. This service provides a means for the public to find information online relating to domain name registrants. auDA publishes its own policy on such information which we abide by. The current policy on can be found by clicking on the following link <a href="http://www.auda.org.au/policies/auda-2010-06/" target="_blank">http://www.auda.org.au/policies/auda-2010-06/</a></p>
<p><strong>How we manage your personal information?</strong></p>
<p>We take reasonable steps to keep any personal information which we hold about you secure, and to keep that information accurate and up to date.</p>
<p>Internally we have controls and procedures to ensure that personal information provided to us remains confidential. All our staff are bound by strict rules and duties of confidentiality.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, no data transmission over the internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we employ commercially reasonable security measures to protect data and seek to partner with companies which do the same, however, we cannot guarantee the security of any personal information transmitted to or from our website, and we are not responsible for the actions of any third party that may receive such personal information.</p>
<p><strong>Can you see the personal information we have about you?</strong></p>
<p>You have a right to know what information we hold about you, and you can <a href="/contact-us" target="_blank">contact us </a>and ask us to show you this information to ensure it is correct. Please note that information that we hold about you may be subject to the requirements of various regulatory or governmental authorities. In that regard, we will comply with the requirements of those regulatory or governmental authorities in releasing any information to you.</p>
<p>If you would like to review or make any corrections to your personal information you can <a href="/contact-us" target="_blank">contact us </a>in writing at the address designated in this document.</p>
<p>Under the National Privacy Principles there are limited circumstances in which access to some or all of this information may be denied. If this applies to you, we will explain this to you when you ask for your information. Otherwise we will endeavour to provide you with your information within a period of 30 days, depending on the amount of information required.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
<p>At times, we may utilise “cookies” which enable us to monitor traffic patterns and to serve you more efficiently if you revisit the site. A cookie does not identify you personally but it does identify your computer. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie and this will provide you with an opportunity to either accept or reject it in each instance.</p>
<p><strong>Hyperlinks to other web sites</strong></p>
<p>This website may contain hyperlinks to web sites owned and operated by third parties. These third party web sites have their own privacy policies and we urge you to review them. They will govern the use of personal information you submit whilst visiting these third party web sites. We do not accept any responsibility or liability for the privacy practices of such third party web sites and your use of such web sites is at your own risk.</p>
<p><br><strong>Dealing with us anonymously</strong></p>
<p>Where it is lawful and practicable, you can deal with us anonymously (e.g. general enquires about the services we can offer you).</p>
<p><strong>How you can help protect your privacy?</strong></p>
<p>You can help us to protect your privacy by:</p>
<ul>
<li>observing our security requirements relating to usernames and passwords; and</li>
<li>contacting us when your contact details change.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How can you contact us?</strong></p>
<p>If you want further information on how we handle your personal information, if you want to find out about or update the information that we hold about you, or if you want to complain about a possible breach of privacy, please contact us in one of the following ways:</p>
