# PRIVACY POLICY - Australia Network News

Australia Network News is strongly committed to protecting your privacy while interacting with our content, products and services. We want to provide a safe and secure environment for you and your children.

This policy applies only to Australia Network News and not to other companies’ or organisations’ websites to which Australia Network News is linked.

## Collection of information

Information is collected from you primarily to make it easier and more rewarding for you to use our services. Depending on the service you are accessing, you could be asked to provide information such as your name, email address or information about what you like and do not like. It is entirely your choice whether to respond to these questions or not.

Australia Network News collects two types of information. The first type is anonymous information. For instance, we may collect information to tell us that five thousand people visit this Privacy Policy today, but we do not know their names, where they live or their date of birth – they are ‘anonymous’ to us. Another example of Australia Network News collecting anonymous information is when Tune Media Pty Ltd audiences are invited to respond to surveys on the Tune Media Pty Ltd website. The surveys may ask you for demographic information such as your age, gender and postcode. This information is collected for research purposes, is used in the aggregate (where possible), and remains anonymous. Many of the individuals who access our services are anonymous to us.

The second type of information that Australia Network News collects is personal information. Australia Network News will collect personal information that lets us know the specifics of who you are such as your name, email address, or postal address, when you provide it to us. With this information, Australia Network News can provide a variety of personalized and enhanced services that are not available to anonymous users. We hope that you will find it beneficial to provide individually identifiable information about yourself to us because it will make our services more valuable to you.

## Use of anonymous information

Australia Network News automatically gathers anonymous information to monitor the use of Australia Network News like the numbers and frequency of visitors to Australia Network News and its areas, very much like television ratings that tell the networks how many people tuned in to a program. We only use such data in the aggregate. This collective data helps us determine how much our audiences use parts of the site, so we can improve Australia Network News to assure that it is as appealing as we can make it for as many users as possible. Australia Network News may publish or provide this aggregate data to other people.

## Use of personal information

Australia Network News will only use the personal information you have chosen to provide us for the purpose for which you provided it. Australia Network News will not use it for any other purpose without your consent.

## Disclosure

There will be occasions where it will be necessary for the Tune Media Pty Ltd to disclose your personal information to third parties. The Tune Media Pty Ltd may be required by law to disclose the information, or the Tune Media Pty Ltd may be required to disclose your personal information to third parties to provide the service you have requested, for example, if you purchase products online from the Tune Media Pty Ltd Shop, the Tune Media Pty Ltd will need to disclose your personal information to third parties in order to bill and deliver your products. However, the disclosure will only be made where it is necessary to fulfill the purpose for which you disclosed your personal information. Otherwise than stated above, we do not disclose personal information that you may give us, such as your name, address, email address or telephone number, to any organization or person outside the Tune Media Pty Ltd unless you have authorized us to do so. For example, when you contribute to an online forum you may want to publish your name and email address.

## No sale of personal information

Under no circumstances will Australia Network News sell or receive payment for licensing or disclosing your personal information.

## Access and correction: personal data

If Australia Network News holds your personal information the Tune Media Pty Ltd will where possible provide you with access to the information. The Tune Media Pty Ltd will take reasonable steps to correct the information so that it is accurate, complete and up to date.

## Security

The Tune Media Pty Ltd operates secure data networks that are designed to protect your privacy and security. Our website is scanned on a regular basis for security holes and known vulnerabilities in order to make your visit to our site as safe as possible. We also use regular Malware Scanning to ensure your data are safe with us.
