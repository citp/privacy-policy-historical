# AustralianSuper - Privacy Policy

### AustralianSuper respects your privacy

The following is information about AustralianSuper’s Privacy Policy and the way in which AustralianSuper has implemented the requirements of the Privacy Act 1988.

Protecting your personal information is important to AustralianSuper, and is required by law. The Commonwealth Privacy Act determines that AustralianSuper must handle your personal information in accordance with a set of National Privacy Principles.

AustralianSuper collects information that is necessary to administer your account and to keep you informed of opportunities available to you as a Fund member.

### Authorised use of information by others

AustralianSuper has appointed a Fund administrator, a life insurer and other organisations to provide services to you on our behalf. They are authorised to use your personal information only to administer your Fund account, under the strictest confidence.

From time to time, AustralianSuper may also commission certain external organisations to assist in the provision of services to members (eg. mail-houses, auditors, lawyers and independent consultants who conduct research on member satisfaction).

AustralianSuper provides members’ names and contact details to such organisations, but only for the purpose of providing, administering or improving member benefits or services.

Your personal information will not be used or disclosed for any other purpose without your consent, except where required by superannuation, taxation or other relevant law. For example, AustralianSuper’s fund administrator is required to report certain information to the Australian Taxation Office for tax related purposes.

### Your personal details

The personal information collected by AustralianSuper from you, or through your employer, includes your contact details, date of birth and Tax File Number (TFN), and, where relevant, may include certain details about your health, which you have provided.

Over time, this will be supplemented with financial and other information necessary to administer your account. Additional information may be collected from medical practitioners or from your employer for the purpose of assessing your eligibility for higher levels of insurance cover or for the assessment of a claim. We would only seek such information with your consent.

AustralianSuper has strict security measures in place, and staff who handle your personal information have the knowledge, skills and commitment to protect it from unauthorised access or misuse.

### Use and storage of information

When you fill out an application to join AustralianSuper, you are asked to provide information to assist us administer and keep you informed about your account. 

Where you do not complete a joining application, your name, date of birth, address and TFN, will be provided to AustralianSuper by your employer to enable us to accept and process your superannuation contributions. 

The information we collect and store about you includes: name, address, date of birth, TFN, and where you have requested insurance cover for Death, Total & Permanent Disablement (TPD) or Income Protection, certain information about your health.

If AustralianSuper is unable to collect certain personal information from you, such as contact details, date of birth and TFN, it may not be able to administer your benefits. Also, if you don’t provide your TFN, AustralianSuper will be unable to accept personal after-tax contributions from you and additional tax will be deducted from any employer or salary sacrifice contributions made by you or your employer.

### Secure storage of information

Once your details have been recorded by the Fund administrator, your original application is securely stored based on the following application method:

  * paper applications are held at the Fund’s document storage facility 
  * online applications are stored within our electronic secure network. 



Access to your information is restricted to staff who require the information to administer your account and provide information and services to you. A system of passwords and different levels of access is used to protect the information held on the system.

Your TFN is recorded in an encrypted form. It is provided to AustralianSuper to be used only for approved purposes as required by legislation.

### Information relating to your work

Information that we collect about your job title and occupation is used for statistical purposes only, and will not identify you personally. These details enable us to develop a profile of the Fund’s members, and assist in the future development of investment products and other Fund services. Providing this information is optional, as it is not essential information for the administration of your account.

### Nominating your dependants for death benefits

You are asked to advise AustralianSuper of the names of the persons who you would like to receive your superannuation in the event of your death. This information assists the Trustee to distribute your death benefit fairly to your dependants or to your estate.

The Trustee will take your wishes into account, but will also look at all your dependants at the date of your death. Advising AustralianSuper about your relationship with the persons you nominate is not required if you consider this to be an unreasonably intrusive request.

### Keeping your details up to date

In order to keep your information as current as possible, we ask that you let us know of any changes to your personal details.

### You decide on additional information

If you decide at any time that you do not wish AustralianSuper to advise you of opportunities and additional services open to you as a member of AustralianSuper, you can request to not receive this additional information by writing to us.

### Information provided to our insurer regarding insurance cover in AustralianSuper

Our Insurer provides insurance cover for AustralianSuper members for Death, Death and TPD and Income Protection.

AustralianSuper will advise our Insurer of the personal details about you that the Insurer requires to administer and assess insurance-related matters. This information includes your name, date of birth, contact details and information about your health that you have provided to AustralianSuper.

### Information about your health

Our Insurer may contact you to seek your consent to collect additional information about your health if you apply for higher levels of insurance cover. Your consent will always be obtained before any details are requested from your treating doctor or other health service providers.

### Incomplete or inaccurate information

If you submit incomplete or inaccurate information to our Insurer, they may not be able to provide you with the Insurance cover you are seeking, or complete their assessment of your insurance-related matters.

### Information required when making a claim

In the event that you claim for either TPD or Income Protection, the relevant Insurer may provide your personal information to AustralianSuper and our fund administrator, to assist with the assessment and administration of the insurance claim. The Insurer may also pass information to claims investigators, medical practitioners, reinsurers, insurance reference bureaus and certain organisations to whom they outsource some functions.

If your claim is declined and you take legal action or complain to the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal (SCT), AustralianSuper and our service providers must provide your personal details and information about your health to legal representatives of AustralianSuper and the Insurer, officers of the SCT and court officials.

In all cases where contractors and agents may become aware of your personal information, strict confidentiality arrangements apply. Personal information may only be used for the purpose of administering and assessing your insurance-related matters.
