**Austin Canoe & Kayak (ACK) Privacy Statement**

At ACK, we place the highest importance on respecting and protecting the privacy of our customers. Our most important asset is our relationship with you. We want you to feel comfortable and confident when using our Web site. Therefore, we would like to share with you the following principles that govern our information practices and other privacy aspects of our Web site. Throughout this policy, we refer to information that personally identifies you as "personal information." 

**We protect your information**

We work to protect your personal information from loss, misuse or unauthorized alteration by using industry-recognized security safeguards. We use both internal and external resources to review our security procedures. Our employees are trained and required to safeguard your information. 

**We tell you how we use your information**

When we ask you for information, we will tell you, — or it will be clear — what we need to know to fulfill your request and how the information you provide to us will be used. For example, if you order a product or register for a service from us, we will ask you for your name and contact information such as mailing address, phone number, and e-mail address. In addition to responding to your request, we may use your contact information to tell you about products or services we think might interest you or to invite you to participate in a product or service-related survey. Because of the financial nature of our business, our Web sites are not designed to appeal to children under the age of 13\. We do not knowingly request or receive any information from children. 

* We do not sell or rent your personal information to anyone.  
* We do not share your personal information with anyone outside of ACK for their promotional, including marketing, use.

**We tell you about our relationships with third parties**

We have limited relationships with third parties to assist us in servicing you, for example, by fulfilling customer orders or providing customer service. These service providers are contractually required to maintain the confidentiality of the information we provide them. When you request any of these products or services, you are permitting us to provide your personal information to the partner to fulfill your request. We may disclose your information if we are required to by a law enforcement action such as a court order, subpoena or search warrant. 

**We tell you how we use Web technology**

Like many Web sites, we use technology, such as cookies, that allow us to make your visit to our Web site easier by recognizing you when you return and help to provide you with a customized experience.
