  * required or permitted by law; or 
  * with your express or implied consent. 



### Direct Marketing and Your Privacy

From time to time we may use the personal information we collect from you to identify particular Australia Post products and services which we believe may be of interest to you. We may then contact you to let you know about these products and services and how they may benefit you. We will only do this with your consent and we will always give you a choice to opt put of receiving such information. 

### Direct Mail

Where we use your personal information to send you marketing information via the mail we may do so with your implied consent. You imply consent where we reasonably conclude that it has been given by the actions you take or do not take, such as by not ticking an "opt out" box on a form for one of our products and services. We will ensure that our opt out notices are clear, conspicuous and easy to take up.

### Electronic Marketing

Where we use your personal information to send you marketing information by e-mail, SMS, MMS or other electronic means we may do so with your express consent. You may give us your express consent by, for example, ticking a box on an electronic or paper form where we seek your permission to send you electronic or other marketing information.   
All of our electronic marketing activities will comply with the requirements of the Spam Act 2003 (Cth). 

### Telemarketing

  * **authorised or required by law**   
e.g. disclosure to various government departments and agencies such as the Australian Taxation Office, CentreLink, Child Support Agency, or disclosure to courts under subpoena. 
  * **in the public interest**   
e.g. where a crime, fraud or misdemeanour is committed or suspected, and disclosure against the customer's rights to confidentiality is justified. 
  * **with your consent**   
Your consent may be implied or express and it may also be verbal or written. 



### Use of third party service providers

When we temporarily provide personal information to companies who perform services for us, such as specialist information technology companies, mail houses or other contractors to Australia Post we require those companies to protect your personal information as diligently as we do. Stringent contractual and other quality assurance measures are used to ensure your personal information is protected. 

## Information collected on this web site

Our internet server logs the following information which is provided by your browser for statistical purposes only: 

  * the type of browser and operating system you are using. 
  * your Internet Service Provider and top level domain name (for example - .com, .gov, .au, .uk etc). 
  * the address of any referring web site (for example - the previous web site you visited), and 
  * your computer's IP (Internet Protocol) address (a number which is unique to the machine through which you are connected to the internet). 



All of this information is used by Australia Post for aggregated statistical analyses or systems administration purposes only. No attempt will be made to identify users or their browsing activities, except where required by or under law. 

### Cookies

A "cookie" is a packet of information that allows the Australia Post server (the computer that houses our web site) to identify and interact more effectively with your computer. 

When you access our web site, we send you a temporary or " **session cookie** " that gives you a unique identification number. A different identification number is sent each time you use our web site. Cookies do not identify individual users, although they do identify a user's internet browser type and your Internet Service Provider. Shortly after you end your interaction with our web site, the cookie expires or "crumbles". This means it no longer exists on your computer and therefore cannot be used for further identification or access to your computer. 

Without cookies certain personalised services cannot be provided to users of our website, accordingly you may not be able to take full advantage of all of the Australia Post website features if cookies have been disabled. 

### Cookie Policy

We use session cookies in the following manner: 

  * **Log-on and log-off administration** \- If you decide to register with our site, so as, for example, to use one of our online services, session cookies help with the log-on and log-off process. The cookies enable us to recognize your log-on ID when you log on so that we do not establish a duplicate registration record for you. 
  * **Transactions and site usability** \- We use session cookies to improve how you navigate through our website and conduct transactions. As examples, session cookies are used to maintain your online session as you browse over several pages; to store and prepopulate information so that you do not have to re-enter the same information twice. Session cookies may also be used to collect referral statistics when you click on a link or ad banner to or from www.auspost.com.au. 



Australia Post may also use " **persistent cookies** ". A persistent cookie is a small piece of text stored on your computer's hard drive for a defined period of time, after which the cookie is erased. Australia Post will not collect or link to personal information through persistent cookies without your express consent. 

We use persistent cookies as follows: 

  * **Site usage measurement** \- Our site measurement tool uses a persistent cookie to assist us in measuring how and when our web site and its various components are used. It functions as a "visit cookie," so that we can determine if you are a repeat visitor to our site. This allows us to know if we are attracting new visitors and what aspects of the site seem most useful. The cookie will expire 30 days after your last visit. 
  * **Log-off safety function** \- Australia Post uses a persistent cookie to automatically log you off of certain Australia Post sites if there has been no activity for 15 minutes. This is done for your safety to ensure that, if you have finished using our site, but have forgotten to log off, no one else can use your computer via your log-on and password. The cookie is permanently removed from your computer when you log off, or, if you have closed the browser without logging off, it is removed within 15 minutes from your last activity. 
  * **Opt-in cookies** \- Persistent cookies allow us, at your request, to recognize you when you return to www.auspost.com,au or to remember certain information that you have provided us. The recognition feature allows you to log on to certain Australia Post sites automatically, without having to enter your name and password each visit. The cookie assigns a random number to you, which we link to personal information you have provided and your site activity. This allows us to personalize the site for you and tailor the content to your needs, for instance to show you banner ads about other products you may be interested in. 



Other cookies allow us to remember certain information related to prior transactions, such as package tracking numbers, or mailing or address lists, so that we may prepopulate those fields for you on return visits. These features and cookies are strictly at your request and for your convenience. 

We will also present you with a convenient way to remove the cookies, via where you manage your account, if you decide later that you want to terminate one or more of these functions. The cookies will expire one year from your last visit. 

### Cookie Management

You can configure your internet browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies or notify you when a cookie is sent. Please refer to your internet browser's instructions or help screens to learn more about these functions.

## Information Security

Australia Post is committed to keeping your trust by protecting and securing your personal information. 

We employ appropriate technical, administrative and physical procedures to protect personal information from unauthorised disclosure, loss, misuse or alteration. 

We limit access to personal information to individuals with a business need consistent with the reason the information was provided. We keep personal information only for as long as the law requires. 

Australia Post protects your personal information by complying with industry best-practice standards, including: 

  * AS 8015-2005 Corporate governance of information and communication technology 
  * AS/NZS ISO/IEC 17799:2001 Information technology: Code of practice for information security management 
  * AS/NZS 7799.2:2003 Information security management - Part 2: Specification for information security management systems 
  * AS/NZS 4360:2004 Risk Management. 



### Web site security and privacy

The internet has dramatically changed the way we do business. It allows Australia Post to provide our products and services to you from the convenience of your own home or office. 

We understand that you may be concerned about the confidentiality and security of the personal information we collect from you online. 

Accordingly, we have systems in place to ensure our online dealings with you are as secure and confidential as your dealings with us in person, or on the telephone. 

In those instances where we secure your personal information in transit to us and upon receipt, we use the industry standard encryption software, Secured Socket Layer (SSL) 128 bit encryption. The URL in your browser will change to "HTTPS" instead of "HTTP" when this security feature is invoked. Your browser may also display a lock symbol on its bottom task bar line to indicate this secure transmission is in place. 

For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available to all users, we employ software programs to monitor network traffic in order to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause us damage. Except for authorized law enforcement investigations, no other attempts are made to identify individual users or their usage habits other than those uses identified in this policy. Unauthorized modification or misuse of information stored in this system will be investigated and may result in criminal prosecution. 

## Information Transfer

If Australia Post transfers personal information to countries outside Australia we will only do so in compliance with all applicable Australian data protection and privacy laws. 

Australia Post will take reasonable steps to protect personal information no matter what country it is stored in or transferred to. We have procedures and data transfer contracts as appropriate to help ensure this. 

## Children's Privacy

Australia Post believes it is important to provide added protection for children online. We encourage parents and guardians to spend time online with their children to participate in and monitor their online activity. When we collect personal information from children, we ask only for the minimum information necessary to seek access to the information or service for which the child is requesting. 

### Collection of Information from Children

When collecting personal information from children we will give a notice specifying what information we are requesting, how we will use it, whether it will be shared with a third party, and a contact at our Web site for questions. We will utilize the information only for the particular purpose for which it was given to us. 

### Obtaining Verifiable Parental Consent

We will use reasonable effort to obtain verifiable parental consent prior to the collection and use of personally identifiable information from children under 16. The method of parental consent verification may vary according to the information, product, service or event in which the child wishes to participate. 

Means of obtaining such consent may include, but are not limited to, offline consent such as printing and submitting a permission form by mail or fax, or online consent such as by ticking an on-line check box that parental or guardian consent has been obtained. 

### When Parental Consent is Not Required

We do not require parental or guardian consent in order to collect and use on-line or off-line contact information to: 

  * Respond directly to a child's request on a one-off time basis, or to answer a specific request, where the information is not used to re-contact the child for other purposes; 
  * Request the name or on-line contact information of a parent/guardian for the sole purpose of obtaining verifiable parental consent or providing parental notification; 
  * Respond directly more than once to a specific request from a child and the information is not used to recontact the child beyond the scope of the request. 



### Parental Review

Australia Post will allow parents or guardians to review any personal information collected from their children, based on verifying the identity of the consenting parent/guardian. 

Parents/Guardians may revoke their consent and delete information collected from their children at their discretion.
