# Australia Post - Privacy Policy

At Australia Post, protecting your privacy and the confidentiality of your "personal information" is very important to us and is fundamental to the way we serve you.

Personal information means information or an opinion (including information or an opinion forming part of a database) we hold about you from which we can determine your identity. For example, we may collect and use your name and address details when you acquire or use particular Australia Post products or services. Collecting and using this personal information ensures we can deliver our services to you as efficiently as possible.

At Australia Post, we know that giving your personal information to us imposes a serious responsibility upon us.

We are committed to protecting your personal information. Where your personal information may be disclosed, and to the extent that we can, we believe in giving you a choice as to whom we may disclose your personal information, who may use your personal information and how that personal information may be used. 

We believe that our Privacy Policy complies with the requirements of the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) and the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989 (Cth).

Generally, Australia Post will collect personal information directly from you, and only to the extent necessary to provide an Australia Post product or service, including our "agency" functions, or to carry out our internal administrative operations. For example, we may collect personal information from you when you fill in an application form, deal with us over the telephone, ask us to contact you after visiting our web site or have contact with us in person.

An "agency" function means a service that we provide to you on behalf of another organisation. Examples of this are POSTbillpay and giroPOST services.

We will collect personal information from you by lawful and fair means and not in an unreasonably intrusive way.

The type of personal information we may collect from you generally comprises name, address, age group, gender, contact details (including phone, fax and e-mail) and information collected as a result of you using or acquiring particular Australia Post products or services.

Generally, we collect your personal information in order to provide you with, or give you access to, a particular Australia Post product or service.

The personal information we collect from you ultimately allows us to provide you with better customer service.

We may also use or disclose your personal information for purposes related or ancillary to the main purpose for which we collect it and where such use or disclosure would be reasonably expected by you. Some examples are:

| 

Helping us to build a relationship with you  
  
---|---  
| 

Internal accounting and administration  
  
| 

Regulatory reporting and compliance  
  
| 

Protecting you and Australia Post from fraud  
  
| 

Helping us to identify and inform you about other Australia Post Products and services that may be of benefit to you.  
  
Also, we sometimes outsource some of our internal functions and activities to other companies. In the course of doing this, we may disclose your personal information, such as name and address details, to enable the service provider to undertake that particular function.

Our Privacy Policy requires that confidentiality agreements be in place specifically prohibiting these service providers from using or disclosing your personal information for any purpose other than the reason it was provided to them.

Occasionally, we may also collect, use or disclose your personal information for the secondary purpose of facilitating the distribution of marketing materials to you by Australia Post or a third party. We will not do this if you ask us not to do so.

There are other situations where we are compelled by law to disclose your personal information. For instance, under certain circumstances we may be compelled to provide your personal information to law enforcement agencies, the Australian Electoral Office, the Department of Family Services or the Australian Taxation Office.

We have a duty to keep confidential all personal information we hold about you.

Generally, our duty of confidentiality applies except where disclosure of your personal information is :

| 

**compelled by law**  
For example, disclosure to various government departments and agencies such as the Australian Taxation Office, and disclosure to courts under subpoena.  
  
---|---  
| 

**in the public interest**  
For example, where a crime, fraud or misdemeanour is committed or suspected, and disclosure against the customer's rights to confidentiality is justified.  
  
| 

**with your consent**  
Your consent is important to us. Your consent may be implied or express and it may also be verbal or written.  
  
You imply consent where we may reasonably conclude that you have given consent by the actions you take or do not take. For example, where you acquire or use an Australia Post product, service or agency function, you consent to Australia Post storing, using, maintaining and disclosing your personal information to the extent necessary for us to provide that particular Australia Post product or service to you.

If you do not consent to certain uses of your personal information we may not be able to provide that particular Australia Post product or service to you.

We reserve the right to make changes to the Australia Post Privacy Policy and this Privacy Statement from time to time or as required by law.

From time to time we may use the personal information we collect from you to identify particular Australia Post products and services which we believe may be of interest and benefit to you. We may then contact you to let you know about these products and services and how they may benefit you.

If you do not wish to receive direct marketing information from Australia Post, please tell us. Please note however that your instructions to one part of our business may take a little time to flow through to the rest of Australia Post.

If we have accurate personal information about you, it enables us to provide you with the best possible service. 

Australia Post takes reasonable steps to ensure the personal information we collect, use and disclose is accurate, complete and up-to-date.

If you find that the personal information we hold about you is inaccurate, incomplete or out-of-date, please contact us immediately and we will take reasonable steps to ensure it is corrected.

Where Australia Post does not agree with your view about the accuracy of the information and if you ask us to do so, we will take reasonable steps to note your claim where that information is stored and accessed.

Australia Post takes reasonable steps to protect your personal information from loss, misuse, unauthorised disclosure or destruction. Australia Post has in place generally accepted standards of technology and operational security in order to keep your personal information safe.

The internet has dramatically changed the way we do business. It allows Australia Post to provide our products and services to you from the convenience of your own home or office.

We understand that you may be concerned about the confidentiality and security of the personal information we collect from you online. Accordingly, we have systems in place to ensure our online dealings with you are as secure and confidential as your dealings with us in person, or on the telephone.
