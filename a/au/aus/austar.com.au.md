**Why does AUSTAR need your information?**

The type of information we collect from you will depend on what AUSTAR products and services you use. 

When you become an AUSTAR customer you will need to provide certain details so that we can establish and manage your customer account.

We may also require information about your premises in order to assist with the installation of AUSTAR’s services. 

AUSTAR may offer products or services which will be supplied by other organisations and we will collect the relevant details in order to provide you with the products, services or information requested.
