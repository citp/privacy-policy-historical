# Privacy Statement - AUSTAR Television

## AUSTAR cares about your privacy

We appreciate that your privacy is important to you. AUSTAR will continue to protect the personal information you entrust to us.

AUSTAR has compiled this page to advise you of how your personal information is handled including how it collects, holds, uses and discloses that information.

## National Privacy Principles

AUSTAR is committed to protecting your personal information. We comply with the National Privacy Principles (NPPs) set out in the Privacy Act 1988. The NPPs regulate the way that organisations can collect, use, keep secure and disclose personal information. It also gives individuals the right to know what information an organisation holds about them and a right to correct that information if it is wrong.

## What information do we collect and why?

The type of information we collect from you will depend on what AUSTAR products and services you use. Generally we collect personal information directly from you, for example when you subscribe to an AUSTAR service over the telephone. We may collect personal information about you from a third party for the purpose of marketing our products and services.

When you become an AUSTAR customer you will need to provide certain details so that we can establish and manage your customer account. This includes information such as your name, contact details and information for identification purposes. AUSTAR may also request your credit card or bank account details and information to help us assess your credit application where this is relevant. We may also require information about your premises in order to assist with the installation of AUSTAR’s services.

AUSTAR may offer third party products or services and we may collect information about you in order to provide you with the products, services or information requested.

## Use of information by AUSTAR

AUSTAR may use your information for purposes which you would reasonably expect, such as managing your account, billing, contacting you or providing customer support. AUSTAR also collects and uses information about your use of our services for monitoring and evaluation purposes so that we can improve and enhance our products and services.

AUSTAR may use your information to notify you about new services or promotions from time to time. If at any stage you no longer wish to receive these communications from AUSTAR you can contact us to let us know.

## What information do we disclose?

We may disclose information where you would reasonably expect us to do so, when you have consented or where the disclosure is for an activity related to the purpose for which your information was collected. For example, AUSTAR may provide your information to organisations associated with the provision of AUSTAR’s services, such as TV channel providers, for marketing and analysis purposes.

AUSTAR may disclose your personal information to a credit reporting agency for the purpose of assessing your credit application and maintaining a credit information file about you. The disclosures will include information relating to your credit application including identifying information about you, the fact you have applied for credit (and the amount). We may also subsequently disclose information about your credit relationship with us to a credit reporting agency.

AUSTAR may disclose your personal information to government agencies for the purpose of investigating and resolving disputes or complaints concerning your use of our services.

AUSTAR will not disclose your personal information to any third parties, other than those who are contracted to us to keep the information confidential. We use contractors to perform certain services on our behalf, for example the installation and servicing of AUSTAR equipment, customer service support, sales activities, and for mailing purposes.

There may be some exceptional circumstances for disclosing your information, such as when there are grounds to believe that the disclosure is necessary to prevent a threat to life or health, or for law enforcement purposes.

## Security and quality of your information

We take all reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we collect, use or disclose is accurate, complete, up-to-date and stored securely.

## How you can access your personal information

You are entitled to access personal information AUSTAR holds about you and to amend that information if it is incorrect. To do this, please contact us and include your account details.
