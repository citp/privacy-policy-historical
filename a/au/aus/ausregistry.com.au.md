### Privacy Act 1988

The __Privacy Act 1988__ (the ****Act**** ), regulates the way in which many private sector organisations in Australia collect, use, store and disclose personal information.

Personal information is defined under the Act as:

__“…information or an opinion about an identified individual, or an individual who is reasonably identifiable, whether the information or opinion is true or not and whether the information or opinion is recorded in a material form or not.”__

The Act aims to give people greater control over the way information about them is handled, by requiring organisations to comply with thirteen Australian Privacy Principles or to establish an approved privacy code.

The Australian Privacy Principles cover areas such as collection, use and disclosure of personal information, data quality and security and access and correction rights for individuals.

#### How we collect personal information

We generally collect personal information directly from the relevant individual but in some cases we may collect it indirectly from a third party, for example from domain name Registrars to whom you have given registration information. There may be other circumstances in which we may collect personal information about an individual, such as the operation of our website www.ausregistry.com.au.

#### Information about individuals

Personal information collected by us generally comprises name, address, date of birth, gender and contact details (including telephone, facsimile and e-mail). Personal information is only accessible by authorised AusRegistry personnel or authorised service providers who use the information accurately to administer the business of AusRegistry or to provide you with our products and services.

#### Why do we need your personal information?

The personal information that we collect is used by us to conduct our business and is also used in conjunction with the provision of goods and services to you by AusRegistry.

Personal information may also be used in connection with:

  * administering our customer relationships;
  * monitoring and evaluating products and services;
  * assisting customers with queries;
  * taking measures to detect and prevent fraudulent conduct; and
  * performing and responding to obligations that we have to regulatory or governmental authorities, for example displaying WHOIS information.



__Third party service providers__

There are other organisations that are connected to the services we provide to you and which may have access to your personal information. They include:

  * Auditors and Legal Advisers – organisations that ensure we are complying with legislation and contractual obligations.
  * Insurance companies – organisations which provide insurance cover for our assets.
  * IT service providers – organisations maintaining our information technology systems and providing information technology services.



We will only disclose personal information to these organisations to enable them to undertake specified management and administration services. We require our service providers to adhere to strict privacy guidelines and not to keep this information or use it for any unauthorised purposes.

__Transfer outside of Australia__

Our holding, use and disclosure of your personal information may involve transfer of the personal information to countries outside Australia. Where your personal information is transferred outside Australia, we will do so in accordance withAustralian Privacy Principle 8, including taking reasonable steps to ensure that the overseas recipient does not breach the Australian Privacy Principles.

__Legal disclosure requirements__

We will also disclose personal information in circumstances where we are required by law to do so. This includes disclosure to certain courts, tribunals and regulatory authorities as authorised or required by law.

__Other people authorised by you__

Where a person authorises another party to receive information and/or undertake transactions, the authorising person must notify us in writing.

__Use of general statistical information__

From time to time we may use general statistical information for future planning so that we can improve our business. If you do not consent to us doing so, please let us know.

Where we receive personal information about you that is unsolicited, if it is not reasonably necessary for one or more of the uses set out herein, we shall de-identify or destroy it as soon as practicable.

We may send relevant communication material to you from time to time, such as direct communications (which may include information from third parties) about special offers and promotions that are available for you, where you have given express or implied consent to be included in our mailing list. __
