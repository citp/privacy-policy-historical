This Privacy Policy applies to all Auslogics Labs Pty Ltd ("Auslogics") owned websites and domains ("Auslogics Websites") and all software products developed and published by Auslogics (“Auslogics Products”). Auslogics Websites and Auslogics Products may provide links to third-party websites and products. If you access those links or install and use those products, that interaction will not be covered by this Privacy Policy, as Auslogics has no control over third-party websites, products and their policies. We do not endorse or make any representations about third-party websites or products. Auslogics specifically disclaims any and all liability, in contract or in tort, arising from your use of any link to any third-party website, or your use of any third-party product. The personal data you choose to give to unrelated third parties is not covered by the Auslogics Privacy Policy. We encourage you to review the privacy policy of any company before submitting your personal information. Some third-party companies may choose to share their personal data with Auslogics; that sharing is governed by that third-party company's privacy policy.
