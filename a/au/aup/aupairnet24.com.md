Any such background checks will be subject to the terms we establish for such checks on the Site pages where they are requested or authorized, the terms of this Privacy Policy, and our Terms of Use.

      6. #### By other sources

In addition, we may obtain information about you from other sources (e.g., partners, researchers, marketers, etc.), such as demographic data, and other information to enable us to comply with regulatory requirements, ensure the accuracy of data, better understand your likely interests, prevent fraud, etc. We may combine information that we collect from you with information about you from such other sources and use it in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

    3. ###  Information you expressly authorize us to collect 

We may from time to time request permission to collect certain information from or about you. For example, if you use a Care.com mobile application, we may request permission to access information about the contacts listed in your mobile device phone book when you initiate an address book search for friends who have downloaded the application. We may also request permission to access and store your location (e.g., your precise GPS-based functionality on the mobile devices used to access the Site and Services). If you grant your permission, we will access and/or store such information unless you subsequently opt out by adjusting the settings in your mobile device. See your device manufacturer's instructions for further details. 

    4. ###  Automatically collected information 

We may automatically collect certain information about the computer or devices (including mobile devices) you use to access the Site and Services as described in this section below.

      1. #### Log files, IP addresses and information about your computer and mobile device

When you visit the Site, Care.com receives the internet protocol ("IP") address of your computer (or the proxy server you use to access the internet), your computer operating system, the type of web browser you are using, and browser language. If you are using a mobile device, Care.com may also receive unique device identifiers and other information about your mobile or other device(s), and mobile operating system. We may correlate this information with other information we have about you. We may also automatically collect information related to the ways in which you interact with the Site and the Services, such as referring and exit pages, URLs, platform type, the number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages and content viewed (including ads viewed) and the order of such views, the amount of time spent on particular pages, the date and time you use the Services, error logs, and other similar information. 

      2. #### Cookies and other technologies

A cookie is a tiny data file that resides on your computer, mobile phone, or other device, and allows us to recognize you when you return to the Site using the same computer (or mobile device) and web browser. Like most websites, we and our service providers use cookies, and tracking pixels to track Site usage and trends, evaluate the effectiveness of our ads both on and off our Site, customize your experience on the Site and improve the quality of our Services. For example, using these technologies we can determine, among other things, which pages of our Site you visit and which ads you click on. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can modify your browser settings to decline cookies. In some cases, however, doing so may impact your ability to use Care.com. Tracking pixels do not identify individual users, and the analysis of data obtained by tracking pixels is performed on an aggregate basis. 

      3. #### Online analytics and advertising

When you visit our Site or open one of our emails, we may allow authorized third parties, such as ad servers, ad agencies, ad exchanges, ad technology vendors, and research firms, to place or recognize a unique cookie, pixel, and/or similar technologies on your browser in order to provide you relevant Care.com advertisements as you surf the Internet. These advertisements may be targeted to you based on information these authorized third parties know or infer about you and include in the cookies placed on your browser, and/or on information about your Internet browsing activities gathered through your browser. If you prefer not to receive these online behavioral advertisements, you may opt-out [here ](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp) or [here](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/). In order for the opt-out to work, your browser must be set to accept third party cookies. Furthermore, if you buy a new computer or mobile device, change web browsers or delete the opt-out cookie, you will need to perform the opt-out task again. Please note that if you opt-out you may continue to receive Care.com advertisements as you surf the Internet, including contextual ads based on the content on a webpage you are visiting. However, these advertisements will not be displayed based on information contained in, or collected by, cookies or other technologies placed on your browser when you visit our Site or open our emails.

We also use Google Analytics to measure Site usage and improve our visitor experience. The relevant data is provided to us by Google in the aggregate (i.e., individual users are not identified) and allows us to better understand our Site audience. The Google Analytics features implemented by us allow us (i) to evaluate and generate reports on certain demographic, behavioral, and interest metrics of users collected by Google, and (ii) to create advertising remarketing audiences and campaigns based on such metrics, which may be segmented into aggregated groups.

Visitors can opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising and customize Google Display Network ads using the Ads Settings form at <https://www.google.com/settings/ads>. 

**Do Not Track Notice.** Some browsers used to access the Internet may give you the option through "Do Not Track" settings associated with such browsers to request that a website operator not track your information across its website or other websites. We engage in such tracking in order to optimize and/or customize our Services, detect and respond to allegations of fraud, and to otherwise ensure the safety of our Registered Users and Site Visitors. While we do not currently honor such browser requests, we will not use your information in a manner that violates this Privacy Policy. In addition, you retain the ability to opt out of certain online analytics and advertising activities as discussed in this section above.

      4. #### Social media features and widgets 

Our Site includes social media features and widgets, such as the Facebook "Like" button and the Facebook "Share" button. These features may collect your IP address, the URL of the page you are visiting on our Site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it. 

  2. ##  How We Use Information

In addition to using the information collected by Care.com for the purposes described above, we may also share your information with various third parties, as described below. Please review our sharing policy closely. By using our Site or our Services, you agree to allow us to share the information you provide to us in the ways described below. Your ability to make changes to what information is shared is described below in Section IV. 

      1. #### With All Site Visitors and Registered Users

If you are a Care Seeker or a Care Provider, in order to increase your chances of finding a job or finding the care you need, we share with Site Visitors and Registered Users the information that is included in your job posting or profile, aside from your contact information, as well as the following registration information, which we may include in your job posting or profile: your first name, first initial of your last name, city, state, profile picture, and if you are a Care Provider, your gender and, unless you opt-out, your age. With certain exceptions, you choose how much detail you want to include in either your job posting or your profile. We may also share on your profile or job posting any company reviews you have posted on our Site, whether you have connected to Care.com through Facebook, and any connections you have with other Care.com members, including the nature of those connections. If you are a Care Provider and have elected to verify certain information with Care.com or to have a background check performed, we may also disclose that information in your profile as a Registered User in addition to your response rate and any payment or payroll preferences you have indicated. 

If you post information in a Care.com online group forum, such as the Working Moms Group, that information may be viewed by any Site Visitor or Registered User who accesses the forum. 

We may display personal testimonials of Registered Users and other endorsements on our Site or in other marketing materials. These testimonials or endorsements may include information such as the Registered User's first name, first initial of last name, town and state. With a Registered User's consent, we may include their full name. 

      2. ####  With other Registered Users and corporate providers

In addition to the information that is provided to all Registered Users and Site Visitors, Care Provider reviews and references are made available to certain Registered Users. If you are a Care Provider, your phone number may be visible to certain Registered Users if you elect to share it in your profile. In addition, your approximate residential location (through Google map plotting) is made available to certain Registered Users and Site Visitors unless you elect to keep that information confidential. 

If you are a Care Seeker or a Care Provider, you will appear in search result listings if you match the search criteria used by a Care Provider or Care Seeker, as applicable. Similarly, you may appear in emails sent to Care Providers or Care Seekers in your area. Care Seekers may opt-out of being included in Care Provider search results and in certain emails sent to Care Providers. In addition, if you are a Care Seeker and you view the profile of certain Care Providers, those Care Providers will be able to see that you have viewed their profiles unless you opt-out of that information sharing. 

If you are a Registered User, your Care.com online status may be made available to other Registered Users unless you elect to keep that information confidential.

If you connect to Care.com through Facebook, we may allow any of your Facebook friends who have connected to Care.com through Facebook to see that you are a Registered User. In addition, other Registered Users who have connected to Care.com through Facebook will be able to see if you are friends with any of their Facebook friends or if you share certain affinities or interests with them. 

If you register for our Karoo mobile application, other Registered Users of that application may search for you by name, email address, or other information. If they do, your name and profile photo will appear in the search results list and the searcher may contact you through the application to request to join your network or invite you to join theirs. No other information on the application will be shared with the Registered User unless you expressly allow them into your Karoo network. However, all information you post to the Karoo application will be available to all members of your network, including your precise GPS location when you post to the application if you have given us permission to access and collect your precise GPS location information. 

If you fill out a form to request information from a specific corporate Care Provider, such as a specific day care or tutoring center, the contact information you submit on a form for the provider will be forwarded to that provider. Similarly, if you call a corporate Care Provider directly or click to a corporate Care Provider's site from the Care.com site, any information you provide over the phone or on the provider's site will be provided by you directly to the provider. 

In addition, if you utilize our Backup Care Services or the Senior Care Planning Services to obtain information about senior care or other care options for yourself or your loved ones, information you provide Care.com, including contact, health, financial, and other information about yourself or your loved ones may be forwarded to third party Backup Care Providers or Senior Care Services providers that may meet your stated needs and preferences so they may evaluate your needs and preferences and contact you. If you provide information about someone other than yourself, you represent that you have authority to provide us the information and to authorize us to share the information in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy. Once provided to a corporate Care Provider, the information is subject to the privacy policies of the corporate Care Provider. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a corporate Care Provider may share information about you and your dependents who are receiving their services, including contact information, utilization information, and medical and health-related information, with Care.com and our subsidiary, Care Concierge, Inc. Such shared information would be subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

**If we terminate your registration for any reason, we reserve the right to send a notice of your termination to other Registered Users with whom we believe you have corresponded.**

      3. #### With vendors/service providers

We also share information with vendors with whom we have a contractual relationship and who perform services for Care.com including, without limitation, vendors who provide email, demographic information, or geo-location information services, vendors who perform background checks or Preliminary Membership Screens, vendors who process or accept credit card payments, vendors who run classified advertising businesses, vendors who send SMS messages to Registered Users' mobile phone numbers, vendors who provide services that enable us and other third parties to detect and prevent fraud, in each case to the extent applicable. In certain cases (such as for vendors who help facilitate our online communication services or provide fraud detection and prevention services), the information we share may include the contents of written and audio messages you send through our online communication platforms.

We have implemented Google's Invisible reCAPTCHA technology on our site. Use of the Invisible reCAPTCHA is subject to the [Google Privacy Policy](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/) and [Terms of Use](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/).

      4. #### With listings in and through Google and other public search engines, social media sites (e.g. Facebook, Google+), and on other third party websites)

In an effort to further facilitate the ability of Care Seekers or Care Providers to find a caregiver or job, selected information contained in Care Seeker job postings and Care Provider profiles, which may include photo, first name, first initial of last name, city, state, and job/provider description, may also be shared with third party search engines, social media sites, and other third party websites or vendors who run classified advertising and other businesses, and thus may be listed in third party web site search results and on third party websites, which would make that information available to the public and allow them to link to your Care.com posting. Registered Users can opt-out of this sharing by adjusting their [account settings](https://web.archive.org/account-preferences-p1016.html). If you post information in a Care.com online group forum, such as the Working Moms Group, your content, including your name as the contributor, may be displayed in third party search engine results and available to the public. 

      5. #### With Facebook if you connect to Care.com through Facebook

If you connect to Care.com through Facebook's API, you may elect to post certain of your activities on Care.com back to your Facebook account. You will be prompted to decide whether or not to share those Care.com activities back to your Facebook account. 

      6. #### With third parties to send you direct mail from other companies 

We may share certain of your information, such as your name, postal address and other information we know about you such as your age, presence of children, and the type of care you are looking for, to third parties in the business of facilitating communications, such as direct mail brokers, to enable them to send you postal mail advertisements from companies whose products we believe may be of interest to you. We do not share email addresses for this purpose, and we do not allow these third parties to provide your information directly to the companies whose products are being advertised. If you do not want to receive these advertisements and prefer that we do not share your information with these third party communication facilitators for that purpose, you may opt-out by adjusting your [account settings](https://web.archive.org/account-preferences-p1016.html). 

      7. ####  As required by law or for reasons of safety 

We may disclose your information when we believe in good faith that such disclosure is appropriate in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding possible illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the health or physical safety of any person, violations of this Privacy Policy, the Terms of Use, or the Backup Care Terms of Use, and/or to protect the rights and property of Care.com, our employees, users, and the public. This may involve the sharing of your information with law enforcement, government agencies, courts, and/or other organizations

      8. #### With employers that provide Care.com as part of their benefits program

If you enroll in Care.com as part of your employer's benefits program, you acknowledge and agree that we may disclose information about your utilization of the Site and the Services to your employer, including without limitation the type of care sought and number of jobs posted, statistics on provider searches, and messages sent or received in relation to your use of your Care.com subscription; the number of inquiries and types of care sought in relation to your use of Assisted Search; days and hours of care used through the Backup Care Service; names and ages of dependents for whom the Backup Care Services are utilized; the type of Backup Care utilized (i.e., adult or child); and your utilization of the Senior Care Planning service. Care.com also may share this information with third parties designated by your employer to receive it. 

      9. #### With Your Consent

We also may share your information with a third party if you consent to the sharing. 

      10. #### Background Checks

Care.com offers various background check services from consumer reporting agencies. A Care Provider can authorize a Motor Vehicle Records Check, Criminal Records Check, Criminal+ MVR Check, or an Investigative Criminal Plus check in response to a request by a Care Seeker who is considering hiring him or her. If you authorize a background check to be run on you in response to a request by a Care Seeker who is considering hiring you, the results of the check will be shared directly with the Care Seeker. If you are a Registered User who has requested a background check through Care.com, a statement may be included in your profile to confirm that you have completed that check. The service provider who completes the background check may also send the results to you by email or postal mail. **You acknowledge that sensitive material may be included in your background check, and that you are responsible for providing us and our service provider (if applicable) with correct information.**

Through certain pages of the Site, Care.com may from time to time offer to individuals who may or may not be Registered Users the opportunity to purchase Investigative Criminal or Investigative Criminal Plus background checks on caregivers who may or may not be Registered Users. If you authorize an Investigative Criminal or Investigative Criminal Plus Check to be run on you in response to such a request, the results of the check will be shared directly with the requester. If you are a Registered User of the Site and have requested such a background check, a statement may be included in your profile to confirm that you have completed that check. However, we will not share the check or results with any other Site Visitor or Registered User unless you specifically consent. The service provider who completes the background check may send the results to you by email or postal mail.

      11. #### Business transactions 

In the event we go through a business transition such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your information may be among the assets transferred. You acknowledge and consent that such transfers may occur and are permitted by this Privacy Policy, and that any acquirer of ours or that acquirer's affiliates may continue to process your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy. 

  4. ##  Your Choices Regarding the Sharing of your Personal Information 

Registered Users have control over what optional information they choose to share with us when utilizing our Services (such as pictures, certain details in a job description or profile, etc.). 

In addition, Registered Users have the following opt out choices with respect to the sharing of their information:

    * Registered Users can opt out of having their Care.com online status visible to other Registered Users who are on Care.com.
    * Registered Users can opt out of having information contained in their job postings or caregiver profiles shared with third party web sites to be listed in third party search engine results such as Google.
