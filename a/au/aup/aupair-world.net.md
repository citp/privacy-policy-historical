##  General

We respect your privacy and consider the protection of your personal data to be a particular quality feature of the services we provide. We therefore strictly adhere to the rules and regulations of data protection law.

The following statement gives you an overview of how we ensure your data is protected. We would like to explain to you as a visitor to our website and user of our services what type of data we collect and why and how we use this data.

##  Collection, processing and transmission of data

##  Information on cancellation

**You may cancel permission to use your data at any time with effect from that time onwards.** To do so, send us an e-mail with the subject “Cancellation” to support(at)aupair-world.net. Your account will then be disabled and you will no longer be able to be traced in the system by a third party. This does not establish any claim to reimbursement of the user fees.

##  Use of cookies

This website uses so-called "cookies"; these are text files, which are stored on your computer and make it possible to analyse your use of the website. The information generated through the “cookie” regarding your use of this website is used in order to assess your activity on the website and to improve the services we offer. The information obtained is used only for internal statistical assessments and is not passed on to third parties.  
You can prevent the installation of cookies through a corresponding setting on your browser software; however we would like to point out that in this case you might not be able to use all the functions of this website in their entirety.

##  Assessment of user behaviour

We automatically collect and save information on our servers which your browser leaves with us whilst you are surfing. We compile the complete Uniform Resource Locators (URL) clickstream anonymously through and from our website, i.e. the sequence of the pages on our website which you look at, including the date and time of the content, which you have viewed or searched for. During your visits we sometimes use JavaScript to collect and evaluate information, including the length of time it takes to load a web page, errors during downloads, the duration of a visit to a single page, information on interaction between pages (e.g. scrolling, clicking, mouse-overs) and about how you leave our site.

The most important data which we save is, in brief:  
browser type/version  
operating system used  
referrer URL (the page visited previously)  
host name of the accessing computer (IP address, short form)  
time of server inquiry  
visitor history

We cannot assign this data to individual persons unless they are registered. This data is not combined with other data sources and is deleted after a statistical evaluation.

After your registration we additionally capture your IP address and the time of your registration from the data entered by you. By registering you agree that we may evaluate your data anonymously. This is necessary to be able to continue to offer high quality services at Aupair World. For this purpose we compare the data you have entered with other freely accessible data on the Internet. This enables us to identify undesired entries (joke entries, agencies, human trafficking, etc.). However, Aupair World does not guarantee the quality of the entries.

##  Use of social plugins

As a modern service provider our will is to be active in the field of social media. For this purpose, three social platforms (Facebook, Google+ and Twitter) have provided specific buttons.Through the connection created by these buttons, information will normally be sent to Twitter, Facebook and Google+ when accessing a web page regardless of whether the user explicitly gave consent or not. To avoid the transmission of your personal data to Twitter, Facebook and Google+, these social media functions are deactivated by default on [www.aupair-world.net](http://www.aupair-world.net/) . Thus no information will be passed on to third parties unless you agree to it. Only once you have activated the social media functions and you have given your consent to the sending of your data to Facebook, Google+ and Twitter, the buttons will be activated, thus establishing a connection to this service. 

Among other things, in addition to the web address of the visited page, an identifier is transmitted which establishes a connection between the visitor of a particular page and his profile on Facebook, for instance. None of these platforms give concrete information on which further data is also passed on. Please find the privacy policies of the three platforms here: [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/), [Google+](http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/privacy). 

##  Data Protection Officer

It is important to Aupair World that data processing is carried out efficiently and securely under data protection law. In order to provide evidence of this also to external parties, we have appointed an external Data Protection Officer.
