Information About You  
Our site's registration form requires you to provide personal information (including without limitation name, email address, street address, telephone number and fax number). We will also collect transaction information (including without limitation prices, item descriptions, shipping destinations and other transaction-related information) about the listings and bids you place and transactions you conduct through our site. Without your permission, we do not intend to sell or rent any of your personally identifiable information to third parties. When you voluntarily list equipment for sale, place bids on equipment, purchase products or services, or enter into transactions with other users or third parties through our site, these parties may be provided with your personally identifiable information and transaction information in connection with such activities and transactions. 

We do presently aggregate personally identifiable information and knowingly disclose such information in aggregate for a number of business purposes, but in these situations we do not, in the normal course, disclose to other entities any information that could be used to personally identify you. 

We use this information in the normal operation of the site and we may disclose this information on an aggregated basis. Also, we may use information we obtain from you to display on our site ads or offers from advertisers that we think may be relevant to you, but in these cases we do not disclose any personally identifiable information about you to third parties. 

We automatically track certain technical information about your use of our site. This information may include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on our site or not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on our site or not), what browser you are using, and your IP address. 

We may also use cookies on our site. Cookies are small pieces of information stored on your computer hard drive, not on our site. Among other things, cookies can permit you to enter your password less frequently during a session. Cookies can also help us provide information that is targeted to your interests so that we may focus our resources on features that are the most popular. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although in that case you may be required to reenter your password multiple times during a session. 

If you send us correspondence, such as emails or letters, or if other users or third parties send us correspondence about your use of our services, we may collect such information into a file specific to you. We use information in the file we maintain about you, and other information we obtain from your current and past use of the service, to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our user agreement. 

Your Email Address and Personalized Content If your registration form indicates that you want to receive email updates about AuntMinnie, as part of our service we may send to you periodic emails and newsletters containing information about us, updates on new product and service features, product and service usage tips, information about third party services that are likely to be of interest to our customers, and customer satisfaction questions. Right now, we think we will send these emails weekly. 

If your registration form indicates that you want AuntMinnie to share your name with advertisers, or if you otherwise expressly indicate to us that you would like to receive information about products and services from third parties, we may disclose your name and email address to these parties. 

If your registration form indicates that you want us to personalize your content based on your profile, we may use the information you provide to us to filter the content we deliver to you and to provide you with content we believe may be relevant to you. 

If you do not want us to send you periodic emails, do not want us to provide your name and email address to advertisers, or do not want us to personalize content for you, you should make sure that the applicable box on the registration form is not checked when you submit it. In addition, at any time you can opt-out of these services by sending an email with "UNLIST" in the subject line to unlist@auntminnie.com and telling us which of the foregoing services you do not want. You can also opt-out by notifying us in a letter at AuntMinnie.com, 1350 North Kolb Road, Tucson, Arizona 85715, Attention: Technical Service. 

In addition to the periodic emails described above, we may use your email address to send you administrative notices about your account (such as notices about pending activities). 

Third Party Collectors of Information and Public Information. Our policy only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. Other sites (including those third party sites or services that we co-brand) may have their own policies and practices, which we do not control, and thus are not addressed by this policy. To the extent that you disclose your information to other parties, such as other users or third party suppliers of products and services that link to our site or with which we co-brand, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the personal information you disclose to them. To the extent that we use third party advertisers, they adhere to their own privacy customs and policies. Since we do not control the privacy policies of third parties, we encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others. 

Our site may make electronic storefronts, chat rooms, forums, message boards and/or newsgroups available to you. You should bear in mind that any information disclosed in these areas is public information and may be disclosed to and used by third parties. 

Nondisclosure Can't Be Guaranteed  
Unfortunately (and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this policy), due to the existing regulatory and technical environment, we cannot guarantee that all of your communications and other personally identifiable information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. By way of example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be forced to, or deem appropriate to, disclose information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access your transmissions or communications. Further, we can (and you authorize us to) disclose any information about you to law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate. Therefore, although we attempt to use standard practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personally identifiable information or communications will remain private. 

Security  
We currently use standard efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your personally identifiable information, such as firewalls and SSL technology. These are the same technologies that many websites use to safeguard credit card information and other personal information. However, that said, "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet (or anywhere, for that matter.) Under no circumstances will we have any responsibility or liability of any kind for any breaches of this Privacy Policy. 

In order to use SSL security technology, we require that you have either Netscape Navigator version 3.0 or later OR Microsoft Internet Explorer version 3.0 or later.
