**II. INFORMATION WE COLLECT VIA OUR SITES**

**Information We Collect from Unregistered Visitors**

You must register to access our full Services; however, you may be able to access certain limited areas of the Sites without disclosing any personally identifiable information. We will collect non-personally identifiable information, i.e., information that is not traced back to any individual and is not used on its own to identify an individual. 

Even if you have not registered, AuntMinnie will collect such data including: the referring website, if applicable, the type of browser you use, the time and date that you accessed the Services, the pages you visited and viewed throughout our Sites, and what computers responded to a market research survey. 

Taken in aggregate, this information enables us to better develop and fund the Services, provide content, and respond to our users’ needs. We will explain how this is done in the "Information Collected through Tracking Technology" section of this Privacy Policy. 

**Information We Collect from Registered Users**

**_Account Registration:_** You must register to access our full Services. When you register for the Services, you are asked to provide identifying information such as your name, email address, zip code and other professional information, e.g. profession and science application. Additional information may be requested, which may be required to access some Services. We may collect additional information about registered users from third-party sources to assist us in providing the Services. For example, we may use such third-party sources to verify and update registration information and confirm licensure status. 

**Information We Collect through Services We Offer**

**_Market Research:_** Registered users of the Services may opt-in to receive offers to participate in market research studies offered by AuntMinnie. From time to time, registered users may also be invited to participate in a sponsored or unsponsored market research study through an email invitation, mail, on-site popup or some other means. In order to participate in any such survey, you will be required to agree to additional terms and conditions as part of the opt-in process. 

Furthermore, in addition to providing your responses to the survey questions you may be asked to provide personally identifiable information that may be combined with information that you have already provided at registration or that we have received from a third-party source. These studies are intended to give specific anonymous feedback to third parties as described in the "IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT CONSENT" section of this Privacy Policy. 

**_Reporting Compensation and Tax Information:_** If you participate in a survey that pays compensation, AuntMinnie may have an obligation to report such payments. By participating in a market research survey, you are permitting us to disclose your earned compensation as appropriate to comply with all laws and other reporting requirements. In addition, IRS regulations prevent us from paying individuals in excess of $600 in any given tax year without valid tax information. If tax information is not provided within 12 months after completing a survey, compensation above $600 in any tax year is forfeited. 

**_Additional Forms and Emails:_** We may also ask you to provide additional information after you register if you want to obtain additional services or information such as continuing education or continuing medical education, or to resolve complaints or concerns. 

**III. INFORMATION COLLECTED THROUGH TRACKING TECHNOLOGY**

AuntMinnie collects information about your activity on the Sites using technologies such as cookies, including third-party cookies, web beacons and server log files. 

**Usage Tracking**   
AuntMinnie uses traffic analysis software on our servers to track user traffic patterns throughout the Services. AuntMinnie uses this data to break down overall usage statistics according to IP address, domain name, browser type, and MIME type by reading this information from the data automatically sent by the browser whenever a web page is requested. Additionally, solely in connection with your voluntary participation in a market research study or screening or medical education, your computer may (i) be tracked by digital fingerprinting or watermarking to help ensure unique responders to a survey, and (ii) accessed to assess browser compatibility and/or video cam utility. 

**Cookies**   
A cookie is a small text file placed in your computer’s browser to store your preferences. A cookie can be accessed only by the server that originally created the cookie. A cookie cannot store or send back any information to us that you have not specifically and voluntarily provided while on a Site, or that is not among the information mentioned above that is contained in every user’s browser (e.g., domain name, browser type). Cookies do not contain personally identifiable information; however, once you choose to furnish a Site with personally identifiable information, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie. 

AuntMinnie uses cookies to monitor and manage Service development and delivery, and potentially to permit greater personalization of the Service based on your preferences and specifications. We may assign cookies to devices that access our Services to help us dynamically generate content to users of the Services. 

**Web Beacons**   
AuntMinnie and our third-party business partners may also use "web beacons" or clear .gifs, or similar technologies, which are small pieces of code placed on a web page, to monitor the behavior and collect data about the visitors viewing a web page. For example, web beacons may be used to count the users who visit a web page or to deliver a cookie to the browser of a visitor viewing that page. 

We and our third-party business partners use the information automatically generated by cookies and web beacons, as well as other information that we or they have, to provide you with an optimal website experience. 

At this time, the Sites do not recognize automated browser signals regarding tracking mechanisms, which may include "do not track" instructions. However, you can change your privacy preferences regarding the use of cookies and similar technologies through your browser. You may set your browser to accept all cookies, block certain cookies, require your consent before a cookie is placed in your browser, or block all cookies. If your browser is set to block cookies, websites that are cookie-enabled will not recognize you when you return to the website, and some website functionality may be lost. The Help section of your browser will tell you about your options for managing your cookies. 

**IV. HOW WE USE INFORMATION WE COLLECT**

Generally, these programs provide specific feedback using aggregated, de-identified data to third parties used to analyze trends and statistics for research and development purposes, and neither your identity nor your specific feedback is shared with third parties. However, under the following circumstances, your identity may be shared with third parties and/or associated with specific feedback: (i) when you participate in a medical education program or we have your consent, (ii) when we match user information with such third party’s data, (iii) when we suspect your answers are fraudulently provided and (iv) when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.
