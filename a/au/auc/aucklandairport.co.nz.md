If you are using one of our apps, we may send you "Push Notifications", and you agree to receive notifications from us even if your App is not running. You can change your push notification settings within your device or via the App itself.

Some uses of your personal data may involve the transfer of that data outside New Zealand, to be held and used by our related companies and commercial partners. 

Statistics may be provided with personal identifiers removed about our customers, readers, sales, traffic patterns (both online and within our property) and related site functions to reputable third parties. We may use service providers to assist us to aggregate and anonymise such data, so that it does not include any data from which an individual can be identified. This aggregated and anonymised data is not personal data and its use is not subject to this Privacy Policy.
