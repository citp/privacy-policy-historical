### Telephone and video surveillance 

In the interests of safety and security at the Airport, it is necessary for Auckland Airport to operate video surveillance cameras, in the form of a closed circuit television system, as well as record telephone conversations that take place in the operations centre at the airport. All surveillance of this type must relate solely to safety and security issues, as they affect the safe and efficient operation of the airport. The Chief Operating Officer - Aeronautical must approve any additions or variations to the Auckland Airport surveillance system. Other organisations operating at the airport may also operate video surveillance cameras in respect of the areas in which they operate, as well as record telephone conversations via their telephone systems. 

From time to time Auckland Airport receives requests from other parties to view surveillance footage. Any access to such footage must comply with Auckland Airport's Privacy Act obligations. 

Auckland Airport will ensure that its video surveillance is restricted to those areas of the airport where surveillance will not amount to an unreasonable interference with personal privacy. It must be noted, however, that where Auckland Airport has any reason to suspect that misconduct or unlawful behaviour is occurring on airport, hidden camera surveillance may occur. In such a situation, Auckland Airport will be under no obligation to notify the location or installation of cameras, however, will endeavour to limit surveillance to the particular conduct being investigated. 

Similarly, Auckland Airport will ensure that the recording of telephone conversations will not amount to an unreasonable interference with personal privacy. Should Auckland Airport need to access recorded telephone conversations, it will concentrate solely on the information that is relevant to the matters being investigated.
