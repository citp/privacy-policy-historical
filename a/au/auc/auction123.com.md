Personal and business information is information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, or phone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available. 

This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Auction123 does not own or control, or to people that Auction123 does not employ or manage. In addition, certain companies associated with Auction123, such as eBay, have their own privacy statements that we do not control.

Auction123 may combine information about you that we have with information we obtain from business partners or other companies. 

When you register we ask for information such as your name, email address, birth date, gender, zip code, occupation, industry, and personal interests. For some financial products and services we may also ask for your address, Social Security number, and information about your assets. Once you register with Auction123 and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us.

Auction123 collects information about your transactions with us and with some of our business partners, including information your use of financial products/software and services that we offer.

We may collect information that you send to us in an e-mail message and information that you submit to us in a CGI or other script based form.

Email sent to us may not be secure. If you choose to send us an email message, you are consenting to our retention of the content of the email, your email address, and our response. 

Auction123 uses information for the following general purposes: to customize the content you see, fulfill your request for products/software and services, improve our services, contact you, conduct research, and provide anonymous reporting for internal and external clients.

We reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to the Auction123 service, such as service announcements, and administrative messages, that are considered part of your Auction123 account, without offering you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving them.

Auction123 does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies except to provide products or services you've requested, or under the following circumstances: 

We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with Auction123 under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal information to help Auction123 communicate with you about offers from Auction123 and our marketing partners. These companies, however, do not have any independent right to share this information.

We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims;

We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Auction123 terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.

We may transfer information about you if Auction123 is acquired by or merged with another company.  In this event, we may notify you but are not required to do so, before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

Auction123 may display targeted advertisements based on personal information. Advertisers may assume that people who interact with, view, or click on targeted ads meet the targeting criteria - for example, women ages 18-24 from a particular geographic area.

Auction123 does not provide any personal information to the advertiser when you interact with or view a targeted ad. By interacting with or viewing an ad, however, you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad.

Auction123 advertisers may include financial service providers (such as banks, insurance agents, stock brokers and mortgage lenders) and non-financial companies (such as stores, airlines, and software companies).

Confidentiality and Security   
We limit access to personal information about you to employees and independent contractors who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs. 

We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to protect personal information about you.
