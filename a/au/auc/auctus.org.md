objected to processing pending the verification whether the legitimate grounds of Auctus override those of
you.
Where processing has been restricted in accordance with the above, such Personal Data shall, with the
exception of storage, only be processed with your consent or for the establishment, exercise or defense of
legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important
public interest of the law. If you obtain restriction of processing pursuant to the above, you shall be
