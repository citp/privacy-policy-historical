This policy covers how Autoquake.com treats personal information that Autoquake.com collects and receives, including information related to your past use of Autoquake.com's products and services. By accepting this Privacy Policy and the Visitors Agreement, you expressly consent to our use and disclosure of your personal information in the manner prescribed in this Privacy Policy.

## 1\. Information We Collect

Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you with a safe, efficient, and personalized experience. We only collect personal information about you that we consider necessary for this purpose.

In general, you can browse the Site without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. Once you give us your personal information, you are not anonymous to us. If you choose to use our services, we may require you to provide contact and identity information, financial information and other personal information as indicated by the Site. Where possible, we indicate which fields are required and which fields are optional. You always have the option not to provide information by choosing not to use a particular service or feature.

Under some circumstances we may require some additional financial information, such as, but not limited to, credit card details if you are registering to sell on the Site or to registering to use our financial services. We use this financial information to help verify your name, address, and other information. We may also use this information to charge you for your use of our services.

We automatically collect and process certain information based upon your use of the Site. We use this information to conduct internal research on our users' demographics, interests, and behaviour to better understand and serve you and our community. This information may include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on the Site or not), which links on our site you follow, browser information, and your IP address.

We use data collection devices such as "cookies" on certain pages of the Site. "Cookies" are pieces of information, small files placed on your hard drive by your web browser between visits of our site that assist us in providing customised services and to help promote safer trading. We also offer certain features that are only available through the use of a cookie. We also use cookies to allow you to enter your password less frequently while you are using the Site. Cookies can also help us provide information which we tailor to your interests. Most cookies are "session cookies", meaning that they are automatically deleted from your hard drive at the end of a session using the Site. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although in that case you may not be able to use certain features on the Site and you may be required to re-enter your password more frequently while you are using the Site. Cookies don't reveal personal information; the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. Cookies can't read unrelated data off your hard drive.

To help us keep track of how many users are visiting particular pages within our website, and how many users are accessing particular listings that we distribute, we may place a small file, called a web beacon, on some of our pages and on some of the listings we distribute. These web beacons allow us to track the number of users that view our pages and our listings, but they don't reveal any personally identifying information about individual users.

Additionally, you may encounter "cookies" or other similar devices on certain pages of the Site that are placed by third parties. For example, if you view a web page or an ad created by a user or partner, there may be a "cookie" placed within that web page. We do not control the use of cookies by third parties.

If you establish a credit account with us to pay the fees we charge, we collect some additional information, including but not limited to a billing address, a credit card number and a credit card expiration date. We do not store credit card information except, for reference purposes only; we may store the last 4 digits of credit card numbers.

If you send us personal correspondence, such as emails or letters, or if other users or third parties send us correspondence about your activities or postings on the Site, we may collect such information into a file specific to you.

If you register for Autoquake.com (a) on another web site, or (b) use a web site providing a service for Autoquake.com, or (c) a web site that helps facilitate your activity on Autoquake.com, that web site may provide personal information about you and your transactions back to Autoquake.com.

## 2\. Our Use of Your Information

We use information in the files we maintain about you, and other information we obtain from your current and past activities on the Site, to resolve disputes, provide customer support, troubleshoot problems and enforce our Visitors Agreement and policies. At times, we may look across multiple users to identify problems or resolve disputes, and in particular we may examine your information to identify users using multiple User IDs or aliases.

To make use of certain features on our site, visitors need to provide limited information about themselves and their interests so that we can tailor the information we provide to their needs. For example, to help you find the car you want close to home, we need to know what kind of car you're looking for and your postal code. We ask you to provide this information when you perform a search. We use this information to help you find the car you're looking for. If you find a listing that interests you and elect to send the seller an email through our website, we'll share with the seller the contact information you supply through our online "Email Seller" form.

You agree that we may use personally identifiable information about you to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to analyze site usage, improve our content and product offerings, and customise the Site's content, layout, and services. These uses improve the Site and better tailor it to meet your needs.

You agree that we may use your information to contact you and deliver information to you that, in some cases, are targeted to your interests, such as targeted banner advertisements, administrative notices, product offerings, and communications relevant to your use of the Site. By accepting the Visitors Agreement and reading this Privacy Policy, you expressly agree to receive this information.

(1) We aggregate (gather up data across all user accounts) personally identifiable information and disclose such information in a non-personally identifiable manner to advertisers and other third parties for marketing and promotional purposes.

(2) Autoquake.com cooperates with law enforcement inquiries, as well as other third parties, to enforce laws and third party rights, such as intellectual property rights and laws relating to fraud. Therefore, in response to a verified request by law enforcement or other government officials such as a the Data Protection Act 1998 form relating to a criminal investigation or alleged illegal activity, or other activity that may expose us or you to legal liability, we can (and you authorise us to) disclose personal information such as name, address, telephone number, email address, User ID history, and bidding and listing history about you as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate. Further, we can (and you authorise us to) disclose your User ID, name, address, telephone number, email address, and company name to Autoquake.com under a confidentiality agreement as we in our sole discretion believe necessary to share information in order to prevent, investigate, or take action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud, situations involving potential physical threats to any person, violations of our Visitors Agreement, intellectual property infringement or other unlawful activities.

We respond to verified requests (subpoenas, search warrants, court orders, or other legal process) from law enforcement or other government officials relating to a criminal investigation of alleged illegal activity, or to establish or exercise our legal right or defense against legal claims.

(3) At times we may retain third parties to analyze data we collect, including Personal Information, safely to help us improve our products and our Web site . In addition, if you order a product or service from us, we may provide Personal Information to suppliers and other third parties to enable delivery of such product or service. These third parties are not authorized by us to use your Personal Information in any way. To help us do this, we may measure the effectiveness of our web presence by determining what you clicked on to get to our site. To help us do this, we may measure statistics to personalize your Web site experience, as well as to evaluate statistics about usage of the Web site. Information about your computer may also be collected and linked to your Personal Information.

For example, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, or users may abuse or misuse your information that they collect from the Site. Therefore, although we use industry standard practices to protect your privacy, we cannot guarantee, and you should not expect, that your personally identifiable information or communications with Autoquake.com will always remain private.

We reserve the right to transfer information about you to a successor in interest that acquires the right to such information by acquiring the Service, acquiring Autoquake.com or substantially all of Autoquake.com's assets, or merging with Autoquake.com.
