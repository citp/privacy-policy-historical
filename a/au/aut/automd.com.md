**Information we collect and how we use it**

We may collect the following types of information:

**Information you provide** – When you use AutoMD Services or sign up for an AutoMD Account either directly on the Properties or through the use of FaceBook, we may ask you for information which personally identifies you, such as your first and last name, address, telephone number, email address, credit card number, credit card expiration date, or other data which can be reasonably linked to such information by AutoMD (“Personal Information”). However, Personal Information does not include, and this policy does not cover, any publicly available information and public records about auto repair professionals, auto repair shops and auto repair service providers, including without limitation information obtained from licensing authorities, associations, accrediting bodies, courts, law enforcement agencies, and web sites that are available to the public. Personal Information also does not include “aggregate” information, which is data we collect about the use of the Properties or categories of users, from which any Personal Information has been removed. We collect aggregate data for a number of purposes, including helping us understand trends and user needs so that we can better consider new publications, products and services, and tailor existing publications, products and other Services to user desires. This policy in no way limits or restricts our collection of aggregate information. We may combine the information you submit under your account with information from third parties in order to provide you with a better experience and to improve the quality of our Services.

**Information sharing**

We do not sell, share, or rent any Personal Information we collect from you through the Properties in ways different from what is disclosed in this Policy, although we may provide aggregate information or other non-Personal Information to third parties without your authorization. AutoMD only shares Personal Information with other companies or individuals outside of AutoMD in the following limited circumstances:

  * We may provide such information if we have your consent;
  * We may provide such information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies or other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of processing Personal Information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures; or
  * We may provide such information if we have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable Terms of Use, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of AutoMD, its users or the public as required or permitted by law.



In the event that we engage or partner with a trusted business or person, including without limitation, third party vendors, consultants or other service providers in connection with the operation of the Properties and our business (“Service Providers”), we may also share Personal Information with such Service Providers who need access to such information to carry out their work for us. For example, we may use mapping or location based services companies to provide information on services available near your location. In addition, we may offer various features through a Service Provider.

When you use these services, you are providing information directly to the third party provider of these services, and the provision of such information is subject to such third party’s own privacy policy. We are not responsible for the actions of Service Providers or other third parties or for any information you provide to these parties directly, and we encourage you to become familiar with their practices before disclosing information directly to such third parties with which you come into contact.

You should also note that Personal Information that you post to public areas of the Properties, may become publicly available. For example, information you post in your user profile or in ratings of auto repair professionals, auto repair shops and auto repair service providers, User Content (incorporated by reference from AutoMD's Terms of Use), including without limitation postings or updates to or relating to AutoMD Auto Answers, AutoMD Insta-Quotes!, AutoMD How-to-Guides, AutoMD How-to-Videos, AutoMD Reviews or AutoMD Ratings or any other Interactive Areas (incorporated by reference from AutoMD's Terms of Use), or other information that is provided for the purpose of being shared may be made publicly available and can potentially be viewed by anyone. In particular, certain information that you may provide about yourself, including without limitation, your “Image”, “Display Name”, “Location” and “About Me” information will be accessible by other users of the site and may become publicly viewable by anyone. Your posting to such public areas of the Properties constitutes your consent to share such information publicly.

The Properties may contain links to other sites or other interactive forums hosted by a third party. Please be aware that although we may participate in or utilize such other sites, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our Properties and to read the privacy policies of any web site or application that collects personally identifiable information. Similarly, if you entered our Properties through a third party’s web site or other application, we are also not responsible for the privacy practices of that third party, and you should review the privacy policy of the originating web site or application before providing any Personal Information. This privacy policy applies solely to information collected by AutoMD.

If AutoMD becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will protect the confidentiality of any Personal Information involved in such transactions and provide notice before Personal Information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

**Information security**

We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, including appropriate encryption and physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data. Additionally, your account information is accessible online only through the use of a password.

Please be aware, however, that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. To protect the confidentiality of your Personal Information, you must keep your password confidential and not disclose it to any other person.

We restrict access to Personal Information to AutoMD employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to process it on our behalf. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.

When you use AutoMD Services, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your Personal Information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. Therefore, whenever you believe that your contact information needs to be updated, you may do so by accessing and updating your user profile.
