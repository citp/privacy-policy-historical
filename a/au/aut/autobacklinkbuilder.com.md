If legally required or if it is reasonably necessary to meet regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, prevent fraud and abuse, or enforce our Terms and Conditions, we may also retain some of your information for a limited period of time as required, even after you have closed your account or it is no longer needed to provide the Services to you.

### Registration forms

kokoshungsan Ltd will not sell or rent your personally identifiable information, gathered as a result of filling out the site registration form, to anyone.

  * You can verify the details you have submitted to [company name] by contacting our customer services team support@kokoshungsan.net. Our security procedures mean that we may request proof of identity before we reveal information, including your e-mail address and possibly your address
  * You can also contact us by the same method to change, correct, or delete your personal information controlled by kokoshungsan Ltd regarding your profile at any time. Please note though that, if you have shared any information with others through social media channels, that information may remain visible, even if your account is deleted.
  * You are also free to close your account through our account settings. If you do so, your account will be deactivated. However, we may retain archived copies of your information as required by law or for legitimate business purposes (including to help address fraud and spam).
  * You can always feel free to update us on your details at any point by email at support@kokoshungsan.net.
  * You can unsubscribe from receiving marketing emails from us by clicking the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of any email. Once you do this, you will no longer receive any emails from us.
