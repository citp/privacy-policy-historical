<p><strong><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><font color="#808080">2. Web Site Use
Information</font></span></strong></p>

<p><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><font color="#808080">Similar to other commercial Web sites, our Web
site utilizes a standard technology called "cookies" (see explanation below, "What Are Cookies?") and web server
log files to collect information about how our Web site is used. Information gathered through cookies and Web
server logs may include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at our Web site, and the Web
sites visited just before and just after our Web site.</font></span></p>

<p><strong><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><font color="#808080">How Do We Use the Information That You
Provide to Us?</font></span></strong></p>

<p><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><font color="#808080">Broadly speaking, we use personal information
for purposes of administering our business activities, providing the products and services you requested, to
process your payment, , to monitor the use of the service, our marketing and promotional efforts and improve our
content and service offerings, and customize our site's content, layout, services and for other lawful purposes.
These uses improve our site and better tailor it to meet your needs.</font></span></p>

<p><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><font color="#808080">Furthermore, such information may be shared
with others on an aggregate basis. Personally identifiable information or business information will not be shared

<p><strong><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><font color="#808080">What Are
Cookies?</font></span></strong></p>

<p><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><font color="#808080">A cookie is a very small text document, which
often includes an anonymous unique identifier. When you visit a Web site, that site's computer asks your computer
for permission to store this file in a part of your hard drive specifically designated for cookies. Each Web site
can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your
browser only permits a Web site to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by
other sites. Browsers are usually set to accept cookies. However, if you would prefer not to receive cookies, you
may alter the configuration of your browser to refuse cookies. If you choose to have your browser refuse cookies,
it is possible that some areas of our site will not function as effectively when viewed by the users. A cookie
cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive or pass on computer viruses.</font></span></p>

<p><strong><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><font color="#808080">How Do We Use Information We Collect
from Cookies?</font></span></strong></p>

<p><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><font color="#808080">As you visit and browse our Web site, the site
uses cookies to differentiate you from other users. In some cases, we also use cookies to prevent you from having
to log in more than is necessary for security. Cookies, in conjunction with our Web server's log files, allow us to
calculate the aggregate number of people visiting our Web site and which parts of the site are most popular. This
helps us gather feedback to constantly improve our Web site and better serve our clients. Cookies do not allow us
to gather any personal information about you and we do not intentionally store any personal information that your
browser provided to us in your cookies.</font></span></p>

<p><strong><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><font color="#808080">IP
Addresses</font></span></strong></p>

<p><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><font color="#808080">IP addresses are used by your computer every
time you are connected to the Internet. Your IP address is a number that is used by computers on the network to
identify your computer. IP addresses are automatically collected by our web server as part of demographic and
profile data known as traffic data so that data (such as the Web pages you request) can be sent to
you.</font></span></p>

<p><strong><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><font color="#808080">Sharing and Selling
Information</font></span></strong></p>

<p><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><font color="#808080">We do not share, sell, lend or lease any of
the information that uniquely identify a subscriber (such as email addresses or personal details) with anyone
except to the extent it is necessary to process transactions or provide services that you have
requested.</font></span></p>

<p><strong><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><font color="#808080">How Can You Access and Correct Your
Information?</font></span></strong></p>

<p><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><font color="#808080">You may request access to all your personally
identifiable information that we collect online and maintain in our database by emailing us at the usual
address.</font></span></p>

<p><strong><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><font color="#808080">What About Legally Compelled
Disclosure of Information?</font></span></strong></p>

<p><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><font color="#808080">We may disclose information when legally
compelled to do so, in other words, when we, in good faith, believe that the law requires it or for the protection
of our legal rights. We may also disclose account information when we have reason to believe that disclosing this
information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our Terms
of Service or to protect the safety of our users and the Public.</font></span></p>

<p><strong><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><font color="#808080">What About Other Web Sites Linked to
Our Web Site?</font></span></strong></p>

<p><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><font color="#808080">We are not responsible for the practices
employed by Web sites linked to or from our Web site or the information or content contained therein. Often links
to other Web sites are provided solely as pointers to information on topics that may be useful to the users of our
Web site.</font></span></p>

<p><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><font color="#808080">Please remember that when you use a link to go
from our Website to another web site, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on
any other web site, including web sites, which have a link on our Website, is subject to that Web site's own rules
and policies. Please read over those rules and policies before proceeding.</font></span></p>

<p><strong><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><font color="#808080">Your
Consent</font></span></strong></p>

<p><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><font color="#808080">By using our Web site you consent to our
collection and use of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy. We reserve the right to amend
this privacy policy at any time with or without notice.</font></span></p>

<p><strong><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><font color="#808080">Our Commitment To Data
Security:</font></span></strong></p>

<p><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><font color="#808080">Please note that your information will be
stored and processed on our computers in the United States. The laws on holding personal data in the United States
may be less stringent than the laws of your Country of residence or citizenship. To prevent unauthorized access,
maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical,
electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.</font></span></p>

<p><strong><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><font color="#808080">Choice/Opt-In/Opt-Out</font></span></strong></p>

<p><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><font color="#808080">This site allows visitors to unsubscribe so
that they will not receive future messages. After unsubscribing we will discontinue sending the particular messages
as soon as technically feasible.</font></span></p>

<p><strong><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><font color="#808080">Surveys &amp;
Contests</font></span></strong></p>

<p><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><font color="#808080">From time-to-time our site requests
information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary
and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include
contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level).
Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for
purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.</font></span></p>

<p><strong><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><font color="#808080">A Special Note About
Children</font></span></strong></p>

<p><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><font color="#808080">Children are not eligible to use our services
unsupervised and we ask that children (under the age of 14) do not submit any personal information to us. If you
are a minor, you can use this service only in conjunction with permission and guidance from your parents or
guardians.</font></span></p>

<p><strong><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><font color="#808080">Acquisition or Changes in
Ownership</font></span></strong></p>

<p><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><font color="#808080">In the event that the web site (or a
substantial portion of its assets) is acquired, your information would be considered part of those assets, and may
be part of those assets that are transferred.</font></span></p>

<p><strong><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><font color="#808080">Policy
Modifications</font></span></strong></p>

<p><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><font color="#808080">We may change this Privacy Policy from time to
time. If/when changes are made to this privacy policy, we will email users who have given us permission to do so.
We will post any changes here, so be sure to check back periodically. However, please be assured that if the
Privacy Policy changes in the future, we will not use the personal information you have submitted to us under this
Privacy Policy in a manner that is materially inconsistent with this Privacy Policy, without your prior
consent.</font></span></p>
