(3) With Service Providers and Joint Marketing Partners  
We may disclose all Private Information we collect to companies that perform services on our behalf, including companies we engage to market our products and services for us, or to other financial institutions with which we have joint marketing agreements including motor vehicle dealers providing vehicle financing.

(5) With Other Third Parties

We may share all Private Information about you with other non-affiliated third parties, as permitted by law.

Protection of Information

We restrict access to Private Information about you to our employees and third parties who need to know that information in order to manage your account. Additionally, we take other steps to protect your Private Information in a manner consistent with industry standards for similar sized finance companies. We will review our safeguards from time to time, and strive to maintain them in a manner consistent with federal regulations, if any, that may be in effect from time to time.
