Cookies serve to give the Web browser a memory so that it can use data that was input on one page into another page, or so it can recall user input when the user leaves a page and later returns. We use cookies for the purpose of simplifying the registration process and enhancing the online user experience when using the AutoCheck report service. Only computer identification information will be stored in a cookie and it can only be read by our servers. We do not store any cookies on our server.

AutoCheck may enable third party Web site services organizations to access and assist with the performance and use of our Web site.  These parties may use cookies on our Web site and monitor user activities in order to measure Web site effectiveness or fulfill the services rendered as part of our affiliated relationships such as for search engine optimization and marketing efforts.

#### Website Analysis

AutoCheck maintains information about the various uses of our Web site. The primary way in which we monitor Web site activity is through the use of Web beacons. Web beacons are small image files that correspond with our Web servers indicating user activity such as; whether Web pages are viewed, how often, at specific times of day, and from specific referring pages. The Web beacons we use may be correlated with our use of cookies in order to maintain personalization and unique identification for users.

#### Security

Experian protects your information over the Internet by using a secure Web server, which allows your Web browser programs (Netscape Navigator/Communicator or Microsoft Internet Explorer) to interact with Experian's Web server via an encrypted session. Experian employs a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) connection that provides an encrypted connection between your computer and Experian. The 128 bit encrypted connection scrambles ordinary text or data into cyphertext to safeguard your sensitive and private information during its journey across the Internet. The information is decrypted, or put back into a readable format, when it reaches its intended destination, your computer.

Depending on which browser you use, you will know you are in a secured area by “https” appearing in front of the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) in the address bar, and/or a locked padlock appearing somewhere in the lower corner of your screen. When you visit our Web site, you may move in and out of secured areas. Any time that you are on a registration page you will be in a secured area.

Additionally, Experian utilizes systems access controls to protect your information. Experian continually monitors access to its systems to detect unauthorized attempts to gain access to information.

Our Web site may contain links for other offers and services in which we feel you may have an interest. We believe these sites share a similar commitment to consumer privacy and urge you to review their privacy policy when visiting their sites. We cannot, however, be responsible for their privacy or security practices.
