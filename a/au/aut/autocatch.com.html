					<p><strong>Our commitment to privacy</strong>: Metroland Media Group Ltd. ("Metroland") knows that protecting the privacy and confidentiality of your personal information is important to you.&nbsp;This Privacy Code governs the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information in any form, whether written or electronic, by Metroland and its affiliates.&nbsp;The collection, use and disclosure of your personal information is governed by the <em>Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act</em> (the “Act”), and any applicable provincial legislation. This Privacy Code explains what personal information may be collected from you and how it is used. It also explains how you can ask questions, make suggestions, and express concerns about our privacy practices. </p>

<p>This Privacy Code applies only to personal information collected by Metroland and its affiliates. Be aware that our websites may contain links to other websites that are maintained by third parties who are not required to comply with this Privacy Code and for which Metroland has no responsibility. Please review the privacy policies on any external websites to determine their information handling practices.</p>

<p>This Privacy Code is available to the public through our websites, and in paper form from Metroland. If you have any additional concerns or questions, we encourage you to contact us and we will address your concerns to the best of our ability. <strong>Please read this Privacy Code carefully, and check back periodically as we may update it from time to time. By submitting your personal information to Metroland, you signify your agreement to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Code.</strong></p>

<p><strong>What is personal information?</strong> Personal information is any information about an identifiable individual. </p>

<p>Metroland is responsible for personal information under its control. Metroland has implemented policies and practices to give effect to this Privacy Code, including training and communicating with our employees about the importance of privacy and implementing security procedures that reasonably protect the personal information you provide to us. In addition, Torstar Corporation, Metroland’s parent company, has appointed a Chief Privacy Officer to oversee personal information-handling practices of Metroland and its affiliates.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><strong>What is excluded from privacy protection?</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;This Privacy Code does not impose restrictions on:&nbsp;business contact information, including the name, title, business address or telephone number of an employee of an organization; information collected, used or disclosed solely for journalistic, literary or artistic purposes; publicly available information, such as an individual’s name, telephone number and address when listed in a directory or made available through directory assistance; or information that is aggregated and not associated with a specific individual, including demographic information and statistics.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Children:</strong> If you are under the age of 18, be sure to obtain your parent or guardian’s permission before you send any personal information to us, or anyone else.&nbsp;We encourage parents to get involved with their children’s online usage and to be aware of the activities in which they are participating.</p>

<p><strong>What personal information do we collect, and why?</strong></p>

<div class="browse_general_list">
						<ul>

    <li><span><span>We collect personal contact information (such as your name, address, email address and telephone      numbers) if you: sign up for a newsletter; subscribe to a newspaper;      register on an online forum or website, or to attend a paid event; participate      in a research survey; purchase any product or service from Metroland; are      a classified advertiser or auction participant; or provide it to us when      you attend a trade or consumer show. This information is used to fulfill      your request for information, products or services, to provide targeted      advertising, and to respond to your inquiries. From time to time this      information may be used to provide reward points or apply credit, as      applicable in the circumstances. </span></span></li>

    <li><span>We will retain your      subscriber ID and passwords so that upon request by you we may remind you      of them. </span></li>

    <li><span>If you enter a contest or      other promotion, we use your personal contact information to administer      the contest or promotion including contacting, announcing and promoting      prizewinners. &nbsp;&nbsp;In addition,      sometimes our contest rules provide that we may contact contest entrants      with promotions and product information.&nbsp;Those rules will also include a way for you to indicate to us that      you do not want to be contacted for this purpose.&nbsp;Some contests may also involve      co-sponsors, who have their own privacy practices.&nbsp;In these cases, the contest rules and/or      entry forms will indicate that your personal information is being shared      with these co-sponsors and will provide you with the ability to opt-out      from receiving promotions and product information from them.</span></li>

    <li><span>We collect demographic      information, as well as purchase history and a list of promotions offered      to you, in order to gain a better understanding of your interests so that      we may develop better products and services, and to determine your eligibility      for other products and services. </span></li>

    <li><span>We may also use demographic,      personal contact and history information to contact you about changes,      enhancements or other notices related to products or services you      requested from us and which Metroland provides. In addition, we may use      this information to send you offers or information from us, our affiliates      and from selected sponsors or advertisers (“Marketing Offers”). If you do      not wish to receive Marketing Offers, you may opt-out at any time by      following the opt-out procedure below. </span></li>

    <li><span>We keep notes and special      instructions for classified advertisers and subscribers to help us fulfill      your request and provide customer service. We may tape or monitor your      telephone calls with our customer service representatives for quality      assurance purposes. </span></li>

    <li><span>We collect your credit card      information if you: subscribe to a newspaper; register on a paid website;      enter a paid contest; register to attend a paid event; purchase any      product from Metroland or through one of our websites; are a classified      advertiser or an auction participant. This credit card information is used      for the purpose of fulfilling your order. </span></li>

    <li><span>If you choose to opt-out of      any use of your personal information in accordance with our opt-out      policy, we will keep your contact information on a list so that your      request can be honoured. If you provide a complaint to any of our      departments, we will collect your contact information and the nature of      your complaint, for the purpose of investigating your concerns and      responding to you. </span></li>

    <li><span>If you provide freelance or      other services to us, we may collect your social insurance number for tax      reporting purposes and your contact information in order to pay you. </span></li>

    <li><span>We may also use or collect additional      information from freelancers, other service providers and from advertisers,      such as financial information (for example, banking details and credit      history) to assess credit risk, sales data to prepare royalty reports and      other relevant information to help us evaluate the quality of your      services. </span></li>

    <li><span>If you use any of our      websites, we may assign an internet cookie. An internet cookie is a small      text file that a website stores on your internet browser and that can      collect and store information. We use cookies to better understand how you      use our websites, to make sure our ads and dynamic content are served      correctly and to improve the performance of our websites. For example, a      cookie may recall a set of preferences you have set for our website and      record items that you have registered for. Storing cookies on your web      browser allows us to present you with web pages and other content that are      attuned with your preferences. These activities are invisible to you, and      are generally intended to improve your internet surfing convenience.      Unless you have set your preferences so that you will be alerted when a      cookie is being stored on your computer, you won’t know about it. </span></li>

    <li><span>If you are concerned about      cookies, it is possible to turn them off in your web browser preferences. The      following link has useful information about how to opt out of cookies that      are placed by companies who are members of the network Advertising      Initiative: <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">NAI (Network      Advertising Initiative) Opt-Out</a>. &nbsp;&nbsp;However, please be aware that by disabling      cookies, you may not be able to use all portions of our websites,      particularly pages requiring registration.</span></li>

    <li><span>We may place advertising or      other links on our websites that originate from outside advertisers.&nbsp;If you view these ads, the advertisers      may assign a cookie.&nbsp;Metroland does      not control these cookies, nor is it responsible for any marketing or      other use of your information by these advertisers. </span></li>

    <li><span>Our websites may use Web      beacon, gif, or other technologies to better tailor and manage advertising      on those sites.&nbsp;These technologies      may be in use on a number of pages across web sites.&nbsp;When you access these pages, a      non-identifiable notice of that visit is generated which may be processed      by us or by our suppliers.&nbsp;These Web      beacons usually work in conjunction with cookies.&nbsp;If you don’t want your cookie      information to be associated with your visits to these pages, you can set      your browser to turn off cookies.&nbsp;If you turn off cookies, Web beacon and other technologies will      still detect visits to these pages, but the notices they generate cannot      be associated with other non-identifiable cookie information and are      disregarded.</span></li>

    <li><span>Many of our websites use      third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit the      site.&nbsp;These companies may use      information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone      number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide      advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to      you.&nbsp;Some ads appearing on our      websites are delivered to you by AdTech or DoubleClick, which are web      advertising companies.&nbsp;These third      parties may, from time to time, use information that they collect about      your visits to this site, such as the number of times you have viewed an      ad (but not your name, address or other personal contact information) to      serve additional ads about goods and services that may be of interest to      you.&nbsp;If you do not wish to have      your information used in this way, please click on the following links: <a href="http://optout.doubleclick.net/cgi-bin/dclk/optout.pl">DoubleClick      Opt Out</a> , &nbsp;<a href="http://www.adtechus.com/cookie_opt-out/">AdTech Opt-Out</a> .</span></li>

    <li><span>We use IP (internet protocol)      addresses, to gather demographic and statistical information about our      users, for systems administration and to diagnose problems with our      servers, and to administer our websites.&nbsp;We may also use IP addresses to display or allow our third party      advertising providers to display more targeted advertising and content.</span></li>

    <li><span>We may, from time to time,      track and analyze anonymous usage and browsing patterns of visitors to our      websites to provide our advertisers with more targeted advertising      opportunities and to help users see advertising that is most likely to      interest them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></li>

    <li><span>We generally use your      personal information for the purposes of : managing, administering,      collecting or otherwise enforcing your accounts; maintaining business      records for reasonable periods of time and generally managing and      administering our business; and meeting all relevant Canadian and      international regulatory, legal, insurance, audit, security and processing      requirements. </span></li>

    <li><span>Occasionally, we ask our      customers to complete market research surveys. If you choose to      participate in these surveys and provide your personal information for      that purpose, your information will be aggregated as part of the survey      results and shared with our advertisers, sponsors and affiliates in a      manner that does not identify you. </span></li>

    <li><span>Other than as permitted or      required by law, if we wish to collect, use or disclose your personal      information for purposes that are not contemplated in this Privacy Code, we      will identify those purposes at the time of collection. You will be given      a reasonable opportunity to opt-out of any such additional purposes. </span></li>
