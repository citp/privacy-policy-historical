# Privacy Policy - Auto Auction Mall

## Overview

Auto Auction Mall and its affiliates and subsidiaries (hereinafter, “AutoAuctionMall.com”, “AAM”, “we", "us", or "our") take privacy and security seriously and we make all efforts to use your personal information properly. We have put together this Privacy Policy to set out how we treat your personal information. 

This Privacy Policy governs each website, mobile site, application, and/or other service, regardless of how distributed, transmitted, published, or broadcast (each, a "Site") provided by AAM, its partners, affiliates and/or its subsidiaries that links to this Privacy Policy, which is binding on all those who access, visit and/or use the Site (collectively, "you" or "your"). 

This Privacy Policy describes the information collected as part of the normal operation of the Site, process of collection of the information from you and what may happen to that information. Although this policy may seem long, we have prepared a detailed policy because we believe you should know as much as possible about AutoAuctionMall.com’s practices so that you can make informed decisions. 

By accepting the Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use Agreement, you expressly consent to our use and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is deemed incorporated into and subject to the terms of AAM’s Terms of Use Agreement. 

Our primary purpose in collecting personal information is to provide you with a safe, smooth, efficient, and customized experience. This allows us to provide services and features that are most likely to meet your needs, and to customize our service to make your experience safer and easier. We only collect personal information about you that we consider necessary for achieving this purpose. 

## 1\. Information We Collect From You

A. **General Account Registration** \- When you register for an account on AAM in order to purchase a vehicle or access any of our services, we ask for certain information. As part of the account registration process we ask for your name, phone number and email address. In addition, when creating the account, you will also be required to choose a password for accessing the created account. We store the information you have provided in our database. 

B. **Registration for Events and Forms** \- We record your name, email, phone number and, if required to be provided, address that you submit when you (i) register for events, including webinars or seminars, (ii) subscribe to our newsletters or any other mailing list, (iii) provide your information in connection with coupons and promotions that we are running, (iv) participate in contests or respond to surveys, (v) submit a form to request one of our customer support representatives to contact you, (vi) speak to our customer support representative through live chat or (vii) when you contact AAM for any other purpose. 

C. **Payment Processing I - Deposit** \- When you make a deposit with AAM for the purpose of purchasing a vehicle, we ask you to provide your name, contact information (including your address), and credit card information or other payment account information. In connection with deposits made with AAM, when you submit your credit card information, we store the name and address of the cardholder, the expiry date, the type of credit card (i.e. Visa, MasterCard, etc.…) and the last four digits of the credit card number. We do not store the actual credit card number. We wanted to also let you know that when you place a deposit payment on the Site, we: i) may request a copy of your driver’s license (or other form of government issued identification) and your credit card (covering the credit card number except for the last 4 digits) and ii) obtain your IP address. This information is important to safeguard against fraudulent transactions by ensuring that the owner of the credit card is the one who is placing the deposit. Merchant banks and payment service providers will also receive this information in order to process the deposit. As mentioned above, we take privacy and security seriously and will not share this information with third parties other than with the merchant banks and payment service providers who are processing the transaction. 

D. **Payment Processing II – Purchase of Vehicle** \- When you purchase a vehicle from AAM, we collect the following information from you: i) your name, ii) contact information (including your address), and iii) government issued identification. As a licensed car dealer, we need to collect this information in order to complete and provide you with the bill of sale and vehicle title documentation. 

E. **Assistance with the Shipping of your Vehicle** – At the present time, AAM does not offer any form of shipping service for vehicles purchased from us. If you request that we help you arrange shipping of the vehicle that you purchased we will require your address and, if different, shipping information (which should have already been provided to us when you purchased the vehicle from us). If the shipment is within the United States, we will, with your consent, provide your address/shipping information to a third-party site for the purposes of getting quotations on the shipping rate and, if such quote is acceptable to you, completing the shipment of the vehicle. If the shipment is international and you ask us to use our shipping broker to deliver your vehicle, we will, with your consent, provide your contact information (including your name, phone number, email address, home address and, if different, shipping address) to the broker in order to complete the transportation. 

F. **Financing Pre-Approval** – Through our Site you may begin a financing pre-approval application. This is available to U.S. Residents only. AAM does not pre-approve you for the financing nor provide the financing but only permits you to input certain information (detailed below) in connection with this which is then passed on to our third-party partners who provide the pre-approval and financing. The actual pre-approval application and, following pre-approval should you decide to apply for the loan, are done on third party sites that have their own Privacy Policies which govern the use of the information you provide them. Through our site, we only collect your name, home address, email address, date of birth, phone number, employment status and requested loan amount. As mentioned, the actual detailed financing application is done on the third-party lender’s site. 

G. **Placing a Bid, Making an Offer, Using the Buy Now** \- If you choose to make an offer, place a bid or buy a vehicle on our Site, we collect information about your offer, bids and buying behavior. That information can and will be used by our subsidiaries, affiliates and business partners. 

H. **Other Interaction with AAM** – Information included in any submissions on our ‘Contact Us’ page or other form where you try to contact AAM in connection with general or specific enquiries or support. We may also record, analyze and use your interactions with us, including email, telephone, and chat conversations with our sales and customer support professionals, for improving our interactions with you and other customers.

AutoAuctionMall.com fully cooperates with law enforcement inquiries, as well as other third parties to enforce laws, such as: intellectual property rights, fraud and other rights, to help protect you and the AutoAuctionMall.com from bad actors. Therefore, in response to lawful requests by law enforcement or other government officials relating to a criminal investigation or alleged illegal activity, we can disclose your name, city, state, telephone number, email address, UserID, fraud complaints, and offer and payment history without a subpoena. Without limiting the above, in an effort to respect your privacy and our ability to keep the community free from bad actors, we will not otherwise disclose your personal information to law enforcement or other government officials without a subpoena, court order or substantially similar legal procedure, except when we believe in good faith that the disclosure of information is necessary to prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss; or report suspected illegal activity. 

## 12\. Enforcement of our Rights

Due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personal information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. By way of example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be forced to disclose personal information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances such as preventing fraud, investigating any suspected illegal activity, enforcing our agreements or policies or protecting the safety of our users. 

## 13\. Control of Your Password

You are responsible for all actions taken with your User ID and password, including fees charged to your account. Therefore, we do not recommend that you disclose your AutoAuctionMall.com password to any third parties. If you choose to share your User ID and password or your personal information with third parties, you are responsible for all actions taken with your account and therefore you should review that third party’s privacy policy. If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your personal information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately change your password as detailed in next Section.

Otherwise, we will not provide any information to that individual. 

## 14\. Children’s Personal Information

The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act was passed to give parents increased control over what information is collected from their children online and how such information is used. Our products and services are not directed to individuals under 16. AAM does not knowingly collect personal information from children who are under 16 years of age. If we become aware that a child under 16 has provided us with personal information, we will take steps to delete such information. If you believe that a child under 16 years has provided personal information to us, please write to [info@autoauctionmall.com](mailto:info@autoauctionmall.com) with the details, and we will take the necessary steps to delete the information we hold about that child.

## 17\. Do Not Track Requests

Some internet browsers have enabled 'Do Not Track' (DNT) features, which send out a signal (called the DNT signal) to the websites that you visit indicating that you don't wish to be tracked. Currently, there is no standard that governs what websites can or should do when they receive these signals. For now, we do not take action in response to these signals.

## 18\. External Links on Our Site

Some pages of our websites may contain links to websites that are not linked to this Privacy Policy. If you submit your personal information to any of these third-party sites, your personal information is governed by their privacy policies. As a safety measure, we recommend that you not share any personal information with these third parties unless you've checked their privacy policies and assured yourself of their privacy practices.

Your information is stored on AutoAuctionMall.com’s servers which are located in the United States. We use procedural and technical safeguards to protect your personal information against loss or theft as well as unauthorized access and disclosure to protect your privacy, including “firewalls” and other means. We treat data as an asset that must be protected against loss and unauthorized access. We employ many different security techniques to protect such data from unauthorized access by users inside and outside the company. However, you hereby agree that in the event of the security breach/theft of your information you release AutoAuctionMall.com and its affiliates, and their agents and officers will not be held liable by you. AutoAuctionMall.com and its affiliates, associated and business partners does NOT either expressly or impliedly guarantee or warrant in any way that the information that we collect is safe from any type of breach, theft, intentional, unintentional or negligent security failure that may result in disclosure of your information.

## 22\. Changes to this Privacy Policy

From time to time, we may update this policy. If the updates have minor consequences, they will take effect immediately when we post the revised Privacy Policy on our Site. If there are substantial changes to the Privacy Policy, it will be effective 30 days after we initially posted the Privacy Policy on our Site and sent you an update email. 

Until the new policy takes effect, if it materially reduces the protection of your privacy right under the then-existing policy you can choose not to accept it and terminate your use of our Site and services and stop purchasing products from our Site. Continuing to use our Site, purchase our products and user our services after the new policy takes effect means that you agree to the new policy.
