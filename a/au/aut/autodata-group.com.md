# Privacy Policy | Autodata Group

Autodata Limited ("We") are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. This policy (together with our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms) and any other documents referred to on it) sets out the basis on which any personal data we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be processed by us. Please read the following carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your personal data and how we will treat it.

Any changes we may make to our privacy policy in the future will be posted on this page and, where appropriate, notified to you by e-mail.

INFORMATION WE MAY COLLECT FROM YOU

We may collect and process the following data about you:

  * Information that you provide by filling in forms on our website [www.autodata-group.com](http://www.autodata-group.com/) (“our site”). This includes information provided at the time of registering to use our site, purchasing products, subscribing to any services, or requesting further services. We may also ask you for information when you report a problem with our site. If you contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence.
  * Details of transactions you carry out through our site and of the fulfilment of your orders.
  * Details of your visits to our site including, but not limited to, traffic data, location data, weblogs and other communication data, whether this is required for our own billing purposes or otherwise and the resources that you access.



IP ADDRESSES

We may collect information about your computer, including where available your IP address, operating system and browser type, for internal purposes (including but not limited to) system administration. This is statistical data about our users' browsing actions and patterns, and does not identify any individual.

COOKIES

For the same reason, we may obtain information about your general internet usage by using a cookie file which is stored on your browser or the hard drive of your computer. Cookies contain information that is transferred to your computer's hard drive. They help us to improve our site and to deliver a better and more personalised service. Some of the cookies we use are essential for the site to operate.

You may block cookies by activating the setting on your browser which allows you to refuse the setting of all or some cookies. However, if you use your browser settings to block all cookies (including essential cookies) you may not be able to access all or parts of our site. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies as soon you visit our site.

WHERE WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL DATA

All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. Any payment transactions will be encrypted using SSL technology. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.

The transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk.

USES MADE OF THE INFORMATION

Personal data collected by us may be used by us for editorial and feedback purposes, for marketing and promotional purposes, for statistical analysis of users' behaviour, for product development, for content improvement or to customise the content and layout of the site.

Aggregate data on home server domain names, operating system, and type of Web browser may be used for internal purposes.

Individually identifying information, such as names, postal and e-mail addresses, phone numbers, and other personal information which visitors voluntarily provide to us may be added to the our databases and used for future calls and mailings regarding site updates, new products and services, upcoming events, and status of orders placed online.

We also use information held about you to carry out our obligations arising from any contracts entered into between you and us; to allow you to participate in interactive features of our service, when you choose to do so; and to notify you about changes to our service.

DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION

We do not sell, rent, share or intentionally make publicly available any individually identifying or aggregate information.

We may disclose your personal information to third parties in the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, in which case we may disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets; if we or substantially all of our assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal data held by us about our customers will be one of the transferred assets; and or if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our terms of use or licence agreements; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Autodata Limited, our customers, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

YOUR RIGHTS

You have the right to ask us not to process your personal data for marketing purposes. We will usually inform you (before collecting your data) if we intend to use your data for such purposes or if we intend to disclose your information to any third party for such purposes. You can also exercise your right to prevent such processing at any time by contacting us at [sales@autodata-group.com](mailto:sales@autodata.ltd.uk).

Our site may, from time to time, contain links to and from the websites of our partner networks, advertisers and affiliates. If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies. Please check these policies before you submit any personal data to these websites.

ACCESS TO INFORMATION

The Act gives you the right to access information held about you. Your right of access can be exercised in accordance with the Act. Any access request may be subject to a fee of £10 to meet our costs in providing you with details of the information we hold about you.
