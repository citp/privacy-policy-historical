      <p>AutoTrader.com, LLC respects the privacy of visitors to our website. Please read this Privacy Statement carefully so that
         you understand what information we collect through our website and what we do with that information. This Privacy Statement
         applies only to information collected online through the Autotrader.com website and does not describe the ways in which we

<body_copy>
   <div class="rxbodyfield">
      <p>Children should always get permission from their parents before sending any information about themselves (such as their names,
         email addresses, and phone numbers) over the Internet, to us or to anyone else. Our website is not directed at children under
         13 and we won't knowingly allow anyone under 13 to provide us any personally identifying information; if you're under 13,
         please don't provide any information about yourself on this website.
      </p>
   </div>
</body_copy>
<h5>THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h5>
<body_copy>
   <div class="rxbodyfield">
      <p>The information we gather falls into two categories: (1) information supplied by visitors to the site when they list a car
         for sale, perform a search, enter a sweepstakes or other promotional contest, or initiate a transaction, and (2) tracking
         information gathered as visitors navigate through our website and review our email newsletters and other email messages. Third-party
         providers featured on or linked to by our website, such as vendors of products and services offered through our site by third
         parties, may be gathering information, as well, through processes we don't control.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Searches and Listings</strong> To make use of certain features on our site, visitors need to provide limited information about themselves and their interests
         so that we can tailor the information we provide to their needs. For example, to help you find the car you want close to home,
         we need to know what kind of car you're looking for and your zip code. We ask you to provide this information when you perform
         a search. We use this information to help you find the car you're looking for. If you find a listing that interests you and
         elect to send the seller an email through our website, we'll share with the seller the contact information you supply through
         our online "Email Seller" form. If you do not wish to share your email address or other contact information with the sellers
         who advertise on our website, you should not use our "Email Seller" contact form. Many of the dealer listings that appear
         on our website include toll-free telephone numbers that can be used to contact the dealership that is selling the advertised
         vehicle. If you call a dealer using one of these toll-free numbers, we may provide the dealer with the date, time, and duration
         of your call, as well as the number from which your call originated. If you wish to contact a dealership that advertises on
         our website without disclosing this information, please contact the dealer by email or by dialing its local telephone number.
         When you list a car for sale, we ask for information on the car and on how you can be contacted by potential buyers. We also
         ask for your credit card number and the expiration date on your card. We use this information to create your ad and to process
         your payment.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Sweepstakes and Other Promotions</strong> From time to time, we may offer sweepstakes or other promotions on our website. If you enter a sweepstakes or promotional
         contest, we'll ask you to provide information about yourself (such as your name, address, and email address). Among other
         things, we'll need this information to contact you if you win, and we may use this information for marketing purposes. We
         may share this information with any co-sponsor of the contest or sweepstakes, which we'll identify in the contest rules. We
         may also share this information with shipping or fulfillment companies or other third-party service providers who are responsible
         for some aspects of administering our promotions, such as conducting drawings, and/or delivering prizes to winners. If you
         don't want us to collect the information requested in the contest or sweepstakes registration form or to provide it to co-sponsors,
         please do not enter the contest or sweepstakes.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Email Addresses</strong> If you provide us your email address, we may email you about our website or our services, or to inquire about your experience
         using our website or sites operated by others. From time to time, we'll also send you emails that may include automotive information,
         special promotions and other commercial offers that we think may be of interest to you. Though we hope you'll find these communications
         informative and useful, if you don't, you can always unsubscribe by following the simple instructions included in each email.
         And you can opt-out of receiving these types of commercial offers at all by indicating, when you list a car for sale or inquire
         about a car listed on our website, that you'd prefer not to receive these communications.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Cookies</strong> To help us tailor our website to the needs and interests of our visitors, we keep track of the pages visited by our users
         by placing a cookie, a small entry in text file, on your hard drive. The cookie contains an ID number that allows us to track
         the pages you've visited. We aggregate this data with data on the pages visited by other users to track overall visitor traffic
         patterns. We use this information to improve our site by making it more responsive to the needs of our users. We also use
         cookies to make sure you don't see the same ad repeatedly during a single visit to our site. Cookies don't reveal personal
         information; the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. Cookies can't read unrelated
         data off your hard drive. Our advertisers and those who provide products and/or services through our site may also assign
         their own cookies, a process we don't control. We don't have access to these cookies or to any information they contain. The
         help function on most web browsers contains information on how to set your browser to notify you before accepting a cookie
         or to disable cookies entirely. However, if you don't accept cookies, you won't be able to take advantage of various features
         on our site that are available to other visitors. Our "Find Your Car" feature, for example, won't work properly if you configure
         your browser not to accept cookies.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Web Beacons</strong> To help us keep track of how many users are visiting particular pages within our website, and how many users are accessing
         particular listings that we distribute, we may place a small file, called a web beacon, on some of our pages and on some of
         the listings we distribute. These web beacons allow us to track the number of users that view our pages and our listings,
         but they don't reveal any personally identifying information about individual users. Advertising networks with which we are
         affiliated may also use web beacons on our site to gather similar anonymous "clickstream" information, which is used to deliver
         targeted advertising messages to our visitors. (See "Data Collected in Connection with Ad Serving and Targeting," below, for
         more information regarding the information collection practices of these advertising networks.)
      </p>
      <p><strong>Browser Level Information</strong> Our web server automatically collects limited information about your computer configuration when you visit our site, including
         the type of browser software you use, the operating system you're running, the resolution of your computer monitor, the website
         that referred you, and your IP address. (Your IP address is a numerical address that is used by computers connected to the
         Internet to identify your computer so that data (such as the web pages you want to view) can be transmitted to you. We also
         use IP address information for systems administration and trouble shooting purposes. Your IP address does not tell us who
         you are.) We use this information to make our site as useful as we can for as many users as possible.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Data Collected in Connection with Ad Serving and Targeting</strong> AutoTrader.com works with two leading third-party advertising companies, DoubleClick and Advertising.com. Their services
         include targeting and serving some of the advertisements, promotions, or other marketing messages you see on the pages of
         our site and other websites. Anonymous tracking information called "clickstream" data is collected from our website and other
         websites so that DoubleClick, Advertising.com, AutoTrader.com, and others can use such information, sometimes in conjunction
         with similar anonymous information gathered through other websites, to deliver advertisements targeted to the perceived interests
         of consumers. This clickstream data does not identify you personally and does not include your name, address, email address
         or telephone number, but it may include the Internet Protocol ("IP") address of your computer. Clickstream data is used for
         marketing research, targeting advertising, and other similar purposes. We also use DoubleClick software to serve our own ads
         and collect similar information in the process. DoubleClick and Advertising.com also use cookies and/or web beacons to collect
         anonymous information directly from our users. If you would like to know more about DoubleClick's information gathering practices
         and opt-out procedures, please see the privacy statement on the <a href="http://www.doubleclick.com/us/about_doubleclick/privacy/">DoubleClick website</a>. To opt out of DoubleClick's ad targeting program, please <a href="http://www.doubleclick.com/us/about_doubleclick/privacy/ad-cookie/">click here</a>. If you would like to know more about Advertising.com's information gathering practices and opt-out procedures, please see
         the privacy statement on the <a href="http://www.advertising.com/Policy.html">Advertising.com website</a>. To opt out of Advertising.com's ad targeting program, please <a href="http://www.advertising.com/optout2.html">click here</a>.

<h5>USE AND DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION</h5>
<body_copy>
   <div class="rxbodyfield">
      <p>When we present information to our advertisers-to help them understand our audience and confirm the value of advertising on
         our website--it is usually in the form of aggregated statistics on traffic to various pages within our site. Any credit card
         information you may provide to us is secured during transmission over the Internet using industry--standard secure socket
         layer (SSL) encryption and is stored on our secure servers. (See "Security," below.) We use your credit card information only
         to bill you for the products and services you order from us. We don't share your credit card information with anyone, except
         as may be necessary to process your transactions or comply with law. We may collect, or have a third party collect on our
         behalf, aggregated statistical information about how visitors use and navigate around our site, such as the number of users
         who visit various pages within the site, what they click on, whether they scroll up or down on particular pages, fill out
         forms, etc. This aggregated information does not identify you personally. We use this information to improve our site. We
         may also disclose this aggregated information to third parties.
      </p>
   </div>
</body_copy>
<h5>LINKS AND FEATURES OFFERED IN CONJUNCTION WITH OTHER PROVIDERS</h5>
<body_copy>
   <div class="rxbodyfield">
      <p>To make our website more valuable to our visitors, we feature some products and services that come from other providers. Our
         finance, insurance, warranty, and inspection services, for example, are made available through cooperative arrangements with
         companies that specialize in providing such services. We share with these third parties such information as is necessary for
         them to provide the products or services. We have a strategic marketing relationship with our sister company, Trader Publishing
         Company, the publisher of Auto Trader Magazine. When you visit our site to purchase a combination print ad (in Auto Trader
         Magazine) and online ad (on AutoTrader.com), you may be redirected to a web page hosted by Trader Publishing to complete your
         transaction. Any information you submit on forms that appear on web pages hosted by Trader Publishing will be collected pursuant
         to Trader Publishing Company's <a href="http://traderpub.com/privacy.html ">privacy policy</a>. (You can tell which site hosts the page you're viewing by looking at the location bar at the top of your web browser. If
         it says "autotrader.com," you're on a page hosted by AutoTrader.com. If it says "traderpub.com," you're on a page hosted by
         Trader Publishing.) Of course, our site includes links to other websites, and provides access to products and services offered
         by third parties, whose privacy policies we don't control. When you access another website or purchase products or services
         or conduct other transactions through our website, use of any information you provide is governed by the privacy policy of
         the operator of the site you're visiting or the provider of such products or services. When you provide information in the
         course of obtaining products or services through our site, use of any information you provide may be governed by the privacy
         policy of the provider of those products or services. The provider's privacy policy may differ from ours. If you can't find
         the privacy policy of any of our provider partners via a link either from their site's homepage or from the pages on which
         the products or services are offered, you should contact the provider directly for more information.
      </p>
   </div>
</body_copy>
<h5>OTHER DISCLOSURES</h5>
<body_copy>
   <div class="rxbodyfield">
      <p>We may occasionally release information about our visitors when release is appropriate to comply with law, to enforce our
         Visitor Agreement, or to protect the rights, property or safety of visitors to our site, our customers, the public or AutoTrader.com.
         As our business grows, we may buy or sell various assets. In the unlikely event that AutoTrader.com LLC, one of its business
         units, or substantially all of its assets is acquired by another company, information on our visitors would be among the transferred
         assets. To ensure that the email marketing preferences of our visitors are honored, we may share email addresses collected
         on our website with advertisers (or their designated agents) for the limited purpose of identifying and removing from our
         distribution lists and/or the advertiser's distribution lists the email addresses of any persons who have "unsubscribed" or
         otherwise indicated a preference not to receive commercial electronic mail messages from, or transmitted on behalf of, the
         relevant advertiser. We may allow others to search some of our databases (our listings database, for example) and to analyze
         the data they find there or aggregate it with other data, either for their business purposes, or ours. Though some of the
         information in our databases may be personally identifying (such as the contact information included in a vehicle listing),
         we'll only allow searches of the portions of our database that contain information that is otherwise publicly available on
         our website. When we use other companies to help us operate our site or improve the services we offer to you, we may provide
         them with information about our visitors that is necessary for them to perform their services. We require that these companies
         commit to use the information only to perform the services that we request.

<h5>SECURITY</h5>
<body_copy>
   <div class="rxbodyfield">
      <p>Information we gather on our website is stored within AutoTrader.com-controlled databases (or databases hosted on our behalf)
         on servers maintained in protected environments. Any credit card information you provide us is secured for transmission over
         the Internet using industry-standard secure sockets layer (SSL) encryption. <a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/S/SSL.html">Click here</a> to learn more about the SSL protocol on webopedia.com. However, no physical or electronic security system is impenetrable.
         We cannot guarantee the security of our servers or databases, nor can we guarantee that information you supply won't be intercepted
         while being transmitted to us over the Internet. And, of course, any information you include in a vehicle listing is available
         to anyone with Internet access.

<h5>CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT</h5>
<body_copy>
   <div class="rxbodyfield">
      <p>The Web is an evolving medium. If we need to change our privacy policy at some point in the future, we'll post the changes
         to this Privacy Statement on this website and update the reference to the effective date to reflect the date of the amendment.
