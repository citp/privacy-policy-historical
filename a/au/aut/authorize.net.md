**Scope of this Privacy Policy**

This Privacy Policy covers Authorize.Net's treatment of personally identifiable information collected from merchants (hereafter "merchant" or "you") who use the Authorize.Net payment gateway services, as well as consumer information that we acquire in the course of our business. This Policy also covers the treatment of personally identifiable information that Authorize.Net's business partners may share with it.

This Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Authorize.Net does not own or control, or to people that Authorize.Net does not employ or manage. Authorize.Net is a wholly owned subsidiary of Lightbridge, Inc. This Policy is specific to Authorize.Net and does not apply to [www.lightbridge.com](http://www.lightbridge.com/) or other Web sites or Internet services that are part of the Lightbridge, Inc.

**Information Collection and Use**

Authorize.Net collects personally identifiable information when you register for an Authorize.Net account, and when you use certain Authorize.Net products and services. Authorize.Net may also receive personally identifiable information from its resellers and other business partners.

When you register with Authorize.Net, we ask for your contact information (such as your name, street address and e-mail address), as well as certain information pertaining to your business, along with billing information such as a bank account and/or credit card number.

In the course of processing a payment transaction, we typically receive from the merchant or a financial institution information related to the transaction. This normally includes information about the payment that a consumer has furnished the merchant or financial institution in placing the order. We do not acquire any information directly from consumers through the [www.authorize.net](http://www.authorize.net/) Web site.

Authorize.Net uses the information collected to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, to process payment transactions, to facilitate billing, and otherwise deliver the payment gateway services. We may also send merchants service announcements, newsletters, and periodic notices about specials and new products. Personally identifiable consumer information is used to process payment transactions and for no other purpose.

Authorize.Net does not offer services or sell products to children. Authorize.Net does not request or knowingly collect personally identifiable contact information from anyone under the age of 13.

**Information Sharing and Disclosure**

Protecting personally identifiable information about merchants and consumers is an important part of our business. We share and disclose such information only as described below.

Authorize.Net will send personally identifiable information about you to other companies or people when: 1) we have your consent to share the information; 2) we need to share your information to provide the product or service you have requested; 3) we need to send the information to companies who work on behalf of Authorize.Net to provide a product or service to you (unless we tell you differently these companies do not have any right to use the personally identifiable information we provide them beyond what is necessary to assist us).

Personally identifiable consumer information is shared with third parties (such as banks and credit card processors) to the extent necessary for Authorize.Net to deliver payment processing services.

We also may release personally identifiable information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with law; enforce or apply our Merchant Agreement and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Authorize.Net, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and risk reduction.

In the unlikely event that Authorize.Net is acquired, merchant account information may be one of the transferred assets.

**Information Security**

Information security is critical to our business. We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information. The information gathered on secure computers is stored in a locked down data center. The number of employees involved in the management of the data center that have physical access to these computers is limited. We use firewalls and other security technology, as well as implement the highest industry standard security practices, to prevent our computers from being accessed by unauthorized persons.

We also require that any personally identifiable consumer information sent to us by you be encrypted using SSL encryption. To learn more about SSL, go to: <http://webopedia.internet.com/TERM/S/SSL.html>.

It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your login ID/password, other sensitive account data and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer and otherwise safeguard the password used to access the Authorize.Net services.

**Account Information and Preferences**

Authorize.Net gives you the ability to edit your Authorize.Net account information and preferences at any time, including whether you want Authorize.Net to contact you about promotions and new products, by using the Settings option in the Merchant Interface or by contacting [Customer Support](http://www.authorize.net/support/inquiryform/).

**Notice for European Users**

Authorize.Net is located in the United States. Any information that you provide to Authorize.Net will be transferred out of the EU to the United States. By providing personal information to us, you are consenting to its storage and use as described herein.

**Changes to this Privacy Policy**

Authorize.Net reserves the right to modify or amend this Privacy Policy at any time and for any reason. If there are material changes to this statement or in how Authorize.Net will use personally identifiable information, Authorize.Net will post notices in the Merchant Interface and on the Authorize.Net homepage at [www.authorize.net](http://www.authorize.net/) prior to implementing the change. If you have additional questions about this Policy, please contact [Customer Support](http://www.authorize.net/support/inquiryform).
