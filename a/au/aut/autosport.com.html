</ul>

<p>In addition, the data subject has a right of access as to whether personal data has been transmitted to a third country or to an international organization. If that is the case, then the data subject has the right to obtain information about the appropriate guarantees in connection with the transfer.</p>
<p>If an affected person wishes to exercise this right to information, they can contact us at <a href="mailto:datacontroller@motorsport.com">datacontroller@motorsport.com</a>, or write to us at the address given at the end of this Policy.</p>

<br>
<p>4.4  Right to Cancellation</p>
<br>
<p>Any person affected by the processing of personal data shall have the right to require the controller to immediately delete the personal data concerning him, provided that one of the following reasons is satisfied and the processing is not required:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The personal data has been collected for such purposes or otherwise processed for which they are no longer necessary.</li>
	<li>The data subject withdraws the consent on which the processing was based the data controller lacks any other legal basis for the processing.</li>
	<li>The data subject objects to the processing and there are no legitimate reasons for the processing, or the data subject appeals the processing.</li>

	<li>The deletion of personal data is required to fulfill a legal obligation under Union or national law, to which the controller is subject.</li>
	<li>The personal data were collected in relation to information society services.</li>
</ul>

<p>If one of the above reasons is correct and an affected person wishes to arrange for the deletion of personal data held by us, they may, at any time, contact us at <a href="mailto:datacontroller@motorsport.com">datacontroller@motorsport.com</a>, or write to us at the address given at the end of this Policy. Our data protection officer or another employee will arrange that the deletion request be fulfilled immediately.</p>

<p>If the personal data have been made public by us and if our company is responsible for deleting personal data as the person responsible, we shall take appropriate measures, including technical ones, taking into account the available technology and the implementation costs to inform other data controllers processing the published personal data that the data subject has requested that these other data controllers delete all links to such personal data or copies or replications of such personal data, as far as the processing is not required.

	<li>Processing is unlawful, the data subject refuses to delete the personal data and instead requests the restriction of the use of personal data.</li>
	<li>The controller no longer needs the personal data for processing purposes, but the data subject needs them to assert, exercise or defend legal claims.</li>
	<li>The data subject has objected to the processing and it is not yet clear whether the legitimate reasons of the person responsible outweigh those of the data subject.</li>
</ul>

<p>If one of the above conditions is met and an affected person wishes to request the restriction of personal data stored by us, they may at any time contact our data protection officer or another employee of the controller. Our data protection officer or another employee will cause the restriction of processing.</p>
<br>
<p>4.6. Data Transferability</p>
<br>
<p>Any person affected by the processing of personal data shall have the right to obtain the personal data concerning him or her provided to a controller by the data subject in a structured, common and machine-readable format. It also has the right to transfer this data to another person responsible, without hindrance by the controller, to whom the personal data was provided, provided that the processing is based on the consent or on a contract and processing by means of automated processes, unless the processing is necessary for the performance of a task of public interest or in the exercise of public authority, which has been assigned to the responsible person.</p>

<p>Furthermore, in exercising their right to data portability, the data subject has the right to obtain that the personal data are transmitted directly from one controller to another, insofar as this is technically feasible and if so this does not affect the rights and freedoms of others.</p>

<p>In order to assert the right of data transferability, the data subject may at any time turn to the data protection officer appointed by us.</p>
<br>
<p>4.7. Right to Object</p>
<br>
<p>Any person concerned by the processing of personal data shall have the right, for reasons arising from its particular situation, against the processing of personal data relating to it. </p>

<p>In the event of an objection, we will no longer process personal data unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for processing that outweigh the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject, or the processing is for the purpose of asserting, exercising or defending legal claims.</p>
<p>If we process personal data in order to operate direct mail, the data subject has the right to object at any time to the processing of personal data for the purposes of such advertising. This also applies to the profiling, as far as it is associated with such direct mail. If the data subject objects to processing for direct marketing purposes, we will no longer process the personal data for these purposes.</p>
<p>In addition, the data subject has the right, for reasons that arise from their particular situation, against the processing of personal data relating to them, which we carry out for scientific or historical research purposes or for statistical purposes, to object, unless such processing is necessary to fulfill a public interest task.</p>

<p>In order to exercise the right to object, the data subject can directly contact us at <a href="mailto:datacontroller@motorsport.com">datacontroller@motorsport.com</a>, or write to us at the address given at the end of this Policy. The data subject is also free, in the context of the use of information society services, to exercise his right of opposition by means of automated procedures using technical specifications.</p>
<br>
<p>4.8  Automated Decisions in Individual Cases Including Profiling</p>
<br>

Your browsing and interaction on any other website or your dealings with any other third party service provider, is subject to that website’s or third party service provider’s own rules and policies. We do not monitor, control, or endorse the Information collection or privacy practices of any third parties. We encourage you to become familiar with the privacy practices of every website you visit or third party service provider that you deal with and to contact them if you have any questions about their respective privacy policies and practices. This Policy applies solely to Information collected by us through our website or services and does not apply to these third party websites and third party service providers.</p>

So, we cannot ensure the security of your Information transmitted by you to us via the internet. Any such transmission is at your own risk and you acknowledge and agree that we shall not be responsible for any unauthorised use, distribution, damage or destruction of your Information, except to the extent we are required to accept such responsibility by the GDPR. Once we have received your Information we will use security procedures and features to prevent unauthorised access to it.</p>
