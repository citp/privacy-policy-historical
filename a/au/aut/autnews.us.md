### The Iran Crisis

* * *

There is an increasing sense of urgency among the israeli leadership over Iran's nuclear program and the possibility of taking military action to stop it.

The window in which to solve the crisis, as estimated by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the UN last September as this spring or summer, is closing, and the prospect of a military strike looms.

It is Mr Netanyahu's opinion that further negotiations are fruitless and serve only to buy Iran more time.

"This programme lasted 38 minutes and 33 seconds, of which 31 minutes and 17 seconds consisted of talk time, including 123 appearances from 21 sources (including the narrator). Israeli sources, of which there were 15, appeared 55 times for a total of 15 minutes and 58 seconds - 51% of talk time, 41.4% of the programme, 71.4% of sources and 45% of source appearances."

"In stark contrast, the Iranian sources, of which there were just two, appeared three times for a total of 52 seconds - 2.8% of talk time, 2.2% of the programme, 9.5% of sources and 2.4% of source appearances. The first Iranian source does not appear until around 27 minutes into the documentary."

#### Logbook loans to be banned in the UK

"A form of secured borrowing known as logbook loans, or [bill of sale lending](http://www.elogbookloans.com/), may be outlawed under government proposals. The department for business innovation and skills (BIS) is consulting on plans to ban what it calls the "archaic" and expensive method of borrowing. More than 1,000 people have complained to the Office of Fair Trading about these loans in the past four years. The loans are usually secured against the value of cars and allow the lender to repossess without a court order." Source: BBC News UK

#### Payday borrowers 'could complain' about lenders

"A host of payday loan customers have grounds for complaint against lenders over the way repayments were collected, a charity has said. Citizens Advice said it saw 665 cases, of which 76% could have been forwarded to the Financial Ombudsman Service. These included cases of individuals being chased for a loan they had not taken out, it said. A string of payday lenders have signed up to a code of conduct aimed at improving standards."

##### 'Pestered with texts'

Citizens Advice analysed a series of payday loan cases, which were reported to its customer helpline in the first half of the year. It found potential cases of fraud, such as being chased for non-existent loans. Others were "pestered" with phone calls and text messages, despite offers of repayments plans from customers. Some in financial difficulty were treated unfairly, according to the charity, and so could have taken a complaint to the ombudsman." Source: BBC News UK"

There are however some reputable firms that do exist. But even then, APRs still remain rather high when compared to mainstream credit.
