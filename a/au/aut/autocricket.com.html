<h6>Site Usage Information</h6>
<h6>Cookies</h6>
<p>We try to provide you with services, products and offers customized to your interests. In order to do that, we may use “cookies” to keep, and sometimes track, information about you. Cookies are small pieces of data that are sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your computer’s hard drive. Cookies do not gather any Personal Information about you; they simply track where you travel on the AutoCricket Corporation U.S. Web sites and what you look at. (Cookies may, however, store your login name which allows you access to our online forums.) In doing so, a cookie may enable AutoCricket Corporation U.S. to relate your use of the Web sites to Personal Information that has already been submitted. Many other web sites use cookies for very similar purposes.</p>
<p>Most web browsers can be set to inform you when a cookie has been sent to you and provide you with the opportunity to refuse that cookie. Refusing a cookie will generally not interfere with your use of a AutoCricket Corporation U.S. Web site. However, refusal of a cookie may, in some cases, preclude you from using features of a site that require registration. You may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers. These cookies are sent from third-party computers and are subject to such third parties’ policies.</p>
<p>We may also use web beacon technology to help track site usage. Web beacons (also called single pixel gifs or action tags) allow AutoCricket Corporation U.S. and our service providers and business partners to track page viewing counts and patterns, which we use, for example, for future site development and to measure the effectiveness of marketing campaigns. We may also use web beacons within the context of certain emails to determine the effectiveness of the mailing.</p>

<p>Our server automatically collects data about your server’s domain address when you visit us. This information, known as an Internet Protocol address, or IP Address, is a number that’s automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider whenever you’re on the Web.

<p>We may use cookies to access your account information (stored on our computers) in order to deliver better and more personalized services; estimate our audience size for our advertisers; assist in processing items in your shopping basket; track the number of entries in our promotions, sweepstakes and contests; and identify which areas of our Web Sites you have visited.
