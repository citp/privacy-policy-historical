# Autodesk - Privacy Policy

Autodesk Privacy Policy  


  
Your right to privacy is very important to us. When you choose to provide us with information about yourself, we recognize that you trust us to act in a responsible manner. It is our belief that this information should only be used to help us provide you with better products and services. We are currently in the process of revising and clarifying our privacy statement. We are making these changes to make our statement clearer and more informative to users. Future modifications to this policy will be posted at this same location. At times our privacy statement might change, but the usage of the information we collect and the policies regarding the sharing of that information will not. 

Our objective at Autodesk is to be your design resource of choice by providing you with the information and services that are most relevant to you. To achieve this goal, we need to collect information to understand what differentiates you from each of our other unique users. We collect this information in a few ways. 

**Registration**

First, you may provide us with certain information such as your name, e-mail address, and postal addresses when registering for certain services such as Professional Networking, chat sessions, e-mail newsletters, and contests/promotions. This information is used for purposes such as personalization and verification. 

**Cookies**

Second, we may track your visit to our site by giving you a "cookie" when you enter. Cookies are pieces of information that websites transfer to your computer's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Autodesk uses cookies to make visiting our sites easier. Cookies allow us to save passwords and preferences for you so that you won't have to re-enter them the next time you visit. Cookies help us to collect anonymous click-stream data for tracking user trends and patterns. The use of cookies is now an industry standard, and you'll find them used on most major websites. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. If you prefer, you can reset your browser either to notify you when you've received a cookie or to refuse to accept cookies. You should understand that areas of certain sites will not function properly if you set your browser not to accept cookies. 

**Use of Information**

Any information you provide to Autodesk over this website is maintained and accessible only by Autodesk and its authorized partners. Autodesk uses this information to send you information such as product updates and special offers. Autodesk will not disclose any information about any individual user to entities outside of those partners except to comply with applicable law or valid legal process. 

**Sharing of Information**

The individually identifiable information that you provide will be used extensively within the Autodesk® website to provide a personalized experience for you. Autodesk does not sell user information that it has collected over this website. Autodesk's use of the information submitted by you may change although the sharing of information will not. 

**Opt-Out**

Although many of our feedback forms allow you to opt out (elect not to participate in certain communications) of Autodesk or partner communications, there are still some that do not. We are currently in the process of updating the remaining forms to have this capability. However, at any time you may request to be removed from our mailing database and we will honor such requests. You may send e-mail to [webmaster@autodesk.com](mailto:webmaster@autodesk.com?subject=Privacy%20Policy) for this request. We welcome any questions or comments you have; please direct them to [webmaster@autodesk.com](mailto:webmaster@autodesk.com?subject=Privacy%20Policy). 

It is very important to us that your experience using autodesk.com is positive. We respect your rights.
