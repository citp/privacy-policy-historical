                            is one of the hottest issues today, on or off the 
                            Internet. <strong>AuthorHouse™</strong> is aware 
                            of these concerns and wants you to feel as comfortable 
                            shopping at our site as you do at your local bookstore. 
                            Our privacy policy, as detailed below, answers questions 
                            you may have about access, security, and control of 
                            personal information. It also describes how the information 
                            will be used and whether it will be provided to third 
                            parties. <p></p> 
                            <p>AuthorHouse believes that 
                              your personal information -- including your name, 
                              mailing address, telephone number, email address, 
                              and credit card data -- belongs to you. While we 
                              collect this type of information when you provide 
                              it to us, we do not rent or sell it to third parties. 
                              We use it only to process orders and to provide 
                              a more personalized shopping experience. </p>
                            <p>The United States Federal Trade Commission 
                              has created a website, <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/online/webredy.htm">How 
                              to Be Web Ready</a>, which provides general tips 
                              on how to protect your privacy online. The FTC has 
                              also created another website, <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/online/sitesee.htm">Site 
                              Seeing on the Internet</a>, which provides general 
                              tips about navigating the Internet. Both websites 
                              are filled with information about how to use the 
                              Internet wisely, how to avoid fraud and deception 
                              online, and how to keep personal information private.

                            <p>WHAT INFORMATION 
                              DOES AUTHORHOUSE COLLECT? <br>
                              When users visit the AuthorHouse website, there 
                              are two types of information that may be collected. 
                            </p>
                                                        <p>The first 
                              type of information is known as "personally 
                              identifiable information" and can only be collected 
                              when an order is placed. This information includes 
                              your name, mailing address, telephone number, email 
                              address, and credit card data. This information 
                              allows us to process and fulfill your order as well 
                              as to notify you of your order status. AuthorHouse 
                              has never, and will never, share this information 
                              with a third-party vendor. </p>
                            <p>AuthorHouse 
                              may use your email address to occasionally notify 
                              you about important functionality changes to the 
                              website, new services, and special offers we think 
                              you'll find valuable. If you would rather not receive 
                              this information, you can change the preferences 
                              by clicking <a href="http://newsletter.1stbooks.com/">HERE</a>. 
                            </p>
                            <p>AuthorHouse 
                              may release account information when we believe, 
                              in good faith, that such release is reasonably necessary 
                              to (1) comply with law, (2) enforce or apply the 
                              terms of any of our user agreements, or (3) protect 
                              the rights, property or safety of AuthorHouse, our 
                              users, or others. </p>

                              known as "non-personally identifiable information" 
                              and is collected upon each visit to our website. 
                              Our server automatically recognizes visitors' domain 
                              names and Internet Protocol addresses (where possible). 
                              We also collect information about how visitors use 
                              the site. This information, which is collected and 
                              maintained in an anonymous, non-personal and composite 
                              form, allows us to improve the content of our website 
                              and facilitate market research. </p>
                            <p>DOES AUTHORHOUSE 
                              USE NON-PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION? <br>
                              On occasion, we may provide non-personally identifiable 
                              information about our users, sales, traffic patterns, 
                              and related site information to reputable third-party 
                              vendors to help us understand this information better. 
                              However, these statistics will not include any personally 
                              identifiable information. Other than improving our 
                              website and providing our visitors with the best 
                              experience possible, we make no other use of this 
                              information. </p>
                            <p>HOW DOES 
                              AUTHORHOUSE PROTECT USER INFORMATION? <br>
                              AuthorHouse uses the latest encryption technology 
                              to keep your personal information safe. All of your 
                              ordering information -- including your name, mailing 
                              address, telephone number, email address, and credit 
                              card data -- is encrypted using a secure server 
                              for maximum security. </p>
                            <p>Credit 
                              card transactions are handled by a third-party financial 
                              institution called <a href="http://www.verisign.com">Verisign</a>, 
                              the world's recognized leader in e-commerce payment 
                              solutions. They receive the credit card data only 
                              to verify the credit card numbers and process transactions. 
                            </p>
                                                        <p style="margin-top: 0;">Furthermore, 
                              your credit card and billing information cannot 
                              be read as it travels to our ordering system. To 
                              ensure that your information is even more secure, 
                              once we receive your credit card information, we 
                              store only the last five digits on a server that 
                              is not accessible from the Internet. </p>
                            <p>If you 
                              feel more comfortable doing so, you may place your 
                              book order over the telephone by calling 800-839-8640. 
                              AuthorHouse has a department fully dedicated to 
                              placing book orders. </p>
                            <p>COOKIES 
                              <br>
                              When you visit a website, information may be stored 
                              in a file known as a "cookie." This file 
                              is stored on your computer and is used for future 
                              reference. If you revisit a website, the cookie 
                              allows that website to identify you as a returning 
                              guest and tailor your shopping experience to you. 
                            </p>
                                                        
                            <p>AuthorHouse's cookies do not contain 
                              any personally identifiable information. We use 
                              them in two places. The first is when a user places 
                              an order. We use cookies to fill in their name and 
                              email address in the form where appropriate (this 
                              is known as "auto-fill.") The second is
