## AutoAnything's Lower Price Guarantee

**You will never pay more for any product at AutoAnything-guaranteed!**

If you happen to find the same product at a lower price, we will refund the difference - plus $1 - promptly.

And, to show our commitment to you, you have 1 FULL Year of price protection from the date of your purchase.

### Price match for products you would like to purchase

If you want to purchase a product from AutoAnything and you see it advertised at a lower price anywhere else, there are two ways to get that price for your order:

  * **Place your order by email**  
Email us at [sales@autoanything.com](mailto:sales@autoanything.com), and we will gladly place your order at the lower price. Include the lower price and the location where it was found.
  * **Use our online shopping cart**  
Place your order online as you would normally order an item from AutoAnything. In the "comments" area in the checkout section of your shopping cart, note the lower price you found and where you found that price. We will adjust your order to reflect a credit of the difference.

**Please note: your online receipt will not reflect the price adjustment if you order with our shopping cart. It will be emailed to you immediately once the adjustment has been processed.




Processing your order at the lower match price is done at the discretion of AutoAnything and is subject to evaluation using the terms and conditions below.

### Price match for products you have already purchased

Email us at [sales@autoanything.com](mailto:sales@autoanything.com), providing the lower price, source and the date you purchased the item from us. We will then gladly look into your order and process your refund. You will receive confirmation of the refund by email.

Processing your order at the lower match price is done at the discretion of AutoAnything and is subject to evaluation using the terms and conditions below.

### Terms and conditions

## Safe & Secure Shopping

The AutoAnything Security Guarantee protects you while you shop at AutoAnything so that you never have to worry about credit card safety. We guarantee that every transaction you make at AutoAnything will be safe. This means you pay nothing if unauthorized charges are made to your credit card as a result of shopping at AutoAnything. We have processed more than 100,000 problem free orders. AutoAnything servers use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), an encryption technology that works with Netscape, Microsoft Internet Explorer, and AOL's browser. This ensures that only AutoAnything can read your personal information. We reveal only the last four digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. We will, however, transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing.

After you click on the "checkout" button, be sure that the website's URL always begins with https://www.autoanything.com/

The "s" in "https://" at the beginning of the URL means you are logging into a secure page. If the URL does not begin with https, you are not on an AutoAnything page.

AutoAnything has also obtained a digital certificate from Network Solutions, a leading provider of Internet trust services. When you enter a secured portion of our site, an image of a closed lock or a solid key should appear in the bottom bar of your browser window. If you click on this image, a small popup window displaying site-security information will appear. This certificate guarantees that your personal information is being transmitted in secure (encrypted) form to an AutoAnything Web server, not to an unknown or unauthorized server.

Ultimately, your personal information is protected by the password you created when you registered for an account at AutoAnything on the "Log-In / Quick Checkout" page. Please keep this password confidential. No representative of AutoAnything will ever ask you for your password. The confidentiality of your password is yours to protect.
