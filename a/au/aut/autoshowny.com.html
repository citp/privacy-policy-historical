	The New York International Auto show collects customer information to help us to serve you better. We respect your privacy and are committed to maintaining and using this information responsibly.

	<strong>Information We Collect About You</strong> 
	<br>
	Any personal information you provide to us is maintained on secure servers and our internal systems. We collect information when you register online or update your account, log-in, place an order, opt-in to receive our emails, participate in a sweepstakes, contest, or promotion or survey. This information may include, but is not limited to, your contact information (for example, your name, email address, billing and shipping addresses and phone number) and your credit card information. If you create an online account, you also have the option of providing your product preferences and demographic information. If you use our "email this to a friend" functionality found on Ticket pages, or if you choose to send an email from our site to a friend, we will also collect your friend's name and email address. Your friend's information is only used to send the forwarding email and is not saved in our customer or marketing databases. 
</p>
<p>
	<strong>How We Use This Information</strong> 
	<br>
	When you place an order on any of our websites, we use this information to process and track your order and contact you via email, postal mail or phone if we have any questions or concerns regarding your order. If you provide an email address during checkout, you will also receive order confirmation and shipping status emails.
</p>
<p>
	We also maintain a record of your purchases made on any of our websites in order to serve you better. We may combine information you provide with demographic information and information that is publicly available. We may also use information about your product preferences and interests in order to improve our site design and enhance your shopping experience.
</p>
<p>
	When we offer sweepstakes, contests, promotions or surveys, you may be required to provide certain personal information so we can notify winners and/or fulfill promotional obligations. In these instances, you have the option to receive emails or other communications from us regarding our products, services, contests, and promotions. Even if you have previously chosen not to receive email or postal mail from us, you may still receive information as it relates to the sweepstakes, contest, promotion or survey in which you have participated.
</p>

<p>
	In the unlikely event of a sale of some or all of our business, the New York International Auto Show may disclose your personal information to a purchaser that agrees to abide by the terms and conditions of this privacy policy. 
</p>
<p>
	You should also be aware that we may disclose specific information about you if required to do so by law, governmental request, process or court order or based on our good faith belief that it is necessary to conform or comply with such law, request or court order or to protect the users of our websites or the public. 
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Marketing Email Communications</strong> 
	<br>
	At various points on our websites, you have the option to join our email list and receive information about our products, services and offers. Also, if you provide us with your email address when you register online or update your account, log-in, place an order, opt-in to receive our emails, participate in a sweepstakes, contest, promotion or survey, you may automatically be added to our email list and receive marketing or promotional information from us. 
	<br>
	If you do not wish to receive New York International Auto Show marketing emails, you may opt out by clicking on the unsubscribe link found at the bottom of all New York International Auto Show marketing emails, or you may email customer service at <a href="mailto:contactus@autoshowny.com">contactus@autoshowny.com</a> with the following: 

</p>
<ul class="list-bullet">
	<li>
		The phrase "no New York International Auto Show email" in the subject line 
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Please be aware that it can take up to 10 business days to remove you from our marketing email lists. If you opt-out from receiving our marketing emails, you will continue to receive order confirmation and shipping status emails. 
</p>
<p>
	<strong>How We Work with Third Party Service Providers</strong> 
	<br>
	New York International Auto Show works with reputable third parties who perform services on our behalf. Sometimes these service providers need information about our customers in order to do their jobs, such as fulfill orders and promotions, maintain and manage our customer database and report on customer behavior and/or preferences. When New York International Auto Show allows these service providers access to your information, we require them to maintain your information in the strictest confidence and we do not permit them to use it in any way other than to help us provide you with better service. 
</p>
<p>
	We currently use the services of a few carefully selected marketing companies to help manage and optimize our Internet business and communications. These companies help us to measure the effectiveness of our advertising and better understand how visitors use our sites. To do this, cookies and web beacons are placed on our websites on our behalf. The type of information collected in this manner includes pages visited, products viewed and products purchased. By supplementing our records, this information helps us to identify what pages are most attractive to our visitors, which of our products most interest our customers and what kinds of offers our customers like to see. Although our marketing partners record the information coming from our sites on our behalf, the data subsequently retrieved cannot be used for any reason without our authorization. In addition, we may share statistical, demographic and other non-personally identifiable information with third party companies to help manage and optimize our Internet business and communications. 
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Your Online Account</strong> 
	<br>
	When setting up an online account, you will be prompted to select a password. The retrieval of personal information relating to you and your order history is only available to you if you provide the correct password that you have created. After providing your password, you can edit or delete your information at any time through the "my account" page. 
</p>
<p>
	If you forget your password, you can request that it be emailed to your email address. We will not give passwords out over the phone, nor will we email them to a different address than the one used to register. If you request to have your password emailed to you, your credit card information will be automatically deleted from your profile for your protection. 
</p>
<p>
	If you are using a public computer, please click on the link on your order confirmation page that prompts you to "click here to clear all information" after placing your order to maximize privacy. 
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Links to Other Sites</strong> 
	<br>
	To enhance your experience, our websites may include links to other sites outside our family of brands. Those websites will have their own privacy policies that you may wish to review. New York International Auto Show has no responsibility for these linked websites, outside of our family of brands. 
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Cookies and Web Beacons</strong> 
	<br>
	Cookies are bits of information that we automatically store on your computer if your computer accepts cookies. Cookies do not retain any personally identifiable information such as your name, address or any financial information, on your computer. We use cookies to recognize you and your preferences in order to provide you with a customized experience on our websites. New York International Auto Show places a unique user ID number on your cookie which allows us to access information that we can then use to improve your experience.
</p>
<p>
	If you do not wish to have cookies on your system, you can set your browser preferences to refuse them. In order to disable cookies, please consult your browser's "help" section for instructions. 
	<br>
	Web beacons are small strings of code that are placed in a web page. They are sometimes called "clear GIFs" (Graphics Interchange Format) or "pixel tags". Web beacons are most often used in conjunction with cookies to monitor activity on our websites. When you visit a particular web page, web beacons notify us of your visit. Since web beacons are used in combination with cookies, if you disable cookies the web beacons will only detect an anonymous website visit. 
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Privacy of Young Children</strong> 
	<br>
	The New York International Auto Show is concerned about the privacy of young children and we do not knowingly collect any personal information from a child under 13. We do not sell products for purchase by children and all children's products we sell are for purchase by adults only. 
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Security</strong> 
	<br>
	The security of your information is very important to us. We use 256-bit Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to protect the security of your online order information. SSL technology encrypts your order information to protect it from being decoded by anyone other than the New York International Auto Show.
</p>
<p>
	Once you enter the checkout page your computer will begin communicating with our server in secure mode. You can tell that you are in secure mode by the following: 

</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		The "http" in the web address will be replaced by "https" 
	</li>
	<li>
		Depending on the browser, you will see either a padlock (Microsoft Internet Explorer, AOL, Netscape Communicator) or a solid key (Netscape Navigator) in the lower section of the browser window. 
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Only browsers that use the 256-bit Secure Socket Layer technology are able to order through our websites. If your browser does not support SSL, you can get an upgrade at Microsoft's or Netscape's home page. 
</p>
<p>
	While we implement these and other security measures on our sites, please note that 100% security is not always possible. You play a role in protecting your information as well. 
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Accessing Our Web Sites From Outside The US</strong> 
	<br>
	If you are visiting autoshowny.com from a location outside of the United States, you will be connected through and to servers located within the United States. All information you provide will be securely maintained on web servers and our internal systems located within the United States. By providing your information to us, you agree that all personal information will be used in accordance with this privacy policy. 
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Privacy Policy Updates</strong> 
	<br>
	We may update our privacy policy from time to time and our use of the information we collect is subject to the terms of the privacy policy in effect when we collect that information. Whenever we make a change, we will post the updated policy at this site and we encourage you to check our policy periodically. If you have any questions or concerns regarding our privacy policy, please contact us:
