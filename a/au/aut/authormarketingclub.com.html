<p>AuthorMarketingClub.com is owned and run by AMC (“AuthorMarketingClub.com”, “AuthorMarketingClub”, “AMC”, “us”). To contact us with questions about this privacy policy, write to:</p>
<p>AMC, 2220 Superior Viaduct, #3 Cleveland, OH 44113</p>
<p>AMC, has adopted this Privacy Policy to inform its customers and others about how it protects personally identifiable information and other information that may be collected when users visit the AuthorMarketingClub.com web site.</p>

AMC may also collect Personal Information from your usage of the AuthorMarketingClub.com website. If you do nothing during your visit but browse through the website and read the information contained on the Web pages, we may gather certain information about your visit automatically, such as your IP address, the date and time you access a given page, and the pages you visit. We use cookies to identify return users, so that they need not log in each time they arrive.</p>
<p>We use data collection devices such as “cookies” on certain pages of our Websites. “Cookies” are small files placed on your hard drive that assist us in providing customized services. We also offer certain features that are only available through the use of a cookie. Cookies can also help us provide information which is targeted to your interests. We use this information to determine our members’ demographics, interest, and behavior to better understand and serve you and our community.</p>
<p>Please note that your personally identifiable information will be stored and processed on our computers in the United States. The laws regarding the handling of personal data in the United States may differ from the laws of other countries but, as we explain below, AMC will hold and transmit your information in a safe, confidential and secure environment.</p>
<p>Under some circumstances we may require certain additional information, including, but not limited to your credit card and/or bank account billing information. We use this financial information, including your name, address, and other information to bill you for use of our Services such as sponsorships or other advertising. By making a purchase, such placing a sponsorship advertisement as enrolling as a member of a AMC or engaging in any other kind of activity or transaction that uses financial information on the Website, you consent to our providing of your financial information to our service providers and to such third parties as we determine necessary to support and process your activities and transactions, as well as to your credit card issuer and/or bank for their purposes. These third parties may include the credit card companies and banking institutions used to process and support your transaction or activity.</p>
<p>Our Use of Your Information</p>
<p>We use information in the files we maintain about you, and the other information we obtain from your current and past activities on the Websites to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our Terms and Conditions. At times, we may review the data of multiple members to identify problems or resolve disputes.</p>
<p>You agree that we may use personally identifiable information about you to analyze Website usage, improve our content and service offerings, and customize our Website’s content, layout, and service. These uses improve our Websites and may better tailor them to meet your needs.</p>

<p>Sharing and Disclosure of Personal Information</p>
<p>AMC will not sell or rent your Personal Information to any individual, business, or government entity.</p>
<p>AMC will share your Personal Information with other entities if AMC is required to respond to court orders, subpoenas, or other legal process. AMC may also use customer identifiable information to investigate and help prevent potentially unlawful activity or activity that threatens AuthorMarketingClub.com’s users or otherwise violates the Terms of Use agreement.</p>
<p>AuthorMarketingClub.com’s servers automatically gather information about which pages are visited within the AuthorMarketingClub.com site. AuthorMarketingClub does not use that information except in the aggregate. This information helps us identify the type of website content or features our customers value most. We may use suppliers to assist us in collecting, using, or otherwise processing for our benefit the non- personal information obtained through the site.</p>
<p>We share much of our data, including personally identifiable information about you, with our parent, affiliates and/or subsidiaries that are committed to serving your online needs and related services, throughout the world. To the extent that these entities have access to your information, they will treat it at least as protectively as they treat information they obtain from their other members. Our parent, affiliates and/or subsidiaries will follow privacy practices no less protective of all members than our practices described in this document, to the extent alleged by applicable law. It is possible that AMC, its affiliates, and/or its subsidiaries, or any combination of such, could merge with or be acquired by another business entity. Should such a combination occur, you should expect that AMC would share some or all of your information in order to continue to provide the Service. You will receive notice of such event (to the extent it occurs) and we will require that the new combined entity follow the practices disclosed in this Privacy Policy, as it may be amended from time to time.</p>
<p>Your Use of Author Members’ Information</p>
<p>Our services to our Reader members include postings of Requests for reviews. Some are posted anonymously; some contain our Author member’s contact information. By accepting this Privacy Policy, you agree that, with respect to other members’ personally identifiable information that you obtain through the services, AMC hereby grants to you a license to use such information only for: (a) AMC’s related communications that are not unsolicited commercial messages, that is, responses to the specific Request for Information and (b) any other purpose to which such member expressly agrees. In addition, under no circumstances, except as defined in this Privacy Policy, may you disclose personally identifiable information or confidential information about another member (including Author Members) to any third party without our consent and the consent of such other member. AMC and our AMC members do not tolerate spam. Therefore, without limiting the foregoing, you are not licensed to add a AMC member to your mail list (email or physical mail) without their express consent after adequate disclosure. Further, you may only send a relevant response to a specific request for information and not use such information for any other purpose. To report spam from other AuthorMarketingClub members, please Contact Us.</p>
<p>Security</p>
<p>AMC uses industry standard practices to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal identifiable information. AMC treats data as an asset that must be protected against loss and unauthorized access. We employ many different security techniques to protect such data from unauthorized access by others inside and outside the company. However, perfect security does not exist on the internet.</p>
<p>Access</p>
<p>We restrict access to nonpublic information to people on the AMC team who need to access that information in order to provide AuthorMarketingClub.com service to you.</p>
