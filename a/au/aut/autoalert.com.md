# Privacy Policy « AutoAlert Inc. AutoAlert Inc.

AutoAlert.com, Inc. respects the privacy of visitors to our website. This Privacy Statement applies only to information collected online through the AutoAlert.com website and does not describe the ways in which we may collect or use information obtained offline or through any means other than our website. Please read this Privacy Statement carefully so that you understand what information we collect through our website and what we do with that information. If you have any questions about this Privacy Statement, please contact us at privacy@AutoAlert.com.

## THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT

The information we gather generally falls into two categories: (1) information supplied by visitors to the website when they list a car for sale, perform a search, enter a sweepstakes or other promotional contest, request an offer through our Trade-In Marketplace program, or inquire about a vehicle listed for sale or about another product or service offered through our website; and (2) information we collect as visitors use our website.  
Third-party providers involved in the operation of the website (including, but not limited to, vendors of products and services and providers of widgets, tools, and applications) featured on or linked to by our website may also collect information about you. Their collection and use of this information will be subject to their privacy policies.

Communicating with us If you find a listing that interests you and elect to send the seller an email through our website, we will share with the seller the contact information you supply through our online “Email this Seller” form. Some dealerships that list vehicles for sale on our website use third-party service providers to manage their “leads” (that is, the inquiries they receive from consumers who are interested in the vehicles they’ve listed for sale). If a dealership has designated a provider of lead management services, we may also share with that provider any information you elect to send to the dealership through our “Email this Seller” form. Vehicle manufacturers like to monitor how responsive their franchised dealers are to consumer inquiries. To help them monitor and improve dealer performance, we may also provide vehicle manufacturers with the information you send their franchised dealers using our “Email this Seller” tool. If you find a listing for a certified pre-owned vehicle that interests you and elect to send the seller an email through our website, we will also share the information you supply through our “Email this Seller” form with the manufacturer of the vehicle you are inquiring about (which administers the certified pre-owned program) to use for quality assurance, internal business analysis, process management, and other similar purposes. If you do not wish to share your email address or other contact information with sellers who advertise on our website, lead management service providers, and vehicle manufacturers, you should not use our “Email this Seller” contact form.

If you choose to receive a vehicle listing on your mobile phone, we or a service provider acting on our behalf will use the phone number you provide to send the listing you request. By providing us with your mobile phone number, you agree that we may send this information to your mobile phone via text message or email.  
Many of the dealership listings that appear on our website include toll-free telephone numbers that can be used to contact the dealership that is selling the advertised vehicle. If you call a dealership using one of these toll-free numbers, we (or a service provider acting on our behalf) may provide the dealership with the date, time, and duration of your call, as well as the number from which your call originated and an audio recording of your call. If you use our website’s live chat feature to ask questions about a vehicle, the service provider that manages this feature on our behalf may send a copy of your chat transcript to us and to the dealership that posted the vehicle listing. Our service provider collects and uses chat transcripts in accordance with its own privacy policy, which may be accessible via the link shown during the chat session. If you do not want this information to be shared with us, do not use the chat service.

You may sign up for or use certain products, services and tools on our website that require or permit you to provide information about yourself, such as your name, physical address, email address and phone number. For example, you may provide such information if you sign up for our newsletters, complete our “Feedback” form or use a social media or interactive tool. We may use such information in order to provide you with the products, services or tools you have requested.  
When you list a car for sale, we ask for information on the car and on how you can be contacted by potential buyers (including information like your phone number and email address). We also ask for your credit card number and the expiration date on your card. We use this information to create your ad and to process your payment (please see the section on “Use and Disclosure of Information” below for more information about how we use and secure credit card information). We may also use information you submit to us in connection with your purchase of that listing, including your name and location, on third-party sites and mobile applications where we distribute or promote your listing.

In addition to the above, we may collect information, and/or use the information we collect, in the following specific ways:  
Searches and Listings To make use of certain features on our website, visitors need to provide limited information about themselves and their interests so that we can tailor the information we provide to their needs. For example, to help you find the car you want close to home, we need to know what kind of car you are looking for and your zip code. We ask you to provide this information when you perform a search. We use this information to help you find the car you are looking for or as otherwise described in this Privacy Statement.

Sweepstakes and Other Promotions From time to time, we may offer sweepstakes or other promotions on our website. If you enter a sweepstakes or promotional contest, we will ask you to provide information about yourself (such as your name, phone number, address, date of birth, and email address). Among other things, we will use this information to contact you if you win, and we may also use this information for marketing purposes. We may share this information with any co-sponsor of the contest or sweepstakes; we will identify the co-sponsor in the contest rules. We may also share this information with shipping or fulfillment companies or other third-party service providers that help administer our promotions, such as by conducting drawings, and/or delivering prizes to winners. If you do not want us to collect the information requested in the contest or sweepstakes registration form or to provide it to co-sponsors, please do not enter the contest or sweepstakes.

Online Surveys From time to time, we survey our users to measure their satisfaction with our website and other sites and to help us learn more about our audience and how they interact with our website. Third-party research firms often conduct these surveys on our behalf. We use the survey results to help us improve the services we offer to you. Except in the circumstances described below in the “Other Disclosures” section of this policy, we will not share, without your consent, any personally-identifying information you submit in response to an AutoAlert.com survey with any company other than the research firm conducting the survey. We will, however, take the information you provide and aggregate it on an anonymous basis with data collected from other survey participants. We may use and disclose that pool of anonymous information as we see fit, without identifying you personally.

You may also find on our website invitations to participate in surveys conducted by our advertisers, whose privacy practices we do not control. These invitations will usually link to an online survey form that is hosted either by the advertiser conducting the survey or by a third-party research firm working on the advertiser’s behalf. When you access an advertiser’s survey through our website, the use and disclosure of any information you submit will be governed by the advertiser’s privacy policy (or by the privacy policy of the advertiser’s research firm), which may differ from ours. If you cannot find the applicable privacy policy via a link either from the advertiser’s survey invitation or from the online survey form, you should contact the advertiser directly for more information.  
Credit App You may be able to apply for credit for a car loan or refinancing through our website using our Secure Credit Application or automobile financing portal. If you use our website to apply for credit, we (and/or a service provider acting on our behalf) will collect your personal information from you. This information may include, but is not limited to, your name, email address, date of birth, Social Security Number, address, phone number, credit history, credit score, mortgage/rental information, and employment information. If you use the Secure Credit Application, we (and/or a service provider acting on our behalf) may: (1) share your application information with the dealership(s) you selected so that the dealership(s) may make a decision about your application; and/or (2) store any application information on behalf of our dealership partners. If you submit an application through our financing portal, we will transmit your application information to our third-party service provider so that our service provider may process your credit application request, and we may store your name, email address, and phone number on behalf of our dealership partners. Our service provider’s use and storage of your credit application information is governed by its own privacy policy, which may differ from ours.

AutoAlert.com Trade-In Marketplace If you request an offer for your car through our Trade-In Marketplace program, we will ask you for your contact information, including your name, telephone number and email address. We may also ask for additional optional information, like your credit score. We will also ask you for a description of the vehicle that you want to sell or trade, including detailed information about the condition and history of the car. We will use the information you provide to prepare and send you an offer for your vehicle. If you access our Trade-In Marketplace program by clicking on a link displayed on a participating dealer website (or in a listing on AutoAlert.com posted by a participating dealer), we will share your contact and vehicle information with that dealer so that the dealer can communicate with you about your interest in selling or trading in your car. If you indicate that you are considering the purchase of a replacement vehicle, we will share your information with participating dealers in your area so that they can contact you about vehicles that may match your interests. If you decide to redeem your Trade-In Marketplace offer, the participating dealer that you choose to conduct the required confirmation inspection of your car will also have access to your contact and vehicle information. When we use other companies to help us operate our Trade-In Marketplace program or improve the services we offer to you, we may provide them with information about you and/or your vehicle that is necessary for them to perform their services. We require that these companies commit to use the information only to perform the services that we request.

Email Addresses We may use your email address to respond to requests you make for our products or services or to respond to your communications with us. We may also contact you to inquire about your experience on our website, to provide you with information about our products and services available from us or from our affiliates or to communicate to you information related to the automotive industry. From time to time, we may also send you emails that include special promotions and other commercial offers that we think may be of interest to you. We hope you will find these communications informative and useful. If you do not, you can unsubscribe from any of our commercial email programs by following the simple instructions included in an email you receive in connection with that program. If you request an offer through our Trade-In Marketplace program we will use and share your email address and other contact information with participating dealers as described in the paragraph immediately above.

To access AutoAlert.com, we will ask you to register with us on the form provided, which may include personally identifiable information like your email address. You may also be asked to provide additional, optional personal information, such as your name, gender, and age. You agree to provide true, accurate, current, and complete information about yourself.

The social network’s use of that information will be subject to its own privacy policy, which may be different from this Privacy Statement.

You may also have the opportunity from time to time to respond to questions that we display to users of the website.
