Please read the following carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your personal data and how we will treat it.</p></li>    <p>
</p><li class="paddedlist"><p><strong>2 HOW WE COLLECT INFORMATION ON AUTOTRADER.IE</strong> </p>    <p>
</p><p>2.1 You can browse Autotrader.ie without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself.</p>    <p>
</p><p>2.2 When registering as an Advertiser, responding to an advertisement via Autotrader.ie or during your time as an Advertiser or user of Autotrader.ie you may be asked to provide information to us.  We will inform you at the time of collecting information from you whether you must provide the information to use Autotrader.ie or a particular Autotrader.ie service, or whether the provision of information requested by us is optional.  By agreeing to this Policy you agree that we have informed you at the time of collecting information from you whether the information that you may provide to us will be accessible to other users of Autotrader.ie, other Advertisers or by third parties so that you are in a position to take an informed decision on whether to provide the information to us.</p>    <p>
</p><p>2.3 We may collect and process the following data about you: </p>  	<ul style="list-style:none;">  		<li class="paddedlist">2.3.1	if you contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence;<br></li>  		<li class="paddedlist">2.3.2	information that you submit in response to an advertisement or when communicating with an Advertiser; <br></li>  		<li class="paddedlist">2.3.3	in order to register as an Advertiser, we will require you to supply your name, email address, and postal address; <br></li>  		<li class="paddedlist">2.3.4	in order to ensure the information supplied to us is held securely we may occasionally request proof of identity before allowing access to your personal information;<br></li>  		<li class="paddedlist">2.3.5	if you place an advertisement on Autotrader.ie, we will require vehicle registration details, a telephone number, (either a landline or a mobile number) and an email address;<br></li>  		<li class="paddedlist">2.3.6	if you place an advertisement on Autotrader.ie, we retain information regarding the value of the order placed within the data log and on the advert placement record.

</p><p>3.1	Advertisers partake in Autotrader.ie by placing advertisements for Vehicles, Parts and Accessories for sale.

</p></li>    <p>
  </p><li class="paddedlist"><p><b>4 DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION TO OTHER PEOPLE</b></p>    <p>
</p><p>4.1	We do not disclose to any third party personal information that you provide to us unless we have your permission or we believe the law permits or requires it.</p>    <p>
</p><p>4.2	If you provide personal information to us you understand and agree that we may disclose your personal information to the following third parties:</p>    <p>
	</p><ul style="list-style:none;">  		<li class="paddedlist">4.2.1	to the Autotrader.ie hosting provider Telecity, Kilburn House, Lloyd St North, Manchester M15 6SE, UK and Getronics UK Limited Howard Pincock, The Babbage Centre, The Heath Business &amp; Technology Park, Runcorn, WA7 4QX, UNITED KINGDOM. You acknowledge that we may change the hosting provider at any time and any such change will be posted on Autotrader.ie by an amendment to this Privacy Policy.  You consent to the transfer of your personal data to any new hosting provider's servers.  You may communicate any questions, comments or requests in relation to any change in hosting provider by emailing <a href="mailto:enquiries@autotrader.ie">enquiries@autotrader.ie</a> or by post to Trader Publishing Limited, Paramount Court, Corrig Road, Sandyford, Dublin 18.<br></li>  		<li class="paddedlist">4.2.2	any member of our group of companies, which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries;<br></li>  		<li class="paddedlist">4.2.3	to Trader Media Group Limited;<br></li>  		<li class="paddedlist">4.2.4	to the prospective seller or buyer of any business or assets related to Autotrader.ie or all or part of Trader Publishing Limited or any other member of our group of companies;<br></li>  		<li class="paddedlist">4.2.5	to a third party if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data with that third party in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our <a href="/terms-and-conditions">terms of use</a> and other agreements, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of our group of companies, Autotrader.ie, our customers, other registered users or others.  This includes exchanging information with third parties for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</li>  	</ul>    <p>
</p><p>4.3	While we do not disclose your name to third party vehicle record checking service providers, when you ask us to check registration details of your vehicle or where we think it is prudent to do so, we may send limited details such as your vehicle's registration number to these services providers, including Auto Records t/a Cartell.ie.</p>    <p>
</p><p>4.4	Where legally required to do so we will notify you when information about you may be provided to third parties in ways other than explained in this policy, and you will have the option to prevent such information sharing at the time that we notify you. </p>    <p>
</p><p>4.5	We do not disclose personal information about you to third parties (including advertisers or marketing companies), but we may provide them with aggregate anonymised information about Autotrader.ie users.  For example, we may inform them that 500 men aged under 30 have clicked on their advertisement displayed on Autotrader.ie on any given day, or we might inform third parties regarding the number of unique users who visit Autotrader.ie.  We may also use such aggregate anonymised information to help advertisers reach the kind of audience they want to target (for example, women in the southeast of Ireland) when displaying advertisements on our website.  We may make use of the personal data we have collected from you to enable us to comply with our advertisers' wishes by displaying their advertisement to that target audience. You agree to these practices.</p>    <p>
</p><p>4.6	It may be necessary to transfer your personal information to other group companies or service providers located in countries outside of the European Economic Area (EEA).  This may happen where our servers or suppliers and service providers are based outside of the EEA or where you use our services and products while visiting countries outside of the EEA.  The data protection and other laws of these countries may not be as comprehensive as those in Ireland or the EU but in these instances we will take steps to ensure that your privacy rights are respected.  You agree that we may transfer your personal data on that basis.</p>    <p>
</p></li>    <p>
</p><li class="paddedlist"><p><b>5 SECURITY AND CONTROL OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA</b></p>    <p>
