					<h1>Privacy Statement</h1>	
						<div>
						
						<p><strong>Showcase Publications, Inc.</strong> is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Statement describes the ways that personally identifiable and anonymous information about our online users 
						is gathered through our website and what we do with that 
						information. The practices described in this policy are 
						applicable to current and former customers and to 
						consumers who do business with us. The policy also 
						explains how we protect the confidentiality and security 
						of our customer information. This Privacy Statement does not apply to any 
						information that You may provide to third parties; for 
						example, other sites linked to Our Website. You should 
						contact such third parties directly to determine their 
						respective privacy policies. By visiting 
						AutoShopper.com, you agree that your visit, and any 
						dispute over privacy, is governed by this Privacy Statement 
						and <a href="http://www.autoshopper.com/termsofuse.asp">Our Terms  
						of Use</a>.</p>

						<h2>Non-Personally Identifiable Information We Collect</h2>
						<p>Anytime you visit AutoShopper.com, we gather certain 
						non-personally identifiable information regarding the 
						means you use to access our site. This information  
						includes the type and version of your browser, your 
						service provider, your IP address and any search engine 
						you may have used to locate the site. We use this 
						information to help diagnose problems with our server, 
						administer the Web site, and compile broad statistical 
						data. In addition, we gather certain navigational 
						information about where you go on our Web sites. This 
						information enables us to determine which areas of the 
						Web sites are most frequently visited and helps us to 
						tailor the sites to the needs and interests of our 
						online visitors. Your IP address may be used to identify 
						possible abuse and may be blocked if abuse is detected. 
						Your information is gathered by us in 
						the aggregate and will not be associated with a specific 
						individual without that individual's consent with 
						the exception of illegal activities. If you engage in 
						any illegal acts while using this Website your IP 
						address will be released to law enforcement agencies. </p>
												
						<h2>Personally Identifiable Information We Collect</h2>
						<p>Any information you provide to us (i.e. name, e-mail 
						address, etc.) when you register, place an ad, request information, or use any of 
						the other interactive portions of our Website, is 
						securely maintained on our Web servers and internal 
						systems. This information may be used to provide you 
						with information you've requested about our company, our 
						products and our services, or to provide you with 
						special notices, automotive information, special 
						promotions and other commercial offers that we think may 
						be of interest to you. Though we hope you'll find these 
						communications informative and useful, if you don't, you 
						can always unsubscribe by following the simple 
						instructions included in each email. This data may also 
						be used to tailor your experience on our sites by 
						providing content that is relevant to your interests and 
						geographic region.</p>
						
						<p>By using AutoShopper.com, you are consenting to have your 
						personal data transferred to and processed in the United 
						States.</p>

						<h2>Placing An Ad &amp; Registration</h2>
						<p>Most of the information collected in the registration 
						process will be used to process orders. During the order 
						process, you will have to provide financial information 
						such as your credit card number, expiration date, money 
						order, wire transfer or check information. This 
						information is used for billing purposes and to fulfill 
						your order. If we have trouble processing an order, we 
						will use this contact information to get in touch with 
						you. To properly process your credit card information, 
						we must share your personal and financial information 
						with the merchant bank for authorization and approval. 
						This process is protected by an enhanced security 
						system. See the Security section below for more details 
						on security measures and procedures. We do not share 
						your personal and financial information with any third 
						parties, except those specified in the Sharing section 
						of this policy. </p>
						
						<h2>Cookies</h2>
						<p>AutoShopper.com uses cookies to improve your 
						experience with our online content. We keep track of the 
						pages visited by our users by placing a cookie, a small 
						piece of information that is stored on your computer's 
						hard drive. The cookie contains an ID number that allows 
						us to track the pages you've visited. We aggregate this 
						data with data on the pages visited by other users to 
						track overall visitor traffic patterns. We use this 
						information to improve our site by making it more 
						responsive to the needs of our users. We also use 
						cookies to control the number of times you see 
						advertisements. Cookies don't tell us who you are unless 
						you've specifically given us personally identifiable 
						information. Cookies can't read unrelated data off your 
						hard drive and are not accessible to other sites. Our 
						advertisers and third parties that provide products 
						and/or services through our site may also assign their 
						own cookies, a process we don't control. Most web 
						browsers automatically accept cookies but allow you to 
						modify security settings. The help menu on most web 
						browsers contains information on how to set your browser 
						to notify you before accepting a cookie or to disable 
						cookies entirely. However, cookies may be required to 
						complete certain functions on this Website. For example, 
						our search engine, order placement, registration and 
						login won't work properly if you configure your browser 
						not to accept cookies.</p>


						<h2>Email Addresses</h2>
						<p>We require a valid email address for every ad placed 
						on this website. Your email address will be used for 
						buyers to inquire about the vehicle you have for sale. 
						To help protect your email address from spam, your email 
						address will not be displayed online. If you provide us your email address, we may email you about our website or 
						our services, or to inquire about your experience using our website or sites 
						operated by others. From time to time, we'll also send you emails that may 
						include automotive information, special promotions and other commercial offers 
						that we think may be of interest to you. Though we hope you'll find these 
						communications informative and useful, if you don't, you can always unsubscribe 
						by following the simple instructions included in each email. And you can 
						opt-out of receiving these types of commercial offers at all by indicating, when 
						you list a car for sale or inquire about a car listed on our website, that you'd 
						prefer not to receive these communications.</p>
						
						<h2>Links</h2>
						<p>AutoShopper.com contains links to other sites. Please 
						be aware that Showcase Publications, Inc. is not 
						responsible for the privacy practices of such other 
						sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they 
						leave our site and to read the privacy statements of 
						each and every website that collects personally 
						identifiable information. This privacy statement applies 
						only to information collected by AutoShopper.com.</p>
						
						<h2>Third Party Advertising</h2>
						<p>Advertisements that appear on AutoShopper.com are sometimes 
						delivered (or "served") directly to users by third party 
						advertisers. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. 
						These companies may use aggregated information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. Third party advertisers may also download cookies to your computer, 
						or use other technologies such as JavaScript 
						and "web beacons" (also known as "1x1 gifs") to measure 
						the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize 
						advertising content. Doing this allows the advertising 
						network to recognize your computer each time they send 
						you an advertisement in order to measure the 
						effectiveness of their ads and to personalize 
						advertising content. In this way, they may compile 
						information about where individuals using your computer 
						or browser saw their advertisements and determine which 
						advertisements are clicked. AutoShopper.com does not have 
						access to or control of the cookies that may be placed 
						by the third party advertisers. Third party advertisers 
						have no access to your contact information stored on 
						AutoShopper.com unless you choose to share it with them.<br>
						<br>
						This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by 
						AutoShopper.com and <span class="underline">does not cover</span> the use of cookies or other 
						tracking technologies by any of its advertisers.<br>
						<br>
						<span class="fBold">Google AdSense</span><span> (Google.com)</span><br>
						  If you 
						would like more information about third party 
						advertisements used on this site served from Google.com and to know your choices 
						about not having information used by their advertisers,
						<a href="http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html" target="_blank">click 
						here</a>.</p>
						<p><span class="fBold">Burst Media</span><br>
						  If you would like more information about third party advertisements used on this site served from Burst Media and to know your choices about not having information used by their advertisers, visit <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp.</a></p>
						<h2>Sharing</h2>
						<p>We may employ third party companies to perform 
						functions on our behalf. These functions may include 
						order fulfillment, marketing assistance, e-mail 
						delivery, customer service, data analysis, and credit 
						processing. The third parties we contract for these 
						purposes have limited access to your personal 
						information and may not use it for other purposes. </p>
						<p>We may frame or mask another web site so that the 
						look, feel and interface simulate the experience of 
						browsing a genuine AutoShopper.com web page. Extreme 
						care and discretion is exercised when evaluating third 
						party sites. We only brand third party sites if their 
						organization applies stringent security and privacy 
						practices which parallel our own commitment to safe 
						online shopping. </p>
						<p>As our business continues to evolve, we may acquire 
						or sell business units or subsidiaries. Customer 
						information is one of the business assets that would be 
						transferred in these types of transactions. In such a 
						situation, your personally identifiable information 
						would only be used in a manner consistent with our 
						pre-existing Privacy Notice. </p>
						<p>We reserve the right to disclose your personally 
						identifiable information as required by law and when we 
						believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our 
						rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court 
						order, or legal process served on our Web site.</p>

						<h2>Your Choices</h2>

						You are entitled to make certain choices about how we communicate with you.
                        <ol>
                        	<li>You may choose not to provide personal information, even though that might impact your ability to register or receive a particular product or service.</li>
                            <li>If you do not want to receive marketing email from us, you can follow the unsubscribe link provided in those emails.</li>
                            <li>If you do not want to receive interest-based advertisements, you can opt out as discussed in the "Third Party Advertising" section above.</li>
                            <li>You have a number of choices regarding certain Data Technologies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser's setting to decline cookies if you prefer. You may also render some web beacons unusable by rejecting their associated cookies and disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or opting out at Evidon.com or the website of the technology provider. If you choose to decline cookies or similar technologies, however, please note that certain features may not function properly or at all as a result. You may be able to adjust the use of advertising identifiers on mobile devices through the settings on your device.
</li>
                            <li>If you do not want us to use Location Information, you can decline our initial invitation to provide that information, or opt out by changing the location services settings on your mobile device. However, please note that certain features may not function properly or at all as a result if you opt out.</li>
                        </ol>

						<h2>Children</h2>
						<p>In compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, Showcase 
						Publications, Inc. does not knowingly or intentionally solicit or collect 
						information from minors, and our marketing is not directed to minors. If 
						we determine that a user is under eighteen (18) years of age and has 
						submitted information by way of our website, we will immediately delete 
						such information.</p>

						<h2>Surveys</h2>
						<p>From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys. 
						Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and the user 
						therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose any information. 
						Information requested may include demographic information (such as postal 
						code, age level). Survey information will be used for purposes of 
						monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.</p>

						<h2>Security</h2>
						<p>The security of your Personal Information is very important to us. We take steps to keep your information  secure at our facilities limiting access only to authorized personnel as needed to perform operations governed by this policy. In addition, when Showcase Publications, Inc. collects credit card information from you, Showcase Publications, Inc. uses Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption, the industry standard for protecting privacy in web transactions. Please keep in mind that despite these measures, Showcase Publications, Inc. cannot guarantee or warrant 100 percent security of its servers and databases. Moreover, Showcase Publications, Inc. cannot guarantee that personally identifiable information that you submit through the Site will not be intercepted or otherwise disclosed.</p>
			

						<h2>Changes in Our Policy</h2>
						<p>Showcase Publications, Inc. may amend this Privacy Statement from time to time, at its sole discretion. Use of 
						information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Statement in effect at the time such information is used. 
						If we make changes to the Privacy Statement, we will post 
						the changes here so you are always aware of what 
						information we collect, how we use it, and under what 
						circumstances if any, it is disclosed.</p>
						
						<h2>Effective Date of this Privacy Statement</h2>
						<p>This Privacy Statement is effective as of 
						February 1, 2003 and last revised on March 25, 2014.</p>
