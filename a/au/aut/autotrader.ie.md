The Website allows users to search advertisements posted on the Website for new and used vehicles. The Website also allows users, both private sellers and professional trade advertisers, to register with Autotrader.ie (" **Advertiser** ") and to place advertisements for the sale of vehicles on the Website. 

Please read the following to understand our practices regarding your personal data, how we will treat it and your data protection rights. The Website is not intended for children and we do not knowingly collect personal data relating to children.

##### **1\. Who controls your personal data?**

Autotrader is the controller and is responsible for the personal data we obtain from your use of the Website.

The type of personal data collected and used by us varies depending upon whether you are an Advertiser, a registered user of the Website or just browsing the Website. Typically we collect and process the following kinds of personal data:

  * **Identity and Contact Data** such as your name, telephone number, email address, postal address proof of identity (if requested by us) and vehicle registration number as well as details of any advertisements and enquiries which you submit to us via the Website from time to time or inbound SMS or some other means. 
  * **Communication Data** records of your correspondence with us and, sometimes, recordings of phone calls made by you to us or by us to you. 
  * **Payment Details** including credit card numbers and expiry dates. Autotrader retains no record of this information once payment has been successfully made.

In this case, we may not be able to provide all or part of the relevant service. For example, if you wish to place an advertisement on the Website and you do not provide personal data necessary to create a user account we will not be able to give you access to that feature. 

##### **3\. How we collect your personal data**

  * **Direct Interactions:** Users of the Website are required to provide us with their name, email address, comments addressed to the Advertiser and (optionally) a telephone number when responding to an advertisement. We then email the Advertiser on the user's behalf and provide the Advertiser with this information. Advertisers agree that they will only use this information for the purposes of dealing with their Advertisement unless the relevant Website user enters into a separate agreement with the Advertiser. You may provide us with your Identity and Contact Data when contacting us through the 'contact' Website feature.

Your personal data may be transferred, stored and accessed within the European Economic Area ("EEA") or transferred to, stored in, and accessed from countries outside the EEA in order to fulfil the purposes described in this Privacy Notice. For transfers to countries outside the EEA, the data protection regime may be different than in the country in which you are located and will therefore be based on a legally adequate transfer method. Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is given to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented: 

· Where the country has been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission. For further details, see European Commission: Adequacy of the protection of personal data in non-EU countries. 

· We may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe. For further details, see European Commission: Model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries. 

We will provide you on request a list of the countries located outside the EEA to which personal data may be transferred, and an indication of whether they have been determined by the European Commission to grant adequate protection to personal data. Where applicable, you are entitled, upon request to receive a copy of the relevant safeguard (for example, EC model contractual clauses) that have been taken to protect personal data during such transfer. 

**7** **How your personal data is secured**

Autotrader is committed to maintaining the security of all personal data which is processed pursuant to this Privacy Notice. We maintain appropriate physical, procedural, organisational and technical security measures intended to prevent loss, misuse, unauthorised access, disclosure, or modification of personal data under our control. We have also put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so. 

**8** **How long do we keep your personal data?**

We keep your personal data for no longer than is necessary for the purpose for which it was processed and no longer than is allowed under applicable data protection law. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of personal data, the purposes for which we process personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means in addition to the applicable legal requirements. We also retain personal data if required by applicable law or if justified to do so under applicable statutory limitation periods.

This Privacy Notice does not address, and we are not responsible for the terms of use, privacy, content or other practices of any third-party website, including any third party website to which a link is provided on our Website.
