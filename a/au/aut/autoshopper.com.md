**Cookies**   
A cookie is a small bit of text used by a browser to store information. When you visit a site that uses cookies, the Web server will request permission to pass a cookie to your browser. If accepted, it will occupy only a few bytes on your hard drive and can improve your Web surfing experience. We use cookies to track customer visits through our site. This information enables us to save you time when returning to the site by saving your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit.

Cookies cannot profile your system or collect information from your hard drive. And although you may receive cookies from many different sites, each cookie can only be read by the Web server that originally issued it. At Showcase Publications, Inc., we do not use cookies to store credit card numbers or any other personal identification. You aren't even identified by name or e-mail address, just by a unique string of numbers that we assign the first time you register at our site - a sort of virtual identity.

While using this website, you may choose to link to third party websites that are not affiliated with Showcase Publications, Inc. These third party links may also assign their own privacy policies and/or cookies, a process we don't control. We don't have access to third party cookies or to any information they contain and we are not responsible for any third party privacy policies or cookies. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site. 

You may elect to turn off cookies or alert you when a cookie is being used by editing the preferences of your browser. However, if you refuse the cookies from this site, you may find that some services do not function properly or may be considerably slower. For example, you will no longer be able to login and change your online listing if you turn cookies off.

**Minors**   
In compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, Showcase Publications, Inc. does not knowingly or intentionally solicit or collect information from minors, and our marketing is not directed to minors. If we determine that a user is under eighteen (18) years of age and has submitted information by way of our website, we will immediately delete such information.

**Surveys**   
From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose any information. Information requested may include demographic information (such as postal code, age level). Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.

**Security**  
Our intent is to provide privacy, integrity, and authentication in regards to our Internet communication. The security measures we have taken are intended to secure and encrypt your data, so that a third party cannot capture, read or access the information while it is in transit between your computer and our system.

Specifically, we use standard-based Internet protocols to safeguard the information you provide during the purchase, payment and most information submittal processes. We use a secure server implementing the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol to interact with you when you provide personal information during the purchase and payment processes. These processes use 128 bit encryption. You can tell if you are using a Web browser that supports SSL if a "key" or "padlock" icon appears in one of the lower corners of your screen (For example, when using Netscape you will see a key; when using Internet Explorer you will see a padlock). When you enter a secure page, the key is "un-broken" or the lock is closed. This means that your communications are now secure, encrypted, and cannot be read by non-authorized sources. Another sign that you are in a secure transaction mode is a URL that begins with "https:". When you see any of these symbols on your browser, you know that your information is protected and you can interact with the website with confidence.

We limit internal access to our servers databases and require that Showcase Publications, Inc. employees adhere to high standards of ethics and integrity in performing their jobs and conducting business. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our employees must use password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desk. When they return, they must re-enter their password to re-gain access to your information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers’ information is protected.

**Changes in Our Policy**  
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post the changes here so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information, and whether we will disclose it to anyone. By continuing to use this website, you agree to the privacy policy stated above, along with our [Terms of Service Policy](https://web.archive.org/web/20050403054047id_/http%3A//www.showauto.com/termsofservice.htm).
