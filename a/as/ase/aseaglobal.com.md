### SECURITY, ENCRYPTION, COOKIES, LOG FILES AND VERIFICATION

a. Encryption - Secure Sockets Layer (SSL Technology) - ASEA uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to protect Customers Personal Information. SSL technology enables encryption (scrambling) of sensitive information, including credit card numbers, during your online transactions. All of the forms on our site are secured with SSL technology. While on a secure page, such as the order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Apple Safari and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when Customers are just 'surfing'.

b. While SSL encryption is used to protect sensitive information online, ASEA also does everything in its power to protect Customer information off-line. All of ASEA’s Customers’ information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in the ASEA office. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information. Furthermore, all employees are kept up-to-date on ASEA’s security and privacy practices. ASEA employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance ASEA places on privacy, and what they can do to ensure all Customers’ information is protected. Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment, behind a locked cage in a locked facility.

c. Cookies - A cookie is a piece of data stored on Customer’s computer tied to information about them. ASEA uses both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, once Customer close the browser, the cookie terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the Customer hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions.

By setting a cookie on ASEA Media, Customers would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on ASEA Media. If a Customer rejects the cookie, he/she may still use ASEA Media, however, the Customer will be limited in some areas of ASEA Media. Persistent cookies enable ASEA to track and target the interests of ASEA customers to enhance the experience on ASEA Media. Some of ASEA’s business partners use cookies on ASEA Media. However, ASEA has no access to or control over these cookies.

d. Log Files - Like most standard website servers ASEA uses log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track Customer movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to Personally Identifiable information.

e. ID Address Verification - ASEA uses third party software to verify a Customer’s identity and address to match billing information records.
