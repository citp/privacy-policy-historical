<p>Maintaining your privacy and trust is important to <strong>Contract Web Development Inc.</strong>. On this Web site, Contract Web Development Inc. and its affiliates collect information from users in connection with certain features and services. This privacy policy is designed to tell you how personal information is collected and used on this Site so that you can make an informed decision about using our Site, or permitting your children to use our Site.</p>
<p>Please read this policy before using our Site or submitting any personal information to us. By using our Site, you consent to the information collection and use practices described in this policy. Contract Web Development Inc. reserves the right to change this privacy policy at any time. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes in an updated privacy policy so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. The date of the last revision is always posted at the top of the privacy policy. Your use of this Site following the posting of such changes or revised policy shall constitute acceptance of any such changes. We encourage you to review our privacy policy whenever you visit our site to make sure that you understand how any personal information you provide will be used.</p>
<p>Contract Web Development Inc. is the sole owner of the information collected on this site.  To contact Contract Web Development Inc., please visit the <a href="/contact">Contact</a> page. <strong>We value your privacy. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways other than as disclosed in this policy.</strong></p>
<h2>What information is collected on this Site?</h2>
<p>In order to provide our users with certain products or services on our Site, Contract Web Development Inc. and its affiliates may collect different types of information. In particular, we occasionally may need to collect certain types of personal information in order to provide our users with particular features, services or offers. "Personal Information" as used herein means information that identifies a person or allows a person to be located. Examples of Personal Information include a first and last name, a home address, or an email address. The following is a summary of the kinds of information we collect at the Site from our users, and how we collect that information:</p>
<h3>Passive Collection</h3>
<p>Our software automatically collects certain information from a user's computer when that user logs on or moves about our Site. We do not link this information to any other Personal Information the user tells us; we only use it to get a broad picture of who is on our Site and which areas our users are visiting. This information tells us what's important to our users and what isn't, allows us to make our Site more interesting and useful, and enhances security and efficiency on our Site. The two main ways in which we collect this general information are through:</p>
<ul class="bullets">
    <li><strong>Log Files</strong> - log files are records of user activity collected to analyze trends, administer the Site, track users' movements, and gather broad types of information for aggregate use. The kinds of general information we collect in the log files include:
    <ul class="bullets">
        <li>The IP address of the user's computer.</li>
        <li>How many people visit our Site.</li>
        <li>Which pages of our Site are visited most often.</li>
        <li>Which ISPs our visitors come from (e.g. AOL, MSN, etc.).</li>
        <li>Which browsers users are used to visit our Site (Netscape, Internet Explorer, etc.).</li>
        <li>Time of day users visit our Site.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Cookies</strong> - Contract Web Development Inc. also uses "cookies" to gauge how users interact with our Site. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Cookies cannot execute code or deliver a virus to a computer. Usage of a cookie is not linked to any personal information, it merely helps the Site to be more efficient. Typically, a cookie enables a user's computer to load Web site files faster on subsequent visits. We may also use cookies to track a user's path for security purposes, as well as to target a user's interests in an effort to enhance the user's experience on our Site. If a user wishes to block, erase, or be warned of cookies, the user may refer to browser instructions to learn about these functions. If a user rejects a cookie, the user may still use our Site, however, the user may be limited in the use of certain areas. For example, if the user disables cookies the <strong>font sizing</strong> feature will not work properly.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Active Collection</h3>
<p>At several places on our Site, we collect certain information that users voluntarily provide to us which may contain Personal Information. Here is a brief summary of some of the areas on our Site where users may be asked to provide Personal Information:</p>
<ul class="bullets">
    <li><strong>Registration</strong> - one or more areas of our Site may require users to register for access. As part of the registration process we may ask users for a username, password, or other personal information in order to verify the user's identity, establish the account, promote security, and enable access to various online features. We may also ask users to complete a survey as part of the registration process to find out more about who is using our Site (see more on surveys below).</li>
    <li><strong>Product Updates and Other Communications</strong> - we may collect information whenever a user communicates with us  or asks to receive more information about Contract Web Development Inc. or Contract Web Development Inc. products, services and events (for example, if a user sends us email or signs up to receive notification of product updates or new product releases). This information may include the user's name, e-mail address, or other contact information.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How does Contract Web Development Inc. use information collected on this Site?</h2>
<p>Contract Web Development Inc. is the sole owner of the information collected on this Site. Personal Information that is provided to Contract Web Development Inc. (such as a personal e-mail address) may be used by Contract Web Development Inc. in the following ways:</p>

    <li>to contact users or others about a user's use of the Site or about our products and services or about special events or offers.</li>
    <li>to notify contest winners.</li>
    <li>to respond to comments or requests.</li>

<p>We have the following exceptions to this disclosure policy: We will release specific information about you or your account to comply with any valid legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute or court order.
