# Asda | Privacy & Cookie Policy

**_Privacy Policy_**

**Our Privacy Mission Statement:**

"At ASDA, we value the trust placed in us by customers, suppliers and colleagues who give us their Personal Information. Data security is one of our highest priorities and we aim to be as clear as possible about what we do with Personal Information and why we do it."

**Our Privacy Statement for ASDA websites**

Your Privacy is really important to us, and we understand how important it is to you.

Our aim is to be as clear and open as possible about what we do and why we do it. ASDA is committed to the online Privacy of all its users.

This Privacy Policy regulates the use by ASDA and its partner companies of the information you provide when using ASDA websites.

This ASDA website is run by the [ASDA group of companies](http://www.asda.com/help/privacy-policy.html?cmpid=ahc-_-ahc-_-asdacom-_-hp-_-footer-_-privacy#asdagroupcomp) and its partners (" **we** ", " **us** ", " **our** ")

The Privacy policy applies to the processing of your application by Asda and your use of the recruitment services on this site.

**_Information we collect_**

You can have a look through the site without giving us any of your Personal Information.

If you decide to apply for a position through the site or an agency, Asda will need to collect and process your Personal Information, including:

  * Name, address and postcode - We need this to send you all of the recruitment information.
  * E-mail address - We send a confirmation of your application by email. We may use e-mail or telephone to speak to you about similar vacancies unless you have asked us not to. We may also contact you by e-mail if you have only partially completed an application. But don’t worry. We won’t fill up your inbox with boring emails.
  * Contact telephone numbers - If there are any problems with your application, or we have to clarify anything with you, we need to be able to contact you quickly. Again, we certainly won’t call you for any other reason.
  * User name and password - This is to keep your Personal Information secure, and so you can come back to an incomplete application at a later date.
  * Your application – Well, we definitely need this so we can assess you. Such Personal Information will include details of your skills (including education, professional qualifications and training), employment history and referees. You should only provide the Personal Information required by our application template. This template includes a question about any adjustments that may be required should you be invited for an interview or assessment.
  * Disability Information – Any information you provide about a disability is considered Highly Sensitive. By providing such Personal Information, you agree to allow us to use it for the purposes of making any necessary adjustments if you’re invited for interview/assessment, and for monitoring purposes.
  * Criminal records checks – For some roles, we might need to enquire about previous criminal convictions or carry out criminal records checks. If this is necessary, we’ll make you aware of this as early in the recruitment process as possible.
  * Other Personal Information specified during the online application process that is relevant to recruitment.



If you’re application is successful, we’ll need a few other things before you start. This includes your National Insurance number (and any other proof of your right to work in the UK, for example visa or working permits), bank details, date of birth, next of kin, and driving licence (if applicable).

**_How we use the information we collect_**

The Personal Information you provide will be used to:

  * Process your application.
  * Consider you for the position you have applied for, and any upcoming vacancies that are suitable (unless you have opted not to be contacted in respect of subsequent vacancies).
  * Fulfil Asda's legal obligations.
  * Carry out internal record keeping.
  * Provide general information (which does not identify individuals) and statistics to help Asda develop its websites and services.
  * Make up part of your personnel records if your application is successful. However, this will only be for as long as it’s relevant to your employment at Asda.
  * Approach your nominated referees for the purposes of obtaining references.
  * Carry out equal opportunities monitoring (see below).



Where you provide Personal Information about somebody else, like your referees, you should always ask them beforehand to get their consent.

**IP addresses**  \- when you visit our site, we will automatically receive your IP address, a unique identifier for your computer or other access device.

**Equal opportunities -** We’re required by law to make basic documentation checks on every candidate. Please note that we’ll ask you to provide documentation of your eligibility to work in the UK if you’re invited to attend the next stage of the recruitment process with us. Other Personal Information, for example, relating to your gender, race or ethnic origin, religion or belief, age bracket, details of any disability and sexual orientation is requested for the purpose of monitoring the effectiveness of our Equal Opportunities policy. This Personal Information is requested purely for monitoring purposes.
