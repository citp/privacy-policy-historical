        </p>
        <p>  
                Where we talk about an order in this policy, this can mean an order for goods or services, registration on a site, an application for a quotation or application for a product or service or the opening of an account.
        </p>
                <h2><strong>Information We Collect</strong></h2>
                <p>
        To be able to order from us we have to collect certain information from you.  As part of this, you will need to give your contact information. We use the information given to us by you to provide the service you request from us in the way that is set out in this privacy policy. You can change your registration details easily through the account facilities available on the website.
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>User name and password</strong> - If we collect a user name and password, this is so we can keep your information safe and so that we can have your information to hand each time you visit us.
        </p>
                <p>
        <strong>Name, address and postcode</strong> - Without this we won't know where to send your order or to whom. We also use postcodes to quickly get your full address to save you typing it out, and in some cases to identify whether we deliver or offer services in your area.  
        </p>
                <p>
        <strong>Age / date of birth</strong> – we may need to collect your age or date of birth in order to be able to offer you certain products, such as insurance, financial services products or alcohol, and we may also use this to send you age or birthday related offers if you agree.

                <p>
        <strong>Email address</strong> - we send a confirmation of your orders via email which may include delivery details, order tracking and our customer services details, in case you need to contact us about your order.

                <p>
        <strong>Payment card number, expiry date, issue no and name of card holder</strong> – when you purchase a product or service we need these details so we can collect payment in the same way as when we take payment in a store via chip and pin.
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>Where you heard about us</strong> – we may ask you this to help make our marketing more efficient.

By letting us have any sensitive personal data, you expressly consent to us using and telling others about any of your sensitive personal data so we can provide you with the goods or services requested by you in the way set out in this Privacy Policy. 
        </p>
                <p>
        <strong>Third party information</strong> - if you give us information about another person (for example if someone else is taking delivery for you or is included in the purchase of a product) you confirm that you have identified ASDA to them and told them what we will use their information for, as set out in this Privacy Policy and that they have given permission for us to be able to use their personal information in the manner described.  Their personal information will be used to make sure that the delivery is performed correctly, to get in touch with them (if we need to) and to respond to any communications from them.  They will not be sent marketing information unless they become a customer and provide us with any necessary consents.
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>IP addresses</strong> - when you visit our site, we will automatically receive your IP address, a unique identifier for your computer or other access device.

                        Performance cookies allow us to recognise and count the number of visitors to our sites and to see how visitors move around them. This helps us to improve the way our sites work by enabling us to tailor our sites to the way visitors use them.

                        Experience cookies allow our sites to remember the choices you make. Our sites use experience cookies to provide you with enhanced and personalised features. For example, we use information collected through what are known as “web-analytic” cookies to compare the choices you make to those of our other customers so that we can learn from those choices.
                        <br>
                        Information collected by experience cookies cannot track your browsing activity when you leave our sites to browse other sites.

                        Marketing cookies record your visits to our sites, the pages you have visited and the links you have followed. We use this information to make our sites and the advertising displayed on them more relevant to your interests. For example sometimes we use marketing cookies to limit the number of times that you see an advert. Sometimes we share information about your browsing activity, (which we have collected from cookies), with our advertising partners. They may use this information to advertise products, which may interest you, on other sites.

        A cookie is a small piece of text that a website may place on your computer's hard drive.
        <br />
        We use cookies to:
        </p>
        <ol>
                <li>operate online ordering (cookies are needed to browse, apply and purchase);</li>
            <li>greet you personally and speed up your log-in when you come back to the site and to remember your previous orders; </li>

                </ol>                        
                <p>
        You may set up your web browser to notify you of cookie placement requests or decline cookies completely (although declining them may prevent you from being able to use the website properly or at all). How to do this is explained below.
        </p>
        <p>
        We may look at cookies stored on your computer when you visit our website in future or when you open an email from us.  We are able to do this by including web beacons (also known as clear GIFS or web bugs) in our emails and on our website.  Our web beacons do not store information on your computer but, by speaking with our cookies on your computer, they can tell us when you have opened emails from us and what pages you look at.
        </p>
        <p>
        We may also use third party web analytics services (for example Google Analytics, a popular web analytics service provided by Google, Inc.) to help us look at how users use the site.  The service provider may be based outside the UK but your information will only be used for the purpose of looking at your use of our website, putting together reports on website activity and providing other services connected with website activity and internet usage.  The service provider may also let third parties have this information where required to do so by law, or where such third party provides the information on the service provider's behalf.  The service provider will not associate your IP address with any other data held by them. 
        </p>
        <p>
        If you have Adobe Flash installed on your computer (most computers do) and you use our audio or video players, the web analytics service may try to store some additional data on your computer.  This data is known as a Local Shared Object or Flash cookie.  This helps us look at the popularity of our media files.  We can count the total number of times each file is played, how many people watch videos right to the end and how many people give up half way through.  Adobe's website explains how to control Flash cookies on your computer.

          You may come across Asda adverts and content while you are on other websites. For these adverts, and if your computer is set to allow cookies, our third party provider will use software that can set a cookie through your browser to enable us to monitor whether you see the adverts, click on them and buy from our website. Some of this information is personal but none of it is sensitive. We collect this so we can make our adverts relevant to you based on your past visits to websites. We only share this information within Asda. If you would prefer not to receive or see this content on the websites you visit or to exercise your choice about the collection, use and sharing of this information with us, please visit the <a href="http://www.criteo.com/en/privacy-policy" target="_blank" title="Click here for more information about Criteo">Criteo website</a>.

        <h2><strong>Who We Share The Information With</strong></h2>
                <p>
        We will not sell, distribute or lease your personal information to third parties (other than our Partners) unless you say we can or are required by law. We may need to disclose your information to process and fulfil your order, to provide services you request, for internal business analysis purposes, for marketing, for the purposes of fraud prevention, or if ASDA itself, or any of our business is bought or sold.
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>Market Research</strong> - we may provide information at an aggregated statistical level about our customers, sales, traffic patterns and related site information to third parties, but this information will not identify individuals.
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>Processing by third parties</strong> - from time to time we may employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include completing orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail, e-mail or SMS messages, removing repetitive information from customer lists, confirming contact details, looking at information, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing credit card payments and providing customer service (such as through our call centre staff in the UK or South Africa). They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. They must also process the personal information as set out in this Privacy Policy and as permitted by the UK's Data Protection Act.
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>International transfers</strong> - in order to carry out the steps set out above we may send your personal information outside of the European Economic Area and, if necessary, across international borders. The data protection laws in these countries may not be as comprehensive as in the European Economic Area. However, we have taken appropriate steps to make sure there is the same level of protection for the processing carried out in these countries as within the European Economic Area.
        <br>
        Any details you provide may be electronically sent to the US to our parent company Wal-Mart Stores Inc., which helps us in running our websites. However, any such information will be dealt with in accordance with the UK’s Data Protection Act.
        </p>
        <h2><strong>Storage of Data</strong></h2>
                <p>
        We will not store your personal information for any longer than we need to, however we may be obliged by law to store your communications and personal information including activity logs and we may need to show details of these to government or authorised officials upon request. Like many websites, we use log files to monitor the effectiveness of our online marketing programmes. 
        </p>
        <h2><strong>Access Rights</strong></h2>
                <p>
        You have a right to access the personal information that is held about you. To obtain a copy of the personal information ASDA holds about you, please write to us at the following address enclosing your postal details and a cheque for £10, which we are entitled by law to charge, payable to ASDA Stores Limited:
        <br>
        Data Protection Officer,
        <br>
        Legal Department,
        <br>
        ASDA Stores Limited, 
        <br>
        ASDA House, 
        <br>
        Great Wilson Street, 
        <br>
        Southbank, 
        <br>
        Leeds, LS11 5AD
        </p>
         <p>
        <strong>Security</strong> - at ASDA, information security is very important and we have taken many steps to make sure your shopping experience with us is secure. Information about you will be kept safe and secure.
        <br>
        In order to prevent unauthorised access or disclosure of your information, we have put in place suitable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to protect and secure information that is collected online. 
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>Keeping your information secure</strong> - to help us keep your information confidential you should:
        </p>
        <ol>
                <li>Keep your password secret.</li>
            <li>Never distribute the website addresses for pages that you have looked at while logged in as a registered customer.</li>
            <li>You should choose a password that is not obvious or known to anyone else. You should never give a third party your password, as you will be responsible for all activity and charges incurred through use of your password whether authorised by you or not.
                        </li>
            <li>If you forget your password, you can request a new password, which will be emailed to the address we hold for you. You can change your password anytime through the account facilities on the website.  Should we think that there is likely to be, or has been any breach of security, we may change your password and notify you of the change by email.
                        </li> 
        </ol>
        <p>
        <strong>Payment Card Security</strong> - we use Verisign, 3DS and the latest SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) technology to make sure that the details you provide when placing an order are kept private and secure, making shopping on our website safe. Our secure server encrypts your credit or debit card number details along with your personal information and changes them into bits of code that are then securely sent over the internet. Your browser will show when you are in a secure environment by displaying either a locked padlock or an image of a key in the grey bar at the bottom of the page; it may also warn you when you are entering a secured environment as you go to place your order. Once your payment information is received by us, your payment card is processed through the same systems that handle our store sales - so they're tried and tested over many years of secure operation.
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>Security in our offices</strong> - access to your information is restricted in our stores and offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information. The servers that store this information are kept in a secure environment.
        </p>
        <h2><strong>Links</strong></h2>
                <p>
        Our website may contain links to let you visit other websites of interest easily. Once you have used these links to leave our website, you should be aware that we do not have any control over that other website. As such we cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of any information which you provide whilst visiting these websites, and they are not governed by this Privacy Policy. ASDA is not responsible for any products and/or services featured on any third party website. You should exercise caution and look at the Privacy Policy applicable to the website in question.
        </p>
        <h2><strong>Notification of Changes to This Policy</strong></h2>
                <p>
        If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post these changes on this website so you know what information we collect and how we use it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a way different from that told to you at the time it was collected, we will tell you. You will have a choice as to whether or not we use your information in this different manner.
        </p>
        <h2><strong>Feedback</strong></h2>
                <p>
        We want to make sure we're giving you the information about privacy and security that you want - let us know what you think. If you have any feedback, questions or concerns, please <a href="http://your.asda.com/section-contact-asda">contact us.</a>
