**Cookies**

A cookie is a small piece of text that a website may place on your computer's hard drive.

We use cookies to:

  * operate online ordering (cookies are needed to browse, apply and purchase);
  * greet you personally and speed up your log-in when you come back to the site and to remember your previous orders;
  * help us look at web traffic to allow us to improve your experience; and
  * make sure of the security and authenticity of registered users.



You may set up your web browser to notify you of cookie placement requests or decline cookies completely (although declining them may prevent you from being able to use the website properly or at all). How to do this is explained below.

We may look at cookies stored on your computer when you visit our website in future or when you open an email from us. We are able to do this by including web beacons (also known as clear GIFS or web bugs) in our emails and on our website. Our web beacons do not store information on your computer but, by speaking with our cookies on your computer, they can tell us when you have opened emails from us and what pages you look at.

We may also use third party web analytics services (for example Google Analytics, a popular web analytics service provided by Google, Inc.) to help us look at how users use the site. The service provider may be based outside the UK but your information will only be used for the purpose of looking at your use of our website, putting together reports on website activity and providing other services connected with website activity and internet usage. The service provider may also let third parties have this information where required to do so by law, or where such third party provides the information on the service provider's behalf. The service provider will not associate your IP address with any other data held by them.

If you have Adobe Flash installed on your computer (most computers do) and you use our audio or video players, the web analytics service may try to store some additional data on your computer. This data is known as a Local Shared Object or Flash cookie. This helps us look at the popularity of our media files. We can count the total number of times each file is played, how many people watch videos right to the end and how many people give up half way through. Adobe's website explains how to control Flash cookies on your computer.

**Turning cookies and web beacons off** \- If you want to delete any cookies or web beacons that are already on your computer or stop future cookies or web beacons, please go to the instructions for your file management software or look at [www.AboutCookies.org](http://www.aboutcookies.org/).

We will not sell, distribute or lease your personal information to third parties other than our subsidiaries, affiliates or parent companies unless you say we can (for example for carefully selected third parties to contact you) or are required by law. We may disclose your information to process and fulfil your order, to provide services you request, for internal business analysis purposes, for the purposes of fraud prevention or if ASDA itself, or any of our business is bought or sold.

They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. They must also process the personal information as set out in this Privacy Policy and as permitted by the UK's Data Protection Act.

**International transfers** \- in order to carry out the steps set out above we may send your personal information outside of the European Economic Area and, if necessary, across international borders.
