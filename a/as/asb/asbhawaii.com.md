We value your business and the trust you have put in American Savings to provide a safe and secure environment for personally identifiable information about you and your finances, which we will call in this Privacy Policy your "Personal Information." It is our policy that all Personal Information about you will be held in strictest confidence. American Savings does not sell or share your Personal Information or Personal Information about our former customers to non-affiliated third parties outside the American Savings family of companies except for those companies that work for us and as permitted by law. To help you better understand how we protect your Personal Information, we are providing you with the following Privacy Policy describing our privacy practices and policies with respect to your Personal Information pursuant to the Federal Financial Privacy Law.

We collect, maintain, and use information about you on a routine basis in order to offer you the financial services and products you seek to obtain and to provide superior customer service. We use all of your Personal Information we collect for specific business purposes such as administering and servicing your accounts, complying with state/federal banking regulations, protecting against fraud, and developing a better understanding of your financial needs to provide you with improved products and services. Personal Information we collect falls within the following five categories:
