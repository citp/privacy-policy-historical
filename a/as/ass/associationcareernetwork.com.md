This site is operated by Affiniscape, Inc. (“Affiniscape”). Affiniscape takes your privacy very seriously; accordingly, we provide this notice to set forth our use of information generated from this website.

**What this Privacy Policy Covers**

This policy covers how Affiniscape treats personal and non-personal information collected and received through the Affiniscape.com website. Non-personal information includes “cookies.” This policy does not govern the practices of companies that Affiniscape does not own or control or people that Affiniscape does not employ or manage.

**Personal Information**

You may be asked to provide personal information in certain fields on this website. Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable. Examples include your name, address, e-mail address, and other information not publicly available. The personal information collected on this site is used only for the purpose for which it is requested via the site 

**Non-Personal Information**

Affiniscape may automatically receive and record information on its server logs from your browser, including your IP address and cookies. We may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our website. Your IP address may be used to gather broad demographic information.

**Cookies**

We may use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests. Cookies are text files we place in your computer's browser to store your preferences. Cookies, by themselves, do not tell Affiniscape your e-mail address or other personally identifiable information unless you choose to provide this information to Affiniscape by, for example, registering at one of Affiniscape's sites. However, once you choose to furnish the site with personally identifiable information, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie. We use cookies to understand site usage and to improve the content and offerings on Affiniscape's sites. Affiniscape also may use cookies to offer you products, programs, or services.

**Information Sharing and Disclosure**

Affiniscape uses industry-standard technologies when transferring and receiving consumer data exchanged between Affiniscape and other companies to help ensure its security. This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under Affiniscape's control. However, "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet.

Additionally, although we strongly recommend that each of the other sites to which we target our Internet banner advertisements post a privacy statement that fully describes the advertising activities on its site, we cannot guarantee that all such sites will follow our recommendation.

**Links**

Affiniscape may create links to other websites. Affiniscape will make a reasonable effort to link only to sites that meet similar standards for maintaining each individual's right to privacy. However, many other sites that are not associated with or authorized by Affiniscape may have links leading to Affiniscape's site. Affiniscape cannot control these links and Affiniscape is not responsible for any content appearing on these sites. Since this website does not control the privacy policies of third parties, you are subject to the privacy customs and policies of that third party. Affiniscape encourages you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others.

**Amendments**

Affiniscape may amend this policy at any time. If Affiniscape is going to use personally identifiable information collected through Affiniscape's corporate site in a manner materially different from that stated at the time of collection Affiniscape will notify users by posting a notice on Affiniscape's website for 30 days.

**Contacting the Website**

If you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of this site, or your dealings with this website, you can contact Affiniscape at:[webmaster@Affiniscape.com](mailto:webmaster@Affiniscape.com).
