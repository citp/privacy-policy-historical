<p><b>Information We Collect </b></p>
<p>To serve your health insurance needs, Assurant Health collects information about you. We may collect this information directly from you orally or on applications or other forms. We also collect information from third parties such as your agent or broker, your current or former health care providers and consumer reporting agencies. In addition, this information may include your transactions with Assurant Health, its affiliates and others. It is impossible to describe every type of information that we collect, but here are some examples: your name, age, address, Social Security number, telephone number, occupation and other demographic information about you and your family; whether you are a past or present customer with us, or if you ever applied for an insurance product or service from us, as well as your history of other insurance coverage and applications (if you apply online, information is collected through an Internet “cookie,” an information-collecting device from a web server); your past, present or future physical, mental or behavioral health or condition; your health care history; your history of insurance coverage, premiums, claims and payments through Assurant Health; information from consumer reporting agencies and data collection agencies.</p>

Assurant Health must have this health information to process your claims. </p>
<p><b>Health Care Operations:</b> Assurant Health may use and disclose protected health information as part of our health care operations. For example, we may use and disclose information in the underwriting process, renewal process, quality assessment activities or accreditation and certification. </p>

<p><b>Business Associates:</b> Assurant Health works with companies and consultants who perform a wide variety of functions on our behalf. For example, we work with financial institutions such as agents, brokers, insurance distributors, reinsurers and excess loss insurers, non-financial institutions such as health care providers, detectors of fraud, auditors, insurance support organizations, claims handlers, underwriters, and others such as information technology specialists and consultants. At times it may be necessary for us to provide your protected health information to one or more of these outside persons or organizations who assist us with our health care operations. In all cases, we require these business associates to provide written assurances to us that they will appropriately safeguard the privacy of your protected health information. </p>
<p><b>Individuals Involved in Your Care or Payment:</b> We may use or disclose protected health information to you or other family members who are covered under your health insurance policy regarding your care or payment related to your care.
