**Treatment:** Your health care provider may ask us to use or disclose protected health information in connection with treatment, including the provision, coordination, or management of health care and related services. 

**Payment:** We may use and disclose protected health information for payment purposes, including billing, review of health care services, determining whether a service is “medically necessary” and for utilization review. For instance, a doctor or health facility involved in your care may forward a claim to us with your protected health information. Assurant Health must have this health information to process your claims. 

**Health Care Operations:** Assurant Health may use and disclose protected health information as part of our health care operations. For example, we may use and disclose information in the underwriting process, renewal process, quality assessment activities or accreditation and certification.

For example, we work with financial institutions such as agents, brokers, insurance distributors, reinsurers and excess loss insurers, non-financial institutions such as health care providers, detectors of fraud, auditors, insurance support organizations, claims handlers, underwriters, and others such as information technology specialists and consultants. At times it may be necessary for us to provide your protected health information to one or more of these outside persons or organizations who assist us with our health care operations. In all cases, we require these business associates to provide written assurances to us that they will appropriately safeguard the privacy of your protected health information.
