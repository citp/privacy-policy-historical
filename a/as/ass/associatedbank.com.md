By capturing this information we will be able to provide you with updates to our Web site, notify you of new products and services being offered, and allow us to enhance our Web site based on traffic trends. 

Associated may use a "cookie" on some pages of our Web site. A "cookie" is an element of data that a Web site can send to your browser, which may then store it on your system. A cookie helps a Web site to recognize whether or not you have visited the site before, allowing the browser to provide your information back to the server on subsequent visits. A cookie does not retrieve any data from your hard drive, does not carry computer viruses, and does not reveal anything about you that you have not already revealed. 

Associated is concerned about protecting personal information it gathers about its clients. Associated wants to ensure that all client account information is kept confidential to protect the client's right to privacy, to secure accounts from fraud and to avoid clients receiving unwanted solicitations. Associated believes our clients have the right to be informed about the information being collected about them and about its intended use. Associated may share information we receive from you directly among our affiliated companies to better fulfill your needs for financial products and services. 

This information is provided to keep you informed about the privacy policies of Associated and its subsidiaries. This statement reflects our understanding and expectations at the time we provide it. Naturally, these policies could change over time. No information communicated by Associated regarding its privacy policy statement alters, amends or creates any contractual relationship and does not constitute any type of warranty. 

You may be familiar with federal legislation that requires financial institutions to follow some specific guidelines in insuring the privacy of your financial records and nonpublic personal information. This is a practice that Associated Banc-Corp and its affiliates have always taken very seriously.

We would like to take this opportunity to clearly outline the guidelines we will follow to protect your nonpublic personal information, including the privacy provisions in Title V of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. After reviewing this information, please contact us if you have additional questions. Thank you for choosing Associated. We appreciate your business.
