the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply

Beacons/Web Bugs)</span></h1><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt">We and our third party
advertising companies employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web
Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing
us what content is effective.&nbsp; Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique
identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online
movements of Web users. The main difference between the two is that clear gifs
are invisible on the page and are much smaller, about the size of the period at
the end of this sentence. Clear gifs may be tied to a user's account, but are
completely secure and cannot and will not be used to disclose information about
a user or a user's account to any third parties.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Clear Gifs can "work with"
existing cookies on a computer if they are both from the same Web site or
advertising company.&nbsp; That means, for example, that if a person visited “www.companyX.com”,
which uses an advertising company's clear gif, the Web site would match the clear gif's identifier and the advertising company's
cookie ID number, to show the past online behavior for that computer. This
collected information would then be given to the advertising company.&nbsp; </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt">In addition, we may use clear
gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by
the recipients.&nbsp; This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain
communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.&nbsp; If users would
like to opt-out of these emails, please see the Opt-out section. </span></p><h1><span style="font-size: 11pt">&nbsp;</span></h1><p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-size: 13pt">Communications from the
