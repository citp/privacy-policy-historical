# Privacy Policy

We strive to keep our customer's information private and confidential. We have a "zero spam" policy, meaning we will not add or sell your information to any mailing lists.

• We do not share customer information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete an order.

• For example, when an item is not available, we may send your shipping information to our suppliers so they can fulfill your order.

• Return email addresses are not used for any purpose other than to answer emails we may receive or to send you a copy of our bi-monthly newsletter.

• If you do not wish to receive electronic mailings, you can have your name removed from our internal mailing list at any time. Removal instructions appear at the bottom of each newsletter.
