Updated and Effective From: May 17, 2017

Association of Surfing Professionals LLC d/b/a World Surf League and its related bodies corporate (collectively referred to as WSL and individually referred to as a WSL Entity), support the protection of your rights to privacy as a fundamental element of its governance of professional surfing worldwide and the relationship it has with its members. WSL is committed to maintaining the highest standards of privacy and security in the way in which it conducts business. With regard to the privacy of any personal information, WSL pledges to conduct business according to the following principles, which apply in their entirety to the World Surf League online and mobile sites and applications (each a “WSL Digital Site” and collectively the “WSL Digital Sites”). 

If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not use a WSL Digital Site. Your use of any part of the WSL Digital Sites indicates your acceptance of this Privacy Policy and your consent to use of your personally identifiable information by WSL in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
