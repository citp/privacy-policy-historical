Updated: September 8, 2015

**1\. WSL Privacy Policy**

Association of Surfing Professionals LLC d/b/a World Surf League and its related entities (collectively referred to as “WSL” and individually referred to as a “WSL Entity”), support the protection of your rights to privacy as a fundamental element of the governance of professional surfing worldwide and the relations involved with its members. Both from a corporate and employee level, WSL is committed to maintaining the highest standards of privacy and security in the way in which it conducts business. With regard to the privacy of any personal information, WSL pledges to conduct its business according to the following principles, which comply with at least the Australian Privacy Principles (Australian legislation), which can be found by (clicking here)[www.google.com/url?q=http%3a%2f%2fwww.oaic.gov.au%2fprivacy%2fprivacy-resources%2fprivacy-fact-sheets%2fother%2fprivacy-fact-sheet-17-australian-privacy-principles&sa=d&sntz=1&usg=afqjcnfwgzw6a5s03o74hmvrj9sui-njpq]. These standards apply to use by WSL around the world, and include each of the jurisdictions in which WSL operates.

Personal Information is information about you that identifies you or information by which your identity can be reasonably determined. This Privacy Policy illustrates in general terms how WSL protects the privacy of your personal information under the Australian Privacy Principles. It also sets out the matters, which WSL is required to disclose to individuals under Australian Privacy Principles 1.4. The principles set out in this WSL Privacy Policy will apply to any personal information you provide to WSL and to information, which WSL collects about you from other sources (e.g., WSL Events or sponsors).

There may be specific principles detailed here which may apply to certain situations of disclosure of information to WSL. They will be detailed by their specific headings.

**2\. Collection of personal information**

If WSL requires personal information, it is generally collected directly from you. Personal information is usually collected during the course of WSL's relationship with you, and may be provided by you in correspondence (e.g., letter, form, email, through the WSL website or app, or by entering competitions, events, promotions or membership application), or by you giving WSL such information in person.

Generally, the type of personal information WSL collects about you includes matters relevant to the primary purpose for the information being collected, such as:

  * Your full name;
  * Your sex;
  * Mailing address;
  * Telephone number;
  * Interests;
  * E-mail address;
  * Age;
  * Nationality;
  * Bank details; or
  * Next of Kin.



Further to the above, WSL may collect medical and health related information from you if you enter and compete in WSL events (“Medical Information”).

**3\. Choice**

WSL is careful to recognize any valid requests from individuals to suppress their names from use for any reason and have various systems and procedures in place to ensure this suppression is provided efficiently when requested by the relevant individual. Any such requests should be made by contacting WSL directly on the contact details at the foot of this Policy.

**4\. Compliance**

WSL is fully compliant with the Privacy Amendment (Enhancing Privacy Protection) Act 2012 of Australia and operates within the requirements of any relevant privacy law or regulation around the world.

**5\. Purposes for personal information collected**

WSL will only use the information for the following purposes or as required by law:

  * to provide you with information about WSL Events, promotions, functions or entries
  * to notify you regarding WSL event or membership issues;
  * to be able to respond to questions or comments you have;
  * to enable you to enter contests or events that we promote or conduct;
  * to pay you prize money or other applicable payments;
  * to assist in administration matters relating to insurance;
  * to administer all WSL events and tours efficiently;
  * to accord you credit in connection with images, audio visual footage and/or other content submitted by you to WSL, when applicable;
  * to contact you for discipline purposes as stipulated in the WSL rulebook; or contact you urgently for any reason deemed necessary.



WSL may also provide any and all Medical Information collected to medical professionals working at WSL events for the purpose of providing the best possible medical care to you.

In some circumstances, WSL collects personal information about you from a third party source (e.g. if WSL runs a competition or event in conjunction with a third party co-promoter and you provide your personal information to it). As a general rule, WSL will attempt to ensure that any third parties from whom it gets personal information about you comply at least to the privacy law requirements of Australia and have advised you that it will or may be passed on to us and/or we will take reasonable steps to contact you and ensure that you are aware of the purposes for which we are collecting your personal information.

**6\. Other people's information, which you provide to us**

If you provide personal information to WSL about someone else, such as your agent or next of kin, you must ensure that you are entitled to disclose that information to WSL and that it can collect, use and disclose such information for the purposes described above without being required to do anything else under relevant privacy laws (which may include laws of a country they are from or in which they reside). You should take reasonable steps to ensure the individual concerned is aware of the contents of this Privacy Policy as those matters relate to them. You should ensure that the information disclosed has been approved by the individual as being true and correct.

**7\. Third Parties Use of personal information**

WSL may engage third party contractors to perform services, which involve the contractor handling personal information (including, without limitation, Medical Information) that WSL holds. For example, WSL may engage third party contractors to maintain and monitor its customer and user databases. In these situations, WSL restricts it to using any of your personal information for the purpose permitted under this Privacy Policy. All contractors having access to your personal information will also be bound by a confidentiality provision in their respective contract that protects use of that personal information.

In limited circumstances WSL may provide your personal information to third parties such as co-sponsors or promoters of WSL events. In such circumstances, WSL will take commercially reasonable steps to ensure you are aware that this may be the case when the information is collected unless otherwise permitted herein.

**8\. Sharing information within the WSL group of entities**

Each WSL Entity may disclose personal information to other WSL Entities, which will use and disclose the information only for the purpose for which it was originally collected and as described above. The contact details below are applicable to all WSL Entities. All WSL Entities are aware of and are committed to this WSL Privacy Policy.

**9\. Awareness**

WSL management ensures that relevant information is disseminated in a timely and appropriate way throughout the organization and between the WSL Entities. WSL uses a variety of resources to stay informed about developments in legislation and regulation, including any advances in methods of ensuring security and integrity of information held. We provide the use of various mechanisms to its employees ensuring that WSL policy and procedures comply with and surpass accepted practices where WSL operates.

**10\. Access to your personal information**

If you request, WSL will provide you with access to the personal information it holds about you (unless there is an exception which applies under the Privacy Act such as employee records or if it may put the health or life of an individual at risk). WSL will process your request in a reasonable time. Note that WSL may recover a reasonable cost of providing you with such access.

In the case that WSL refuses to provide you with access to such information, we will provide you with reasons for the refusal and inform you of any exceptions relied upon under the Privacy Act.

**11\. Accuracy, completeness and currency of your personal information**

WSL will take commercially reasonable steps to ensure that your personal information is accurate, complete, and up-to-date. If any of the personal information WSL holds about you is inaccurate, incomplete or out-of-date, please contact WSL immediately and WSL will correct any incorrect information.

**12\. Security of your personal information**

Personal information WSL holds is stored either in hard copy documents or as electronic data. WSL protects any personal information in any form from misuse and loss and from unauthorized access, modification and disclosure.

Physical security is maintained over our paper and electronic data stores and premises, such as locks and security systems. WSL maintains computer and network security; for example, WSL uses firewalls (security measures for the internet) and other security systems such as user identifiers and passwords to control access to our computer system.
