<h2 class="element">3.	Information Collected From You</h2>

<p class="element">To qualify to receive access to the Website and/or Services, subject to the requirements set forth in our Terms of Service we gather personal information from you in order to begin your application to Aspen University. This information may include, but is not necessarily limited to, your first and last name, e-mail address, postal mailing address, mobile telephone number and other demographic information, as well as credit/debit card information for payment and/or age verification purposes (collectively, "Personally Identifiable Information" or "PII". IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU SUPPLY US WITH VALID, COMPLETE, CURRENT AND ACCURATE PERSONAL IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION; SUCH PII WILL BE USED TO SUPPLY THE SERVICES TO YOU AND TO COLLECT PAYMENT FOR SUCH SERVICES (WHERE APPLICABLE). By submitting your PII, you authorize us to confirm the accuracy of the information you submitted against government-issued identification. We may also collect information related to your online activities to more accurately target and measure our advertising inventory, including, without limitation, the places you visit at the Website, content accessed and associated marketing metrics (such as e-mails opened and responded to) (collectively, your "Marketing Profile").</p>

<h2 class="element">4.	Links To Third-Party Websites</h2>
<p class="element">In addition, you may find links to other websites from our Website. Please be aware that the Company is not responsible for the privacy practices of any third parties and/or websites. We strongly encourage you to be aware of when you leave our Website and/or supply your Personally Identifiable Information to any third party, and to read the privacy policies of each and every third party and/or website before using such third party website(s) and/or before supplying any PII to them. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by this Website.</p>

<h2 class="element">5.	How We Use And Share The Information We Collect</h2>

<p class="element">You understand and agree that the Company may use and share your PII with third parties as needed to supply the Service(s) to you. For example, we may notify you in regards to your account or transactions with us.  </p>
<p class="element">You understand and agree our advertising relationships allow us to make the Company, its Website and/or the Service(s) available to you. Accordingly, the Personally Identifiable Information that you submit to the Company remains your property, but by participating in the Company Website and/or Service(s), you grant us the right to use such PII and your Marketing Profile for multiple marketing and/or research purposes, including, but not limited to, sharing such PII with third parties. These providers may include, but are not limited to, providers of online, e-mail, telemarketing and direct mail marketing services and applications. Such services and applications may include, but not be limited to, lookup and reference, data enhancement, overlay, appending, suppression and validation.</p>
<p class="element">By submitting your data to Aspen University, you are indicating that you have read and agree to this Privacy Policy and its Terms of Service, and you further acknowledge and agree that you understand how and under what circumstances your Personally Identifiable Information will be used. You also agree to receive marketing promotions and other solicitations from this Website.</p>
<p class="element">In addition to marketing purposes, the Company reserves the right to release your Personally Identifiable Information if: (a) we believe that the Website and/or Service(s) is being or has been used in violation of the Terms of Service and/or to commit unlawful acts; (b) your Personally Identifiable Information is subpoenaed or requested by a court, governmental agency or law enforcement entity; or (c) the Company is sold, transferred and/or acquired. Moreover, you hereby consent to the disclosure of any information, record or communication from you to any third party when the Company determines, in its sole discretion, that the disclosure is appropriate or necessary, for example, to share your e-mail address with other third parties for suppression purposes in compliance with the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, as amended from time to time.</p>
<p class="element">In addition, you agree that by enrolling in Aspen University such act constitutes a purchase, inquiry and/or application for purposes of the Amended Telemarketing Sales Rule, 16 CFR §310 et seq. ("Rule"). Notwithstanding that your telephone number may be listed on the Federal Trade Commission's Do-Not-Call List, the Company retains the right to contact you via telemarketing in accordance with the Rule. To the extent that your credit card-specific information and/or social security number is collected by the Company, said information will be transmitted securely, kept in confidence and will not be shared with any third parties (other than third party service providers - such as payment processors - who provide services to the Company and/or consumer credit agencies) without your prior informed consent. In addition, by submitting your credit card information to us, you authorize the Company to periodically verify by various methods that your credit card account continues to be valid and active, including, without limitation, charging and thereafter immediately crediting a small sum to the credit card. Apart from the foregoing uses, the Company and its affiliates and/or subsidiaries reserve the right to share with third parties the fact that we/they have credit card information on file for you, but such specific credit card information shall not be shared by us/them with any third parties without your prior authorization</p>
<p class="element">You may receive an e-mail confirming your inquiry, application or enrollment to/in Aspen University. The Company reserves the right to collect and retain data relating to e-mail marketing sent to, and opened by, individuals on our marketing list(s). </p>
