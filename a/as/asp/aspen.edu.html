                    <h3><b>FERPA</b></h3>
                    <p><b>The Family Rights and Privacy Act of 1974</b>, as amended, 
                      (commonly known as the Buckley Amendment) is a federal law 
                      which provides that schools will maintain the confidentiality 
                      of student education records. The law basically says that 
                      no one outside the institution shall have access to students' 
                      education records nor will the institution disclose any 
                      information from those records without the written consent 
                      of students.</p>
                    <p>In compliance with FERPA, the following statement reflects 
                      Aspen University's policy:</p>
                    <p><i>The following directory information may be released 
                      by telephone:<br>
                      a) student's dates of attendance; <br>
                      b) date of graduation and degree or certificate earned. 
                      </i></p>
                    <p><i>Other kinds of directory information, such as a student's 
                      address, telephone listing, program of study, awards received, 
                      and the most recent previous education agency or previous 
                      institution attended, will be released only in response 
                      to a written request. </i></p>
                    <p><i>Aspen University reserves the right to refuse the above 
                      information if the reason for the request is not considered 
                      to be a sufficient need to know. Information regarding the 
                      student's record: grades, courses, GPA, social security 
                      number and other personal information will not be released 
                      without the student's written consent.</i></p>
                    <p>Each student has the right to inform Aspen University that 
                      any or all of the information is not to be released. This 
                      status is binding until such time that Aspen University 
                      is notified in writing by the student to permit release 
                      of "directory information". <br>
                    </p>
                    <p><b>Parental Access to Children's Education Records:</b><br>
                      At Aspen University, parents or gaurdians have no inherent 
                      rights to inspect a student's education record. The right 
                      to inspect is limited solely to the student. Records will 
                      be released to parents only under the following circumstances: 
                      (1) through the written consent of the student, (2) in compliance 
                      with a subpoena, or (3) by producing a copy of the most 
                      recent Federal Income Tax form showing that the student 
                      was claimed as a dependent. </p>
                    <p><b>Posting of Grades by Faculty:</b><br>
                      The public posting of grades either by the student's name, 
                      institutional student identification number, or security 
                      number without the student's written permission is a violation 
                      of FERPA. <br>
                    </p>

                    <p><b>Self-assessment Surveys:</b><br>
                      Aspen University makes a series of self-assessment surveys 
                      available to prospective students to help them make decisions 
                      regarding their career and education. When you visit our 
                      site, you may voluntarily complete any or all of these surveys. 
                      The surveys solicit information that is electronically evaluated 
                      for the purpose of recommending career paths and determining 
                      whether distance education might be a good way for you to 
                      learn. <br>
                      <br>
                      Your responses to the survey are saved in a database on 
                      the Aspen University server when you click the Submit button 
                      at the bottom of each survey page. However, no information 
                      identifying you as an individual is collected or stored. 
                      Therefore, your responses to the survey are completely anonymous. 
                      We have no way of knowing who generated which data or of 
                      contacting you. You will never receive any solicitation 
                      or other communication from Aspen University based on information 
                      provided in this survey, and Aspen will not sell or share 
                      this information with other individuals or organizations.</p>
