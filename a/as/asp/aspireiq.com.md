AspireIQ, Inc., doing business as AspireIQ (www.aspireiq.com), as well as any present or future affiliated or related company (AspireIQ or we), recognizes the importance of your privacy. This privacy policy tells you what personal information we collect and how we use it. AspireIQ may change this privacy policy from time to time, in its sole discretion, as discussed in section 7 below. By registering an account or otherwise using or visiting any AspireIQ website, application, product, software, tool, data feed, and/or service (collectively the "Service"), you understand and agree to the terms of this policy. Please read this policy carefully. 

## 1\. What Information Do We Collect?

 _a. Personally-Identifiable Information:_ We may collect personally identifiable information when you specifically and knowingly provide it to us, for example when you request a demo or register and provide personal information such as your e-mail address, name, phone number, year of birth, or other information. Where applicable, personally identifiable information includes personal data as defined in applicable law. 

This Privacy Policy does not apply to the privacy practices of third parties that we do not own or control, including but not limited to any third party websites, services, applications, online resources to which this Site may link or otherwise reference (collectively Third Party Services or TPS) that you may access through the Services. For example, the Services utilize the YouTube API Services as a TPS, and you are agreeing to be bound by the YouTube Terms of Service ([ https://www.youtube.com/t/terms ](https://www.youtube.com/t/terms)), Privacy Policy ([ http://www.google.com/policies/privacy ](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy)), and API Services Terms of Service ([ https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/api-services-terms-of-service ](https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/api-services-terms-of-service)) when engaging YouTube content and services through the Service. We take no responsibility for the content or privacy practices of any TPS. We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of any TPS you access.{' '} 

You may have the option to register an account with us using a TPS, and you may connect your account to a TPS such as Instagram, Facebook, Twitter or YouTube. By authorizing us to access your TPS account, you authorize us to obtain certain information from your TPS account, which may including your name, email address, birthday, work history, education history, current city, shared media, and the names, profile pictures, relationship status, and current cities of your TPS contacts. We only obtain information from your TPS account that you specifically authorize and grant us permission to obtain. 

AspireIQ does not consider personally identifiable information to include information that has been anonymized so that it does not allow a third party to identify a specific individual. We collect and use your personally-identifiable information to: provide the Services; operate and improve our Service; provide customer service; perform research and analysis aimed at improving our products, Service and technology; and display content that is customized to your interests and preferences. 

You may always choose not to provide personally identifiable information, but if you so choose, certain parts of the Service may not be available to you. If you have registered an account with us, you will have agreed to provide your personally identifiable information in order to access the Services. This consent provides us with the legal basis we require under applicable law to process your data. You maintain the right to withdraw such consent at any time. If you do not agree to our use of your personal data in line with this Policy, please do not use our Services. 

_b. Sensitive Personal Data:_ Subject to the following paragraph, we ask that you not send us, and you not disclose, any sensitive personal data (e.g., social security numbers, information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or other beliefs, health, biometrics or genetic characteristics, criminal background or trade union membership) on or through the Services or otherwise to us. 

If you send or disclose any sensitive personal data to us when you submit content to the Services, you consent to our processing and use of such sensitive personal data in accordance with this Policy. If you do not consent to our processing and use of such sensitive personal data, you must not submit such content to us. 

_c. Non-Personally-Identifiable Information:_ We may collect and aggregate non-personally identifiable information which is information which does not permit you to be identified or identifiable either by itself or in combination with other information available to a third party. This information may include information such as a website that referred you to us, your IP address, browser type and language, hardware types, geographic location, and access times and durations. We also may collect navigational information, including information about the Service content or pages you view, the links you click, and other actions taken in connection with the Service. We use this information to analyze usage patterns as part of making improvements to the Service. 

_d. Cookies, Pixels and Local Storage:_ We may collect information using cookies, which are small data files stored on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device by a website. We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer or mobile device until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience when using the Services. 

We use two broad categories of cookies: (1) first party cookies, served directly by us to your computer or mobile device, which are used only by us to recognize your computer or mobile device when it revisits any site or application that is party of the Services; and (2) third party cookies, which are served by service providers on sites or applications and can be used by such service providers to recognize your computer or mobile device when it visits other websites. 

### i. Cookies we use

The Services use the following types of cookies for the purposes set out below: 

Type of cookie| Purpose  
---|---  
 _Essential Cookies_|  These cookies are essential to provide you with services available through the Services and to enable you to use some of its features. For example, they allow you to log in to secure areas of the sites or applications and help the content of the pages you request load quickly. Without these cookies, the services that you have asked for cannot be provided, and we only use these cookies to provide you with those services.   
_Functionality Cookies_|  These cookies allow the Services to remember choices you make when you use a site or application, such as remembering your language preferences, remembering your login details and remembering the changes you make to other parts of your account, or preferences. The purpose of these cookies is to provide you with a more personal experience and to avoid you having to re-enter your preferences every time you use the Services.   
_Analytics and Performance Cookies_|  These cookies are used to collect information about traffic to the Services and how users use the Services. The information gathered does not identify any individual visitor. The information is aggregated and anonymous. It includes the number of visitors to, the websites that referred them, the pages visited, what time of day they visited, whether they have visited before, and other similar information. We use this information to help operate the Services more efficiently, to gather broad demographic information and to monitor the level of activity on our Services.   
We use Google Analytics for this purpose. Google Analytics uses its own cookies. It is only used to improve how the Services work. You can find out more information about Google Analytics cookies here:{' '} [ https://developers.google.com/analytics/resources/concepts/gaConceptsCookies ](https://developers.google.com/analytics/resources/concepts/gaConceptsCookies)  
You can find out more about how Google protects your data here:{' '} [ www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html ](http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html).   
You can prevent the use of Google Analytics relating to your use of the Services by downloading and installing the browser plugin available via this link:{' '} [ http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en-GB ](http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en-GB)  
_Social Media Cookies_|  These cookies are used when you share information using a social media sharing button or like button on any site or application for the Services or you link your account or engage with our content on or through a social networking website such as Facebook, Twitter or Google+. The social network will record that you have done this.   
  
### ii. Disabling cookies

You can typically remove or reject cookies via your browser settings. In order to do this, follow the instructions provided by your browser (usually located within the settings, help tools or edit facility). Many browsers are set to accept cookies until you change your settings. If you do not accept our cookies, you may experience some inconvenience in your use of the Services. For example, we may not be able to recognize your computer or mobile device and you may need to log in every time you use the Services 

### iii. Pixel Tags

We may also use pixel tags (which are also known as web beacons and clear GIFs) on the Services to track the actions of users on our sites and applications. Unlike cookies, which are stored on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device by a website, pixel tags are embedded invisibly on webpages. Pixel tags measure the success of our marketing campaigns and compile statistics about usage of the Services, so that we can manage our content more effectively. The information we collect using pixel tags is not linked to our users personal data. 

### iv. Do Not Track Signals

Some Internet browsers may be configured to send "Do Not Track" signals to the online services that you visit. We currently do not respond to do not track signals. To find out more about "Do Not Track," please visit{' '} [http://www.allaboutdnt.com](http://www.allaboutdnt.com/).

## 6\. Security and Encryption

We follow generally accepted industry standards to help protect your personal information. No method of transmission over the internet, mobile technology, or method of electronic storage, is completely secure. Therefore, while we endeavor to maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect the confidentiality of the information that we collect online, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. Our Service has security measures in place designed to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. We use standard Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption that encodes information for such transmissions. All Service information is maintained on secure servers. Access to stored data is protected by multi-layered security controls including firewalls, role-based access controls and passwords. You are responsible to keep your password secure. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), please immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us at support@aspireiq.com. 

## 7\. Changes to This Policy

We reserve the right to change the terms of this privacy policy at any time. When we make changes, we will revise the last updated date at the top of the policy. If there are material changes to this statement or in how we will use your personal information, we will notify you by prominently posting a notice of such changes here or on our home page, or by sending you an email.
