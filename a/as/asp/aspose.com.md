##### Overview

You should be aware though, that if you choose to provide us with your Personal Information, we may transfer such information, within Aspose or to Aspose's third party service providers, across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world, subject to the limitations of this Privacy Policy.

Aspose strives to comply with all applicable laws around the globe that are designed to protect your privacy. Although legal requirements may vary from country to country, Aspose intends to adhere to the principles set forth in this Online Privacy Policy.

##### Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies

When you visit Aspose.com, you may surf the site anonymously and access important information without revealing your identity. In order to analyze and improve our site, we use "cookies" to track your visit. A cookie is small amount of data that is transferred to your browser by a web server and can only be read by the server that gave it to you. "Cookies" cannot be executed as code or deliver viruses.

Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, therefore allowing you to decide whether or not to accept it. (For some web pages that require an authorization, cookies are not optional. Users choosing not to accept cookies will not be able to access such pages.)

While Aspose uses cookies to track your visit to Aspose.com, and our web servers automatically log the IP/Internet address of your computer, this information does not identify you personally and you remain anonymous unless you have otherwise provided Aspose with Personal Information.

##### Newsletters

From time to time, Aspose will provide information to their customers in the form of electronic newsletters.

Your personal information will not be leased, sold, rented or otherwise made available to any other third party except to the extent necessary to comply with applicable laws, police investigations, or in legal proceedings where such information is relevant. Occasionally, Aspose allows access to database information to bonded mailing houses only for the purpose of allowing for the printing of mailing labels that are used for Aspose's own direct mail and promotional purposes. In those instances, the third party is strictly bound by these terms.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, you hereby agree that Aspose may assign, sell, license, or otherwise transfer to a third party, your name, address, email address, member name and any other personal information in connection with an assignment, sale, joint venture, or other transfer or disposition of a material portion or essentially all of the assets or stock of Aspose or its affiliated entities.
