					quotes: ["<span id='quote'>Great book, very cheap for the amount of information it contains. I bought it a few weeks back and coupled with this forum, it is bulletproof.</span> <span id='quoteauthor'>kozij</span>",
"<span id='quote'>I got this last night and as an experienced Amazon seller, having established several stealth accounts via trial and error I would advise anyone in our business to just get this guide before making expensive mistskes. It is first class in every aspect. Well done Aspkin and thank you</span> <span id='quoteauthor'>stevaxx</span>",
"<span id='quote'>At $37, this is a no-brainer for anyone who wants to get back on Amazon, regardless of their level of technical expertise. $37 is what - a sale or two? Using these techniques, a user could get back on Amazon is less than 24 hours. Aspkin's guides always pay for themselves - not over a period of weeks or months, but DAYS! In many cases, ONE SALE will cover it.</span> <span id='quoteauthor'>jeffweico</span>",
"<span id='quote'>The reason this book is so good is all the extra and insider information on how to keep these accounts working for you. Which is some of the most important tid bits of information you could probably only find in the book or the forums if you search hard enough. The content in the book is well worth more than the asking price.</span> <span id='quoteauthor'>jamblix</span>",
"<span id='quote'>I wouldnt be back on ebay if it wasnt for the guide, so yes it is very worth the small investment. Book & forum combined will give you the best tools possible to get back on and know what 'not' to do</span> <span id='quoteauthor'>EmptyPockets</span>",
"<span id='quote'>It reads like a '.... for Dummies' book in the way that if you dont understand something all you have to do is go back and read it slowly and you will get it.</span> <span id='quoteauthor'>Donna</span>",
"<span id='quote'>Should we even be asking this question? It's Aspkin we're talking about here, all of his books are 'GOLD'. The only ebook that tells it like it is, with no lies attached to it like everything else you would find online.</span> <span id='quoteauthor'>Red X</span>",
"<span id='quote'>I was getting a bit desperate when I kept getting kicked off Ebay and I could not work out how to stay on. The book has been an excellent buy giving me all the information I needed. I have only been up and running for about 6 weeks, so time will tell if I can keep operating without another suspension.</span> <span id='quoteauthor'>ebppmongrels</span>",
"<span id='quote'>I wanted to just personally thank Aspkin for providing this service and forum for Ebay...I have finally returned back into the Ebay ballgame for over two months...passed documentation verification and paypal verified...and two other accounts in the same position...i couldn't have done any of this without Aspkin's book and forum...I realize that at anytime a snag could shake things up but at least I can earn an income the way i know how...SELLING !!!</span> <span id='quoteauthor'>dupedagain</span>",
"<span id='quote'>I thought I knew alot about the eb/pp because I have been dealing with them for a number of years but I lacked consistency, so the stealth guide was a huge help it made close up some holes in my game and introduced me to things I have never heard of as well as to this community which is just plain fantabolous</span> <span id='quoteauthor'>zero25</span>",
"<span id='quote'>Just finished reading, very good book very detailed and to the point. Also getting access to the vip section is a great perk. Thanks.</span> <span id='quoteauthor'>123</span>",
"<span id='quote'>There are techniques in this guide that took me 6 months of reading the forums to figure out and i would say that I am more advanced. The info and techniques are there just sit down crack it open and start doing it! The only think i ask, is why you made me read for 6 months and not come out sooner!</span> <span id='quoteauthor'>newtools</span>",
"<span id='quote'>This book is the definitive must read guide on on how to get back on amazon and start selling again weather you are a beginner or stealth pro. Amazon is and always will be an animal of it's own. A different level of detail and knowledge is needed in order to tame this beast and keep the sales going!</span> <span id='quoteauthor'>newtools</span>",
"<span id='quote'>fINALLY I BROKE DOWN AND BOUGHT THE BOOK! IF I WOULD HAVE DONE THIS SOONER I WOULD BE BACK AT MY POWERSELLER STATUS! IF YOU GOT NAU AND BANNED FOR LIFE, BUY THE BOOK! YOU WILL BE BACK AND MAKING MONEY! BUY IT TODAY, READ TONIGHT, BE BACK ON IN A FEW DAYS! PERIOD!</span> <span id='quoteauthor'>beatingebay</span>",
"<span id='quote'>I Have To Say Amazon Ghost is the best e-book i have ever read, it has everything in you need, i got it last week on trailpay i have paid over £400 on the e-books for ebay/paypal/amazon but this is straight to the point better than all of them put together and the same strategies work for ebay/ paypal, aspkin this is the best ever</span> <span id='quoteauthor'>robsut</span>",
"<span id='quote'>Let me say if you're thinking about buying an Ebay account or starting a second one or are going to make a few to set aside for a 'rainy day' then don't even bother until you've read the 'eBay Stealth' book. It's almost 50 pages, very well done, and not at all the same thing as the ebooks in Ebay penny auctions.</span> <span id='quoteauthor'>Donna</span>",
"<span id='quote'>ONLY complaint. I wish it was released sooner. I spent about 3 weeks with a migraine trying to search the forum for all of this information. All that I still didn't know if I was doing things correctly (I wasn't). After reading this I realize I need to go back and redo some things to truly go GHOST on Amazon. Thanks Aspkin!!</span> <span id='quoteauthor'>E-Nertia</span>",
"<span id='quote'>I would like to personally thank askpin for creating such wonderful guide to get us back to selling again. I created a seller's account yesterday on amazon, passed all the verification with different info and even made my first sale this morning. Thanks again.</span> <span id='quoteauthor'>inthezone</span>",
"<span id='quote'>Just a fantastic read for everyone (New or Pro's) to sell on Amazon. You will not find this much Complete Information anywhere... I am new to this forum and as many will tell you on here Amazon is a beastly challenge compared to ebay... Thats why you need Amazon Ghost it is a must read .. thank you Aspkin for another awesome guide...</span> <span id='quoteauthor'>Shadow2010</span>",
"<span id='quote'>Amazon Ghost is a big step up from eBay Stealth and covers all the extra things that could link your accounts. I highly recommend this essential eBook for those that want to sell on Amazon again or even perhaps want to have multiple account elsewehere on the internet. It has certainly helped me with more than just Amazon. Thanks Aspkin for yet another great eBook!</span> <span id='quoteauthor'>Markk</span>",
"<span id='quote'>After i bought Ebay stealth book and read it..i realized I had just purchased Gold...and for $37 dollars...best thing i have done so far in trying to rebuild my income..only wish i knew about it and bought it long ago...could have saved me SOOOOOO much money and aggravation..it is now my bible.</span> <span id='quoteauthor'>dupedagain</span>",
"<span id='quote'>Yes, today I bought the book. I'm reading it now. I am impressed. Very thorough, neatly organized and to the point. I'm only 1/4 through mind you. I see this as one of the best investments for me this year, conservatively. Glad I found this site and the book.</span> <span id='quoteauthor'>2bluestarmom</span>",
"<span id='quote'>This eBook is amazing! I seriously do not make an account without reviewing this book. I no longer just do eBay, I eBay Stealth. I give all my thanks to aspkin for making it possible for me to continue to have an eBay Business. Thank you Aspkin!</span> <span id='quoteauthor'>Ace717</span>",
"<span id='quote'>I bought the book after being a member here after 5 months. I cost myself time lots of frustration, accounts set up wrong, and more importantly money. My opinion is the price is too low (says the future buyers) if it was me selling it...without a doubt it would be more.</span> <span id='quoteauthor'>MtnDew</span>",
"<span id='quote'>As a business decision, buying this was a no-brainer. It takes time and money to create a stealth account PROPERLY and then you have to know how to work it to lessen the chances of getting shut down. This guide will easily save me much more than its cost in the future. It can also be very enlightening in other ways, it could give you ideas.</span> <span id='quoteauthor'>jeffweico</span>",
"<span id='quote'>if you havent brought the book your wasting time, this book is well worth ALOT more than it is sold for!!!!!!!! it is the best ebook i have ever ran across!!!!!!!!! THANK YOU ASPKIN (:</span> <span id='quoteauthor'>techbayelectronics</span>",
"<span id='quote'>I recently bought the book... Its very detailed and a very good read. I have not had the time to sit down and set up any accounts, but it should be fairly easy with the step by step process. I dont regret buying this book. Especially if i am able to make a few more sales.</span> <span id='quoteauthor'>Karleon</span>",
"<span id='quote'>To the author, I am indepted to you. I thought all was lost and I wouldn't have been able to provide for my family as I have a young daughter who I am home with. Thank you, thank you.. I am forever grateful and there are no words to describe my thanks for getting me back on my feet!</span> <span id='quoteauthor'>ets</span>",
"<span id='quote'>I've been digging through these forums for days. It can be hard piecing all of the information together when you are brand new to stealth accounts. I didn't want to pay for the e-book, and I even bought a very cheap alternative I found elsewhere... Needless to say, I shelled out the $37 for the legit stealth guide and I couldn't be happier! The amount of information is amazing and very easy to understand.</span> <span id='quoteauthor'>biggunn</span>",
