We only collect personal information that is relevant to the purpose of our website, which is to enable users to discover and share information with one another. This information allows us to provide you with a customized and efficient experience. We do not process this information in a way that is incompatible with this objective. We collect the following types of information from our Asphalt & Rubber users:

> Information You Provide to Us:

>  We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. Asphalt & Rubber and its authorized agents automatically receive and record certain “traffic data” on their server logs from your browser including your IP address, Asphalt & Rubber cookie information, and the page you requested. Asphalt & Rubber uses this traffic data to help diagnose problems with its servers, analyze trends and administer the website. Asphalt & Rubber may collect and, on any page, display the total counts that page has been viewed. This includes User Profile pages. Many companies offer programs that help you to visit websites anonymously. While Asphalt & Rubber will not be able to provide you with a personalized experience if we cannot recognize you, we want you to be aware that these programs are available.

**E-mail Communications**  
Asphalt & Rubber is very concerned about your privacy and we will never provide your email address to a third party without your explicit permission, as detailed in the “Sharing Your Information” section below. Asphalt & Rubber may send out e-mails with Asphalt & Rubber-related news, products, offers, surveys or promotions. You may also receive notification e-mails from Asphalt & Rubber, which inform you of actions (e.g. comments or recent news posts) that have been performed on the site. 

**Cookies**  
Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our website are visited and by how many people. Asphalt & Rubber cookies do not collect personal information, and we do not combine information collected through cookies with other personal information to tell us who you are or what your screen name or e-mail address is.

The “help” portion of the toolbar on the majority of browsers will direct you on how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to command the browser to tell you when you receive a new cookie, or how to fully disable cookies. We recommend that you leave the cookies activated because cookies allow you to use the majority of Asphalt & Rubber’s features hassle free.

Some of our business partners, like our advertisers, may use cookies on our website. We have no access to, or control over, these cookies.

**Sharing Your Information**  
Because Asphalt & Rubber enables people to discover and share information with one another, information about the people who use Asphalt & Rubber is an integral part of the Asphalt & Rubber experience. Rest assured that we neither rent nor sell your personal information to anyone and that we will share your personal information only as described below.

Moreover, if Asphalt & Rubber, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred.
