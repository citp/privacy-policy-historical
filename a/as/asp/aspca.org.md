# Privacy Policy | ASPCA

The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (“ASPCA,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it through our compliance with this privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”). 

The Privacy Policy is designed to provide you with information about how we collect, store and use non-personally identifiable and personally identifiable information obtained through all ASPCA websites, including but not limited to [www.aspca.org](http://www.aspca.org/) and [www.aspcapro.org](http://www.aspcapro.org/) (each, an “ASPCA Website”).  By visiting an ASPCA Website, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy. The ASPCA reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time by posting such change here.  Your continued use of an ASPCA Website after such change is made constitutes acceptance of and agreement to be bound by the terms of the Privacy Policy as modified.

 **What information does the ASPCA collect and for what purpose? **

The categories of information the ASPCA collects can include:

●      **Information you provide to the ASPCA directly:** The ASPCA collects and maintains certain personal information about you when you send us an e-mail or complete any of our online forms, such as when you request information from us, make a donation, subscribe to one of our online newsletters, request to become a member, sign up for mobile texts, or forward a web page, electronic postcard, or electronic newsletter.  Such information may include your name, mailing address, and e-mail address; it may also include a mobile phone number, the e-mail addresses of those to whom you forward ASPCA electronic content, and any other information collected in the forms. You may be asked to provide credit card information to contribute to the ASPCA, purchase certain information or materials from the ASPCA, or subscribe to various ASPCA publications.

●      **Information the ASPCA collects from third parties:** The ASPCA may collect information about you from third party services. For example, the ASPCA may receive information about you when you interact with our site through various social media, for example, by logging in through or liking us on Facebook or following us on Twitter.  The data the ASPCA receives is dependent upon your privacy settings with the social network.  You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to an ASPCA Website. 

 **How is the information used**?

The ASPCA respects your privacy and has instituted policies intended to ensure that your information is handled in a safe and responsible manner.

The ASPCA uses this information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features of each ASPCA Website.  The ASPCA may use this information to communicate with you, such as to send you email messages, and to follow up with you to offer information about the ASPCA Websites. We may also send you ASPCA Website-related emails or messages (e.g. changes or updates to features of the ASPCA Websites, technical and security notices).  For more information about your communication preferences, see “ _Do I have control over how my information is used”_ below.

The ASPCA may disclose your information when: (i) the person submitting the information authorizes us to do so; (ii) sharing the information is a necessary operation of an ASPCA Website (e.g. to process credit card information); or (iii) we are required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on the ASPCA or an ASPCA Website, (b) protect and defend the rights or property of the ASPCA, an ASPCA Website or the visitors to an ASPCA Website, and/or (c) prevent or mitigate harm or potential harm or damage of any type to visitors to an ASPCA Website or the public.

Occasionally, the ASPCA may make your information, excluding financial information, available to ASPCA’s affiliate organizations or to sponsors or licensees that provide special programs or services we think you might find interesting or beneficial. If your volunteered personal information will be used in any manner other than as stated above, such use shall be specifically posted. Although we may make reasonable inquiries to determine that these select organizations maintain privacy policies similar to the ASPCA’s, we are not responsible for the enforcement of such policies. If you wish to update or remove your information, or if you do not wish your information to be shared with these third parties, please e-mail us at [website@aspca.org](mailto:website@aspca.org) .

 **How does the ASPCA use Cookie and other tracking technology to collect information?**

The ASPCA and our third party partners may automatically collect certain types of usage information when you visit or use an ASPCA Website.  For instance, when you visit an ASPCA Website, the ASPCA may send one or more cookies — a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters — to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and lets us help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the site.  A cookie may also convey information to us about how you use an ASPCA Website (e.g., the pages you view, the links you click, how frequently you access the ASPCA Website, and other actions you take on the ASPCA Website), and allow us to track your usage of ASPCA Websites over time.  The ASPCA may collect log file information about your browser or mobile device each time you access an ASPCA Website.  Log file information may include anonymous information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, information about your mobile device, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the ASPCA Website, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information. We may employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons) which are used to anonymously track the online usage patterns of our users.  In addition, the ASPCA may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients.  The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the ASPCA Websites. We may also collect analytics data, or use third-party analytics tools, to help us measure traffic and usage trends for each ASPCA Website.  These tools collect information sent by your browser or mobile device, including the pages you visit, your use of third party applications, and other information that assists us in analyzing and improving the ASPCA Websites.  Although the ASPCA does our best to honor the privacy preferences of our users, we are not able to respond to Do Not Track signals from your browser at this time, as we believe that there is no consistent industry standard for how to respond to Do Not Track browser settings.

When you access an ASPCA Website by or through a mobile device, the ASPCA may receive or collect and store a unique identification numbers associated with your device or our mobile application (including, for example, a unique device ID, Unique ID for Advertisers, Google Ad ID, or Windows Advertising ID), MAC address, mobile carrier, device type, model and manufacturer, mobile device operating system brand and model, phone number, and, depending on your mobile device settings, your geographical location data, including GPS coordinates (e.g., latitude and longitude) or similar information regarding the location of your mobile device.

The ASPCA may use the data collected through cookies, log file, device identifiers, location data and clear gifs information to:  (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the site; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information, including advertising; (c) provide and monitor the effectiveness of the ASPCA Websites; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, usage, and demographic patterns on the ASPCA Websites; (e) diagnose or fix technology problems; and (f) otherwise to plan for and enhance our service.

 ** _Third Party Tracking and Online Advertising:_** The ASPCA may permit third party ad networks, social media companies, and other third party services to collect information about browsing behavior from visitors to the ASPCA Websites through cookies, social plug-ins, or other tracking technology.  The ASPCA may permit third party online advertising networks to collect information about your use of the ASPCA Websites over time so that they may play or display ads that may be relevant to your interests on the ASPCA Websites as well as on other websites or services.  Typically, the information is collected through cookies or similar tracking technologies.  The only way to completely “opt out” of the collection of any information through cookies or other tracking technology is to actively manage the settings on your browser or mobile device.  Please refer to your browser’s or mobile device’s technical information for instructions on how to delete and disable cookies, and other tracking/recording tools.  (To learn more about cookies, clear gifs/web beacons and related technologies and how you may opt-out of some of this tracking, you may wish to visit [http://www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/) and/or the Network Advertising Initiative’s online resources, at [http://www.networkadvertising.org](http://www.networkadvertising.org/)).  Depending on your mobile device, you may not be able to control tracking technologies through settings.  If you have any questions about opting out of the collection of cookies and other tracking/recording tools, you can contact us directly at [website@aspca.org](mailto:website@aspca.org).

 **How secure are the ASPCA Websites?**

The ASPCA Websites have industry standard high encryption security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. The ASPCA makes every effort to protect your online order information by using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology. SSL encrypts your order information to avoid the decoding of that information by anyone other than the ASPCA. We do not store your credit card information.

 **Does the ASPCA collect information from children?**

No one under the age of 18 is allowed to register on an ASPCA Website.  The ASPCA is committed to safeguarding our users' online privacy and recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of personal information, particularly that of children.  The ASPCA takes all required steps to protect the privacy and safety of children in accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA").

 **Do I have control over how my information is used?**

You may opt-out of receiving communications from us by sending an email to us at [website@aspca.org](mailto:website@aspca.org) with your complete name, address and email address. The ASPCA assumes no responsibility for the data collection and use practices of third parties that process online credit card transactions.  You may request a record of your information by calling the Development Department at (212) 876-7700 during normal business hours, Monday-Friday, 9:00am-5:00pm or by e-mail at [development@aspca.org](mailto:development@aspca.org).
