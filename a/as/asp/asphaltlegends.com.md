## 4 – How we retain your information

Gameloft retains, uses and stores your information as long as you are playing our games or using our Services, and also for the period necessary to fulfill all the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, in compliance with the applicable laws of your country of residence. We want to inform you that a longer retention period could be required to resolve disputes, or answer regulatory or police requests. In such cases, the collected information will be used and stored until the request is closed.

  


## 5 – How we share your information

_With Gameloft entities_

In order to operate the Services, your personal information may be transferred to other Gameloft studios or entities, subsidiaries, processors or third parties located worldwide as described below (please refer to "International operations and transfers of your information").

_With third parties_

We use third-party services that have limited access to your information for specific purposes, such as administration, analytics, optimization, advertising, prize delivery, marketing assistance, customer service, and data analysis. They assist us with our operations.   
Such third parties are authorized to use your information for these purposes only.

If you decide, while using our Services, to use social sharing features such as “Share” or “Like” on Facebook or other third-party social network sites, this may allow the sharing and collection of personal and non-personal information both to and from such third-party social networks.  
You should visit the policies of such third parties for more information about their information-collection practices.

Since Gameloft is part of the Vivendi Group, your information may be transferred to Vivendi entities for global projects. In that case, you will be informed of the nature of the relevant projects and the entities involved, and you will be asked for your prior consent before any transfer of your information takes place.

_With authorities_

We reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies activities that we, in good faith, believe to be illegal. We will investigate or take action to counter illegal activity, suspected abuse or unauthorized use of the Services, or to protect the property or safety of others. We also may disclose your information if required by any law or court order worldwide, if the information relates to actual or threatened harmful conduct.  
In that case, we will consider applicable local laws, the nature of the order, as well as the legitimacy and proportionality of your information.

_In case of sale of our company_

In connection with any sale of our company or any line of business (including the assets relating thereto), customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets. In the event of any such sale or disposition of any or all of our business, your information may be transferred to the acquirer.

  


## 6 – International operations and transfers of your information

As part of our international operations, we may transfer personal information to our affiliates (which means subsidiaries, parent companies, joint ventures, and other corporate entities under common ownership of Gameloft SE) from time to time for our legitimate business purposes.

Gameloft is headquartered in France, and we have operations, entities and Services provided in Canada, the United States and throughout the world. We have taken measures to ensure that your personal information is treated securely and lawfully, and that it receives an adequate level of protection in the jurisdictions in which we process it. If you are located in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or Switzerland, we provide adequate protection for the transfer of personal information to countries outside of the EEA or Switzerland based on the standard contractual clauses authorized by the European Commission or other appropriate safeguards defined in Article 46, EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016/67 (GDPR).

  


## 7 – Security and confidentiality of your personal information

We have implemented security measures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use the personal information collected through the Services.   
We take, and force applicable third parties to take, reasonable precautions to protect your personal information against loss, misuse, unauthorized disclosure, alteration, and destruction. However, please remember that no transmission of data over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your information, we cannot guarantee the security of your information and do not assume any responsibility for the unauthorized use of, or access to, your information that is under our control.   
When we use third parties to assist us in processing your personal information or credit card information, we take reasonable steps to require that they comply with this Privacy Policy and otherwise protect your personal information (including any credit card information).

If there is a breach of security involving your personal information, including credit card information, from our Services, we will inform you immediately according to your local regulations relating to the notification of information Breaches, and take commercially reasonable steps to rectify such breach.

If you believe your personal information is being improperly used by us or any third party, please immediately notify us via email at [DataProtectionSupport@gameloft.com](mailto:DataProtectionSupport@gameloft.com).

  


## 8 – Children

We encourage parents to instruct their children about privacy and the way they use their information on the Internet. Children should never disclose their name, address or phone number, or any personal information, without their parents’ prior permission.

We consider a user to be a child if they are under the age of 13, unless more stringent regulation applies in their country of residence. In EU countries, users under the age of 16 are considered children, unless the data protection regulation of their country of residence specifies another age.

If we consider that any of our Services are directed at users under the minimum legal age required in their country of residence, we can block such users from using the Services or from providing information and/or limit the collection of information from such users as more particularly described below.

No personal information should be submitted to Gameloft by users under the minimum legal age required in their country of residence.

We apply the following limitations to personal information collection for a user that is not of the minimum legal age required in their country of residence.

Such a user cannot:

  * display his/her real name or any information in the games
  * access the chat, leaderboard, forums, SNS (Facebook, Game Center, etc.)
  * subscribe to newsletters
  * use any other feature where users could appear under their real names



With respect to such a user, we will prevent the collection and use of his/her precise geolocation data and display to him/her contextual advertising only (excluding any behavioral advertising).

Children can be invited to take part in testing our games (playtests) with their parents' authorization and/or their parents' physical presence being required depending on the country where the playtest is conducted.

Parents must exercise their privacy rights for their children. Please refer to the "Your rights" section of this Privacy Policy.

  


## 9 – Job applicants

If you apply to a job, you can be directed to the SmartRecruiters website. If you decide to submit your application, you will also have to submit some information to SmartRecruiters, including your name, telephone number, email address and education history.
