**2.3 Information Collected by Cookies.** We use "cookies" to store specific information about you and track your visits to our Site. It is not uncommon for websites to use cookies to enhance identification of their users. A "cookie" is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser and stored on your computer's hard drive. A cookie can be sent to your computer's hard drive only if you access our Site using the computer. If you do not de-activate or erase the cookie, each time you use the same computer to access our Site, our web servers will be notified of your visit to our Site and in turn we may have knowledge of your visit and the pattern of your usage. We use automatically collected information and other information collected on the Service through cookies and similar technologies to: (i) personalize our Service, such as remembering a User’s or Visitor’s information so that the User or Visitor will not have to re-enter it during a visit or on subsequent visits; (ii) provide customized advertisements, content, and information; (iii) monitor and analyze the effectiveness of Service and third-party marketing activities; (iv) monitor aggregate site usage metrics such as total number of visitors and pages viewed; and (v) track your entries, submissions, and status in any promotions or other activities on the Service. You can learn more about cookies by visiting [ http://www.allaboutcookies.org ](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/) . 

You can determine if and how a cookie will be accepted by configuring your browser, which is installed in the computer you are using to access the Site. If you desire, you can change those configurations in your browser to accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is sent, or to reject all cookies. If you reject all cookies you may be required to re-enter your information on our Site more often and certain features of our Site may be unavailable. 

Examples of Cookies we may use: 

  * **Session Cookies.** We may use Session Cookies to operate our Service. 
  * **Preference Cookies.** We may use Preference Cookies to remember your preferences and various settings. 
  * **Security Cookies.** We may use Security Cookies for security purposes. 



Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers or tracking utility companies) may use cookies on our sites. We do not have access or control over these cookies. For example, our website utilizes Google Analytics, a common website analytics tool that transmits website traffic data to Google servers in the United States. Google Analytics does not identify individual users or associate your IP address with any other data held by Google. We use reports provided by Google Analytics to help us understand our website traffic and webpage usage. For more information about Google Analytics, please refer to the website, “How Google uses data when you use our partners’ sites or apps” at http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/. If you would like to opt out of Google Analytics across all websites, you may do so using the “Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on” found at https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en. 

We may also use tracking pixels (also known as clear gifs or web beacons), which are invisible 1x1 pixel images that are requested from a remote server via a url that typically contains small strings of encoded information, which may in part be determined by cookies. When a tracking pixel is requested from a server, that server may decode and process this information, for example, storing it to serve log files for future analysis. For example, our Site may use pixels to helps us track conversions from ads, optimize ads based on collected data, build targeted audiences for future ads, and remarket to qualified leads. Please use the following link if you would like help opting out of any remarketing pixels and related technologies: http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices.

**2.5 Online Tracking / Do Not Track.** We do not track you across third party websites to provide targeted advertising and therefore we do not respond to Do Not Track (“ **DNT** ”) signals. However, some third party sites do keep track of your browsing activities when they serve you content, which enables them to tailor what they present to you. If you are visiting such sites, your internet browser may allow you to set the DNT signal on your browser so that third parties (particularly advertisers) know you do not want to be tracked.
