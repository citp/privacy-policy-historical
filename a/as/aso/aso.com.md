# ASO Privacy Policy: ASO.com

At ASO, we believe that a person's privacy is very important. We are very respectful of your privacy and are providing this information to demonstrate how seriously we take protection of your personal information. This Privacy Policy governs how ASO collects, protects, stores, transfers, and uses the personally identifiable information (“PII”) that we collect. 

At ASO, we try to give you as much control as possible over your personal information. In general, you can visit ASO without giving us personal information or registering for an account. There are times, however, when ASO may gather information from you in order to communicate more effectively with you, or otherwise better facilitate the purpose of your visit to ASO. There are generally three cases in which this is necessary.

First, we require some PII from you when you choose to send an "I'm Interested" message to an advertiser via ASO’s BuyerResponseSM system. In this case, you'll need to supply your name, your phone number, and your email address. Without this basic contact information, our sellers have difficulty believing that you are a genuinely interested buyer. Your information is provided only to the seller to whom you are sending a message. We do keep this information, so that we can re-transmit it in the event of a communication problem.

Second, we require some PII from you to complete any commerce transaction, such as purchasing an aircraft for sale ad or an aircraft information report. In this case, your information is used for the purpose of facilitating the transaction (see the Commerce section below).

Third, users that elect to register for a [MyASO](https://web.archive.org/MyASO/LearnMore.aspx) account must share certain PII in order to establish their account. The overall purpose of a MyASO account is to enable users to have an experience on our website that is more tailored to their specific needs. In general, any PII gathered in registering for an account is used for that purpose. For example, your email address might be used to send you aircraft alerts (lists of new aircraft for sale that meet your pre-defined criteria) if you choose to use this particular feature.

It is against ASO's basic beliefs to ask for unnecessary items, like your street address when we are delivering information by an electronic means. Unless we are mailing something to you, we don't need to know where you live.

In all three cases described above, we will occasionally use your PII to contact you with news about ASO, such as a new product or service that we believe adds value to your relationship with ASO. However, if you tell us that you do not wish to receive these announcements, we will respect your wishes and remove you from our contact database. When you elect to register for a [MyASO](https://web.archive.org/MyASO/LearnMore.aspx) account, you have the choice to opt-in or opt-out of email notifications and marketing distributions from ASO. Currently, we do not share, sell, rent, or otherwise provide our lists of contact information to any 3rd party organizations. However, if we make the decision to do so in the future, we will not include your personal information in any list that we share with a 3rd party unless you have given us explicit consent to do so.

When you purchase aircraft for sale Ads, aircraft cost reports, or other online services from our site, you have the option to make your payment via an online credit card transaction. Each such transaction is secured by SSL encryption and verified with VeriSign® digital certificates. 

ASO intends to protect your PII and implements appropriate measures and processes to help keep your information secure and maintain its integrity. ASO uses technical, physical, and other safeguards for such protection against loss, unauthorized access, destruction and disclosure. 

ASO sometimes collects non-identifiable information about the web pages that you visit. ASO may use cookies, web beacons, and/or similar technologies to enable us to collect certain information when you visit the ASO web pages, including for example: internet protocol address, browser type, operating system, referring site, date and time of visit, URL of pages visited, and downloads from our site.

ASO does use a technology called cookies. A “cookie” is a piece of data that a web site sends to your browser, which may then be stored on your computer as an anonymous tag that identifies your computer but not you. ASO's cookies are harmless and designed simply to improve your interaction with our website. We generally utilize four types of cookies - each serving a slightly different purpose.

The first type of cookie enables the "Remember my Password" feature with [MyASO](https://web.archive.org/MyASO/LearnMore.aspx) accounts, allowing you to automatically login to the service - saving time and effort. We only use this cookie if you specifically request it.

We also use a cookie so that we can greet returning [MyASO](https://web.archive.org/MyASO/LearnMore.aspx) account users. MyASO users may notice that they are often greeted with a message such as, “Welcome Jim” even prior to logging in to their account. However, please note that we will never allow a user to perform any function that requires you to be logged into your MyASO account solely based on this recognition cookie. In order to create an Ad, view or make changes to your existing Ads, view leads or other Ad statistics, manage or view tagged aircraft Ads, run or manage aircraft alerts, or make changes to your account profile, you will always be asked to provide your MyASO user ID and password.

ASO also uses a session cookie to maintain the context of your visit within ASO's website. For example, we use this cookie on our aircraft for sale pages to keep track of the type, make and model of aircraft, as you navigate through those pages. Think of it as a bookmark - its purpose is to prevent you from getting lost in the site. This type of cookie is removed from your browser at the end of each of your visits to ASO. 

Finally, we occasionally use cookies to track general traffic coming through ASO. From this aggregate data, we can learn more about how people use the website. This data helps us improve our site design to maximize the user experience.

We may occasionally link this information to PII in order to provide better service to you and to tailor product and service offerings to you. Most browsers allow you to remove and block cookies and web beacons. The decision to do so is entirely yours. However, please be aware that if you choose to block cookies and web beacons, you may need to re-enter passwords and user IDs when required, and you may also not be able to take advantage of information and a user experience that is tailored to your specific needs. 

The PII provided to ASO is used by ASO to develop and conduct our business. Some examples of how we use PII include: improving our products and services; personalizing communications with you; conducting market research; conducting customer surveys; processing, fulfilling, and following up on transactions for products and support; tracking and improving the effectiveness of our website and web-based marketing; and complying with legal requirements and enforcing our website terms of use or otherwise protecting ASO’s legal rights.

ASO may share your PII with our subsidiaries, service providers, and suppliers who are acting on ASO’s behalf (and only when they are doing so). We may also share your PII with third parties for purposes that you have specifically approved. Lastly, ASO may share or disclose your PII in the event that ASO has a good-faith belief that disclosure is necessary to respond to a judicial action, government inquiry, or is otherwise ordered by law.

ASO's site contains links to other company's web sites. For obvious reasons, ASO cannot be responsible for the content or the privacy practices of such web sites. 

ASO’s web site and marketing are not directed to children under 13 years of age. If that policy changes, we will obtain consent from a child’s legal guardian before we collect PII from anyone under the age of 13. 

Due to privacy policy requirements set by various regulating agencies, Aircraft Shopper Online reserves the right to change any of the privacy policies governing the Site, at any time and in its sole discretion. Although this Privacy Policy may change from time to time, we will not reduce your rights under this policy without your explicit consent. Any changes will be effective upon posting of the revisions to the Site, and may be posted without notice to you. The effective date of this Privacy Policy will appear at the top of this page for your reference.

ASO wants to maintain the accuracy of your information. If you need to update your information or correct it, you may do so by either logging into your [MyASO](https://web.archive.org/MyASO/LearnMore.aspx) account or sending an email to [service@aso.com](mailto:service@aso.com). We will make reasonable efforts to incorporate the changes as soon as possible. Further, we may contact you to confirm your request or to obtain additional details from you to process your request. 

If you have any questions or comments about our privacy practices, please feel free to contact us at [service@aso.com](mailto:service@aso.com).
