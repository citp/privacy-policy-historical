	(Effective January 1, 2003)<br><br>
	asaptickets.com Inc. is committed to protecting your privacy while you are visiting our Site.<br><br>
	In order to provide the best in customer service, we may ask you to
	share "personal information" -- such as your name, address, e-mail
	address, and phone number. First, we want you to understand our policy
	regarding the collection and use of your personal information.<br><br>
	
	<b>The Personal Information Collected</b><br><br>
	You may visit our Site or call our Travel Professionals to search for
	great travel deals without providing us with any personal information.<br><br>
	
	<b>Membership Information</b><br><br>
	
	Membership offers you the flexibility and freedom to complete a travel
	purchase on our Site at any time, and becoming a member is so easy to
	do. When you register to become a member, you will be asked to share
	with us certain basic personal information, such as your name, e-mail
	address, and password. Should you choose to do so, you can supplement
	the basics with your credit card number, frequent flyer number, travel
	preferences, and more. After becoming a member, you can visit or update
	the personal information in your travel profile at any time. By
	completing and updating your personal information, you help us tailor
	our services to better meet your needs.<br><br>
	
	<b>Transaction Information</b><br><br>
	In order to complete a travel purchase, you will be asked to share with
	us information required to complete the transaction successfully, such
	as billing and shipping addresses, credit card number and expiration
	date, etc.<br><br>
	
	<b>Subscription Information</b><br><br>
	Even if you`re not a member, you have the opportunity to receive our
	special travel offers via e-mail. When you sign up for this service,
	you will be asked to provide us with your e-mail address.<br><br>
	
	<b>Contests/Sweepstakes Participation</b><br><br>
	You may participate in our contests or sweepstakes without becoming a
	member, completing a purchase, or subscribing to receive our e-mails.
	When you enter a contest or sweepstakes, you will be asked to share
	with us certain personal information.<br><br>
	
	<b>How Personal Information Is Used</b><br>
	<b>We will use your personal information in the following ways:</b><br><br>
	When you purchase travel products or services, your personal
	information will be shared with the third parties necessary to
	successfully complete the transaction -- including the vendors you have
	selected (for example, airlines, hotels, travel insurance providers,
	etc.) and others who facilitate the transaction (for example, your
	credit card company).<br>
	As a member or guest, from time to time, you may receive communications
	from us or third parties performing services on our behalf, which
	include: (i) specific information we want to communicate to you
	regarding your travel requests or arrangements, such as any
	notification of a flight cancellation; (ii) notifications regarding
	updates or modifications to our Site; and (iii) details regarding any
	special offers sponsored by us, such as rewards, rebates, sweepstakes,
	and gift promotions.<br>
	As a member or subscriber, you may also choose to receive from us, or
	trustworthy third parties acting on our behalf, special promotions that
	we believe will be valuable to you, including, without limitation,
	e-mails promoting special travel deals, sponsored by us or third-party
	vendors. If you participate in a contest or sweepstakes, your personal
	information may be used by us, or trustworthy third parties acting on
	our behalf, to process your entry and fulfill any prize awarded to you.<br>
	From time to time, in an effort to improve our service, we may ask
	third parties to conduct marketing-research analyses on our behalf and,
	as such, the information we provide to them is restricted to
	marketing-research analyses only. Any personal information we provide
	to such third parties is protected under confidentiality agreements.<br>
	
	We may disclose your personal information (i) if you violate our Terms
	of Use or any law, rule, or regulation, or (ii) if required by law or
	regulatory authority (for example, court order or subpoena).<br>
	In the event that our Company or this Site or certain of our assets are
	acquired, your personal information may be one of the transferred
	assets. Use of your personal information by third parties distributing
	promotions on our behalf shall be subject to our Privacy Policy.<br><br>
	
	<b>What We Won`t Do With Personal Information</b><br><br>
	We will not sell or rent your personal information to any third parties.<br><br>
	
	<b>Security</b>
	Security of our customers` personal information is important to us.<br><br>
	As a member, your personal information is password-protected. If you
	ever forget your password, we will help you create a new one. Remember
	to log out of your account and close your browser window when you have
	finished visiting our Site in order to ensure that others cannot access
	your personal information.<br><br>
	To protect personal information transmitted to us, we use a security
	system that includes firewall technologies, intrusion detection
	systems, logical network segmentation, restricted access to stored
	profile information, and security restrictions to our databases and
	systems.<br><br>
	
	<b>We permit authorized personnel only to access personal information.</b><br><br>
	We use industry-standard, secure-socket-layer (SSL) technology, which
	is utilized by most popular browsers, including Netscape and Microsoft
	Explorer, to encrypt (or convert into code) your personal information
	before it is transferred across the Internet. To further safeguard your
	most sensitive credit card information, we transfer such information
	across the Internet in an encrypted format and then store such
	information in our secure database.<br><br>
	Since we do not control transmissions over the Internet, via commercial
	Internet service providers, and/or the security of your personal
	computer, we cannot guarantee 100 percent secure transmission via the
	Internet. Use of the Internet is at your own risk. Also, it is
	important that you take steps to protect yourself against unauthorized
	access to your computer and your password.<br><br>

	<b>Other, Non-Personal Information Collected</b><br><br>
	Like many other Internet sites, we automatically collect non-personal
	information regarding our visitors, such as software client information
	(for example, IP addresses, browser versions and operating systems) and
	aggregate information (for example, number of pages accessed) in order
	to analyze Web traffic and usage trends. Information of this nature
	does not pertain to your specific identity and is not associated with
	your personal information.<br><br>
	To enhance your experience on our Site, we and our third-party
	advertiser(s) commonly employ Internet technologies, such as "cookies,"
	to collect and store non-personal information about our visitors.
	"Cookies" are small pieces of information that are transferred by a
	website and stored by your Web browser on your computer`s hard drive.
	With most browsers, you can set the preferences to show a warning each
	time a cookie request is received. You can also set the browser not to
	accept cookies at all; however, we won`t be able to personalize your
	experience if we cannot recognize you.<br><br>
	Cookies and Web beacons (also called "pixel tags") may be used by us or
	our third-party advertiser(s) to determine how you reached our Site, to
	track your usage patterns once you are on our Site, and to target our
	Internet banner advertisements on our Site and other websites. For more
	information about our third-party advertiser(s), cookies, and how to
	opt out, please click here.<br><br>
	
	<b>What Is Not Covered By This Privacy Policy</b><br><br>
	Except as covered above, this Privacy Policy does not apply to the
	practices or policies of any companies or entities that we do not own
	or control, including links to sites that are not maintained by us, or
	to people that we do not employ or manage. Because these companies or
	entities may have privacy policies that differ from this Privacy Policy
	(or no privacy policy at all), please be sure to review their
	respective privacy policies before providing them with any personal
	information.<br><br>
	
	<b>Questions, Comments or Concerns</b><br><br>

	<b>Privacy Policy Updates</b><br><br>
	We may, in our sole discretion, revise this Privacy Policy at any time;
	all such revisions shall be effective when posted. If we change the way
	your personal information will be used, we will post an announcement on
	our homepage. We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy
	Policy in order to keep apprised of our current privacy practices.
