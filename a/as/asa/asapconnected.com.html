                                            <li>How We May Use Your Information. We may use the information we collect from and about you through the Site for any of the following purposes: (i) to operate the Site and to provide products and services to you, (ii) to respond to your requests and inquiries, (iii) to contact you and to communicate with you in order to respond to your requests for additional information, (iv) to send you newsletters, alerts, and updates, (v) to notify you about important changes to the Site or our business, (vi) to review Site usage and operations and to improve the content and functionality of the Site, (vii) to protect the security or integrity of the Site or our business, (viii) to enforce our Terms of Use, or (ix) to tailor the Site to your needs and the needs of other visitors.</li>
                                            <li>How We May Share Your Information. ASA does not sell, lease or rent the personal information you share with us on or through the Site with third parties. ASA may disclose your personal information to third parties only (i) as required by law or regulation or as we believe in good faith that disclosure of such personal information is reasonably necessary to: (1) satisfy any applicable law or regulation, (2) to respond to claims and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order or legal process served on us, (3) to protect and defend our rights or property and/or the rights or property of third parties, as permitted by law, (4) to detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; or (5) to enforce our Terms of Use; and/or (ii) with our service providers that provide certain services to maintain and operate the Site or to help us deliver services to you.</li>

                                        As with any business, it is possible that in the future we could merge with or be acquired by another company. If this occurs, the successor company would have access to the Information, but would continue to be bound by this Privacy Policy unless and until it is amended.

                                        At this time we will not send you notifications, alerts or other communications via text message.

                                        ASA uses an analytics partner (“Analytics Partner”) to collect Anonymous Information about how our Site is used. Our Analytics Partner may use cookies, web beacons or other automated technologies to collect information about how many times you visit our Site, what parts of our Site you access, and what other websites you visit before and after visiting our Site. To help you understand these technologies better:
                                        <ul style="list-style: circle;">
                                            <li>“Cookies” are electronic files many websites place on a visitor’s computer to store information that makes each visit to a respective website more efficient. To remove cookies, you may configure your browser to clear all cookies, or configure it to reject cookies whenever you visit a new website.   Please consult your browser’s user guide for specific instructions on removing cookies.</li>
                                            <li>“Beacons” are small graphic files with a unique identifier that are used to track a web or mobile site user’s online movements. Unlike cookies, beacons are embedded on websites, not downloaded on your computer or device.</li>
                                            <li>Our Analytics Partner may use these or other techniques to collect Anonymous Information about your visit to our Site. In order to make sure you understand how our Analytics Partner handles your information and how it interacts with our Site, we’ve shared hyperlinks below to its Terms of Use. You should visit this page as ASA has no ability to control or monitor our Analytics Partner’s data collection or data use practices.</li>
                                            <li>Google Analytics— ASA partners with Google Analytics to provide insight into our Site. Google Analytics’ terms are available here: http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html.</li>
                                        </ul>

                                        <h3>HOW DOES ASA PROTECT MY INFORMATION?</h3>
                                        ASA uses reasonable administrative, physical and technical safeguards designed to secure the personal information you share with us. Regardless of the precautions taken by us or by you, no data transmitted over the Internet or any other public network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. We cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you provide all personal information to us at your own risk.

                                        <h3>DOES ASA COLLECT PAYMENT CARD INFORMATION?</h3>
                                        ASA does not collect credit and debit card information directly through the Site and kindly asks you not to share this information with us when communicating with us by e-mail or submitting requests for additional information. ASA does use a third-party credit card processor (“Payment Processor”) to process online transactions through our online store. Please note that your credit and debit card information (number, expiration date, security code) is provided directly to the Payment Processor and is stored by the Payment Processor and not by us, and as such, it is important to review the Payment Processor’s privacy policy and terms of service to understand their information security practices. The Payment Processor may share with us some of the information you submit in connection with purchases so that we can complete your order, including your name, shipping information, e-mail, phone number, and information about the products you purchase and your online order. Please be advised that we may send you e-mail alerts regarding the status of your purchases and/or to ask for your feedback.

Please understand that if you choose to unsubscribe from promotional correspondence from us, we may still contact you in connection with your relationship, activities, transactions and/or communications with us.

                                        We do not intentionally gather information from individuals who are under the age of 13. Upon notification that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will delete the child’s personal information from our records.

If you are a California resident, you may contact us by writing to: Administrative Software Applications, 1310 Hollenbeck Ave. Suite C, Sunnyvale, CA 94087.

                                        The Site may contain links to other websites. The fact that we link to a website is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party. We do not exercise control over third party websites. These other websites (including our Payment Processor) may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data, or solicit personal information from you. Other sites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites. Please be aware that the terms of our Privacy Policy do not apply to these third party websites.
