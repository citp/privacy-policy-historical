		<p><font face="Arial">Last Updated: <span lang="en-us">August 4, 2011</span></font></p>
		<p><b><span lang="en-us"><font face="Arial">We use the latest 
		technologies to ensure that your email address and all personal 
		information is safe.</font></span></b><font face="Arial"><br>
		<br>
		AsAManThinketh.net LLC, and/or it's subsidiaries, as owner(s) of this 
		website, strives to offer its visitors the many advantages of Internet 
		technology and to provide an interactive and personalized experience. We 
		may use Personally Identifiable Information (your name, eMail address, 
		street address, telephone number) subject to the terms of this privacy 
		policy. <br>
		<br>
		<b>How we gather information from users</b><br>
		<br>
		How we collect and store information depends on the page you are 
		visiting, the activities in which you elect to participate and the 
		services provided. For example, you may be asked to provide information 
		when you register for access to certain portions of our site or request 
		certain features, such as newsletters or when you make a purchase. You 
		may provide information when you participate in sweepstakes and 
		contests, message boards and chat rooms, and other interactive areas of 
		our site.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">Like most Web sites, AsAManThinketh.net LLC, 
		and/or it's subsidiaries, as owner(s) of this website, also collects 
		information automatically and through the use of electronic tools that 
		may be transparent to our visitors. For example, we may log the name of 
		your Internet Service Provider or use cookie technology to recognize you 
		and hold information from your visit. Among other things, the cookie may 
		store your user name and password, sparing you from having to re-enter 
		that information each time you visit, or may control the number of times 
		you encounter a particular advertisement while visiting our site.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">As we adopt additional technology, we may also 
		gather information through other means. In certain cases, you can choose 
		not to provide us with information, for example by setting your browser 
		to refuse to accept cookies, but if you do you may be unable to access 
		certain portions of the site or may be asked to re-enter your user name 
		and password, and we may not be able to customize the site’s features 
		according to your preferences.<br>
		<br>
		<b>What we do with the information we collect</b><br>
		<br>
		Like other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance your visit 
		and deliver more individualized content and advertising. <br>
		<br>
		Aggregated Information (information that does not personally identify 
		you) may be used in many ways. For example, we may combine information 
		about your usage patterns with similar information obtained from other 
		users to help enhance our site and services (e.g., to learn which pages 
		are visited most or what features are most attractive). Aggregated 
		Information may occasionally be shared with our advertisers and business 
		partners. Again, this information does not include any Personally 
		Identifiable Information about you or allow anyone to identify you 
		individually.<br>
		<br>
		We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on 
		AsAManThinketh.net LLC, and/or it's subsidiaries, as owner(s) of this 
		website, to communicate with you about your registration and 
		customization preferences; our Terms of Service and privacy policy; 
		services and products offered by AsAManThinketh.net LLC, and/or it's 
		subsidiaries, as owner(s) of this website, and other topics we think you 
		might find of interest.<br>
		<br>
		Personally Identifiable Information collected by AsAManThinketh.net LLC, 
		and/or it's subsidiaries, as owner(s) of this website, may also be used 
		for other purposes, including but not limited to site administration, 
		troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce transactions, administration 
		of sweepstakes and contests, and other communications with you. </font>
		</p>
		<p><font face="Arial">Certain third parties who provide support for the 
		operation of our site (our Web hosting service, our shopping cart 
		providers and fulfillment partners, for example) and for our business 
		(marketing services for example) may also access such 
		information. We will use your information only as permitted by law. In 
		addition, from time to time as we continue to develop our business, we 
		may sell, buy, merge or partner with other companies or businesses. In 
		such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets. 
		If you do not wish your information to be used by third parties for non 
		order related services (such as marketing), please contact us at the 
		email or U.S. mail addresses below.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial">We may also disclose your information in response 
		to a court order, at other times when we believe we are reasonably 
		required to do so by law, in connection with the collection of amounts 
		you may owe to us, and/or to law enforcement authorities whenever we 
		deem it appropriate or necessary. Please note we may not provide you 
		with notice prior to disclosure in such cases.<br>
		<br>
		<b>Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements</b><br>
		<br>
		AsAManThinketh.net LLC, and/or it's subsidiaries, as owner(s) of this

		<p><font face="Arial">While on our site, our advertisers, promotional 
		partners or other third parties may use cookies or other technology to 
		attempt to identify some of your preferences or retrieve information 
		about you. For example, some of our advertising is served by third

		whether you have seen a particular advertisement before. Other features 
		available on our site may offer services operated by third parties and 
		may use cookies or other technology to gather information.

		disclose Personally Identifiable Information on message boards or in 
		chat areas, that information can be viewed publicly and can be collected 
		and used by third parties without our knowledge and may result in 
		unsolicited messages from other individuals or third parties. Such 
		activities are beyond the control of AsAManThinketh.net LLC, and/or it's
