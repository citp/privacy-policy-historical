Please note that, to the extent required by applicable law, we will obtain your express consent for the collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Information (as defined below).

What types of information do we collect?

We collect the following types of information directly from you, from third parties or automatically through your use of our Services:

  1. personally identifiable information, which is information about an identifiable individual ("Personal Information"); and

  2. non-personally identifiable information, which is information that is unable to identify a specific individual (for example, anonymous information related to your use of the Services) ("Anonymous Data").




What information will you ask me for?

When you create a profile on our Platform you will be asked to provide basic information about you which we need to enable us to provide you the Services including contact information (e.g. your email address), demographic information (e.g. your city of residence, zip/postal code, age, gender and ethnicity), and personal characteristics (height, weight and body type). We may supplement this with information about your IP address, or your location, when you use the Services.

While creating your profile, you may choose how much Personal Information you share with us. You will be asked to create a username and offered the chance to upload a photograph and provide a personal description. You are encouraged to create a pseudonymous profile and are not required to include information in your profile that would allow you to be directly identified. Obviously do be careful if you want to remain anonymous, especially if you upload photographs or choose a username which could allow you to be easily identified.

When you make a purchase off our Platform you will be asked for certain Personal Information for billing purposes including your name, address and details of your chosen payment method.

With your permission, we will also collect your location information from your mobile device to help you identify other Platform members in your area. You may turn off this feature through the location settings on your mobile device. We also collect your general geographic location from your browser access to help you identify members in your area and to help us quickly and efficiently respond to inquiries and requests.

If you choose to activate 2-factor authentication for your account, we may ask for your phone number. This phone number will be shared with a third party service provider Nexmo. Nexmo service is not part of the Service, and is subject to separate terms and conditions, including different policies with respect to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information. We do not have control over Nexmo. You will need to make your own independent judgment regarding your interaction with them. Please note that if you decide to delete your Ashley Madison account, we will delete your phone number from our records but Nexmo may not. If you decide to activate 2-factor authentication through an Authenticator App of your choice, please note that use of such app is subject to separate Terms and Conditions and Privacy Practices which we do not control. Please review them and make independent judgement if you want to proceed with such app.

Cookies and Other Tracking

We use cookies, clear GIFs, third-party analytics and other tracking mechanisms to track your use of our Platform and the Services. Such tracking mechanisms may automatically collect information such as: your IP address, domain name, browser type and operating system; web pages you view; links you click; how you move through the Platform and the length of time you visit our Platform and use the Services; and the referring URL, or the webpage that led you to our Platform. We may combine this information with other Personal Information we collect from you.

Do-Not-Track. Currently, our systems do not recognize browser “do-not-track” requests. You may, however, disable certain tracking as discussed in this section (e.g., by disabling cookies or opting out of ad networks).

Cookies. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your web browser for record-keeping purposes. We might use cookies to uniquely identify you, in order to help us to process your transactions and requests, to track aggregate and statistical information about user activity, and to display advertising both on our Platform and on third-party sites. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. If you disable cookies some features of our Platform may not function. Further information may be found at www.allaboutcookies.org.

Clear GIFs. Clear GIFs (a.k.a. web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, though, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages, not stored on your hard drive. We might use clear GIFs to track the activities of our visitors and app users, help us manage content, and compile statistics about usage. We and our third party service providers also might use clear GIFs in HTML e-mails to our customers, to help us track e-mail response rates, identify when our e-mails are viewed, and track whether our e-mails are forwarded. These can be blocked either by using a third party application such as [Ghostery (https://www.ghostery.com)](https://www.ghostery.com/), or, in the case of emails, by changing your settings to prevent images from being downloaded (where your email client supports this functionality).

Third-Party Analytics.  We also use automated devices and applications, such as [Google Analytics (https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245)](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245) (to opt out, go [here (https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout)](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout) ), and AppsFlyer (to opt out, go [here (https://www.appsflyer.com/privacy-policy/)](https://www.appsflyer.com/privacy-policy/) to evaluate usage of our Platform and the Services we provide.  We use these tools to gather information about users to help us improve our services, performance and user experiences.  These analytics providers may use cookies and other technologies to perform their services, and may combine the information that they collect about you on our Platform with other information that they have collected.  This Privacy Policy does not cover such third parties’ use of the data: for further information please see the relevant party's privacy policy. For a list of additional Third Party analytics providers we may use, please go [here (http://www.rubylife.com/analytics_providers)](http://www.rubylife.com/analytics_providers).

Third-Party Ad Networks

We may use third parties such as network advertisers to serve advertisements on our Platform and on third-party websites or other media, and to evaluate the success of our advertising campaigns. This enables us and these third parties to target advertisements to you for products and services in which you might be interested. Third-party ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs and other tracking technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you. These third-party cookies and other technologies are governed by each third party’s specific privacy policy, not this one. We may provide these third-party advertisers with information about users (e.g., IP address and demographic information), but we do not disclose details such as your name or contact information. You may be able to avoid targeted ads by certain ad networks by blocking cookies (see your browser’s “Help” menu for information on how to do this); however, our Platform may not work if you block or disable cookies. For a list of networks advertisers we may use, please go [here (http://www.rubylife.com/network_partners)](http://www.rubylife.com/network_partners).

Third-Party Links

Our Platform and services may contain links to third-party websites. For example, when you leave our Platform, you may be directed to a third-party website, which may collect your IP address and other Personal Information. We do not supply any Personal Information to these third parties. Any access to and use of such linked websites, and any Personal Information collected in connection therewith, is not governed by this Privacy Policy, but instead is governed by the privacy policies of those third-party websites. We are not responsible for the information practices of such third-party websites.

How long do you keep the Personal Information you collect?

We keep your Personal Information for as long as we need your Personal Information for the purposes for which it was collected or as otherwise permitted by applicable law after which we delete or anonymize your Personal Information rendering it unable to identify you. 

Access and Updates

You have the opportunity to (i) opt-out of certain communications, (ii) modify/update Personal Information you have provided to us, and (iii) hide certain information visible to public users of the Platform at any time by going to the 'Manage Profile' or ‘Account Settings’ sections on your profile.

On reasonable notice, you may withdraw your consent to use your Personal Information at any time, subject to certain restrictions prescribed by applicable law.

Please be aware that it may take several hours for any custom changes you make to take effect on the public areas of the system. Please also note that changing or deleting your information through the 'Manage Profile' or ‘Account Settings' section of the system, or opting-out of email notifications from us, will only change or delete the data in our database for the purpose of future activities and communications.

Do you monitor online behavior?

Our users communicate with each other through on-site mail messaging and instant messaging. While we do not, as a rule, moderate or monitor users' private exchanges, we reserve the right to do so if we suspect users of being under the age of 18 or of using our service for the purpose of solicitation or any other violation of our Terms & Conditions or Privacy Policy. Submissions that appear on the public area of the Platform are moderated and, if necessary, we reserve the right to edit, delete, remove or not use any communication on a public area of the Platform.

Other Information Collectors

Except as otherwise expressly described in this Privacy Policy, this document only addresses the use and disclosure of the information we collect from you. To the extent that you disclose your information to other parties, whether they are on our Platform (including links to third party sites) or on other sites throughout the Internet, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the information you disclose to them. To the extent that we use third party advertisers or have third party e-commerce partners, they adhere to their own privacy policies. Since we do not control the privacy policies of any third parties, you should investigate their policies before you disclose your Personal Information to them.

Data Transfers outside Canada

Some of the recipients who we disclose your Personal Information to as contemplated in, and in accordance with, this Privacy Policy may be located in jurisdictions outside Canada. As a result, your Personal Information may be used, stored and/or accessed in countries outside of Canada, including without limitation the United States. However, all such Personal Information will be protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Please note that when your Personal Information is located outside of Canada it will be subject to the laws of the country in which it is situated and these jurisdictions may not have an equivalent level of data protection laws as those in your country.

Security

We take the protection of your Personal Information seriously. We protect Personal Information against loss and theft as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, and modification using security safeguards, including physical, organization and technological measures, commensurate with the sensitivity of your Personal Information.  Employees who have access to your information are made aware of the importance of keeping it confidential.

Where we use service providers who might have access to your Personal Information, we require them to have privacy and security standards that are comparable to ours. We use contracts and other measures with our service providers to maintain the confidentiality and security of your Personal Information and to prevent it from being used for any other purpose.

Please be aware that no data security measures can guarantee 100% security. You should also take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password, phone, and computer by, among other things, signing off after using a shared computer, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, and keeping your log-in and password private. We are not responsible for any lost, stolen, or compromised passwords or for any activity on your account via unauthorized password activity.
