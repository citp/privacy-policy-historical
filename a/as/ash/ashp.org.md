# Privacy Policy - ASHP

The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) has created this statement in order to demonstrate its firm commitment to privacy. This statement will help you understand how your personally identifiable information is collected and how that information may be shared. The following discloses the information gathering and dissemination practices for ASHP.org.

**Notification of Changes to Privacy Statement**

Users can find out about changes in this privacy statement by visiting this page. This statement was **last revised in November, 2016**. We encourage users to read this statement thoroughly and use it as a point of reference for the future. 

**Cookies**

Our site uses cookies to keep track of your online shopping cart. The shopping cart may not perform correctly if the cookies option is turned off in the browser settings. The ASHP website uses cookies to restrict access to some content. ASHP members who elect to browse the site with the cookies option turned off will not be able to access restricted content. 

**Log Files**

Browser type, IP address, access time, and files accessed are collected in log files. ASHP uses this information to analyze traffic on the site and then discards the log files. Aggregate information generated from the log files is sometimes shared with advertisers. 

**Personally Identifiable Information**

The site collects personally identifiable information at the following locations: Online ASHP Membership Form, Change of Address Form for ASHP Members, ASHP Virtual Mentoring Exchange, The ASHP Shopping Cart, Professional Information Form, and the CE Testing Center. The information collected includes name, title, home address, business address, practice demographics, email, and credit card number (when a purchase is made). ASHP uses customer contact information from the forms to send orders, email news services, newsletters, its journal (AJHP), Products Catalog, and event announcements. The non-financial information we collect is sometimes shared with other reputable organizations to help them contact consumers for marketing purposes. Users may choose to decline receiving future mailings; please see the “Opting Out“ section below. Aggregated demographic information may also be compiled and shared, but does not identify the individual user. 

**Special Relationships**

Part of the ASHP Superstore is a royalty arrangement with Doody Publishing. Doody Publishing collects personally identifiable information only for billing purposes and never shares personal information with third parties. Doody Publishing does share with ASHP aggregate sales information as part of the royalty arrangement. Please read Doody Publishing's [privacy policy](http://corp.doody.com/corp2012/privacy.aspx) for additional information. 

**Links**

This website contains links to other sites. ASHP is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of other websites. Please read the privacy statements of the sites to which we link as their privacy practices may differ from those of www.ashp.org. 

**Survey Information**

Personally identifiable information is optional in our online surveys and would be used only to contact a user for clarification purposes. Demographic and profile data that are collected are analyzed and shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis. 

**Email**

Throughout this website, users are provided the opportunity to communicate with ASHP via email. We read every message and try to reply promptly to every one. This information is used to reply directly to your questions or comments. ASHP does not sell or rent email address information of our customers/members. Email addresses will be included in member-protected online networking directories. If you do not want your email address displayed in the online networking directory, see the “Opt Out” section below. 

**Opting Out**

Our website provides users the opportunity to opt out of receiving communications from ASHP and any third parties at the point where the information is submitted. Please note that the current ASHP Product Catalog does not provide the user with the opportunity to opt out of mailing lists at this time. 

Choosing to opt out of emails currently means you will NOT receive ANY email from ASHP (including _Newslink_ ). Likewise, opting out of emails and mailings means you will receive no announcements about upcoming meetings or product announcements and promotions.
