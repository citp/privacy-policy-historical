Privacy Statement for WWW.ASHP.ORG

The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) has created this statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. This statement will help you understand how your personally identifiable information is collected and how that information may be shared. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for www.ashp.org.

## COOKIES 

Our site uses cookies to keep track of your online shopping cart. The shopping cart may not perform correctly if the cookies option is turned off in the browser settings. The ASHP web site uses cookies to restrict access to some content. ASHP members who elect to browse the site with the cookies option turned off will not be able to access restricted content. 

## LOG FILES 

Browser type, IP address, access time, and files accessed are collected in log files. ASHP uses this information to analyze traffic on the site and then discards the log files. Aggregate information generated from the log files is sometimes shared with advertisers. 

## PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION 

The site collects personally identifiable information at the following locations: Online ASHP Membership Form, Change of Address Form for ASHP Members, ASHP Virtual Mentoring Exchange, The ASHP Shopping Cart, Listserv sign-up, Professional Information Form, and the CE Testing Center. The information collected includes name, title, home address, business address, practice demographics, e-mail, and credit card number (when a purchase is made). We use customer contact information from the forms to send orders, email news services, newsletters, our journal (AJHP), Products Catalog, and event announcements. A credit card processing company is used to process credit cards. The credit card information is used only for billing purposes. The nonfinancial information we collect is sometimes shared with other reputable organizations to help them contact consumers for marketing purposes. Users may choose to decline receiving future mailings; please see the "Opting Out" section below. Aggregated demographic information may also be compiled and shared, but does not identify the individual user. 

## SPECIAL RELATIONSHIPS 

Part of the ASHP Superstore is a royalty arrangement with Doody Publishing. Doody Publishing collects personally identifiable information only for billing purposes and never shares personal information with third parties. Doody Publishing does share with ASHP aggregate sales information as part of the royalty arrangement.

This site makes discussion threads and listserv subscriptions available to its users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information. You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose any personal information. These forums are moderated and inappropriate messages will be removed. 

## OPTING OUT
