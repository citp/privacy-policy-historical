Ashley Furniture Industries, Inc. Privacy Policy  
  
---  
  
Our commitment  
  
The following describes the Privacy Policy of Ashley Furniture Industries, Inc. (referred to as “Ashley Furniture,” “we,” “us,” and “our”) for this Web site. We understand how important it is to keep your personal information confidential. We value the information you provide to us and want you to be confident that we are committed to protecting your privacy. Our commitment to protecting your privacy is outlined in the policies below.  
  
This Privacy Policy was created to inform you of what information we collect when you visit our Web site ashleyfurniture.com. This policy addresses the nature, purpose, use, and sharing of any information collected via our Web site. The information you provide on our Web site will be used only for its intended purpose. Submitting personally identifiable information (defined below) is strictly voluntary. By using this Web site, you acknowledge to us and our affiliates your agreement on the Terms of Use of this Web site. If you do not want to give us your permission to use your information, do not provide it. However, not providing certain information may result in our inability to provide you with the information or services you desire.  
  
Information Collected  
  
The two types of information we collect are personally identifiable information and non-personally identifiable information.  
  
Non-personally identifiable information is anonymous information that cannot be used to identify you. We use this information to track navigation through a Web site, which pages are viewed most often, what other Web sites are visited, and similar data.  
  
Personally identifiable information is sensitive information that can be used to identify you. Personally identifiable information includes, among other information, your name, e-mail address, physical mailing address, and telephone number. Some of the features on our Web site require that you provide us information about yourself. This information is collected only when you provide it to us by filling out a form on our Web site. You can review and update any personal information you have provided to us. When you provide us your personal information, you consent to the information practices described in this policy.  
  
We will never request your password, user name, or other personally identifiable information through e-mail. This practice, called “phishing,” is oftentimes a scam designed to steal your personal information. If you receive an e-mail message that looks like it is from us asking you for your personal information, do not respond.  
  
Use of Information You Provide  
  
If you choose to provide us with personal information, we will use that information to enhance your experience in the following ways:  
  
  * Register you as a member of ashleyfurniture.com.
  * Customize your shopping experience.
  * Communicate great values and featured items to you.
  * Comply with valid legal procedures, requirements, regulations, and statutes.

  
  
Interaction with Children  
  
We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13 on our Web site. You must be 18 years of age to use our Web site. Please see our Terms of Use.  
  
Automatically Collected Information  
  
We save information based on your interaction with our Web site. This allows us to process your inquiries more efficiently, and ultimately, give you better customer service. This information includes, but is not limited to, your Internet Protocol address (the address automatically assigned to your computer every time you establish a connection to the Internet), the name of any referring Web sites, as well as your navigation and activity on our Web site. By tracking this type of information, we can modify our content and product displays to enhance your experience on our Web site.  
  
This information is only used to help us make our Web site more useful to you. Except for authorized law enforcement investigations, no attempts are made to identify individual users or their usage habits. Raw data logs are retained temporarily as required for security and site management purposes only.  
  
Information Collected for Tracking Purposes (Cookies)  
  
Like many Web sites, we use “cookies” to obtain information when your web browser accesses our Web site. “Cookies” are small amounts of data that are stored on your computer and find their way to your browser via a Web server. They flag information about your activity on our Web site. This information helps us to improve our Web site and to make it friendlier and easier to use. We are then able to “recognize” you and personalize your experience with our Web site. You may “turn off” cookies by following steps outlined in the “Help” portion of the toolbar on most browsers; however, cookies allow you to take advantage of some of our Web site’s best features, so we recommend that you leave them turned on.  
  
We may use third party service providers to serve advertisements and e-mail messages on our behalf. This form of marketing is called “retargeting;” and it enhances the web surfing experience. These companies may use technologies to measure the effectiveness of advertisements and use information about your visits to our Web site and other Web sites you visit so that we can provide a better experience for you. These third party service providers may collect anonymous information about your visits to our Web site and your interaction with our Web site. This anonymous information is collected through the use of a pixel tag. No personally identifiable information is collected or used in this process. Our third party service providers do not learn the name, telephone number, postal address, e-mail address, or any other personal information about you.  
  
Sharing Information  
  
We may share aggregated general information collected by our Web site with our agents, representatives, service providers, contractors, ASHLEY FURNITURE HOMESTORE® retail furniture stores, and Ashley Furniture Industries, Inc. and its subsidiaries. Aggregated data does not contain any personally identifiable information that could be used to contact or identify you.  
  
We only share personally identifiable information to other companies or individuals if one or more of the following limited circumstances apply: 

  * We have your consent.
  * We provide such information to respected businesses or persons for the sole purpose of processing personally identifiable information on our behalf. When this is done, it is subject to agreements that obligate those parties to process such information only in accordance with our instructions, in compliance with this privacy policy, and with appropriate confidentiality and security measures in place. We have no control over, and bear no responsibility for the privacy policies and/or content of any Web sites or advertisers linked to or on ashleyfurniture.com, or the cookies these Web sites deposit on your computer.
  * We provide such information to ASHLEY FURNITURE HOMESTORE® retail furniture stores, including those that are independently owned and operated. These ASHLEY FURNITURE HOMESTORE® retail furniture stores may use this information to offer products and services to you.
  * When required by law or where we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a criminal investigation, a court order, or legal process served on our company in direct relation to you. We may also share your personally identifiable information if we believe it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of the terms of use of our Web site and services, or as otherwise required by law.
  * If you have established an account with us, we may share the information submitted under your account among all of the services and Web sites we own in order to provide you with a seamless experience and to improve the quality of our services. We will not disclose your account information to other people or non-affiliated companies, except in limited circumstances described in this privacy policy or with your consent.
  * In the event that another company acquires all or substantially all of the assets related to our business, we reserve the right to include any or all stored personally identifiable information among the assets transferred to the acquiring company.
  * We may store and process personally identifiable information collected on our Web site in the United States or any other country in which we maintain facilities. By using our services, you consent to the transfer of your information among these facilities, including those located outside your country.

  
  
We currently DO NOT share your personally identifiable information with any other companies or organizations that would target you with offers or promotions that are not directly related to ASHLEY FURNITURE HOMESTORE® retail furniture stores or this Web site.  
  
Security  
  
We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure, or destruction of the data you provide to us. Our servers are protected by firewalls and are physically located in secure data facilities to further increase security. While no computer is 100% safe from outside attacks, we believe that the steps we have taken to protect your personally identifiable information dramatically reduce the likelihood of security problems to a level appropriate for the type of data involved.  
  
Opt-Out of Services  
  
At any time you may opt-out of our services. You are free to delete all cookies on your browser, or have your browser notify you when a cookie is set – simply check your browser settings. By deleting your cookies you will disable our ability, or that of our third party partners, to deliver advertisements that are targeted to your interests. You will have to clear your cookies each time you visit our Web site to ensure that you are not receiving retargeted advertisements.
