# Ashampoo® - Company - Privacy Policy

  


## Responsible party:

Ashampoo GmbH & Co. KG is responsible for data collection and processing. 

## Data processing for contract fulfilment: 

We process the collected data in accordance with article 6, paragraph 1, subparagraph b GDPR for the purpose of contract fulfilment. This also includes the associated customer service. If necessary, personal data are passed on to companies involved in the processing of this contract, e.g. e-commerce providers for payment processing or external suppliers of software components and products. 

## Data processing for direct advertising:

We process your data for the purpose of direct advertising, in particular for email-based ads. Data processing is carried out in accordance with article 6, paragraph 1, suparagraph f of GDPR and in the interest of informing you about new products and services. Each customer has the individual right to object to such processing. If they exercise that right, processing of personal data for direct advertising purposes will cease. Data stored exclusively for direct advertising will be deleted after the objection has been raised.

##  Analyses 

In case of activation of the IP anonymization, Google will truncate/anonymize the last octet of the IP address for Member States of the European Union as well as for other parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases, the full IP address is sent to and shortened by Google servers in the USA. 

Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity for website operators and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google's behalf. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google. 

The tracking code embedded in this website uses display advertising. Remarketing as specified in Google Analytics for Display Ads is also used. You may find Ashampoo ads on third-party websites including Google. Ashampoo and third-party content providers, including Google, are using cookies. The combined approach of using primary cookies (e.g. cookies by Google Analytics) and cookies by third-party content providers (e.g. DoubleClick cookies) allows for interest-related ad development, optimization and display based on previous visits. You may disable Google Analytics for display ads at <https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb> or customize the display of ads within the Google Display Network.   
We are using these Google Adwords-related features to also reach our visitors on third-party websites or internet users with specific interest profiles based on their internet use. We do not collect any personal data with our cookies, remarketing lists or other anonymous ids.   
By using this website, you consent to the processing of data about you by Google in the manner and for the purposes set out above

**Google Signals**  
In addition we use the web analysis service Google Signals. Via Google Signals, Google provides us with reports on cross-device number of users, as well as different groups of users, based on different device combinations. In order to do so Google uses the data of users who have activated the option “personalized advertising” in their Google account settings. Google Signals is only used with activated IP anonymization. As a result, your IP address will be shortened by Google within the member states of the European Union or in other states that have ratified the Convention on the European Economic Area prior to its transmission to the United States. Therefore, no single user can be identified. You can withdraw your consent to the collection of your data via Google Signals, at any time via disabling “personalised advertising” in your Google Account:

You can refuse the use of Google Analytics by clicking on the following link. An opt-out cookie will be set on the computer, which prevents the future collection of your data when visiting this website: Disable Google Analytics   
You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser. However, please note that if you do this, you may not be able to use the full functionality of this website. Furthermore you can prevent Google’s collection and use of data (cookies and IP address) by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available under <https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout>.:

**Please note:**   
This website uses Google Analytics with the code **"anonymizeIP()"** which ensures that IP addresses are anonymized.

You can deactivate the storage of cookies in your browser under Extras/Internet Options, limit them to specific websites or set your browser to notify you when a cookie is sent.

## eCommerce 

In order to process an order we need your address data, your date of birth, e-mail, telephone number (if applicable), the total purchase price, purchase order date and information about the handling of payments. 

  * To secure your information in transmission we use Secure Sockets Layer software (SSL) where needed. This software encrypts the information you submit. 
  * Of course this is also true for credit card payments. The credit card information is only stored temporarily and deleted after being handed on to the respective payment provider. 
  * It is important for you to take precautions against unauthorized access to your password and your computer. If you share your computer with others, you should remember to always log off after each session. 



You can have your data deleted at any time. We use your data only to process your order, i.e. only information implicitly necessary for possible claims for reimbursement is collected and handled.

##  Software Installation and Activation 

Activation, trial extension and unlocking of free software is achieved through an activation routine at program launch. This process requires an Ashampoo-registered email address and password. Alternatively, a license key can be used. Activation of a full version software requires an active Internet connection. During the process, a connection to a licensing server is established and a validity check performed. Invalid licenses / license keys or keys that have been used multiple times will result in the display of a licensing error in the program that will disappear once the program has been activated successfully. The validity of a product license will be automatically checked online at regular intervals. 

The following information is transmitted when you activate a program with a license key: 

  * The license key 
  * A checksum 
  * The product code 
  * The version numbers 
  * The language setting 



You can check your current license keys at any time. Just visit MyAshampoo at <https://www.ashampoo.com/myashampoo>. Your personal MyAshampoo data is protected against unauthorized access, you can log in with your email address and a password you choose yourself. Your personal data will be stored anonymously unless you choose to enter your name, which is entirely optional. Our privacy policies for managing your data are very strict and we will never share your information with any third parties.

##  Other 

  * Promotions: From time to time we send offers by order of a third party company to selected customer groups. In this case, that company receives neither your name, nor your address or any other information that could be used to personally identify you. If you do not wish to receive such offers, you can simply stop them in your user account. 
  * Ashampoo and its affiliates can use the collected data for their own marketing purposes, in case you have agreed to this. 
  * The Ashampoo support staff uses the dependable Zendesk ticket system. Your data will therefore be relayed to and archived by Zendesk. You can find out more about Zendesk's data protection policy here: <https://www.zendesk.com/company/customers-partners/privacy-policy/>
  * Service providers: We commission other companies and individuals to perform tasks for us. Examples are, among other things, package deliveries and payment processing (credit card, direct debiting, purchase on account). These service providers have access to personal information that is required for their tasks. They are prohibited from using this information for other purposes. Moreover, they are obliged to handle the information in accordance with this privacy policy and German data protection laws. 
  * Protection of Ashampoo and third parties: We will disclose accounts and personal data of customers, if we are bound by law to do so or if disclosure is necessary to enforce our General Terms and Conditions or other agreements or to protect our rights or the rights of third parties. This includes data exchange with companies specializing in preventing and minimizing the risk of violation and credit card fraud. We explicitly state that in this context no data will be passed on to those companies for economic use that would contradict this privacy policy. 
  * With your consent: In all other cases we will inform you if personal information is to be handed off to third parties and give you the chance to give your consent.
