##  Analyses 

In case of activation of the IP anonymization, Google will truncate/anonymize the last octet of the IP address for Member States of the European Union as well as for other parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases, the full IP address is sent to and shortened by Google servers in the USA.

Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google's behalf. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google.

## eCommerce

In order to process an order we need your address data, your date of birth, e-mail, telephone number (if applicable), the total purchase price, purchase order date and information about the handling of payments. 

  * To secure your information in transmission we use Secure Sockets Layer software (SSL) where needed. This software encrypts the information you submit. 
  * Of course this is also true for credit card payments. The credit card information is only stored temporarily and deleted after being handed on to the respective payment provider. 
  * It is important for you to take precautions against unauthorized access to your password and your computer. If you share your computer with others, you should remember to always log off after each session. 



You can have your data deleted at any time. We use your data only to process your order, i.e. only information implicitly necessary for possible claims for reimbursement is collected and handled.  Back to top    


##  Software Installation and Activation 

When you purchase an Ashampoo software product, request an extension of a trial period or activate a free full version, you will receive a license key, generally by e-mail. Similar license keys are also used for trial period extensions and for unlocking free full versions of Ashampoo products. You activate a software product with a license key by entering the key in the appropriate dialog in the application for which you purchased the key. When using this dialog to activate a full version of a software product you must be connected to the Internet so that the validity of the key can be checked. When you activate the software a connection is made to the Ashampoo license server, which checks the key in our database. If the key is unknown or has already been activated an error will be displayed. The software product will still remain fully functional, even if you enter an invalid key. However, the license key error will continue to display when the program starts until you have completed the activation process with a valid key. 

The following information is transmitted when you activate a program with a license key: 

  * The license key 
  * A checksum 
  * The product code 
  * The version numbers 
  * The language setting 



You can check your current license keys at any time. Just visit MyAshampoo at http://www.ashampoo.com/en/usd/mai. Your personal MyAshampoo data is protected against unauthorized access, you can log in with your email address and a password you choose yourself. Your personal data will be stored anonymously unless you choose to enter your name, which is entirely optional. Our privacy policies for managing your data are very strict and we will never share your information with any third parties.  Back to top    


##  Other 

  * Promotions: From time to time we send offers by order of a third party company to selected customer groups. In this case, that company receives neither your name, nor your address or any other information that could be used to personally identify you. If you do not wish to receive such offers, you can simply stop them in your user account. 
  * Ashampoo and its affiliates can use the collected data for their own marketing purposes, in case you have agreed to this. 
  * Service providers: We commission other companies and individuals to perform tasks for us. Examples are, among other things, package deliveries and payment processing (credit card, direct debiting, purchase on account). These service providers have access to personal information that is required for their tasks. They are prohibited from using this information for other purposes. Moreover, they are obliged to handle the information in accordance with this privacy policy and German data protection laws. 
  * Protection of Ashampoo and third parties: We will disclose accounts and personal data of customers, if we are bound by law to do so or if disclosure is necessary to enforce our General Terms and Conditions or other agreements or to protect our rights or the rights of third parties. This includes data exchange with companies specializing in preventing and minimizing the risk of violation and credit card fraud. We explicitly state that in this context no data will be passed on to those companies for economic use that would contradict this privacy policy. 
  * With your consent: In all other cases we will inform you if personal information is to be handed off to third parties and give you the chance to give your consent.
