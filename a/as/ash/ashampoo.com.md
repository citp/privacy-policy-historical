# Ashampoo® - We Make Software!

### We at ashampoo

take the protection of your personal data very seriously and strictly conform to data protection laws. Personal data is being collected on this website only to the extent necessary for technical reasons. **By no means** will the collected data be sold or for any other reason given to third parties. The following statement gives you an overview of how we ensure this protection and what kind of data is being collected for what purpose. 

### Information you give us

Information is transmitted e.g. whenever you search for a product, make a purchase via our websites or a third party vendor or enter details in “My Ashampoo” or your customer account (please note that you may maintain more than one customer account if you have registered with different e-mail addresses), if you communicate with us via e-mail or by another way, if you fill out a questionnaire or enter a contest or if you use other services which inform you personally about certain offers such as newsletters. 

  


### Analyses

When visiting our sites, special analysis software collects and stores anonymized data for marketing and optimization purposes.   
This data cannot be linked to your identity. 

**Examples for types of data we collect:**

  * Browser type and version 
  * Operating system and system language
  * Referring website 
  * Host name of accessing computer (IP address)
  * Time of server request
  * Country/region of origin
  * Screen resolution



This data cannot be definitely linked to certain persons and only serves to optimize our online services. This data will not be merged with other data sources and will be deleted after statistical analysis. 

### Cookies 

This website uses cookies in several places. These cookies are used to make our services more user-friendly, more effective and more secure. Cookies are small text files that your browser saves on your computer. Most of the cookies we use are so-called “Session Cookies”. These will be automatically deleted after your visit. Cookies cannot do damage to your computer and do not  
contain viruses. 

Cookies can also be saved for a longer period of time, e.g. for a website to recognize your user profile without the need to log in. You can customize how cookies are handled in your browser settings. 

### Newsletter 

If you want to receive the newsletter we offer on our website, we need a valid e-mail address as well as, for your own protection, information allowing us to verify the address you entered and make sure you are authorized to use that address and consent to receiving the newsletter. No further data will be collected.  
You can revoke your consent to the collection of data, your e-mail address and receiving the newsletter at any time. 

Some of the software we deliver leads to an entry into several distribution lists upon registration. You are informed about such an entry before or during the registration process, so you can decide at any time whether you want this or not. 

### eCommerce 

In order to process an order we need your address data, your date of birth, e-mail, telephone number (if applicable), the total   
purchase price, purchase order date and information about the handling of payments. 

  * To secure your information in transmission we use Secure Sockets Layer software (SSL) where needed. This software encrypts the information you submit.
  * Of course this is also true for credit card payments. The credit card information is only stored temporarily and deleted after being handed on to the respective payment provider.
  * It is important for you to take precautions against unauthorized access to your password and your computer. If you share   
a computer with others, you should remember to always log off after each session.



You can have your data deleted at any time. We use your data only to process your order, i.e. only information implicitly necessary   
for possible claims for reimbursement is collected and handled. 

### Miscellaneous

  * **Promotions** : From time to time we send offers by order of a third party company to select customer groups. In this case,   
that company receives neither your name, nor your address or any other information that could be used to personally   
identify you. If you do not wish to receive such offers, you can simply stop them in your user account.
  * Ashampoo and its affiliates can use the collected data for their own marketing purposes, in case you have agreed to this.
  * **Service providers** : We commission other companies and individuals to perform tasks for us. Examples are, among other things, package deliveries and payment processing (credit card, direct debiting, purchase on account). These service providers have access to personal information that is required for their tasks. They are prohibited from using this information for other purposes. Moreover, they are obliged to handle the information in accordance with this privacy policy and German data protection laws.
  * **Protection of Ashampoo and third parties** : We will disclose accounts and personal data of customers if we are bound by law to do so or if disclosure is necessary to enforce our General Terms and Conditions or other agreements or to protect our rights or the rights of third parties. This includes data exchange with companies specializing in preventing and minimizing the risk of violation and credit card fraud. We explicitly state that in this context no data will be passed on to those companies for economic use that would contradict this privacy policy.
  * **With your consent** : In all other cases we will inform you if personal information is to be handed off to third parties and give you the chance to give your consent.
