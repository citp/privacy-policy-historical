<p align="justify"><b>What information do you gather automatically from visitors?</b><br> We use your IP address (the series of numbers associated with your individual computer) to help us maintain our site and identify problems with our server. Your IP address does not disclose any personally revealing information about you.</p> 
<p align="justify"> We do use cookies to identify traffic that comes through advertising and to facilitate a more user friendly experience. Cookies are small pieces of information that a web site places on your computer's hard drive so we know it's you when you visit. This helps us to create a personalized experience for you when you visit our site. The use of cookies is a very common practice on the Internet. If you are uncomfortable with this, you can disable all cookies through your browser settings. Your enjoyment of our site won't be affected if you have set your browser to reject cookies.</p> 

<p align="justify"><b>What information will you ask me for?</b><br> When you establish an Ad Profile on The Ashley Madison Agency service you will be asked  for some general identifying information which will enable us to provide you with this individualized  service. We gather contact information (e.g. your email address), and demographic information (e.g. city  of residence or age). We may share some of this information for our own research purposes with our professional  advisors or consultants and third party partners, however the information shared will be limited to non-personally  identifying demographic information shared under cover of a confidentiality agreement. If you choose to become an  Advertiser, we collect financial information (your credit card number and expiry date). We will only use this  information in the course of providing our service to you.</p> 

<p align="justify"> While register and creating an Ad Profile, you will be given the option of creating a pseudonymous profile  (username, password and personal description) where your gender is applicable. Personal information that may identify you is not permitted on your Ad Profile.  Please note, you may upload photos to your Ad Profile.  The type of photos you upload may clearly identify you. </p> 

<p align="justify"><b>How will this information be used and who has access to it?</b><br> We may use your contact information to send you valuable updates and timely notices of promotions  and mailbox status reports. Our site provides you with the opportunity to receive different types of  communication from us.</p> 
<p align="justify"> Your non-personally identifying demographic information is used to personalize your experience,  allow other members to find you through a search, to compose your personal profile - which is  associated with a pseudonymous identity you have created - and to deliver targeted advertising  and promotional offers to you from external companies that are of the highest relevance to your  demographic profile. </p>

<p align="justify"> The personally identifiable information we collect from you is used for internet review and to improve  the content and functionality of our web server or customize the layout of our pages for each individual  member. The specific information we collect is not shared with other organizations and we will never  release your personally identifiable information to any third party or external organization without  your prior consent except for the purposes of validating credit information and collecting debts, or unless we reasonably believe we are required to do so by operation of law.</p> 

<p align="justify"><b>How long do you keep the information I've provided you?</b><br> We keep the information you have given us for as long as your Ad Profile stays active or hidden.</p>

<p align="justify"><b>Accessing and updating your email notification preferences, personal information and public information</b><br> You have the opportunity to opt-out of certain communications and modify personal information or demographic information you have provided to us, and to hide information visible to the public users of the Ashley Madison Website System at anytime by going to the 'Manage Profile' or 'Message Center' sections on your Ad Profile.</p> 
<p align="justify">Please be aware that it may take several hours for any custom changes you make to take effect on the public areas of the system. Please also note that changing or deleting your information through the 'Manage Profile' or 'Message Center' section of the system, or opting-out of email notifications from us, will only change or delete the data in our database for the purpose of future activities and communications. These changes and deletions will not change or delete emails or information that are queued to be sent or have already been sent.</p>

<p align="justify"><b>Unsolicited Contact (SPAM)</b><br> The Ashley Madison Agency Limited, our affiliates and our channel partners do not send unsolicited mail at any time. Members are automatically opted in to receive email notifications to the email address they register on their Ad Profile.  You may opt-out of receiving email notifications at any time.</p>

<p align="justify"><b>Do you monitor online behavior?</b><br> Our clients communicate with each other through on-site Mail Messaging and Instant Messaging.  While we do not, as a rule, moderate or monitor advertisers' private exchanges, we reserve  the right to do so if we suspect users of being under the age of 18 or of using our service for the  purpose of solicitation or any other violation of our Terms of Use or Privacy Statement.  Submissions that appear on the public area of the site are moderated and, if necessary,  we reserve the right to edit, delete, remove or not use any communication on a public  area of the site.</p> 
<p align="justify">Advertisers may choose to participate in community polls. The results of these polls are tracked by gender only and do not reveal any personal identifiable information linked to the individual voters.</p> 	

<p align="justify"><b>Affiliates</b><br> When you register to become an Affiliate, you will be asked for contact information. Your information will only be used by internal staff and will never be shared with anyone external to the company other than our advisors and representatives.</p>
