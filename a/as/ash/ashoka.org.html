<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br>
  This privacy policy (this “Privacy Policy”) is provided to explain the  online information practices of Ashoka (“Ashoka,” “us” or “we”) and the choices  you can make about the way that your personally identifiable information  (“Personal Information”) is collected and used at Ashoka websites  (collectively, the “Site”). </p>
<p>Please note that by accessing or using the Site, you agree to be bound by  the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy except as otherwise required by  local law.&nbsp; This Privacy Policy is  effective as of [•] 2012 and is subject to change as set forth below in  “Changes to the Ashoka Privacy Policy.”<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Use of Cookies</strong><br>
  When you visit the Site, cookies may be created on your  Internet browser to log information and details of visitor behavior patterns. Cookies  are text-only pieces of information that a website, such as ours, transfers to  your computer's hard disk.

<p>You usually can configure your Internet browser to reject cookies.  However, if you do so, you might not be able to access certain pages or use  certain functions on the Site, some of which may be important to you. To the  extent allowable under local law, we reserve the right to introduce new session  management technologies and techniques related to the use of the Site. </p>

<p><strong>Anonymous Usage Logs</strong><br>
  The Site’s web servers collect anonymous logs during user visits to the  Site.&nbsp; This information is used to create  aggregate statistics about the operation and use of the Site such as when our  Site is accessed, the pages which refer visitors to the Site, the type of web  browsers visitors use and which pages of the Site are viewed.&nbsp; These statistics help us understand how the  Site is used and provide us with valuable information for improving the Site in  the future.&nbsp; From time to time, we may  share such aggregate, non-personally identifiable statistical information with  our partners, affiliates, consultants, suppliers and providers. The type and  amount of information we receive and store depends on how you use the Site.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Personal Information </strong><br>
  In general, when you visit our Site you remain anonymous, but on some  pages, you need to provide Personal Information to register, make donations,  contact us or conduct other transactions via the Site. The types of Personal  Information collected on the Site may include any or all of the following, depending  on your activities on the Site: name, address, e-mail address, phone number,  website, organization (including the organization’s name, website, phone  number, and address), username, password, languages, fields of work, Twitter  handle, photograph and other Personal Information that you actively provide to  us via the Site. </p>
<p>The Site also enables you to send a message related to the Site to other  people, for example to introduce friends who you believe may be interested in  learning about Ashoka and who have consented to receiving such messages. To  utilize this functionality, you will need to provide personally identifiable  information, such as name and email address for people other than yourself.  Ashoka does not actively collect or store this personal information and only  uses it so far as it is required to provide the service.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Use of Personal Information</strong><br>
  We use and/or disclose Personal Information to process and complete  donations and to provide information about our organization, initiatives or other  issues of interest.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Except as provided herein, we will not sell any Personal Information that  you provide through the Site without your prior written consent. We may use  Personal Information that you provide to update you on our activities and to  let you and those you identify know about new projects that we believe may be  of interest to you except as otherwise required by local law.&nbsp; </p>
<p>We may share Personal Information with our partners, affiliates,  consultants, local curators and providers. Our agreements with these entities require that they keep  your Personal Information confidential and only use your Personal Information  to the extent necessary to perform their functions and not for any other  purpose. &nbsp;We also contract other  companies and individuals (collectively “Suppliers”) to perform functions on  our behalf, including without limitation, processing credit card payments or  sending communications to you. We will take reasonable steps to ensure that  these Suppliers keep your Personal Information confidential and only use your  Personal Information to the extent necessary to perform their functions and not  for any other purpose. </p>
<p>Donations that are made to Ashoka on the Site are processed using a  third-party payment system. Credit/Debit card details will be retained by the  party providing the payment services and its affiliated bank as deemed  necessary by them to process the payment for your donation. Your Credit/Debit  card details will be retained by the processor for future transactions only  upon your authorization. If you later decide that you do not want such  information stored, you may contact us at web@ashoka.org [1] and we will  coordinate with the processor to remove such information.<br>
  <br>
  We may disclose Personal Information in response to legal process or when  we believe in good faith that the law requires it, for example, in response to  a court order, subpoena or a law enforcement agency’s request. To the extent  allowable under local law, we also reserve the right to disclose Personal  Information to protect the security of the Site, to protect ourselves and our  affiliated non-profits against liability, and/or in connection with any sale,  assignment, or other transfer of some or all of our operations.<br>
  <br>
  In the event that Ashoka or a significant portion of the Site or Ashoka’s  assets or business is sold, assigned, merged, or otherwise transferred, Ashoka  may transfer your Personal Information as a part of the transaction. In the  event such a transfer occurs, Ashoka will comply with applicable local laws  related to your Personal Information and otherwise use reasonable efforts to  keep your Personal Information subject to the same protection as it was prior  to the transfer. In the event that your Personal Information becomes subject to  a different privacy policy, Ashoka will comply with applicable local laws and  otherwise use reasonable efforts to notify you of such change.<br>
  <br>
  The Site is not directed to children and Ashoka does not knowingly solicit  information from any child under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13,  you may not use the Site to disclose Personal Information or use any feature of  the Site that requires such disclosures.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>How You Can Access or Correct Your  Information</strong><br>
  If you are a registered user, you can access, correct and remove certain  Personal Information that we collect online and maintain by logging into your  account. If any errors in your Personal Information cannot be corrected by  accessing your account, or if you do not have an account, or if you have other  questions related to updating or changing your Personal Information on the  Site, please contact us using the contact information below. You may also  contact us using the information below to ask us to terminate your account  and/or remove your Personal Information from our records, electronic or  otherwise.&nbsp; However, we will need to  maintain certain Personal Information about your donations in our records for  purposes such as tax notifications and disclosures.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Links</strong><br>
  Please note that third parties may also collect information about you,  through cookies or other technologies, when you link to their websites through  the Site.&nbsp; We do not monitor or control  the information collection or privacy practices of these or any other third parties,  and are not responsible for their practices or the content of their  websites.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are concerned about  how third parties collect and use information, please review their privacy  practices posted on their websites.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Changes to Ashoka Privacy Policy</strong><br>
  Our privacy practices, like the online medium itself, are subject to  change.&nbsp; Ashoka may, in its sole  discretion, change this Privacy Policy at any time to reflect changes in the  way we collect and use Personal Information in the future.&nbsp; Please check this Privacy Policy frequently  and particularly before you submit additional Personal Information via the  Site. Revisions to this Privacy Policy will be posted on the Site via a link  from the home page of the Site.&nbsp;  Registered users will receive notifications providing information  related to modifications. Your continued use of our Site after changes in this  Privacy Policy will mean that you accept such changes except as otherwise  required by local law.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Security</strong><br>
  Ashoka strives to protect the sensitive information visitors submit and  encrypts some information, such as credit card transactions, using Secure  Sockets Layer (SSL) and transport layer security (TLS) technology. By  encrypting your sensitive data, SSL and TLS attempt to prevent anyone from  reading it as it travels across the Internet. You should note, however, that no  transmission of encrypted data is completely secure and should be aware of the  risks before submitting sensitive information. If you are concerned about using  your credit card to make a donation online, please feel free to call us at  703-527-8300 and make your donation via phone. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>International Users</strong><br>
  Ashoka seeks to collect, process, store, disclose and dispose of Personal  Information that you submit to us in accordance with applicable law in the  jurisdictions where it collects information. Please note that the Personal  Information you submit to the Site will be transferred to the United States to  be processed by Ashoka in order to provide the Site and its services to you or  for such other purposes as set forth in this Privacy Policy under the “Use of  Information” section above. If you are not a resident of the United States, you  acknowledge and agree that we may collect and use your Personal Information, as  discussed in this Privacy Policy, outside your resident jurisdiction.<br>
  <br>
  In addition, we may store such Personal Information in the United States  or other jurisdictions, outside your resident jurisdiction. In particular, you  are advised that the United States uses a sectoral model of privacy protection  that relies on a mix of legislation, governmental regulation, and  self-regulation. Please be aware that United States law may offer different  levels of protection for Personal Information than may be available in your  country.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Residents of California</strong><br>
  California residents are entitled by law to request an Information Sharing  Disclosure. Following your provision of notice to the address below, Ashoka  will provide you with a notice of your right to prevent sharing of your  Personal Information as well as a cost-free means of doing so. To receive such  a notice, submit a written request to the address below, specifying that you  are requesting your “California Customer Choice Notice.” </p>
<p><strong>Compliance with Anti-Money  Laundering Laws</strong><br>
  Ashoka complies with the United States Office of Foreign Assets Control  regulations as well as United States export control and anti-money laundering  laws. All grants will be awarded subject to compliance with such laws. Ashoka  will not make any grant if it finds that to do so would be unlawful. This may prohibit  awards in certain countries and/or to certain individuals or entities. </p>
