## 1\. What Information We Collect:

### Shopping

When you shop at AshleyStewart.com, we will collect the information necessary to complete your order, such as your name, e-mail address, shipping address, payment information (including credit card number and/or debit card number) and billing address. You may also choose to provide us with your gender and birth date. If you create an Account, we will collect information about your purchases and payment methods, as well as the shipping addresses that you add to your Address Book, in order to make future shopping experiences faster and more convenient. You may change or delete certain of the saved information. Simply go to My Account, and log in with your email address and password. You may edit or delete certain personal information if you wish. However, not all personal information may be deleted by you. For example, you may not be able to immediately delete your credit or debit card account number and related information used for specific purchases, since we must retain some of this information in order to, among other things: ship the merchandise to you, process charges against your financial account(s), and track the financial account processing information to reverse charges in accordance with any applicable return policy.  This information is also used to provide you with more relevant content and advertising on our Website and on other sites.

### Ashley Stewart Credit Card

If you apply online for an Ashley Stewart credit card, you will be providing your personal information directly to the issuing bank for the Ashley Stewart credit card. However, your name, address, phone number, birth date and credit card account number, as well as any additional information necessary for us to provide you with the bonuses and benefits of an Ashley Stewart credit card, may be provided to us by the card issuer.

## 9\. Links

For your convenience, the Website may contain links to other websites. Ashley Stewart is not responsible for the privacy practices, advertising, products, or the content of such other websites. None of the links should be deemed to imply that Ashley Stewart endorses or has any affiliation with the links.

## 10\. Security

Ashley Stewart believes in providing a safe and secure experience for all of our online visitors. To that end, we have implemented security measures at AshleyStewart.com to protect the information we have collected at the Website. For example, we limit access to your personal information to select employees and others with a valid business need for the information. In addition, we hold our employees responsible for upholding our privacy standards.

We maintain reasonable physical and electronic safeguards designed to limit unauthorized access to your personally identifiable information, and to protect you against the criminal misuse of that information.

We use data encryption technology when transferring and receiving your personal information. For example, in your transactions submitted by you through the Website, a solid key icon or a locked padlock icon at the lower portion of your Web browser window confirms the site is secured through Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). Pages requesting personal information should always have one of these icons. You can also confirm your data is being encrypted by looking at the URL line of your browser (the place where you type Website addresses). When accessing a secure server, the site address will change from "http" to "https".

While we use the foregoing security measures to protect your information, please note that no data transmitted over the Internet or stored and utilized for business purposes can be guaranteed to be completely secure. No security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We cannot guarantee that only authorized persons will view your information. We cannot ensure that information you share on the Website will not become publicly available. You can reduce these risks by using common sense security practices such as choosing a strong password, using different passwords for different services, and using up to date antivirus software.
