            <h3>Ashford University Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>At Ashford University, we take your personal privacy seriously. This document describes the categories of information we gather via the web site and for what purpose, outlines how that information may be shared with others, and identifies the categories of persons with whom it may be shared.  By registering with Ashford University or by using the Ashford University Site, you accept and agree to this Privacy Policy and the <a href="./terms.php" target="_blank">Ashford University Terms and Conditions of Usage</a>.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to the Internet web site of Ashford University at www.ashford.edu. This Privacy Policy also applies to other affiliated web sites that are owned by Ashford University and made available to students in the matriculation process and after they have enrolled with Ashford University. All such sites will be collectively referred to in this Privacy Policy as the "Ashford University Site" or "Site". </p>
<p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected at any site that is not owned by Ashford University, including any web site reached through a link on any Ashford University Site. By way of example only, a link on Ashford University Site takes a viewer to an online bookstore that is owned and operated by EdMap, not Ashford University. The name and logo of Ashford University may appear on that online bookstore web site in order to notify students that the bookstore sells certain materials specified for Ashford University's curriculum. Ashford University does not have access to information collected through that online bookstore. This Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected through that online bookstore. The privacy policy for the EdMap online bookstore can be accessed by clicking  <a href="http://www.edmapbookstore.com/storefront/showHelpTopic/ASHSP/7" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Effective date</h3>

If you do not want such information about you to be disclosed, please contact us at <a href="mailto:student.records@ashford.edu">student.records@ashford.edu</a>. Please note that you may opt out of disclosure of this information only if you are now or become a student of Ashford University.</p>

<h3>What is Ashford University's practice regarding cookies?</h3>
<p>Your browser software has a feature called a 'cookie' that stores small amounts of data on your computer about your visit to certain websites. As a user of browser software, you may elect to disable this feature, although doing so may prevent you from using certain features that require cookies. Cookies placed on your computer by Ashford University don't tell Ashford any personally identifiable information about you but instead provide anonymous information that permits Ashford University to track how users navigate our pages, when users return to our sites, and which features are the most popular. </p>
<h3>What other information does Ashford University collect on this site? </h3>
<p>Like many commercial websites, Ashford University servers monitor and log all web traffic on the Site. These logs contain the IP address and URL from the site you visited just before you visited, the URL of the page you visit upon leaving the Site, if any, and the type of browser and operating system you are using. Statistical information is collected about visitor traffic patterns in order to improve the quality, functionality and usefulness of the Site to our customers. In such cases, the system has no means to identify you personally. We may also create and maintain records of anonymous data collected from cookies and anonymous demographic information that has been aggregated from multiple personally identifiable records such that it is no longer personally identifiable with a particular person (such as aggregate number of inquiries from a particular city, state or zip code). We may share all of the anonymous data described above with our contractors and consultants, other educational institutions, and unaffiliated third parties such as analysts, reporters, governmental authorities and others. </p>
<h3>How does Ashford University protect personal information? </h3>
<p>Although we cannot guarantee against any loss, misuse, unauthorized disclosure, alternation or destruction of data, we try to prevent such occurrences. Our servers and databases are protected by firewalls and passwords. In addition, we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software to encrypt data as it travels between your computer and our servers. </p>
<h3>Children</h3>
<p>We do not ever knowingly collect information from children under the age of thirteen, nor is this Site designed to provide any service to children under the age of thirteen. If you are under thirteen, please do not give us any personal information. If you have reason to believe that a child has provided personal information to us, please contact us and we will attempt to remove that information from our databases. </p>
<h3>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>We reserve the right to add to, change, update or modify this Privacy Policy. Any such change, update or modification will be effective without prior notice and immediately upon posting within this area of our website. You should review this Privacy Policy from time to time, to determine if changes have been made. The effective date of the current version of this Privacy Policy is listed at the beginning of the Privacy Policy. </p>
<h3>Conditions of use</h3>
<p>This Privacy Policy shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, United States of America. By using our Site, you consent to the collection and use of information described above. Your visit and any dispute over privacy are subject to this Privacy Policy and our <a href="./terms.php" target="_blank">Terms and Conditions of Usage</a>. If you have any concern about privacy related to the Ashford University Site, <a href="mailto:info@ashford.edu">please e-mail us</a> a thorough description together with information to permit us to contact you, and we will try to resolve your concern. </p>
<h3>Links to other sites</h3>
<p>The Site may contain now or in the future links to other Web sites, such as links to online bookstores, degree-granting institutions, teaching certificate institutions, and third parties that may provide services or products to you. We are not responsible for the privacy practices, the content of, or any other actions of such other Web sites or their owners or operators, such as their practices regarding cookies, information they may collect or information they may share, or whether they may permit advertisers to place and use cookies. You should check the privacy policies at each of those sites. </p>
<h3>Requesting changes to your information</h3>
<p>If you wish to review and request changes to your personal information that we collect through the Site, you may <a href="mailto:info@ashford.edu">contact us</a> directly. If you want to request us not to send you emails, you may make that request by sending us an email at <a href="mailto:student.records@ashford.edu">student.records@ashford.edu</a>.

<h3>Online education sessions</h3>
<p>During the education process, you may participate in online education sessions. Please understand that any information that is disclosed during an online classroom experience becomes known to others in the class and to Ashford University and its employees and contractors, such as instructors and administrators. We have no control over information exchanged during these online sessions and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information or any other information about yourself or others.
