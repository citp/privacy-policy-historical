## How We Use Your Information

Information such as your full name, profile photo and any personally identifiable information you have included in your profile may be shown to friends or other users primarily in conjunction with content you have contributed. Your full name and email address may also be used when you send an email notification to a friend (such as in an invitation). We may also use your email address to send you updates or news regarding our site, but you may choose not to receive email of this type by editing your preferences in your profile. Additionally, we use your email address to contact you on behalf of your friends (such as when someone sends you a personal message).

ASKK-POP uses third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, 

Browser-type related information, IP address, requested URL, referring URL, and timestamp data help us diagnose problems with our server, administer ASKK-POP, and otherwise provide the highest possible level of service to you. In addition, we use this information to perform statistical analyses of user behavior and characteristics in order to measure interest in and use of the various areas of the site and to inform advertisers of such information as well as the number of users that have been exposed to, or clicked on, their advertising banners.

## Use of Cookies and Beacons

We use cookies to refine our site and simplify the user experience. For example, the use of cookies allows registered users to enter our site without explicitly typing in their email address and password every time.

You should be aware that ASKK-POP cannot control the use of cookies, beacons and flash cookies by 3rd party advertisers or any of the information advertisers may gather from their use of their cookies, beacons or flash cookies. If you do not want information collected through the use of the aforementioned methos, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to deny or accept the cookie feature as well as browser add-ons that can help you manage cookies and beacons while web browsing; however, you should note that cookies may be necessary to provide you certain features (e.g., customized delivery of information) available on the ASKK-POP site.

## Security

Your ASKK-POP account is password-protected. ASKK-POP tries very hard to protect our users' information. We use industry standard measures to protect your information that is stored within our database. We limit the access to your information to those employees who need access to perform their job function such as our customer service personnel. If you have any questions about the security at our website, please contact us. Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information, we cannot assure you that personally identifiable information that we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy.

Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy, we do not sell, rent, share, trade or give away any of your personal information. ASKK-POP will disclose information about individual users to governmental or judicial authorities or law enforcement agencies, or to other individuals or entities in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal processes.

We reserve the right to transfer your personal information in the event of a transfer of ownership of ASKK-POP, such as an acquisition by or merger with another company. In such an event, ASKK-POP will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

ASKK-POP will notify you when information about you may be provided to third parties in ways other than explained above, and you will have the option to prevent such information sharing.

You should be aware that when you voluntarily disclose personally identifiable information (e.g., user name, e-mail address) via comments, messages, forums, postings, or in other areas of the ASKK-POP network, that information, along with any substantive information disclosed in your communication, can be collected and correlated and used by third parties and may result in unsolicited messages from other posters or third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of ASKK-POP. Please do not post any personal information on the ASKK-POP site or in other areas that you expect to keep private.

As a registered ASKK-POP user, you can modify your personal information at any time by editing your "Profile".
