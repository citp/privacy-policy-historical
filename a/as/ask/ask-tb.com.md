These companies as well as data analytics companies who service them may collect information, such as your computer’s IP address, browser information, mobile device ID, and search queries, as you use our Services.

Some of our products, services and databases are hosted by third party hosting services providers. We also may use vendors for other projects, such as conducting surveys or organizing sweepstakes for us, that involve collection of information from our users. We may also use authorized service providers to process services on our behalf, such as processing service or financial transactions that you have requested.  We may share information about you with these vendors to enable them to perform their services.  
(4) We have contracts with all of these companies that prohibit them from sharing the information about you that they collect or that we provide to them with anyone else, or using it for other purposes.  
(5) We will not share information we collected about you with any third party for other purposes (including direct marketing) without first obtaining your consent.

**Security of the information we collect:**

We have implemented security measures to prevent unauthorized or unlawful access to and misuse of the information we collect, including technological and physical security measures as well as procedural safeguards. However, because no security system can be 100% effective, we cannot completely guarantee the security of any information we may have collected from or about you.

**Cookies, pixel tags and mobile device IDs:**

We use cookies, similar files and other technologies to collect and store the information we automatically collect about your computer, device, Service usage, to track traffic flow and patters of travel in connection with our Services.  If you install a Search Application, a unique cookie ID may be recorded for our uses, including internal reporting, optimization and to provide you with personalized content or advertisements and your search queries and interactions with our services may be associated with your unique cookie ID.  A cookie is a small text file that is stored on your computer. Our cookies enable us to recognize you (for example, as a registered user) when you visit our website and to store your preferences and settings. Cookies from advertising companies enable them to track your activity across various sites where they display ads and record your activities, so they can show ads that they consider relevant to you.

To understand more about cookies, click [here.](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/)

If you are using an Ask mobile application, we use your mobile device ID number to recognize you when you use the application and to store your preferences and settings. Advertising companies may also store your mobile device ID to show ads that they consider relevant to you in various mobile services that you use.

A pixel tag (also called a web beacon or clear GIF) is a tiny graphic with a unique identifier, embedded invisibly on a webpage (or an online ad or email), and is used to count or track things like activity on a webpage or ad impressions or clicks, as well as to access cookies stored on users’ computers.

Ask.com pixel tags are used to measure the popularity of our various pages and services. Advertising company pixel tags are used to measure the number of ad impressions and the performance of ads on our site, and to access the advertising company’s cookies placed on your computer. Data analytics company pixel tags are used to aggregate information about our advertising and your engagement with our site for market research, product improvement, revenue tracking and advertising optimization.

We use outside vendors to help us better understand our user demographics. They use technologies such as cookies and pixel tags in providing their services to us, but do not use them to target ads to you.

Third parties whose products or services are accessible or advertised through the Services, including social networking services, may also use cookies or similar tools, and we advise you to check their privacy policies for information about their cookies and other practices.  We do not control the practices of such partners and their privacy policies govern their interactions with you.  We encourage you to read their privacy policies.

Information from children under 13:**

We do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under 13. If we determine that a user is under 13, we will immediately delete all information pertaining to that user.

**Government authorities and legal rights:**

If requested or required by government authorities, such as law enforcement authorities, courts, or regulators, or otherwise to comply with the law, we may disclose any information we have about our users or modify other practices described in this policy, such as how long and in what form we keep information. We also may disclose information collected about you in order to exercise or protect legal rights or defend against legal claims.
