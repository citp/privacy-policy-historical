        <p><i>(Effective June 13, 2017)</i><br>

            <b>Privacy Policy</b><br>

            <b>Last Updated On: June 13, 2017</b></p>
        At Ask.com, we respect your privacy, and we understand the importance of the information you entrust to us. This
        Privacy Policy describes our practices concerning the information collected by the Ask family of companies
        consisting of IAC Publishing, LLC., APN, LLC and Mindspark Interactive Network, Inc. (“Ask”, “we”, “us”, “our”)
        through the use of (i) our websites (the “Site”), (ii) our Ask mobile applications and (iii) “Search
        Applications,” a search box on an application or site from which you can access our search services,
        specifically provided by APN, LLC and/or Mindspark Interactive Network, Inc. (collectively the “Services”).<p></p>

        <p>Below we describe what information we collect when you use our Services, how we protect that information, how
            long we retain it, with whom we share it, and what your privacy options are. By using the Services, you
            consent to our collection and use of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

        <p>We will continue to evaluate this Privacy Policy against new technologies, business practices, and our user's
            needs, and may make changes to the Privacy Policy accordingly. Please check this page periodically for
            updates. If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will post the updated Privacy Policy
            here, along with its effective date, and notify you by email or by means of a notice on our Site. Your
            continued use of the Services after our posting of changes to this Privacy Policy means that you agree to be
            bound by such changes.</p>

        <p><b>1. What information do we collect about you? </b><br>

            We explain below the main ways that we collect and process information about you.</p>

        <p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Information You Provide To Us:</span></b></p>

        <p>Your use of the Services may require registration, in which case we will ask you to provide certain personal
            information, including an email address, username, and password. You may also decide to provide us with some
            optional demographic information to enhance your profile, such as your country of residence, home address,
            education, interests, and communications preferences.
        </p>

        <p>You may also provide personal information to us, if you choose to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>sign up to receive any additional services or request to receive certain communications from us;</li>
            <li>submit a help request, a customer services inquiry or other inquiry to us, or fill in any other forms
                for the purposes of receiving our Services;
            </li>
            <li>participate in some of the features accessible via the Services (for example, message boards, chat
                groups, social networking, games, surveys, polls, promotions, contests, or sweepstakes);
            </li>
            <li>contact us about employment opportunities posted to the Services; or
            </li>
            <li>otherwise use the Services in a manner that you have requested.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Depending on which of these or any other Services you use, the personal information you provide may include
            your name, email address, user name, home address, telephone number, information posted by you on sites
            accessed via the Services. Also, if you choose to login to a product or feature accessed via a social
            networking site including through a Search Application, you are granting us permission to access and use
            information about you provided by the social network. For example, if you use a social network feature to
            login to a product accessed through a Search Application, per such social network’s policies, they may
            provide us access to you and your friends names, pictures, genders, user Ids, connections and any content
            shared using an “Everyone” or similar privacy setting. Please be aware, that by posting information to
            message boards, chat groups or social networking facilities available via the Services, you will be making
            this information available to other users of these Services to the public. You should be careful about
            revealing any sensitive details about yourself.
        </p>

        <p><b>3.How do we share the information we collect?</b></p>

        <ul>
            <li><b><i> Our suppliers, subcontractors and business partners (“service providers”):</i>
            </b>We may share your data with our services providers who process your personal information to provide

            </li>

            </li>
            <li><b><i>Our Search Application partners:</i></b><i> </i>If you have installed and/or use a Search
                Application, our Search Application partners may collect / receive information about you including the

        <p><b>4. Cookies and Online Advertising:</b></p>

        <p><b>Cookies.</b> We use cookies, pixel tags, web beacons and other such similar technologies to collect and
            store the information we automatically collect about your computer, device and Service usage. A cookie is a
            small text file that is stored on your computer and a pixel tag (also called a web beacon or clear GIF) is a
            tiny graphic with a unique identifier, embedded invisibly on a webpage (or an online ad or email). We use
            the term “cookies” in this policy to refer to cookies and all such similar technologies.
        </p>

        <p>There are two broad categories of cookies: (1) first party cookies, served directly by us to your computer or
            mobile device, and (2) third party cookies, which are served by a third party on our behalf. Cookies have a
            lot of jobs. For example, our cookies enable us to recognize you (e.g. as a registered user) when you visit
            our website and to store your preferences and settings. We use third party cookies for functionality,
            performance / analytics, advertising and social media purposes. Cookies from advertising companies, for
            example, help to ensure that the advertisements you see online are more relevant to you and your interests.

        <p><b>Online Behavioral Advertising and Mobile.</b> Advertisers and advertising networks place ads (including

            as data analytics companies who service them, may use cookies, pixel tags, mobile device IDs and other

            track your activity across various sites where they display ads and record your activities, so they can show
            ads that they consider relevant to you. You may opt-out of receiving targeted online advertising from

        <p>If you are using an Ask mobile application, we use your unique mobile device ID number to recognize you when
            you use the application and to store your preferences and settings. Advertising companies may also use and
            store your mobile device ID to show ads that they consider relevant to you in various mobile services that
            you use.
        </p>
        <p>If you are using an iOS device and you do not want to receive tailored in-application ads that relate to your

        <p><b>Mobile Device Location Information.</b> When you use one of our location-enabled services (for example,
            when you access Services from a mobile device), we may need to collect and process information about your
            actual GPS location (including the latitude, longitude or altitude of your mobile device) and the time the
            location information was recorded. Some of these services require your personal data for the feature to work
            and we may associate location data with your device ID and other information we hold about you. We keep this
            data for no longer than is reasonably necessary for providing our services. If you wish to use the
            particular feature, you will be asked to consent to your data being used for this purpose. You can withdraw
            your consent at any time by disabling the relevant feature. If you do not want your location information
            collected when you use the Services from a mobile device, please follow these instructions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If you are using an Apple device, click on “General,” then “Reset,” then “Reset Location and Privacy.”
                This will turn off location functionality for all of your apps so that the next time you download or use
                an app, you will be asked again to provide your consent for us and others to access your location
                information.
            </li>
            <li>If you are using an Android device, visit device settings, click “Location,” and then click the boxes
                for the particular applications for which you would like to disable location services.
            </li>
            <li>If your device changes the above methods of disabling the collection of mobile device location, please
                contact your device manufacturer or platform provider to determine how to disable the collection of this
                information.

        <p><b>Do Not Track.</b> Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers.
            DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their
            webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services.</p>
        <p>We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our website for
            third party purposes, and that is why we provide the Network Advertising Initiative and the Digital
            Advertising Alliance opt-out links above. However, we do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT
            signals, as the Internet industry is currently still working toward defining exactly what DNT means, what it
            means to comply with DNT, and a common approach to responding to DNT.
        </p>
        <p><b>6. How do we keep the information we collect secure? </b></p>

        <p>We take the security of your personal information seriously and use appropriate technical and organizational
            measures to protect your personal information against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against
            accidental loss, destruction or damage. We also limit access to personal information about you to employees
            who reasonably need access to it to provide products or services to you, or in order to do their jobs.
            However, because no security system can be 100% effective, we cannot completely guarantee the security of
            any information we may have collected from or about you.
        </p>

        <p><b>7. How long do we keep the information we collect?</b></p>

        <p>We retain the information we collect about and from you for as long as necessary to fulfill a business
            purpose or comply with a legal request. We may also choose to anonymize certain of the information you
            provide to us so that it can no longer be attributed to you if we would like to retain it for longer periods
            of time.
        </p>

        <p><b>8. Children under 13</b></p>

        <p>The Services are not intended for users under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any personal
            information from children under 13. If we become aware that a person submitting information is under 13, we
            will attempt to delete the information as soon as possible. You hereby represent that you are at least 13.
        </p>

        <p><b>9. Consent to Transfer of Information </b></p>

        <p>If you are visiting the Services from outside the United States, your data will be transferred to and stored
            in our servers in the U.S. By using the Services, you consent to our collection and use of your data as
            described in this Privacy Policy.

        <p>Following a recent ruling by the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ), users of our web search and

            following a web search for the user's name.</p>
        <p>If you would like to request the removal of a search result generated using your name as the search term,
            <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and the law of your jurisdiction requires us to honor that request,</span>
            please send your request in writing to the address set forth under Section 5. To assist us in processing
            your request in timely manner, please make your request in English if you are able to do so. Your request
            should include any information relevant to your request, including, without limitation: (i) your name, email
            and postal address; (ii) the URL (i.e., "web address") for each link that you are requesting to be removed;
            (iii) a brief explanation of why you believe such results should be removed; and (iv) an explanation as to
            why the contents of the link you wish to have removed relate to you.</p>
        <p>To help us prevent fraudulent removal requests, please also include a legible copy of a document that
            verifies your identity. You need not provide a government-issued document; a utility bill or similar mailing
            will suffice. You may also obscure parts of the document such as identifying numbers so long as the document
            continues to clearly identify you. If you are requesting the removal of search results that contain
            photographs of you, please ensure that the identifying document includes your photograph. If you are making
            the request on behalf of another person, please indicate your relationship to that person and provide
            evidence of your authority to make such request. All requests for removal will be reviewed by Ask.com’s
            legal and compliance team and we reserve the right, in compliance with applicable laws, to accept or reject,
            or make further inquiries regarding, any requests.</p>
