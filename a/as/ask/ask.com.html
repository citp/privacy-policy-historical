						<p><b>Privacy Philosophy</b> </p>
						<p> Ask Jeeves Inc., producer of the Ask Jeeves and Ask Jeeves for 
							Kids Web sites, believes that online privacy is crucial for the 
							ongoing success of the Internet as a service, commercial and entertainment 
							medium. We collect personal information from you primarily to make 
							using the Ask Jeeves services easier and more satisfying. In registering 
							for certain services offered by Ask Jeeves you may be asked to provide 
							your name, e-mail address, zip code, gender and information about 
							what you do and don't like. We request this information from you 
							so that we can provide you with the personalized service necessary 
							to meet Ask Jeeves' goal of humanizing the Internet. However, unless 
							you designate otherwise, the personally identifiable information 
							you provide will be known only to you and to Ask Jeeves. We will 
							always ask you before providing this information to anyone else. 
							If others want this information, including your name or your email 
							address, we will provide it only if you give us permission to do 
							so. </p>
						<p> From time to time, Ask Jeeves may introduce new products and services 
							to its users. To the extent these new products and services affect 
							this policy, this policy will be updated and you will be informed 
							of these updates and any privacy conditions related to these services. 
						</p>
						<p> <b><a name="infoTracked">What information does Ask Jeeves 
							gather/track and how is it used?</a></b><a name="infoTracked"> </a></p><a name="infoTracked">
						<p> Information gathered online can generally be categorized as either 
							anonymous or personally identifiable. Anonymous information is information 
							that cannot be traced back to a specific individual. For example, 
							Ask Jeeves knows how many questions are asked each day at each of 
							its Web sites but does not know the names, e-mail addresses or gender 
							of the people asking the questions. </p>
						<p> Personally identifiable information is information you provide 
							that lets us know specific facts about you so that we can customize 
							the information Ask Jeeves delivers to you accordingly. This information 
							can include your name, address, zip code, age, etc. For example, 
							when you provide your home zip code when you register for Personal 
							Jeeves, Ask Jeeves is able to provide you with weather forecasts 
							for your hometown. It is our belief that you will find it beneficial 
							to provide us with personal information so that your experience 
							with Ask Jeeves is more satisfying. </p>
						<p> <b>Gathering and Use of Anonymous Information</b><br>
							Each time a visitor comes to an Ask Jeeves Web site, we collect 
							some information to improve the overall quality of the online experience, 
							including product monitoring, product improvement, and targeted 
							advertising. At the Ask Jeeves Web sites, we collect the visitor's 
							domain name (e.g. whether the user is logged on from compaq.com 
							or whitehouse.gov), referral data (e.g., we record the address of 
							the last URL a user visited prior to clicking through to an Ask 
							Jeeves Web site), and browser and platform type (e.g., a Netscape 
							browser on a Macintosh platform). </p>
						<p> In addition to collecting these types of information, Ask Jeeves 
							collects aggregate queries for internal reporting and targeted advertising. 
							We also count, track, and aggregate the visitor's activity into 
							our analysis of general traffic flows at our sites (e.g. tracking 
							where traffic comes from, how traffic flows within the Ask Jeeves 
							properties, etc.). To these ends, we may merge information about 
							you into group data, which may then be shared on an aggregated basis 
							with our advertisers; but Ask Jeeves will not disclose your individual 
							identity or personal data without your permission. When Ask Jeeves 
							does present aggregated information to outside companies, no one 
							will be able to identify or contact you. </p>
						<p> <b>Gathering and Use of Personally Identifiable Information</b> 
							<br>
							Ask Jeeves requests that registrants for its Personal Jeeves service 
							provide personal information so that we can provide personalized 
							service. As we have already stated, personally identifiable information 
							is not shared with third parties unless Ask Jeeves has your permission 
							to do so. In addition, Ask Jeeves occasionally sponsors sweepstakes, 
							contests, or other events that require the collection, processing, 
							and storage of individual contact and demographic information to 
							be used for the event. Ask Jeeves sometimes co-sponsors these events 
							with other companies, in which case the user's individual contact 
							and demographic information is likely to be shared with participating 
							sponsors. A registrant's personal contact and demographic information 
							will not be released to third-party or non-participating organizations 
							without the user's consent, and Ask Jeeves will request that co-sponsors 
							of such events maintain the privacy of the registrants' information. 
						</p>
						<p> When appropriate, users will be given the opportunity to receive 
							information from third-party organizations in connection with services 
							or events offered by Ask Jeeves. This option may be made available 
							through Ask Jeeves' registration and/or through registration processes 
							maintained by a participating third party. In all cases, you will 
							be informed before you register for the event or service that a 
							third party will be receiving the registration information you provide 
							and you will have the option not to participate in any service or 
							event that requires third party involvement. </p>
						<p> <b>Use Of Ask Jeeves Cookies</b> <br>
							Ask Jeeves' Web sites use cookies to track traffic flow and patterns 
							of travel within and through the sites. Cookies are a standard Internet 
							technology that allow us to both store and retrieve login information 
							on a user's system. Our Web server automatically asks a new user 
							whether his or her browser will agree to accept an Ask Jeeves cookie 
							file. If a visitor accepts, our Web server will identify the user's 
							cookie for Ask Jeeves' use in internal reporting. If a user accepts 
							an Ask Jeeves cookie, but would later like to remove it from his 
							or her computer, he or she can just remove it from the browser.

						<p> <b>Demographic Information</b> <br>
							When we do present information to our advertisers, it is in the 
							form of grouped statistics compiled from our users' answers to survey 
							questions and on-site behavior. Ask Jeeves will not disclose the 
							contact or demographic information of any individual user to advertisers 
							or any other outside organization without the express permission 
							of the individual. </p>
						<p> <b>User Research</b> <br>
							On occasion, Ask Jeeves will make available to potential advertisers 
							and research firms aggregated results from research it has conducted 
							on its user base. Once again, Ask Jeeves will only provide such 
							demographic information on an aggregated basis and does not disclose 
							individual member profiles without user consent. </p>
						<p> <b>Special Policy With Regards to Information from Children Under 
							Thirteen</b> <br>
							In accordance with the Federal Children's Online Privacy Protection 
							Act of 1998 (COPPA), Ask Jeeves will never knowingly request personally 
							identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without 
							parental consent. When we do receive information (with parental 
							consent) from users under the age of 13, we will never voluntarily 
							share their personally identifiable information with third parties, 
							regardless of their stated preference given at registration. </p>
