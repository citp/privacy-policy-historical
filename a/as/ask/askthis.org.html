<p>Inuvo®, Inc. and its subsidiaries ("Inuvo" or "we") takes consumer privacy seriously. We are committed to following industry standards, best practices and guidelines relating to the use of consumer information and privacy. </p><br>
<p>This privacy policy is intended to inform consumers about the way we use and protect the information we collect about customers and users. Information is collected by us through our website www.inuvo.com, through other Inuvo owned and operated websites, and across our various Advertising Technology Platforms.</p><br>
<b>INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE</b><br>
<i>Personally Identifiable Information</i><br>
<p>Personally identifiable information ("PII") is data that identifies you personally, such as your name, address, telephone number, email address, or birth date. We do not collect PII from client websites via our Advertising Technology Platforms. We do, however, collect any data that you choose to share with us on our websites, such as signing up for newsletters or opting in to receive information from us. For example, you may choose to send us PII about yourself in an email or by completing an online form on one of our websites. We use this information to contact you to respond to an inquiry, and in some instances, certain parts of our websites require requested PII for you to participate in programs and services. Once collected, we will store your PII for a reasonable time for record-keeping purposes and promotional marketing efforts.</p><br>
<p>We also collect PII on some of our websites when you sign up as an Account Holder. Account Holders include both Advertisers and Publishers who have been qualified and approved for access to an Inuvo Advertising Technology Platform, or Consumers who have created an account to access one of our ecommerce websites. Account Holder information collected includes PII necessary to conduct business including, but not limited to, account holder name, phone number, email address, and/or tax ID number. Payments made to and/or from Inuvo require the provision of and specified collection of additional PII which may include, but is not limited to, bank account information and credit card numbers. Phone, facsimile, email and/or cell numbers may be used to contact Account Holders as needed.</p><br>
<p>All Account Holder information collected is maintained in a password-protected environment. This information is used for client/customer service, media delivery, contact, billing-payables and receivables and/or other reporting purposes. Account Holders may change, update or add additional information about themselves online through our various Inuvo web sites.</p><br>
<b>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</b><br>
<p>We also collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information (Non-PII) via our websites and our various Advertising Technology Platforms. Non-PII cannot be used to contact any single person or entity.</p><br>
<p>* Cookies. We use "cookies." The cookies we place on yoru computer are very small text files that uniquely identify your browser and may be sent to your computer or mobile device. They are stored on your hard drive and communicate to our servers only when you are visiting our websites or a Client website utilizing one of our Advertising Technology Platforms. You are always free to decline cookies. You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, erase cookies or notify you when a cookie is set. For more information about cookies and web beacons, visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org/cookies/.</p>
<p>* Device Information. We collect information regarding the Internet browser, computer, tablet, mobile phone, smartphone or other device utilized to access our websites or Advertising Technology Platforms.</p>
<p>* Internet Protocol Addresses. Internet browsers automatically transmit information such as the URL of the website you just came from and the Internet Protocol (IP) address and the browser version of your computer. </p>
<p>* Location Information. On some of our mobile applications we may (or may enable a third party to) request your geolocation information. If allowed, we (or the third party) may use this information to supply you with location specific advertisements, offers and functionality. Additionally, we may (or may enable a third party to) capture geolocation information (such as IP address data) when you access our websites or via our Advertising Technology Platforms, and may use that geo-location information to targets ads, offers and functionality.</p>
<p>* Analytics. We use third party information, reports and analysis about the usage and browsing patterns of Internet users. We allow the third party analytics companies to include web beacons and cookies on certain of our websites and in some of our Advertising Technology Platforms. The collected information includes search terms, search parameters, click-throughs by users, and other similar information. </p>

<p>We use Non-PII for five basic purposes. The first is to improve and customize the content and advertisements on our websites, this includes items such as ensuring our sites and content are viewable and in the appropriate language. The second is to "frequency cap" ad campaigns that we administer. Frequency capping controls the number of times you are exposed to an ad, which results in a better experience for you and the advertiser. The third way we use Non-PII is to serve appropriate promotions from advertisers if you have expressed an implied interest by visiting that advertiser's site (known as "retargeting"). The fourth way is for Interest-Based Advertising (IBA), which uses consumer data to infer intent. We retain this data for 60 days, after which the data is aggregated and maintained for an additional two years solely for reporting purposes. The fifth way we use Non-PII is for business purposes, such as data analysis, audits, record keeping, and contractual compliance. While we also use Non-PII in a limited fashion for the administration and operation of our websites, it used primarily to improve the overall quality of experience with the information we provide on our websites. </p><br>
