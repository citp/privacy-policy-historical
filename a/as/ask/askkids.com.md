# About Ask for Kids - Privacy Policy

Privacy Policy

  


**Ask for Kids** is a U.S. site hosted in the United States. Ask for Kids believes that maintaining the online privacy of children is essential to building a safe site where kids can learn and play. We provide the following privacy policy (the "Privacy Policy") in conformance with the 1998 Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA").

Please note that other sites controlled, owned or operated by IAC Search & Media or its affiliates - such as Ask.com and Ask.co.uk, among others - are governed by a different privacy policy even though they share the "Ask" brand. Please see the privacy policy linked from the home page of each such site for more information on the privacy practices on such site. Also, this Privacy Policy does not govern information collected through offline means in connection with the Ask for Kids site.

  
**1\. What personal information does Ask for Kids collect?**  
Ask for Kids does not collect visitors' personally identifiable information, nor does Ask for Kids require visitors to give personally identifiable information in order to access or use our site. Ask for Kids will not require a visitor to disclose more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in an activity as a condition of that participation. The Ask for Kids site contains links to other Web sites (including those of our advertisers) that may ask for personal information. Collection of personal information on other Web sites will be governed by the terms of that Web Site's privacy policy - not this Privacy Policy. Although we try to review such sites carefully, IAC Search & Media and Ask for Kids expressly disclaim any responsibility or liability for the privacy policies, data collection practices or regulatory compliance of those independent sites.

**2\. Does Ask for Kids use cookies?**  
Ask for Kids may track user visits and behavior on the site by placing a "cookie" (a small file) on your computer's hard drive or browser. The information we collect with cookies helps us make improvements in site navigation and content so we can serve you better or more efficiently. Users can remove cookies from their computers if they want; the "Help" feature of your Internet Explorer®, Netscape® or other browser can show you how. If you choose to reject cookies, you may be unable to use certain functionality of the Ask for Kids site. The privacy policies of such advertisers - not this Privacy Policy \- will govern such activities. 

Ask for Kids occassionally uses advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. In the course of serving advertisements to our Web site, these companies may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser or use other technological tools to monitor visitor activity. For example, these companies may use information about your visit to our Web site in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you. Our privacy policy does not cover any use of information that a third-party ad server may collect from you. You can configure your Internet browser to prevent many such types of information gathering. If you would like more information about this practice, or would like to know your choices about not having such information used by these advertising companies, please click here: <http://www.networkadvertising.org/>

  
**3\. Does Ask for Kids collect aggregated information?**  
Ask for Kids collects statistics on which questions visitors ask and which responses they select. We may also collect statistics through a visitor survey. Ask for Kids does not ask for personally identifiable information in these surveys and will delete any personal information received from children. This information is gathered together (aggregated) so that individual visitors cannot be identified or distinguished from the whole. For example, we might know that 100 visitors asked about giraffes, but we do not know who those visitors were or who specifically asked about giraffes. This information helps us make editorial and design decisions to make Ask for Kids more helpful and even easier to use. In addition, we may use this information to help us target advertising or content for the site in general. We also may collect IP Addresses (which domain a visitor is logged on from), Referral Data (the address of the last URL a user visited prior to clicking through to Ask for Kids), Browser type (which browser is being used), Platform Type (whether a visitor uses Macintosh or Windows), and Traffic Flow (where a visitor spends their time while on the site) on our site, however these collected pieces of information do not consist of personally identifiable information concerning the visitor.

  
**4\. Does Ask for Kids offer electronic postcards?**  
From time to time we may offer electronic postcards, which allow visitors to create a card and email it to a friend. Visitors will be asked to provide their email address and that of the receiving friend. Ask for Kids will use these email addresses only for the purpose of sending the electronic postcard and will not collect or save such email address information. Any email addresses provided by users in connection with the electronic postcard feature will be deleted after use. 

  
**5\. Does Ask for Kids have a chat room?**  
No, Ask for Kids does not operate chat rooms.

  
**6\. Are questions posted to Ask for Kids private?**  
No, questions submitted to Ask for Kids are not private and may be available to others, or used by Ask for Kids for its marketing purposes, but will not be attributed to any particular user and, if made publicly available on the Ask for Kids site, will not include any personally identifiable information.

  
**7\. What rights do parents have regarding their child's personal information?**  
Ask for Kids will not collect, use or disclose personally identifiable information from a child without parental notification or without obtaining prior verifiable parental consent. At this time, no personally identifiable information is being collected. Should that change in the future, we will notify parents that we wish to collect information, post the fact that information is being collected, identify the type of information being collected, how it is collected and used by Ask for Kids, and others, obtain consent from parents in compliance with COPPA, and post the procedures for parents to follow to review the information. If personally identifiable information is collected, the parent can review the child's personally identifiable information, ask to have it deleted and refuse to allow any further collection or use of the child's information.

**  
8\. Sole Authorized Statement**  
This Privacy Policy is the sole authorized statement of Ask for Kids' practices with respect to the online collection of personally identifiable information via the Ask for Kids site and the usage of such collected information. Any summaries of this Privacy Policy generated by third-party software or otherwise (for example, in connection with the "Platform for Privacy Preferences" or "P3P") will have no legal effect, are in no way binding upon Ask for Kids, will not be relied upon in substitute for this Privacy Policy, and neither supersede nor modify this Privacy Policy.
