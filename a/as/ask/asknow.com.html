<p>
<strong>Our Use and Disclosure of Your Information.</strong>
<br>

However, by submitting that information to us you grant AskNow® the right to use that information for any legal purpose including, without limitation: a) effectuating a purchase from AskNow® that you make at the Website; b) marketing purposes, such as sharing your information with third-party advertisers; c) providing promotional offers to you by means of e-mail, text or sms advertising, direct mail marketing, pop-ups, pop-unders and/or online banner advertising; and d) for validation, suppression, content improvement and feedback purposes.
