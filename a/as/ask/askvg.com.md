# Privacy Policy - AskVG

We here at AskVG respect your privacy and we value your trust in us. Your privacy is of extreme importance to us and we are always committed to safeguarding it.

On this page we'll mention what personal information we collect and why we collect it, what rights you have over your data, what are cookies, what cookies we use, how can you disable or delete cookies, etc.

**Who we are**

AskVG is a technology website founded by Vishal Gupta who has been awarded with Microsoft MVP (Most Valuable Professional) award.

Our website address is: <https://www.askvg.com/>

**What personal data we collect and why we collect it  
**

AskVG.com does not collect any personally-identifiable information about you such as your name, address, phone number or email ID without your knowledge. When you provide your email ID while posting a comment or contacting us using contact page, we never share it with anyone. Your email ID will only be used for responding to your email or comment if requested and will never be made publicly available.

You can leave comments on this site and may do so completely anonymously. When you leave comments on the site, we collect the data shown in the comments form. You may (but don't have to) use your real email ID or name. We don't associate IP addresses with comments or store them.

**Who we share your data with**

We do not share or sell any personal data with anyone.

**How long we retain your data**

If you leave a comment, the comment, your name and email ID are retained indefinitely until we manually remove the older comments from our site to reduce database overhead. This is so we can recognize and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.

**What rights you have over your data**

If you have left comments, you can request to receive an exported file of the personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to us. You can also request that we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes. If you want to delete one or more comments made by you on article pages of this website due to privacy reasons, you can request us and we'll remove your comments within 24 hours. You can also ask us to change your name or email ID used for posting a comment and we'll change it as per request. Note that you'll need to provide your email ID to link data to you.

Similarly if you are subscribed to our email newsletter and want to unsubscribe, you can do that anytime by using the unsubscribe link given in the newsletter. You can also contact us to remove the subscription and we'll manually remove your newsletter subscription. Once you unsubscribe, your email address is removed and no email record will be kept.

**Where we send your data**

Visitor information such as IP address and comments are checked through our security mechanisms (firewall and automated spam detection service) for a legitimate interest to secure and protect this website from spam and hacking attempts and based on these check results, the user is allowed or denied to access this website.
