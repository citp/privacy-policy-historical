# AskBobRankin - Privacy Policy

In a nutshell... This website does not collect any personally identifying information, unless YOU choose to provide it -- such as when subscribing to an email newsletter, or making a purchase. 

Any information you provide is used only to provide the services described on this website. 

## Your Personal Information is Safe

Spam (unsolicited junk e-mail) is the bane of the Internet, and I hate it as much as you do. In fact, I have been quite active over the years educating readers about spam, where it comes from, and how to avoid it. We use a trusted email service provider to deliver our email newsletters. The only information retained by the service provider is your email address, your name (if provided), the date and time of your subscription, and the IP address from which you subscribed. 

I further protect privacy and e-mail security in general by requiring that new subscribers confirm their subscriptions. This prevents people from harassing others by subscribing them to something they may not want. When you submit an email subscription request, you will receive an automatic message asking you to confirm the subscription. You _must_ reply to this message before your subscription will be activated. And of course, you may always cancel your subscription at any time. 

If you order a physical product such as a book or CDROM disc, your mailing address will be used only for the purpose of delivering that product to you via USPS, Fedex, UPS or a similar delivery service. 

I will not sell or rent your email address or other personal information to any third party. The only exceptions would be the acquisition or sale of this website, or a court order compelling me to provide such data. (In case you're curious, that's never happened since I started publishing online in 1994.) 

## Editorial Mail

Email messages sent to this website, as well as comments posted here, are considered public statements and become the property of the publisher. Unless noted otherwise in the message itself, such messages may be published in whole or in part. Such publication may include your name and location (if provided), but will not include your e-mail address. 

## Security

This website has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. All information that we collect or store is accessible only by the publisher, and technical staff at our online service providers. 

## Logs

This website runs on a standard unix web server that logs visitor information such as the type of browser you are using, your IP address, time, date, and pages viewed. An IP address does NOT reveal the identify of a website visitor - it only reveals the identify of the visitor's Internet Service Provider. We use IP addresses to help diagnose possible problems encountered on our web server. Neither your email address nor any other personally identifiable information is stored in the server log. 

## Browser Cookies and Third-Party Advertisers

We use third-party companies to serve ads and collect non-personally identifiable information (e.g., the pages you visit, and which links you click, which ads you see and click on, and the categories of search terms you enter) when you visit our web site. These companies may use the information outlined above (which does NOT include your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. These companies often use a cookie or third party web beacon to collect this information. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, [click here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/). 

Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on this site. Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to users based on their visit to this and other sites on the Internet. Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the [Google ad and content network privacy policy](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html) page. 

We use [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/) to analyze our website traffic. 

The presence of third-party advertisements on this site should not be taken as an endorsement of those products or services.
