# DR. SEARS STORE PRIVACY POLICY

This privacy policy ("Policy") discloses the data collection and use practices of AskDrSears.com ("AskDrSears.com") in connection with the AskDrSears.com Web site (the "Web Site") and all associated AskDrSears.com products and services (the "AskDrSears.com Services"). 

AskDrSears.com will not directly inform you of any changes to the privacy policy which involve use of your personal information. If at anytime you are dissatisfied with our service to you or are in disagreement with our terms and conditions or privacy policy, you reserve the option to Opt-out of our website and future communication. AskDrSears.com may make non-significant changes to our privacy policy and may not notify our members if said changes do not pertain to the handling of personal information. 

**What Information We Collect/How We Use It**

We store and use the information you give us in accordance with the terms of this Policy. Our registration form (or registration information you provide our marketing partners if you joined AskDrSears.com though one of our partners) requests that you provide certain contact and profile information. That information includes but may not be limited to: name, address, email address. Additional information may include, but not be limited to, health and lifestyle information about you and your family such as marital status and household information (spouse, children, pets, etc.), ethnicity, education, income, occupation, purchasing habits, reading habits, insurance, height, weight, physical and mental health conditions and diseases, symptoms, treatments, medications, medical devices, vitamins, health habits, participation in research surveys and clinical trials.

In addition, we might receive information about you from outside sources and add it to your AskDrSears.com membership information. We do this to improve personalization of our services (for example, providing better newsletter content, advertising or special offers that we think will interest you). 

We also may collect information such as the identification of the server your computer is logged onto and whether you opened an AskDrSears.com e-mail delivered to you. We also may compare our customer list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending identical messages to our members. You can add and modify the information you have provided by sending an e-mail to [information@AskDrSears.com](mailto:information@AskDrSears.com) with your requested changes. 

We use all this information in five ways: 

  * to provide you with personalized information via electronic delivery, telemarketing and/or direct mail. These may include personalized offers from 3rd party sources. 
  * to send you targeted advertising via electronic delivery and/or direct mail;
  * to contact you for feedback and surveys via electronic delivery and/or direct mail;
  * to send you general and administrative information about your AskDrSears.com membership via electronic delivery and/or direct mail; and 
  * to provide your contact information to AskDrSears.com marketing partners whose offer(s) you have selected to receive in order for them to send you special offers via electronic delivery, telemarketing and direct mail. 

**Agents**

We employ other companies and individuals to perform certain functions on our behalf. Examples include sending direct and electronic mail, removing duplicate information from customer lists, analyzing data, and providing marketing analysis. These agents have access to member personal information as needed to perform their functions for AskDrSears.com.
