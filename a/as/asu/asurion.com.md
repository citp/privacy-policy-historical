When you perform certain transactions, you may give us information such as your name, address, driver's license, social security number, e-mail address and telephone number. We keep information about the types of services you purchase or otherwise obtain from us and our affiliates. Examples of this include premiums, account balances, and payment history. We also collect information using our websites, including information related to your activity while using our sites and information from online collecting devices known as "cookies" (see below).

As part of our services, we also use cookies. Many commercial Internet sites use cookies.
