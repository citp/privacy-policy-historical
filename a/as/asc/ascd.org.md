# ASCD Privacy Policy

ASCD Privacy Policy

  
Your Privacy: Overview

This privacy policy (this "Privacy Policy") tells you about the information that the Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development ("ASCD") and its affiliates and partners collect in connection with the operation of its websites (collectively, the "Site"), how the information is used and how you can access and correct certain information that we may collect.

Please note that this Privacy Policy applies only to information collected from you by ASCD via the Site and does not apply to information obtained or disclosed through offline correspondence or personal contacts with ASCD representatives. In addition, to the extent that you disclose, or you authorize ASCD to disclose, your information to other parties, whether they are vendors, service providers or other users of the Site, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the information disclosed to them. Additionally, the Site may contain links to other entities' websites that are not controlled or operated by ASCD. This Privacy Policy does not apply to such third party websites, and ASCD is not responsible for the content of such third party websites or the privacy practices of such third parties. Therefore, we encourage you to request and review the privacy policies of any third parties upon disclosing your information such parties or visiting such third party websites.

In addition, California residents have certain rights under state law related to the sharing of personal information with third parties for direct marketing purposes. ASCD has chosen to comply with California law SB 27 by providing a cost-free means to opt-out of disclosure of personally identifiable information for direct marketing purposes as described in the section titled "Choice and Opt-Out Preferences" below.

This Privacy Policy is effective as of March 31, 2006.

  
Collection of Your Personal Information

You can access some areas of the Site without submitting any personally identifiable information. ASCD collects personally identifiable information only if you choose to: (a) complete the online forms to register to become a member of ASCD, participate in any ASCD program, purchase products, sign up for seminars, tutorials, professional development programs, classes, polling panels, volunteer or leadership positions or other programs, subscribe to our newsletters or other publications, participate in our "What Works in Schools" and other surveys, report issues, or request information or assistance through the Site or (b) post any information on discussion groups, bulletin boards or forums on the Site including, without limitation, the WebBoard area of the Site. The personally identifiable information that ASCD collects through these portions of the Site includes your name, e mail address, address, telephone number and fax number. Under some circumstances we may also request and collect additional information that is necessary or appropriate for the completion of a transaction requested by you, such as credit card or banking information and billing address. We may also collect demographic data, including, without limitation, through our "What Works in Schools" site and other surveys.

All of the information that you provide on the Site is maintained by ASCD or service providers acting on behalf of ASCD. ASCD may also collect certain non-personally identifiable information in connection with the operation of the Site, including IP addresses, browser or operating system information, data on purchases, and the websites that you visit before or after you visit the Site. Such information is maintained by ASCD or service providers acting on behalf of ASCD.

  
Do We Employ "Cookies" Or Other Similar Technologies?

ASCD may use "cookies," log files, clear gifs or similar technologies on certain portions of the Site. ASCD does not use cookies to retrieve information that is unrelated to your visit or your interaction with the Site.

"Cookies" are small text files stored on your computer's hard drive. "Clear gifs" are small graphics files stored on your computer's hard drive that are similar in function to cookies. They allow ASCD to personalize your experience, provide specialized content and support to customers, record session information, recall visitor preferences and/or simplify the completion of online forms. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can use settings on your browser to disable or turn off cookies. If you choose to reject the cookies used by the Site, you may be unable to access certain areas of the Site, or your use of the Site may be degraded. "Log files" are files that store information such as internet protocol addresses, browser type, internet service provider, pages visited before or after the Site and similar demographic information for aggregate use to determine how the Site is used.

  
How We Protect Your Information

To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, maintain data accuracy and facilitate the appropriate use of information, ASCD uses physical, technological and administrative procedures to attempt to protect the personally identifiable information we collect through the Site. Nevertheless, Internet transmissions are never completely private or secure. You understand that any messages or information you send to the Site may be read or intercepted by others. If you have any questions about the security of personally identifiable information collected by ASCD, contact our Web Help team.

  
Use of Your Personally Identifiable Information

ASCD uses the personally identifiable information we collect about you to provide any products or services requested by you. Upon our collection of your personally identifiable information, ASCD may use such personally identifiable information internally, separately or in combination with pre-existing information, for the following purposes:

  * To provide any requested products or services, including, without limitation, membership services, seminars, professional development programs, tutorials, classes or other training services, books, subscriptions, polls, curricula or other products;
  * To troubleshoot problems with the Site, or any products or services, as requested;

Disclosure of Your Personally Identifiable Information

We may disclose your personally identifiable information to third parties, including, without limitation, service providers or vendors whose products and/or services have requested, as necessary or appropriate to provide such products or services to you. You acknowledge and agree that, by requesting such third-party products and/or services, you hereby authorize ASCD to disclose your personally identifiable information to such parties.

In addition, your username or user ID will be displayed when you use certain portions of the Site, including, without limitation, in connection with the WebBoard and any other discussion groups, bulletin boards or forums in which you participate. Other users may be able to view your username or user ID and the contents of any posts by you (collectively, your "User Posts"). Therefore, if you include any personally identifiable information in any of your User Posts, any other person or entity who accesses this Site may be able to identify you and your activities on this Site. In addition, we may disclose your personally identifiable information, including as part of working group lists, mailing lists and other directories, to leaders and/or other members of groups that you have elected to join or leaders and/or other participants in projects or initiatives in which you have elected to participate.

In addition, we may disclose your personally identifiable information to our subsidiaries or affiliates and to third party partners whom we occasionally hire to provide services on our behalf, including support services, website services, packaging, mailing and delivering promotional materials, shipping, answering customer questions about our services and new services. ASCD will only provide those partners with the personally identifiable information they need to deliver the services to us and/or on our behalf, and they will be contractually prohibited from using that information for any other purpose. In the event that ASCD is involved in a transaction such as a merger, stock purchase or sale, or sale of substantially all of ASCD's assets, your personal information may be transferred to the other party in such transaction.

We may also disclose your personally identifiable information to other third parties that we believe will be able to provide you with offers, valuable products, services or other information that may be of interest. Because such third parties may keep and use your information whether or not you purchase their products or use their services, your personal information will be subject to their privacy policies, and you should contact them directly for more information about their specific privacy policies.

We disclose aggregate information collected from our "What Works in Schools" site and other surveys to school administrators who have requested the data. Although this data does not include personally identifiable information, in some circumstances, school administrators may be able to identify the participants based on the information provided. For our policy on the use of the information gathered from the "What Works in Schools" site by school administrators, please see [www.whatworksinschools.org](http://www.whatworksinschools.org/). Further, from time to time, we may also disclose aggregate de-identified information about users of the Site to service providers, partners, advertisers or others, but such information will not include personally identifiable information.

We may collect User Posts, feedback, polls, survey responses or other information from you in connection with the Site, or about our services or the Site. By providing such content to us, you consent to our use, modification, copying, publication, display and / or distribution of such content at no compensation or other obligation to you. You acknowledge that all such content is owned by ASCD and is subject to our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/about_ascd/Terms_of_Use.aspx), and you consent to the publication, display or distribution of such content.

ASCD reserves the right to disclose your personally identifiable information if required to do so by law or legal process or otherwise requested by any law enforcement officer or agency acting under color of law. In addition, ASCD reserves the right to disclose your personally identifiable information based on the good faith belief that such action is necessary or appropriate to: (a) protect and defend the rights or property of ASCD, or (b) act in urgent circumstances to protect the safety or security of the public or of users of the ASCD's services and/or the Site.

  
Children's Privacy

Although the Site is intended for the use of adults, and is not of likely interest to children, the forms on the Site are capable of collecting online contact information from children who furnish it without prior parental consent or parental notification. ASCD does not intend to collect the personally identifiable information of children under the age of 13. Upon discovery that any such information has been supplied by children, ASCD will disregard and delete such information.

  
Identification and Passwords

In connection with any ASCD membership or certain other programs or services, you may choose, or we may issue to you a username, password or other similar access code. Certain of our vendors and partners may also issue to you and/or include in their communications with you usernames, passwords and other similar access codes. In order to protect the privacy of your personally identifiable information and to comply with the [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/about_ascd/Terms_of_Use.aspx), you must keep any such username, password or access code secret. You may not disclose your user name, password or access code to any third party, or allow any third party to access your account.

You acknowledge and agree that you are responsible for all actions taken using any username, user ID, login or other identifier (each, an "Identifier") or password selected by, or issued to, you in connection with the Site, including, without limitation, any fees charged to your account. You agree to notify ASCD immediately of any unauthorized use of any Identifier or password or any other breach of security of which you are aware by contacting our Web Help team, and you should immediately change your password. You may not use any Identifier or password that is not issued directly to you by ASCD or its authorized vendors or partners.

  
Your Use of the Information of Other Users

In order to protect the privacy of the personally identifiable information of others, you may not collect, use, disclose, publish, display, link to, or otherwise provide access to the personally identifiable information of any other person in connection with the Site without the express written permission of ASCD or through certain areas of the Site, including those titled "Refer a Colleague," "Tell A Friend" or "Send To A Friend."

  
Our Retention of Your Personally Identifiable Information

Once registered with the Site, the personally identifiable information that you provide will be stored and maintained by ASCD until you instruct us otherwise, or, in ASCD’s sole discretion, for the longer of: (a) for so long as is necessary or appropriate to carry out the purpose(s) for which such information was collected, and (b) for so long as we are required to maintain such information by law.

  
Choice and Opt-Out Preferences

ASCD does not collect your personally identifiable information unless you choose to provide it. You may "opt-out" of receiving further information about ASCD and third party products and services (other than support or other information that you specifically request by filling out the online forms to register your product or to request online support services) by checking the appropriate boxes on the online and other forms. If you are a member of ASCD, you may also manage your opt-out and other preferences online via the "MyASCD" link. If, at any time, you prefer not to receive further e mail communications from ASCD, you will have the ability to unsubscribe from such communications by means of a link provided in every broadcast e-mail that is sent to you by ASCD. If, at any time, you prefer not to receive any other form of communication from ASCD, you will have the ability to unsubscribe from such communications by e-mailing us.

  
Access and Accuracy

ASCD aims to keep your personally identifiable information as accurate as possible. You will have the opportunity to update and correct any of your personally identifiable information collected and maintained by ASCD by logging into the Site and entering any new information about yourself. You must promptly update your personally identifiable information if it changes or it is not accurate. You may change your password, email address and other contact information, financial and shipping information and user preferences by logging into the Site and selecting the appropriate options from our menus. As a general policy, ASCD will not modify your personally identifiable information upon request, although ASCD reserves the right to access, remove or modify such information in its sole discretion. ASCD further reserves the right to deny access to your personally identifiable information: (a) when such denial of access is required by law, (b) when granting you access is reasonably likely to negatively impact other people's privacy, (c) to protect ASCD's rights and property, and (d) when such requests are frivolous or made in bad faith.

  
Your Acceptance of This Privacy Policy and Revisions to This Privacy Policy

By using the Site and providing us with your information, you agree to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, you may not use the Site. ASCD reserves the right, in our discretion, to change, modify, add or remove portions of this Privacy Policy at any time and from time to time, without prior notice to you.
