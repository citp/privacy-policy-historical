The information we collect about you and how we collect it varies depending on many factors, including: the products and services that you use and subscribe to, how you have used the products and services, your browser settings, and what we have obtained from a third-party with permission to share it with us.

In addition to the above use cases, we may lawfully process your personal information for the following purposes:

_Use of Third Party Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies_

The Website makes use of automatic data collection technologies including first and third-party Cookies, log files, Web Beacons, Pixels, dynamic tags, and/or other technical means (we refer to these collectively as “ **Cookies** ”). We may use these technologies to collect information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or other online services to deliver content and advertising tailored to your interests, both on the Website and on third-party websites (including but not limited to search engines and social media websites). This practice is commonly known as “Online Behavioral Advertising.”

The third parties who provide us with third-party Cookies, may use these technologies to collect information about you when you use the Website to provide you with advertising based on your visit to the Website or to collect impressions data regarding the efficacy of advertising placed with us. Third parties may have the ability to link the information they collect about you when you use the Website with other information they collect about you elsewhere on the Internet or information about the device you are using. Third parties may also collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites and other online services or mobile devices and may use this information to provide you with Online Behavioral Advertising or other targeted content. 

We encourage you to research and learn about Cookies and other technical means through which information about you may be collected through the websites you visit. See also, Section 7.E and Section 10 of this Privacy Policy to learn how you can act to control the use of Cookies on your browser or device.

_Disclosure of Information to Third-Party Vendors and Service Providers_

ASCO has engaged third-party vendors and service providers to provide services in connection with the Website, outreach for our programs and services, and to help us manage our web presence and improved performance. We may share personally identifiable information or “PII” or other information with these third-party vendors and service providers as necessary so that they may provide the services for which they have been engaged. PII and other information submitted to ASCO through Third Party Managed Pages are also shared with the relevant third-party vendor as necessary for completing authorized transactions. For additional information on “PII” see Section 13, Glossary.

  * In addition, some of the content and services on the Website, including advertisements, are served by third parties, including advertisers, ad networks and servers, content providers, and technology and application providers. 
  * Some of our advertisers may participate in the Facebook/Nielsen program, which helps advertisers improve their measurement of advertising effectiveness. If you are a Facebook user and access a page on our site containing an ad from a participating advertiser, you can learn more about this program and find out how to opt out here: <https://www.facebook.com/help/> and here: <http://www.nielsen-online.com/privacy.jsp?section=leg_scs>.



_Social Networking_

ASCO may maintain a presence on third-party social networking sites such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, and others. ASCO does not control or have responsibility for the collection, tracking, use, or disclosure of your information (including your PII, NPI and Web Information) gathered through these social networking sites, including through the ASCO pages or profiles within those sites, or otherwise because of your participation in social networking sites. Third-party social networking sites may have the ability to link the information they collect about you when you use the Website with other information they collect about you elsewhere on the Internet, including but not limited to your PII, NPI, Website information, or information about the device you are using. Third-party social networking sites and advertisers on these sites, including on the ASCO pages or profiles within these sites, are not obligated to follow or apply this Privacy Policy or the Terms of Use. If you have any questions about an advertisement or other targeted content, you should contact the responsible social networking provider directly.

_Research and Analytics_

We use a variety of analytics methods including what is commonly referred to as “big data analytics”. Big data analytics are mathematically driven analysis techniques on large and varied data sets to uncover hidden patterns and trends. We may create de-identified or anonymous data from PII by removing data components (e.g., name, email address, or linkable tracking ID) that makes the data personally identifiable to you or through obfuscation or through other means. Our use of de-identified or anonymized data is not subject to GDPR or this Privacy Notice.

Analytics are used to, for example:

  * Conduct market research and carry out research and statistical analysis including to monitor how members use our networks, products and services;
  * Frame our marketing campaigns and personalization efforts; and,
  * Provide reports to third parties (such reports do not contain information which may identify you as an individual).



**8\. How we share your personal information**

Where applicable, we share information about you with:

  1. Subsidiaries and corporate affiliates, including Conquer Cancer, CancerLinQ, and QOPI Certification Program;
  2. Partners, suppliers, and agents involved in delivering the products and services you’ve ordered or used, or the benefits attendant to those products and services (e.g., member benefits);
  3. Companies who are engaged to perform services for, or on behalf of, ASCO or its affiliates;
  4. Law enforcement agencies, government bodies, regulatory organizations, courts or other public authorities if we must, or are authorized to by law; and
  5. A third party or body where such disclosure is required to satisfy any applicable law, or other legal or regulatory requirement.



_Promotional Offers from ASCO and Third Parties_

When you register, you may be asked whether you want to receive special announcements and future communications by email. If you check “yes” but change your mind at any time in the future and no longer wish to receive correspondence by email, you will be able to opt-out of these services. See Section 10, “Your rights and user restrictions”, below.

_Cookies_

You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser Cookies, delete Cookies after a time, or alert you when Cookies are being sent. Your browser can be set to reject all Cookies and you can clear Cookies at any time. If you disable or refuse Cookies, then some parts of the Website may not function properly or may be inaccessible. Various third parties provide additional tools to assist you in managing your own preferences regarding Cookies and digital advertising.

_Surveys_

We occasionally survey visitors to our Website. Survey responses are used in aggregated, de-identified form to help us understand the needs of our visitors so that we can improve our site. The information may be shared on a de-identified and/or aggregated basis with third parties with whom we have a business relationship. While you may always decline to share personal information, if survey respondents provide personal information (e.g., personal email) in a survey, it is shared only with those people who need to see it to respond to the question or request, or with third parties who perform data management services for our Website, product or service. Those third parties have agreed to keep all data from surveys confidential.

_IP addresses_

The Web server automatically collects the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computers that access our site. By itself, an IP address merely indicates which computer sent a query, which is not PII. Only when correlated with information like user logs, query patterns, and other contextual information do IP addresses convert to PII. Typically, we use this information in aggregate form to understand how our Website or advertisements are being used and to analyze how we can better serve visitors. See Section 13, Glossary, for additional information on PII.

_Oncology Career Center_

Because the [Oncology Career Center™](http://careercenter.asco.org/) is a career site, it gives job seekers the option of posting their resumes to our database. There are two ways to post a resume.

_Non-Searchable Submission_

You can store your resume in our database but elect to exclude your resume from searches by potential employers. Excluding your resume from database searches means that you can use it to apply for and respond to individual job postings, but employers will not have the ability to search it.

_Searchable Submission_

You will have the option to allow your resume to be searchable by potential employers. Selecting this option permits all parties with access to our searchable resume database to have access to your resume. You may remove your resume from the database and change the status of the resume from searchable to non-searchable, and vice-versa, at any time by updating your profile page on the Oncology Career Center™. We cannot and do not guarantee that third parties will not, without our or your consent, gain access to our resume database. You hereby expressly: (a) acknowledge that registered employers and other third parties who gain access to the database with or without our or your consent may retain a copy of your resume, even if you subsequently change the status to non-searchable; and, (b) agree that in no event shall ASCO be responsible or liable for the retention, use, duplication, distribution, or privacy of resumes in these instances.

_Event Management_

ASCO also uses certain data elements to conduct event management, event data services and for crime prevention efforts. These use cases include:

  * Sharing with event co-sponsors
  * Sharing with third parties involved in the event process (e.g., hotel booking companies)
  * Potentially sharing with exhibitors at the event through badge scanning onsite at the event. You would physically present your badge for scanning. Attendee Lists and Exhibitor Email applications allow event exhibitors to send you email/direct mail. These applications generally do not allow exhibitors direct access to your contact information.
  * When you visit our premises or events, we may also collect information about you on CCTV as part of our security and crime prevention measures.



Once your data has been shared with a third party, ASCO no longer has direct control over that information, but we require our partners to agree to follow GDPR.

**9\. Keeping your personal information secure**

Access to data and technology relating to user information is password-protected and limited to authorized personnel and those vendors that require access to the information in order to furnish services to ASCO and our customers. In addition, ASCO uses industry standard technology to keep users’ information secure while residing on ASCO’s servers. We have specialized security teams who regularly review and improve our measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, accidental loss, disclosure, or destruction.

Communications over the internet (such as e-mails) are not secure unless they have been encrypted. Your communications may go through several countries before being delivered, as this is the nature of the Internet. We cannot accept responsibility for any unauthorized access or loss of personal information that is beyond our control.

**We will never ask for your secure personal or account information by an unsolicited means of communication**. You are responsible for keeping your personal and account information secure and not sharing it with others.

Our Website may provide links to third-party websites. We cannot be responsible for the security and content of such third-party websites. Please be sure to read that company’s privacy and cookies policies before using or putting your personal information on their site. The same applies to any third-party websites or content you connect to using our products and services.

You may choose to disclose your information in certain ways such as social plug-ins (including those offered by Google, Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest) or using third-party services that allow you to post reviews or other information publicly, and a third party could use that information.  **Social plug-ins and social applications are operated by the social network themselves and are subject to their own terms of use and privacy and cookies policies.**

**10\. Your rights and user restrictions**

_How to Lodge a Complaint_

If you want to contact us about any of your rights or complain about how we use your information, contact our Customer Services team or email us at [customerservice@asco.org](mailto:customerservice@asco.org).

_Right to erasure_  
ASCO strives to only process and retain your data for as long as we need to. In certain circumstances, you have the right to request that we erase personal data of yours that we hold. If you feel that we are retaining your data longer than we need, it is worth first checking that your contract with ASCO has been terminated, which you can do with Customer Services. If your contract with ASCO has been terminated, then we may still have lawful grounds to process your personal data.

**13\. Glossary**

**Cookie (or browser cookie)**. A small data file that is stored on the computer you use to view a website. Cookies are placed by that site (“ **first party** ”) or by a third party with a presence on the site (“ **third party** ”), such as an advertiser using a Web Beacon, and are generally accessed only by the party or site that placed the Cookie on the computer. Cookies may contain pieces of PII. Cookies often are used to make the site easier to use. For example, if you check a box to ask that we store your Username on your computer so that you don’t have to enter it each time you visit the site, that information is stored in a Cookie on your computer. Cookies may be persistent (saved on your device even after you close your Browser) or non-persistent (deleted when you close your Browser). Cookies may be “essential” for the use of a website (e.g., session-id cookies, authentication cookies, or user-centric security cookies), or “non-essential” e.g., third-party advertising cookies or other tracking cookies. As used in this Privacy Policy, the term “Cookies” also refers to Web Beacons and Pixels.

**Non-Personal Information (“NPI”)**. Information that may relate to an individual but does not by itself identify that individual. For example, browser information is Non-Personal Information, as is information such as gender, age, city, and physical location, when not linked with other PII. NPI may be “re-identified” through certain processes by linking it to PII relating to the same individual

**Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”)**. Any representation of information that permits the identity of an individual to whom the information applies to be reasonably inferred by either direct or indirect means. Further, PII is defined as information: (i) that directly identifies an individual (e.g., name, address, SSN or other identifying number or code, telephone number, email address, etc.) or (ii) by which an organization intends to identify specific individuals in conjunction with other data elements, i.e., indirect identification. (These data elements may include a combination of gender, race, birth date, geographic indicator, ASCO Member ID and/or other descriptors). Additionally, information permitting the physical or online contacting of a specific individual is the same as PII. This information can be maintained in any form.

**Web Beacons** or **Pixels** (also often referred to as “clear GIFs,” “pixel tags,” “1-by-1 GIFs,” “Single-Pixel GIFs,” “1 x 1 Pixels” or “clear Pixels”). Pages of the website and our e-mails may contain small electronic files known as web beacons that permit us and/or third parties to collect Web Information during your visit to the Website. For example, Web Beacons may be used to count the number of users who have visited a page or opened an e-mail and for other related website statistics (for example, recording the popularity of certain website content and verifying system and server integrity). Web Beacons send information back to their home server (which can belong to the host site, a network advertiser, or some other third party) from the users’ Browser, such as the IP address, the URL of the page on which the beacon is located, the type of Browser that is accessing the site, and information stored in any Cookies on the users’ computer previously placed by that server. Web Beacons can also be used to place a Cookie on the users’ Browser. Third parties who provide us with web beacons or pixels may have the ability to link the information they collect about you when you use the Website with other information they collect about you elsewhere on the Internet, including but not limited to your PII or information about the device you are using.
