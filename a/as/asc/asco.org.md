**1\. Introduction**

**American Society of Clinical Oncology, Inc.** (hereafter “ **ASCO** ,” “ **we** ,” or “ **us** ” or “ **our** ”) has worked hard to bring you an informative and user-friendly Website that is sensitive to concerns about privacy. We have designed this Privacy Policy to explain how and when ASCO collects, uses, and safeguards the information you provide and that we collect through our Website.

By using, accessing, or becoming a Registered User of the Website, you consent to our collection, use, and disclosure of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

This Privacy Policy applies to information you provide to us or that we collect automatically:

  * When you visit the Website.
  * Through email, text, and other electronic messages or communications between you and the Website or ASCO.
  * When you interact with Website content or applications that may link to or be accessible from or on the Website and that are provided or managed by a third-party, if that content or application includes a link to this Privacy Policy.



This Privacy Policy does not apply to information:

  * We collect offline or through any other means not referred to above; or
  * Collected through our mobile applications, which provide dedicated non-browser based interaction between you and ASCO. Our mobile applications are governed by a separate Mobile Application Privacy Policy, available when you download each application.



This Privacy Policy will tell you:

  * Who collects information;
  * What types of information are collected and how this is done;
  * How ASCO uses and discloses the information that is collected;
  * Your rights to view and correct information that you voluntarily submit to us;
  * Your rights to opt-out, opt-in, or limit specific uses and disclosures of your information;
  * How ASCO secures your information;
  * How the interactive areas of our websites operate;
  * How we comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act; and
  * Where you can get answers to your questions about this Privacy Policy.



We hope that reading this Privacy Policy gives you a clear idea of how we manage information about you. Throughout this Privacy Policy, we have underlined various terms and hot-linked them to our Glossary (Section 16 of this Privacy Policy), or hot-linked to a relevant Section within this Privacy Policy, to help you better understand their meaning.

Please carefully review this Privacy Policy to understand our policies and practices regarding the collection, use and treatment of your information. By accessing or using our Website, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy may change from time to time (see Changes to our Privacy Policy). Your continued use of the Website after we make changes is deemed to be acceptance of those changes, so please check this Privacy Policy periodically for updates.

******2\. Certain General Principles, Terms, and Disclaimers**

This Privacy Policy does not supersede the [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/about-asco/legal/terms-use) that govern your use of the Website. Any conflict between this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use shall be determined in favor of the Terms of Use. Please read the Terms of Use carefully.

******3\. Who Collects Information Through the Website**

Subject to this Privacy Policy, the [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/about-asco/legal/terms-use), and any other rules or policies applicable to the Website, ASCO and/or certain third parties collect the information described in this Privacy Policy through the Website. 

_ASCO Pages and Content Managed by Third Parties_

The Website contains Third Party Managed Pages from which third-party vendors may directly collect PII and other information as necessary for completing authorized transactions.

The Website also makes use of third-party Cookies, Web Beacons, Pixels, and dynamic tags, which may allow third parties to collect information about you and your activities on the Website (including Web Information) and provide you, or enable others to provide you, with advertising.  (See Sections 4.a, 5 and 6 for more information.)

_Links to External Sites_

Our Website provides external links to other websites in order to provide those who use the Website with a better, more fulfilling experience. Once you enter another website (whether through an advertisement, service or content link, sponsorship notice or otherwise), be aware that ASCO is not responsible for the privacy or security practices of such other sites (see also Section 17 of the [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/about-asco/legal/terms-use)). We encourage you to look for and review the privacy statements of each and every website that you visit from our Website. You should also adjust privacy settings on your Browser or account on any third-party site to match your preferences.

**4\. Types of Information We Collect When You Visit Our Website**

We collect several types of information from and about you when you use or visit our Website, including Personally Identifiable Information or PII, Non-Personal Information or NPI, and Web Information, as outlined in this Section.

_a._   _NPI and Web Information_

If you use the Website, regardless of whether you are a Registered User, we will collect NPI and Web Information. We collect this information automatically as you navigate through the Website, through our use of automatic data collection technologies including but not limited to first and third-party Cookies, log files, Web Beacons, Pixels, dynamic tag management, and/or through other technical means.  We also collect NPI and Web Information from third parties, such as through third-party advertisements on the Website, from third parties providing services to us, and from third parties with which ASCO advertises.  

Generally, the NPI and Web Information we collect about you is attached to arbitrary system names that are assigned to visitors when they enter the Website.  We may, however, link your NPI or Web Information with your PII in the event that you become a Registered User. In addition, providers of third-party Cookies, Pixels, Web Beacons, and/or dynamic tags used on the Website may have the ability to both link your activities on the Website (including Web Information) with information collected about you elsewhere on the Internet or otherwise in their possession and to use it for their own business purposes, including to provide you with advertising. (See Section 5 for more information on third-party Cookies.)

_b.  PII_

We collect PII directly from you when you provide it to us, such as in the following ways:

  * Information that you provide by filling out forms on our Website. This includes information provided at the time of registering as a Registered User of the Website, updating your registration or profile information, subscribing or unsubscribing to any of our services, posting material or comments, providing feedback, or requesting further information or services.
  * When you report a problem with our Website.
  * Records and copies of your correspondence (including email addresses) when you contact us.
  * Your responses to surveys that we might ask you to complete for research purposes.
  * Details of transactions you carry out through our Website and of the fulfillment of your orders with us, including account balances and purchasing activity. You may be required to provide information sufficient for us to collect payment for registrations, membership, purchases, subscriptions, or other e-commerce transactions authorized by you, which may include but not be limited to your name, address, email address, credit or debit card information, and other information required to process payment through PayPal or other third-party mechanisms.
  * When you use location-specific searches or directories we provide, such as our iDirectory or Find a Cancer Doctor Database.



If you are submitting PII on behalf of others in your family, business or other organization for registration purposes or otherwise, you represent that you have their permission, agreement and full authorization to provide this information to us. We reserve the right (a) to ask you to provide evidence of your authority at any time during, or even after, the submission process and (b) to contact those individuals to confirm your authority at any time. If we determine that your authority has not been properly obtained, we may immediately and without notice to you discontinue your authorized use of those features of the Website for which you have registered.

If you visit the Website through a link from an email newsletter sent by ASCO, our system will log information, including your email address, which links you click through from the e-mail to the Website, the date and time of your click-through, the name of the link or source from which the message was sent, the tracking URL number, and the destination page.

_c.  Registered Users_

Some features on the Website may require you to register as a Registered User and to receive our authorization before you can use those particular features, including forums, mailing lists, meeting registrations, subscriptions, and other services.  In order for you to register and use those features, we may require that you provide us with certain PII and other information about you or your business. This PII and other information may include names, addresses, e-mail addresses, telephone numbers, fax numbers, education and certifications, areas of specialty, credit card numbers (in relation to certain features), and other forms of PII. While you may use some of the functionality of the Website without becoming a Registered User, many specific tools and services on the Website require registration and your submission of PII. 

Once we have authorized you as a Registered User, we may provide you with a customer identification number and you may be required to select a unique Username and Password. Generally, you will be able to change your Password and update any PII you have given us (instructions on how to make these changes can be found in Section 7 of this Privacy Policy).

If you use Website services or features as a Registered User, you acknowledge and also consent to our tracking of your activities and use of the Website under your Username and/or customer identification number. ASCO may use such information to improve user experience, in order to confirm and fill orders, maintain quality control and contact you concerning your orders, transactions, or subscriptions,  as well as for other uses consistent with this Privacy Policy.

If you have access to the Website as a designated representative of a business, ASCO may terminate your right to use the Website upon notification that you are no longer a designated representative for that business.

_d.  Posts to Our Website_

You also may provide information to be published or displayed (hereinafter, “posted”) on public areas of the Website, or transmitted to other users of the Website or third parties (collectively, “User Contributions”). Your User Contributions are posted on and transmitted to others at your own risk. Although we limit access to certain pages, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable.  Additionally, we cannot control the actions of other users of the Website with whom you may choose to share your User Contributions. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that your User Contributions will not be viewed or used by unauthorized persons.

**5\. How We Use Your Information**

We use the information you provide to us and the information we collect automatically to improve our services and your experience with the Website. Our use of your information and any communications from you to us through the Website will in each case be in a manner consistent with the [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/about-asco/legal/terms-use) and this Privacy Policy.

_E-Commerce Transactions_

When you place an order online with us, register for a conference, pay your dues electronically, or otherwise enter into an e-commerce transaction with us, we collect and transfer to a third-party vendor information sufficient for us to collect payment for these e-commerce transactions, which may include but not be limited to your name, address, email address, credit or debit card information, and other information required to process payment through PayPal or other third-party mechanisms.

_Use of Third Party Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies_

The Website makes use of automatic data collection technologies including first and third-party Cookies, log files, Web Beacons, Pixels, dynamic tags, and/or other technical means. We may use these technologies to collect information about your online activities over time and across third party websites or other online services in order to deliver content and advertising tailored to your interests, both on the Website and on third-party websites (including but not limited to search engines and social media websites). This practice is commonly known as Online Behavioral Advertising. 

The third parties who provide us with third-party Cookies, Web Beacons, Pixels, dynamic tags, and/or other tracking technologies, may use these technologies to collect information about you when you use the Website in order to provide you with advertising based on your visit to the Website. Third parties may have the ability to link the information they collect about you when you use the Website with other information they collect about you elsewhere on the Internet, including but not limited to your PII or information about the device you are using. Third parties may also collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites and other online services and may use this information to provide you with Online Behavioral Advertising or other targeted content. 

We encourage you to research and learn about Cookies and other technical means, including Web Beacons, Pixels, and dynamic tags, through which information about you may be collected through the websites you visit. For more information about how to opt out of the use of some of these technologies, see Your Choices About How We Use and Disclose Your Information.

_Social Networking_

ASCO may maintain a presence on third-party social networking sites such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, and others. ASCO does not control or have responsibility for the collection, tracking, use, or disclosure of your information (including your PII, NPI and Web Information) gathered through these social networking sites, including through the ASCO pages or profiles within those sites, or otherwise as a result of your participation in social networking sites. Third-party social networking sites and advertisers on these sites, including on the ASCO pages or profiles within these sites, are not obligated to follow or apply this Privacy Policy or the Terms of Use. If you have any questions about an advertisement or other targeted content, you should contact the responsible social networking provider directly.

**6\. How We Disclose Your Information**

_Disclosure of NPI and Aggregate Information_

ASCO may provide NPI or Aggregate Information about our users and information that does not identify any individual to third parties without restriction. For example, we might inform third parties regarding the number of users of the Website and the activities they conduct while on the Website. We might, for example inform a pharmaceutical company (that may or may not be a sponsor of the Website), that “30% of our users live east of the Mississippi” or that “25% of our users have tried alternative medicine.”

_Disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information_

We may disclose PII that we collect or that you provide as described in this Privacy Policy:

  * To our subsidiaries and corporate affiliates, including the [Conquer Cancer Foundation](http://www.conquercancerfoundation.org/), [CancerLinQ, LLC](http://www.cancerlinq.com/), and [QOPI Certification Program, LLC](http://www.instituteforquality.org/).
  * To contractors, service providers, and other third parties we use to support our business, internal functions, products, or services, including but not limited to managing mailing lists, packaging, mailing and delivering purchases and promotional offers, consulting services, data modeling, printing, sending postal mail, outreach efforts, and processing event registrations.
  * To fulfill the purpose for which you provide it. For example, to complete transactions you undertake on the Website.
  * To other ASCO Members if you choose to participate in our membership directories (the information made available in directories will include contact information and will not include financial information, such as credit card or bank information).
  * If you are a medical provider and you elect to participate in the [Find A Cancer Doctor Database](http://www.cancer.net/find-cancer-doctor) and authorize the disclosure of your contact information through that Database, or if you are an ASCO Member, your contact information may be disclosed to members of the public accessing that Database.  You may elect to make your information private or cease participation in the Database at any time by contacting [ASCO Customer Service](https://www.asco.org/contact-us).
  * To our advertising and social media partners, to enable us and our partners to provide advertisements to appropriate target audience(s).
  * To private entities and law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate (a) to investigate or resolve possible problems or inquiries, (b) to conform to legal requirements or comply with any court order, law or legal process, including responding to any government or regulatory request, (c) to protect our own rights, property or safety of ASCO, our customers, or others, (d) to enforce or apply our Terms of Use and any other agreements, including for billing and collection purposes, or (d) in special cases, such as a physical threat to you or others. 
  * For any other purpose(s) disclosed by us when you provide the information.
  * With your consent.



Please note that additional disclosure rules apply to information obtained by ASCO through the Oncology Career Center™, which is discussed further in Section 10.

In the event of a change of control of ASCO (or the Website or any portion thereof), such as through a merger, sale, consolidation, transfer of substantial assets, reorganization or liquidation, or other similar transaction, ASCO reserves the right to transfer, sell, or assign to third parties any information we have collected. 

_Disclosure of Information to Third-Party Vendors and Service Providers_

ASCO has engaged third-party vendors and service providers to provide services in connection with the Website, outreach for our programs and services, and to help us manage our web presence and allow us to better serve our users. In addition, some of the content and services on the Website, including advertisements, are served by third parties, including advertisers, ad networks and servers, content providers, and technology and application providers. We may share PII or other information with these third-party vendors and service providers as necessary so that they may provide the services for which they have been engaged. PII and other information submitted to ASCO through Third Party Managed Pages are also shared with the relevant third-party vendor as necessary for completing authorized transactions.

**7. Your Rights to View and Correct Information You Provide to Us**

If you are a Registered User of the Website, you can review, correct and change your PII (and any preferences) by logging into the Website and visiting your account profile page.

You may also send us an email at [privacy@asco.org](mailto:privacy@asco.org) to request access to, correct or delete any PII that you have provided to us. We may not accommodate a request to change information if we believe the change would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect. If you withdraw your registration as a Registered User of the Website we may retain your PII in our records and we may continue to use and disclose that data in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy, unless you request deletion of it.

If you delete your User Contributions from the Website, copies of your User Contributions may remain viewable in cached and archived pages, or might have been copied or stored by other Website users. Please refer to our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/about-asco/legal/terms-use) for information relating to the proper access and use of User Contributions.

**8\. Your Choices About How We Use and Disclose Your Information **

You are able to control your information in the following ways:

_Promotional Offers from ASCO and Third Parties_

When you register, you may be asked whether you want to receive special announcements and future newsletters by email. If you check “yes” but change your mind at any time in the future and no longer wish to receive our newsletter and other special announcements by email, you will be able to Opt-Out of these services by: (a) going to [Email Subscriptions](https://apps.asco.org/EmailPreferences?guid=0fe7bc35-b231-4ead-86f1-dea29029b3c2) and selecting “Update Email Subscriptions”; (b) following the directions included at the bottom of any newsletter issue; and/or (c) sending us an email at [privacy@asco.org](mailto:privacy@asco.org), and we will take you off the applicable email list. You may also Opt-In to receive email communications from us and trusted third parties at the point of registration or by similarly following the instructions above. This Opt-Out does not apply to information provided to us as a result of a product or service purchase, product service communications, or other transactions.

_Cookies_

You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser Cookies, or to alert you when Cookies are being sent. Your Browser can be set to reject all Cookies. A “help” section of most Browsers’ toolbars usually offers instructions on how to reset the browser to reject Cookies. To learn how you can manage your Flash Cookie settings, visit the Flash player settings on Adobe’s website. If you disable or refuse Cookies, please note that some parts of the Website may not function properly, or may no longer be accessible.    

**9.  How We Secure and Dispose of Your Information**

ASCO has implemented reasonable security measures designed to secure your PII from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure. Access to data and technology relating to user information is password-protected and limited to authorized personnel and those vendors that require access to the information in order to furnish services to ASCO and our members. In addition, ASCO uses industry standard technology to keep users’ information secure while residing on ASCO’s servers. However, despite these measures, our IT systems could be compromised by parties seeking unauthorized access to our data or users’ data, by a technological malfunction or by an error by an employee, vendor or contractor. In addition, the transmission of information via the Internet could be intercepted by third parties. As a result, our efforts to protect our data and users’ data from unauthorized access may be unsuccessful and we cannot assure you that the security measures we have adopted will provide absolute certainty. By using, accessing or become a Registered User of the Website, you agree that ASCO is not responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort arising from or relating to any breach of our security, circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures, or interception of your transmissions (see [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/about-asco/legal/terms-use)).  Any transmission by you is at your own risk.

When you provide PII and credit card information for e-commerce transactions, this information is encrypted using industry-standard SSL Encryption technology before being sent over the Internet. We submit to the appropriate credit card clearinghouse only the information necessary to collect payment. All credit card information retained by ASCO, including credit card numbers if you elect to store them on your account, is compliant with Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards.

The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our Website, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone. We urge you to be careful about giving out information in public areas of the Website like message boards. The information you share in public areas may be viewed by any user of the Website.

Information related to your ASCO membership will be retained unless you contact us at [privacy@asco.org](mailto:privacy@asco.org) to request its deletion. Other information you provide to us and that we collect from you will be retained for no longer than reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was obtained, or for a period specifically required by law or regulation. Your information will be disposed of in a manner that seeks to prevent loss, theft, misuse, or unauthorized access.  

**10\. How the Interactive Areas of the Website Operate**

As a service to our users, the Website may feature message boards, chat rooms, and/or other public forums where users can share information or where users can post questions. We may also offer online discussions moderated by medical or healthcare experts.

In addition, you may choose to use certain interactive content, tools, and services that ask you to voluntarily provide information about yourself. Some of these tools (like certain quizzes or calculators) do not retain information, while others may store information in accordance with the authorization you provide at the time you use the service or tool. Please be aware of this fact.

Any chat room, message board, forum or similar interactive service is by design open to the public and is not a private, secure service. ASCO is not responsible for the privacy of information voluntarily provided by a user in interactive areas. You should think carefully before disclosing any PII in any public forum because what you have written may be seen, disclosed to, or collected by third parties and may be used by others in ways we are unable to control or predict, including to contact you for purposes unauthorized by you.

**11\. The Oncology Career Center™**

Because the [Oncology Career Center™](http://careercenter.asco.org/) is a career site, it gives job seekers the option of posting their resumes to our database. There are two ways to post a resume.

_Non-Searchable Submission_

You can store your resume in our database, but elect during the registration process to exclude your resume from searches by potential employers. Excluding your resume from database searches means that you can use it to apply for and respond to individual job postings, but employers will not have the ability to search for it.

_Searchable Submission_

During the registration process you will have the option to allow your resume to be searchable by potential employers. Selecting this option permits all parties with access to our searchable resume database to have access to your resume.

You may remove your resume from the database, and change the status of the resume from searchable to non-searchable, and vice-versa, at any time by updating your profile page on the Oncology Career Center™. 

Please note that the Oncology Career Center™ is an interactive service that uses Cookies and tracking technologies, subject to the policies and disclaimers in Section 5 of this Privacy Policy and in the [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/about-asco/legal/terms-use). We cannot and do not guarantee that third parties will not, without our or your consent, gain access to our resume database. You hereby expressly (a) acknowledge that registered employers and other third parties who gain access to the database with or without our or your consent may retain a copy of your resume in their own files or databases, even if you subsequently change the status of your resume to non-searchable, and (b) agree that in no event shall ASCO be responsible or liable for the retention, use, duplication, distribution, or privacy of resumes in these instances.

**12\. Children Under the Age of 13 - Compliance with Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act**

Our Website is not intended for children under 13 years of age.  No one under age 13 may provide any PII to or on our Website. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If we learn we have collected or received personal information from a child under 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information. If you believe we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at [privacy@asco.org](mailto:privacy@asco.org).

**13\. Your California Privacy Rights**

California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits users of our Website that are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please send us an email to [privacy@asco.org](mailto:privacy@asco.org) or write us at American Society of Clinical Oncology, Inc., 2318 Mill Road, Suite 800, Alexandria, Virginia 22312, Attn: Privacy Officer.

_California Do Not Track Disclosure_

ASCO does not have a mechanism in place for responding to browser “do not track” signals or other similar mechanisms used to limit collection of information for use in Online Behavioral Advertising. 

**14. Changes to our Privacy Policy**

ASCO reserves the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy at any time by posting revised terms directly to this page. Amendments to this Privacy Policy are effective when posted and the date on which the Privacy Policy was last revised is identified at the top of this page. ASCO does not have an obligation to provide further notice of any changes and it is each user’s responsibility to monitor and review updates to this Privacy Policy. If we make material changes to how we treat our users’ PII, we will notify you by email to the primary email address specified in your account, to the extent you are a Registered User with us and provided a deliverable email address. You are responsible for ensuring that we have an up-to-date, active and deliverable email address for you. Your continued use of the Website after the posting of amendments will be deemed acceptance of the changes to the Privacy Policy. 

**15.**   **Where You Can Obtain Answers about the ASCO Privacy Policy**

If you have any questions or comments regarding this Privacy Policy and our privacy practices, please contact: [privacy@asco.org](mailto:privacy@asco.org). If you do not receive adequate resolution of a privacy related problem, you may write to ASCO at: 2318 Mill Road, Suite 800, Alexandria, VA 22314, Attention: General Counsel.

**16.**   **Glossary**

**Aggregate Information**. Non-Personal Information, or Personally Identifiable Information that has been de-identified, that is combined with similar data related to more than one individual to form aggregated information. For example, the site may add up the total number of people in Peoria, Illinois, (but not their names) who are seeking information about pancreatic cancer and compare that to the number of people in Petaluma, California seeking the same information. This sort of statistical information is called Aggregate Information because it reflects the habits and characteristics of a large group of anonymous people. Websites may use aggregate data or share it with third parties so that the information and services provided best meet the needs of their users. Aggregate Information also helps advertisers and sponsors on the Website know how effectively they are reaching and meeting the needs of their target audience.

**Browser**. Short for web browser, a browser is a software application used to locate and display pages of the Internet.

Most modern browsers can present multimedia information, including sound and video, though they require plug-ins for some formats.

**Cookie (or browser cookie)**. A small data file that is stored on the computer you use to view a website. Cookies are placed by that site (“ **first party** ”) or by a third party with a presence on the site (“ **third party** ”), such as an advertiser using a Web Beacon, and are generally accessed only by the party or site that placed the Cookie on the computer (i.e. a Cookie placed on your computer by ASCO is generally not accessed by any other site you visit but a Cookie placed on your computer by an advertiser may be accessed by any site on which that same advertiser has a presence). Cookies can contain pieces of Personally Identifiable Information. Cookies often are used to make the site easier to use. For example, if you check a box to ask that we store your Username on your computer so that you don’t have to enter it each time you visit the site, it’s stored in a Cookie on your computer. Cookies may be persistent (meaning that they are saved on your computer even after you close your Browser and may be accessed at a later time) or non-persistent (meaning that they are deleted when you close your Browser). Cookies may be “essential” for the use of a website, such as for example session-id cookies, authentication cookies or user centric security cookies, or “non-essential” for the use of a website, such as for example, third party advertising cookies or other tracking cookies.

**Encryption**. The translation of data into a secret code. Encryption is one way to achieve data security. To read an encrypted file, you must have access to a secret key or Password that enables you to decrypt it. This is typically done by so called “secure computer systems.”

**Non-Personal Information (“NPI”)**. Information that may relate to an individual but does not identify that individual. For example, Web Information is Non-Personal Information, as is information such as gender, age, city, and physical location, when not linked with other Personally Identifiable Information.  NPI may be “re-identified” through certain processes by linking it to PII relating to the same individual.

**Online Behavioral Advertising**. The practice of using online tracking technologies such as Cookies and Web Beacons to collect information, including Web Information, about a user’s online activities over time and/or across third-party websites or other online services in order to deliver advertising and content tailored to the user’s interests.

**Opt-In**. An option that allows you to actively indicate your preference to participate in a program, email, feature, tool, or enhancement on a website. Typically, if you “Opt-in” you must provide certain information, usually Personally Identifiable Information, to the website or otherwise actively indicate your choice or preference to participate in the website program. For example, if you wish to receive a newsletter by email from the [_Journal of Clinical Oncology_](http://jco.ascopubs.org/), you can enter your email address and choose the type of newsletter by checking a box next to a statement such as: “Yes, I’d like to receive the JCO Newsletters.”

**Opt-Out**. An option that allows you to actively indicate your preference not to participate in a program, email, feature, tool, or enhancement on a website. Typically, if you “Opt-Out” you must uncheck a box next to a stated preference or otherwise take some action to indicate your preference not to participate in a program. Failure to opt-out typically means that you will, by default, participate in the program, feature, tool or enhancement.

**Password**. A secret series of characters, typically alphanumeric (meaning it consists of both letters and numbers), that enables a user to access a file, computer, or program. The user must enter its, his, or her password before the computer or system will respond to commands. The password helps ensure that unauthorized users do not access the system. In addition, data files and programs may require a password. A password should be something that nobody but the user could guess.

**Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”)**.  Information that identifies or is uniquely associated with an individual, such as a name, tax payer identification number, home address, telephone number, email address, Social Security number, or credit card number.

**Pixel.  **See the definition of “Web Beacons”.

**Registered User. **Users who register to use particular features of the Website that require registration and, in some instances, the submission of PII, including but not limited to forums, mailing lists, meeting registrations, subscriptions, and other services, as described in Section 4.c of this Privacy Policy.

**Server**. A computer that provides services to other computers. A “web server” stores web site files and “serves” them to people who request them. Servers may belong to ASCO or to other affiliated or non-affiliated entities.

**SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)**. A security protocol developed by Netscape for transmitting private information via the Internet. SSL works by using a private key to encrypt data that’s transferred over the SSL connection. All major Browsers, including Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Opera, and Apple Safari, support SSL, and many websites use the protocol to transmit confidential user information, such as credit card numbers. By convention, URLs that utilize an SSL connection start with https: instead of http:.

**Third Party Managed Pages**. Certain pages of the website, such as registration, job search, journal, and submission pages that are managed by third parties, and from which third party vendors may directly collect PII and other information as necessary for completing authorized transactions, including but not limited to the [_Journal of Clinical Oncology_](http://jco.ascopubs.org/) website, the [_Journal of Oncology Practice_](http://jop.ascopubs.org/) website, the [Oncology Career Center™](http://careercenter.asco.org/) website, portions of the [Career Opportunities at ASCO page](http://www.asco.org/about-asco/careers-asco), portions of [ASCO in Action](http://ascoaction.asco.org/), the Conquer Cancer Foundation Donation page, the TAPUR page, the QOPI page, the Cohort site, abstract submission, meeting or conference registration, voting, and shopping cart pages.

**Web Beacons** or **Pixels** (also often referred to as “clear GIFs,” “pixel tags,” “1-by-1 GIFs,” “Single-Pixel GIFs,” “1 x 1 Pixels” or “clear Pixels”). Pages of the website and our e-mails may contain small electronic files known as web beacons that permit us and/or third parties to collect Web Information during your visit to the Website. For example, Web Beacons may be used to count the number of users who have visited a page or opened an e-mail and for other related website statistics (for example, recording the popularity of certain website content and verifying system and server integrity). Web Beacons send information back to their home Server (which can belong to the host site, a network advertiser, or some other third party) from the users’ Browser, such as the IP address, the URL of the page on which the beacon is located, the type of Browser that is accessing the site, and information stored in any Cookies on the users’ computer previously placed by that Server. Web Beacons can also be used to place a Cookie on the users’ Browser. Third parties who provide us with web beacons or pixels may have the ability to link the information they collect about you when you use the Website with other information they collect about you elsewhere on the Internet, including but not limited to your PII or information about the device you are using.
