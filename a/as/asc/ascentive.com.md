| **Ascentive's Privacy Policy:**  
---  
| The following discloses our information gathering and usage practices.

We may share your unique identifying information with outside parties when they are helping us fulfill your order. We have safeguards in place (strong encryption, passwords, and limited access policies) to protect your information on our systems and when being communicated to our order fulfillment partners, such as the shipping warehouse.  
We use a cookie so you don't see our pop-up offer more than once per day. The cookie contains the date you saw our popup. If you have disabled cookies in your web browser, you'll see our popup offer every time you exit our web site.  
Ascentive's Revenue Partners program provide site traffic to www.ascentive.com in exchange for a percentage of sales revenue. When you order an Ascentive product and you have been referred by a Revenue Partner, the following anonymous information is provided to the Revenue Partner to calculate revenue and verify our compliance: order number, product name, product cost, and date/time. **No customer identifying information is provided to Revenue Partners unless that Revenue Partner is responsible for helping us fulfill your order, in which case your personal information will only be used by Revenue Partner to fulfill your order.** Ascentive is not responsible for information you choose to provide directly to an Ascentive Revenue Partner via their web site.  
Our site uses an order form for customers to request information, products, and services. We collect visitor's contact information (like their email address) and financial information (like their account or credit card numbers). Financial information that is collected is used to bill the customer for products and services. Miscellaneous optional information collected on the order form, such as connection speed and operating system, are used in aggregate to help us make decisions about developing new products and services. Contact information you provide on your order form may be used occasionally by Ascentive or select partners to announce free updates to software items ordered, special offers and related promotions. You may opt out of this at any time. We are committed to respecting your wishes for use of your personal data.
