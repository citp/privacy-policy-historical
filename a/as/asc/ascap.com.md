We request that our third party contractors and service providers follow similar standards of security and confidentiality. However, regardless of our efforts, no one can guarantee the complete safety of your information.

While we are dedicated to securing your personal information and our systems and Services, you are responsible for securing and maintaining the privacy of your credentials ( _e.g._ , user name, password or account information) and verifying that personal information we maintain about you is accurate and current.

## 13\. CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY

When we change this Privacy Policy in a material way, a notice will be posted on our website along with the updated Privacy Policy. Your continued use of the Services after we post a revised Privacy Policy (and, where appropriate, notify you of same) signifies your acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy.
