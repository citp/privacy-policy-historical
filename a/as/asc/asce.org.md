ASCE Privacy Statement

  
[PDF Version](https://web.archive.org/web/20080621223203id_/http%3A//www.asce.org/lib/copyright/privacy.pdf)

ASCE respects the privacy of our members and other visitors to our web site. To protect online privacy, ASCE has implemented the following policy which may be amended at any time by posted amendments to this web page. 

**What Information Does ASCE Collect?**

ASCE collects data to better serve our members and the engineering profession. It is our policy to collect and store only personal information that our members and visitors knowingly provide. 

**Anonymous Information from General Users**. ASCE does not collect personal information from users browsing our web site. Users to the public areas of ASCE's web site browse anonymously. ASCE collects aggregate data from users browsing our web site. ASCE uses this information for purposes of statistical analysis of web site traffic. Aggregate data are only used for internal and marketing purposes, and ASCE does not provide any personal identification information. 

**Information from ASCE Members, Conference Registrants, and Other Customers.** There are a number of areas in the ASCE web site where we ask for and collect information about you, including personally identifiable information. Where we do, it is in order to serve you better, or is necessary to accomplish the service you are requesting. Examples include membership information (which may include name, address, email, telephone number and educational and professional experience information), conference and seminar registrations, security identifiers, shipping information, and product purchase information stored in online shopping carts. 

Membership information is used in the ASCE database, which is used to generate ASCE mailing lists. This includes lists provided to technical and geographical units of ASCE, for example, institutes and sections. The mailing list may be used in connection with informing you about ASCE services, products, conferences, meetings and events. 

**Third Party Disclosure**. ASCE does not sell or rent email addresses to anyone outside of ASCE and its organizational entities. From time to time, to better serve our members and to supplement member dues, the ASCE mailing list, in part or as a whole, is released to other engineering and carefully selected third party organizations to provide you with information on technical products and services related to your profession, or that we otherwise believe is useful to our members. You may instruct us not to share information about you in the ASCE mailing list with third parties by indicating this preference on your membership application when you join ASCE, on your renewal form when you renew your membership, or by notifying us at <https://www.asce.org/lib/redirect/>, or by calling us at 1-800-548-ASCE (2723). 

**Secure Transactions**. For your protection, we have taken a number of steps to maximize the security of financial transactions that are accepted on the ASCE web site. Credit Card processing is accomplished using secure processing services. Your entry of credit card information is encrypted when transmitted in secure mode. If for any reason you still feel uncomfortable submitting your credit card over the Internet, you can mail your information to us. 

**REGARDLESS OF THE PRECAUTIONS TAKEN BY YOU OR BY ASCE, "PERFECT SECURITY" DOES NOT EXIST ON THE INTERNET. ASCE CANNOT ENSURE OR WARRANT THE SECURITY OF ANY INFORMATION YOU TRANSMIT TO THIS SITE OR ASCE, AND YOU TRANSMIT SUCH INFORMATION AT YOUR OWN RISK.**

**How Does ASCE Use Cookies?**

ASCE uses cookies only to facilitate automated activity, store and track passwords, determine appropriate solicitations, and review navigation patterns. Cookies are not used to disseminate information about users over the Internet or to analyze any information that users have knowingly or unknowingly provided. 

**General ASCE Web Server Security.**

All of the ASCE web servers are registered as secure servers using industry-standard certificate techniques. This enables all communication between our servers to be verified when services are requested between computers. 

All the personal information collected from you on our site, including names and addresses, is stored behind a "firewall," and defenses have been erected to seek to enhance the protection of your information from outside attack by hackers and curious visitors. 

**What Privacy Issues Arise With Links To Other Sites?**

This web site contains links to other web sites, including third party organizations that provide ASCE member benefit programs. ASCE is not responsible for the privacy policies or content of such sites and you should read their terms and privacy policies before using them. 

**Legal Compliance**

ASCE cooperates with law enforcement and other third parties to enforce laws. You authorize and recognize ASCE?s right and intention to disclose any information about you to law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate, in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is or may be illegal or may expose us, service or content providers we work with, or you to possible legal liability. 

**What Means Of Redress Are Available?**

If any user suspects ASCE has handled its personal information in a manner that does not comply with this Privacy Statement, please notify us by email at [member@asce.org](mailto:member@asce.org) or by calling 1-800-548-ASCE (2723).
