## How Will ASCE Share or Disclose This Information?

### ASCE Organizational Entity Disclosures

Membership and customer information is used in the ASCE database, which is used to generate ASCE mailing lists and directories. Such mailing lists are provided to the technical and geographical units of ASCE (for example, Institutes and Sections) and to ASCE’s affiliated entities (e.g., ASCE Foundation), who may use this information in connection with informing you about their services, products, conferences, meetings and events. ASCE publishes directory information for its board and committee members, and for members of its technical and geographic organizational entities’ boards and committees. Such members may remove or change the information provided in such directories at any time, by contacting [privacy@asce.org](mailto:privacy@asce.org "privacy@asce.org").

### Third Party Disclosure

ASCE does not sell, rent, or give email addresses to anyone outside of ASCE and its organizational entities. From time to time, ASCE may release its physical mailing address list, in whole or in part, to other engineering and carefully selected third party organizations to provide you with information on technical products and services related to your profession, or for purposes that we otherwise believe are useful to our members.

You may instruct us not to share information about you in the ASCE mailing list with third parties by indicating this preference on your membership application when you join ASCE, on your renewal form when you renew your membership, by notifying us at [member@asce.org](mailto:member@asce.org "member@asce.org"), or by calling us at [1-800-548-2723](tel:1-800-548-2723 "1-800-548-2723") (ASCE) or for international calls, [+1(703) 295-6300](tel:1-703-295-6300 "+1\(703\) 295-6300").

Other information collected by the ASCE website or other digital properties may be disclosed with third parties as follows:

  1. To service providers that we have retained to perform business activities in support of ASCE’s operations. This may include service providers that: (a) conduct research and analytics; (b) create content; (c) provide customer, technical or operational support; (d) conduct or support membership or marketing activities (such as election management activities, email or advertising platforms); (e) fulfill orders and user requests; (f) handle payments; (g) host our online communities, forums, and other online services; (i) maintain databases; (j) provide indexing and linkage of publication content or metadata; or (k) otherwise support our delivery of goods and services.
  2. In response to a legal request, for example, in response to a court order or subpoena, or a request from a law enforcement or government agency.
  3. Disclosures to investigators, attorneys, or other third parties if, in our sole discretion, we believe such disclosure is necessary or appropriate to investigate allegations of fraud, intellectual property infringement, or other activity that is or may be illegal or may expose us, service or content providers we work with, or you to possible legal liability.
