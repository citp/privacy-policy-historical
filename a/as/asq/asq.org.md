# ASQ : About

## **ASQ's Privacy Policy**

The American Society For Quality, Inc. (ASQ), the owner of www.asq.org is strongly committed to protecting the privacy of its members, customers, and visitors. This privacy policy describes what information ASQ will collect from visitors and purchasers such as yourself, and how we will use that information once it is collected. This policy does not apply to the practices of any third party, affiliate, or business partner that ASQ does not own or control. 

**What Web sites does this policy apply to?**  
The privacy policy applies to ASQ's global Web site, www.asq.org. It does not apply to Web sites of any ASQ member, affiliate, section, division, or chapter. It does not apply to Web sites operated by organizations or groups who associate themselves in any way with ASQ. It does not apply to any other Internet Web sites including those that have hypertext links to the ASQ Web site.

**Collection of Non-Personal Data**  
If you browse ASQ's Web site, you do so anonymously. We do not collect personal information - including your e-mail address. We do log your IP address (the Internet address of your computer) to tell us which parts of our Web site you visit and how long you spend there. We do not link your IP address to anything personally identifiable. We track what country you are accessing the Internet from, and what time and date you visited. The only other information automatically provided to us is the type of computer and operating system you are using. Your browser supplies us with this information. We use this information from our server logs to learn more about our visitors as a group, not about you as an individual. The information helps us identify overall usage patterns and trends on the site.

**Credit Card Information**  
We collect your credit card information, such as card number and card expiration date, when you purchase products on our site. We will not voluntarily disclose your credit card information without your consent.

**Cookies**

**What is a Cookie?**  
A cookie is a tiny piece of information that a web site stores on your computer. When you revisit the Web site, your browser sends the information back to the site. Cookies allow Web sites to maintain information on a particular user. For example, an online bookstore might use a cookie to store the contents of your shopping cart so that you can conveniently purchase a cart full of items rather than one item at a time. Cookies can only store data that is provided by the server or generated by an explicit user action. Cookies are designed to be read only by the site that provides them, not by other sites. Most Web browsers can be configured to notify you when cookies arrive and ask your approval to accept them, or to refuse cookies outright. Most browsers can also delete cookies you may have accepted in the past.

**ASQ Cookie**  
ASQ uses cookies to keep track of your shopping cart. An unique ID is assigned to a shopping session. Our Web server sends the shopping cart ID to your computer. If your browser is configured to accept cookies, the unique ID is stored on your computer and sent back to our Web server. The unique ID is retrieved and used by the server to find out the contents in your shopping cart, which is stored on the server side. At the present time, ASQ cookies will be deleted automatically when you quit the browser. This may change in the future as ASQ strives to personalize your Web experience with us. The ASQ Web site cookie will not damage your system or files in any way.

**Web Site Surveys, Contests, and Other Forms**  
We obtain information you provide to us in connection with forms, surveys, and contests, such as your name, address, and e-mail address. We may use this information to provide you with information about the products and services offered by ASQ. Online forms are available for customers to request information, products, and services. In addition, this site uses registration forms for customers to register for courses, conferences, and/or certification exams. We collect information about you only if you voluntarily provide contact information within these forms. We do not share this information with anyone.

**Disclosure**  
We retain the right to release your personal information to proper authorities when required by law or in good faith, believe that we must release the information in order to: (a) satisfy a legal order or comply with legal process; (b) defend the rights of ASQ or its affiliates or business partners; or (c) protect the personal safety of ASQ employees, agents, affiliates, business partners, customers, or site users.

**Security  
** This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control.

We have taken the necessary steps to provide a secure server for transmission of sensitive data to and from our site. All data (including your credit card number) transmitted through our secure Web server is encrypted so no one else can read it.

**ASQ Privacy Policy Changes**  
If we decide to change our privacy policy for www.asq.org, we will post the modifications so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information, and whether we will disclose it to anyone.
