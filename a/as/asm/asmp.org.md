We rely on a number of legal bases to use your information in the above ways.

It may also be necessary in the public interest (such as to prevent crime) or to protect vital interests (in rare cases where we may need to share information to prevent loss of life or personal injury).

If Company receives a lawful, verified request for your Personal Information in one of the limited circumstances described in the previous paragraph, we may disclose Personal Information, which may include, but may not be limited to, your name, address, phone number, and email address.

### **About Cookies**

When you visit Company’s Site, a text file called a cookie is placed in the browser directory of your computer’s hard drive. A cookie is information that a website can store on your web browser and later retrieve. The information that cookies collect includes the date and time of your visit, your registration information and your navigational and licensing information. It allows the web browser to recognize the pages you have been to when you are visiting the Site and allows you to quickly return to viewed pages. We may also use “web beacons” that monitor your use of our Site. Web beacons are small strings of code that provide a method for delivering a graphic image on a web page for the purpose of transferring data, such as the IP address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the web beacon appears, the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) of the page on which the web beacon appears, the time the page containing the web beacon was viewed, the types of browser that fetched the web beacon and the identification number of any cookie on the computer previously placed by that server.

When corresponding with you via HTML capable email, web beacons let us know whether you received and opened our email.

You may adjust your browser to reject cookies from us or from any other website. Additionally, by setting your web browser to display HTML emails as text only, you may be able to prevent the use of some web beacons. Please consult the “Help” section of your browser for more information. However, certain areas of our Site can only be accessed in conjunction with cookies or similar devices and should be aware that disabling cookies or similar devices might prevent you from accessing some of our content.

### **Direct Marketing**

If at any time you decide that you do not want to receive marketing emails from us, you will have the option of opting out and/or unsubscribing from our emails and mailing lists by adjusting your “Personal Information Preferences” as follows: (1) checking or unchecking the appropriate box on your online registration form; (2) contacting your Account Executive; or (3) sending an email to [_asmp@vpassociations.com_](mailto:asmp@vpassociations.com).

Our website may include discussion forums or other interactive areas or services, including blogs, chat rooms, bulletin boards, message boards, online hosting or storage services, or other areas or services in which you or third parties create, post or store any content, messages, comments, materials, or other items on the Site (“Interactive Areas”). If you use an Interactive Area, you should be aware that these areas are open to the public and any Personal Information you post or provide at registration may be viewable by others. We are not responsible for Personal Information you submit in connection with the Interactive Areas, nor are we responsible for how others might use that information, including to send you unsolicited messages. Interactive Area postings may be retained indefinitely. If at any time you would like to remove a posting, please email us at [_asmp@vpassociations.com_](mailto:asmp@vpassociations.com). Keep in mind that removal of a posting from an Interactive Area does not mean that the posting will be deleted from our systems.

Whenever you submit an order to Company, you can do so over a secure (i.e., encrypted) connection. This ensures that your Personal Information is not at risk. Additionally, we encrypt your credit card information and store it in a secure location, which can be accessed only by authorized personnel.
