**Uses of Your Participant Information In Your Participant Profile; Sharing Participant Information with Third Parties**

  * _Operating Our Site_

ASME uses your Participant Information to operate the social networking features of Our Site.

In addition, your activity on the social networking portions of Our Site will be shared with Participants with whom you have connected. We provide you with robust tools to control who may view (1) the information in your Participant profile (except that which is required to remain public, described in Section 3(C)(ii)) and (2) your activity. Please see Section 3(C) for more details about these tools and how to control the sharing of your Participant Information. Portions of your Participant profile information will be available to the general public, including your name, field of technical interest, and work experience.

  * _Customized Content_

We use your Participant Informatio n to customize your experience on Our Site. For example, when you log in to your account, the dashboard page will display activity on Our Site that may be relevant to you. The nature of the content that is displayed is based in part on the Participant Information you provide.

  * _Question & Answer_

If you participate in the Q&A Section, be aware that questions may be viewed by any Visitor, and answers may be viewed by other Participants. ASME is not responsible for the information and materials you choose to submit or disclosures you make in these forums. 

For example, solely by way of illustration, here are some situations in which you should exercise particular caution prior to submitting an answer or comment in this forum:

    * A question or answer that involves any disclosure of your sensitive personal information, such as personal address, employment, family or other personal relationship data or finances; 
    * A question or answer that involves disclosure of proprietary information which belongs to your employer and which is subject to the protection of any non-disclosure agreement or policy of that employer; 
    * A question or answer that involves information which is subject to any applicable export control or other information security laws and, as such, which may not be lawfully exported to certain other countries or disclosed to others without some form of prior government approval; 
    * A question or answer that involves copying and transmission of any copyrighted material (e.g., drawings, images, music, video, etc.) which belongs to some other person and such other person has not given lawful consent to its copying and transmission; 
    * A question or answer that involves a derogatory commentary or opinion about a third person's reputation, judgment, integrity or other similar characteristics; or 
    * A question or answer that involves profanity or patently offensive language (e.g., on account of religion, race, ethnicity, national origin, gender, sexual orientation or other similar factors). 
  * _Sharing Information with Third Parties_

ASME takes the privacy of our Participants very seriously, and we do not sell, rent, or otherwise provide Participant Information to third parties, except as described in this Statement, unless disclosure is reasonably necessary in our opinion to: (1) comply with legal process, including, but not limited to, civil and criminal subpoenas, court orders or other compulsory disclosures; (2) enforce this Agreement; (3) respond to claims of a violation of the rights of third parties; (4) respond to customer service inquiries; or (5) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of ASME, our users or the public.

ASME uses third-party service providers (“ **Service Providers** ”) to provide certain services, such as hosting, software maintenance, and database maintenance, which are necessary for ASME operations, including the operation of Our Site.  These Service Providers may be supplied with or have access to your Participant Information, but only for the purpose of providing these services to ASME or on our behalf.  These Service Providers are obligated to keep Participant Information confidential.




Your Choices 

The Participant Information you provide to ASME may reveal, or allow others to identify, your nationality, gender, age, professional information, and other aspects of your life. By providing your Participant Information to us, you expressly and voluntarily accept the terms and conditions of this Statement and ASME's Terms, including those governing ASME's use of your Participant Information. Providing your Participant Information to ASME is entirely voluntary. If you no longer wish to share your Participant Information you supplied to ASME for your ASME profile, you can revise your profile or close your account, as described in this section.

  * _Accessing and Changing Your Profile Information_

You can review the Participant information you provided for your profile and make changes to that information, or to the settings for your Participant account, at any time by logging in to the Participant account settings page on [Our Site](https://preview.community.asme.org/user/accountinformation.aspx "Account Information"). After your change is processed, ASME may retain residual copies of the old information in its backup and/or archival copies of its database [for a limited period of time ].

  * _Default Settings and Choices_

We strive to offer you control over your Participant Information and how it is shared with other ASME Participants. We offer default settings and other pre-set settings that allow you to control how your Participant Information is displayed and used (e.g., in your profile); you may also customize these settings. You may choose these settings during the registration process, and you may adjust them at any time through your account settings. _Some fields of your profile must remain public, including the information you provide regarding your name, field of technical interest, and work experience._ If you do not wish to share this information with the public, you may deactivate or delete your account, as described in the next subsection.

  * _Deactivating and Deleting Your Account_

If you wish to close your Participant account, you have two options. You may deactivate your account or delete your account. If you deactivate your account, your profile will not be available to other Participants or the public, but we will keep a copy of the information associated with your account to facilitate your return if you ever wish to use the social networking features of Our Site again

If you delete your account, we will delete all information associated with your account, and if you ever wish to use the social networking features of Our Site again, you will need to re-submit all information associated with your account and re-establish all connections with other Participants.

Please note that, in order to maintain the continuity and integrity of the Q&A Section, your submissions to the Q&A Section will not be removed in connection with the deactivation or deletion of your account.

### 4\. ASME Members

  * **(A)** **ASME Members' Information**

You can apply to be an ASME Member by registering and paying on Our Site or by submitting your application by mail or fax. For more information on membership and how to join, please [click here](https://web.archive.org/about-asme/professional-membership/join-asme "Join ASME"). ASME Members' information is made available in the ASME online membership directory, which ASME Members may view in the access-restricted Members section of Our Site. You can choose the information that will be made available to other ASME Members. Please contact us at [CustomerCare@asme.org](mailto:CustomerCare@asme.org "CustomerCare@asme.org") if you wish to make changes to this information.

With regard to ASME Members in leadership or volunteer positions, ASME provides selected portions of those ASME Members' information for use in connection with the activities of the groups to which they belong. If you would like more information about ASME's policies concerning the use of Member data, [click here](https://web.archive.org/about-asme/terms-of-use "Terms of Use").

ASME also shares Member mailing lists (i.e., names, street addresses and email addresses) with carefully selected third parties who offer information, goods or services that we think may be of interest to you. If you would like more information about ASME's policies concerning the distribution of mailing lists, [click here](https://web.archive.org/about-asme/terms-of-use "Terms of Use").

ASME may also disclose information Members have provided to us through Our Site as described in Section 2(B)(ii).

  * **(B) Email Alias**

ASME offers its Members an email alias. The alias is a simple "store and forward" mechanism that accepts email sent to the alias name and forwards it to the Member's actual email address. Once an email alias is issued to a Member, ASME makes no guarantees on the future privacy of the alias. Members use the email alias service at their own risk and must take sole responsibility for protecting against publication or misuse of their email aliases. ASME has taken measures to protect Members from spam in the form of adding third-party spam-blocking services; however, the software cannot guarantee complete spam blocking.

If you serve as a leader or volunteer for an ASME section, division, board, committee, district or any other ASME Member group, or if you are a Member or non-Member who has assumed a leadership role in any activity or program that ASME conducts or sponsors, then ASME may display limited portions of the contact information you have provided to ASME in sections of Our Site so that fellow group Members or participants may contact you. In addition to your name, shared portions of your contact information may include your email address, employer, job title, employer address, telephone and fax numbers and photograph (if applicable). Also, participants in ASME groups, programs or activities may have access to the information of other group Members or fellow participants in the respective program or activity for information sharing purposes. This information is not collected through Our Site, but it is displayed on Our Site. ASME may also disclose this information as described in Section 2(B)(ii).

If you no longer wish to have your contact information displayed on Our Site to identify you as a leader, volunteer or participant in a particular group or activity, please send an e-mail to [webmaster@asme.org](mailto:webmaster@asme.org "webmaster@asme.org") with a subject line of “Remove Personal Information from asme.org.” In the body of the email, identify yourself and the address of the page that lists your contact information.

Note that while we may make the information of participants in ASME sections, divisions, boards, committees, districts or any other ASME Member group available on Our Site as described in this Section, those groups may have their own websites, which are separate from Our Site and are not governed by this Statement.
