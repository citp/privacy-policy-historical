**The American Society of Mechanical Engineers (“ASME,” “we” or “us”) last amended this Privacy and Security Statement on April 4, 2008.**

The American Society of Mechanical Engineers has established this web site (“Our Site”) to provide information to the public, facilitate communication among the engineering community, including ASME members, and offer for sale our goods and services.  This privacy and security statement ("Statement") describes how ASME collects and uses information from visitors to Our Site, including ASME members.

**By using Our Site, you consent our collection and use of information about you in accordance with this Statement.**   We may update this Statement from time to time by posting a modified statement on this page, or, if we determine that it is appropriate, we may post a notice of the change on our home page.  By continuing to use Our Site after we have posted a notice of modification, you agree to the terms of the modified Statement.  This Statement is part of the Terms that govern your use of Our Site, so please be sure to read the entire [Terms](https://web.archive.org/About-ASME/Terms-of-Use "Terms of Use").

**This Statement does not apply to:   (1) web sites operated by individual ASME sections, subsections, groups, student sections, divisions, subdivisions, boards, committees, districts and other ASME-related groups for the benefit of their members or participants; (2) web sites operated by individual ASME members; (3) web sites operated by third-party ASME affiliates; (4) our advertisers’ web sites; or (5) any third-party web sites referred to on Our Site.  You should review those sites’ privacy practices before using them or submitting any personally identifiable information to them.**

**Collection of Anonymous Information**

ASME uses two methods for collecting and reporting statistical information about Web Traffic to our site:

  * page tagging 
  * log file analysis



Using the page tagging method, ASME collects and sends data about our visitors to a third-party service provider. This is accomplished using JavaScript that can be found on most ASME web pages. The JavaScript requests a 1x1 pixel transparent image file located on our service providers' servers. This image file request is "tagged" with variable information containing data about Web traffic activities, such as; page requests, the addition of an item to our shopping cart, clicking on links, and other traffic generating events.  An anonymous "visitor identification cookie" is set in your browser so that our service can more accurately differentiate between unique visitors to ASME sites.

Page tagging image requests also contain the following information: 

  * IP address 
  * Site name 
  * date/time 
  * screen resolution 
  * page with query string 
  * referrer 
  * user agent 
  * cookie



In addition to the page tagging method, our servers also automatically log certain information that ASME uses for statistical analysis of web site traffic.  With the log file analysis method, ASME sends standard web server log data to our third-party service provider for traffic analysis.  Similar information to that collected with page tag image requests is analyzed:

  * IP address 
  * date/time 
  * page with query string 
  * referrer 
  * user agent 
  * cookie



This information is then used to determine:

  * Traffic patterns 
  * Average visitor session length 
  * Number of visitors to certain areas of the site 
  * Banner Ad click-through 
  * Tracking results of promotional campaigns 
  * Other user trends 
  * Improvements to web site navigation and infrastructure



Neither our third-party service nor our server logs collect personally identifiable information about individual users, such as names, addresses, email address, occupation, etc.  As described in the next section, ASME does collect this type of data electronically but only through forms, surveys or event registrations on Our Sites.  ASME also collects anonymous information through cookies and clear GIFs or other graphical files placed on web pages of Our Site.  ASME does not link anonymous information it collects through Our Site to individual users’ personally identifiable information.

**Cookies**

Certain parts of Our Site use cookies, which are small files placed on your computer, to better enable visitors to use Our Site and to measure Web statistics as noted above.  Generally, cookies enable our server to remember visitors, allow entry into password-protected areas, and to help ensure accurate measuring of web traffic.  Cookies can be deleted or rejected by changing the settings on your web browser.  Please be aware that your deletion or rejection of cookies may affect your ability to use certain parts of Our Site effectively.  Because advertisers or third-party web sites may use cookies in different ways, this statement regarding the use of cookies covers only Our Site.

**Collection of Personally Identifiable Information**

ASME also collects personally identifiable information (“Your Data”) that you voluntarily submit through online forms, surveys and event registrations on Our Site or via downloaded forms that are completed offline and then submitted to ASME, such as your:

  * Name

  * Fax Number 
  * Employment information 
  * Memberships and affiliations (including membership identification numbers)

**Disclosure for Legal Purposes**

We may disclose and use Your Data in special circumstances where it is necessary, including to protect our proprietary rights, in connection with a sale or transfer of some or all of our assets in Our Site, or when we, in good faith, believe that the law requires us to do so.

**Email Addresses**

Except as otherwise set forth in this Statement, ASME will not share your email address with any third party other than our Service Providers; we use email addresses for internal purposes and to promote efficient communications between ASME and its members and customers. 

**ASME Peerlink (formerly Communities of Practice)**

ASME Peerlink (formerly Communities of Practice) is an online interactive communications tool that links engineers to resources, news, and solutions and ideas from peers.  Access to the ASME Peerlink (formerly Communities of Practice) is open to both members and non-members of ASME and is contingent on your registration in this section of Our Site.  As part of the registration process, you will be asked to consent to the Rules and Conditions for ASME Peerlink (formerly Communities of Practice), which contain supplemental terms governing your use of ASME Peerlink (formerly Communities of Practice) and treatment of Your Data.  If you wish to view the ASME Peerlink (formerly Communities of Practice) Rules and Conditions, please [click here](http://peerlink.asme.org/COP/Public/Login/UsageAgreement.fusion?DisplayOnly=1 "Peerlink Rules of Use").

**Protection of Children Under Age 13**

ASME does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under 13 years of age, unless it is necessary to respond to a one-time request. Once the request has been answered, ASME will delete the requesting child's personally identifiable information.  If you are a parent or guardian and you believe that your child under age 13 may have provided his or her personal information to us through Our Site, please contact us at [webmaster@asme.org](mailto:webmaster@asme.org "Webmaster").

**Review and Correction**

If you are an ASME member, you may review, update, correct or delete any of Your Data that you have provided to us by logging into the Members Only section of Our Site.  Members and non-members may also review and update their personal information by sending a revision request by email to [CustomerCare@asme.org](mailto:CustomerCare@asme.org "Infocentral") or by mail at ASME SERVICE CENTER, 22 LAW DRIVE, P.O. BOX 2900, FAIRFIELD, NJ 07007-2900, or by calling us at 1-800-THE ASME.

**Email Alias Service**

ASME offers its members an email alias.  The alias is a simple "store and forward" mechanism that accepts email sent to the alias name and forwards it to the member's actual email address.  Once an email alias is issued to a member, ASME makes no guarantees on the future privacy of the alias.  Members use the email alias service at their own risk and must take sole responsibility for protecting against publication or misuse of their email aliases.  ASME has taken measures to protect members from SPAM in the form of adding third-party SPAM-blocking services; however, the software cannot guarantee complete SPAM blocking if an alias is used.

**Links to Third Parties**

Our Site contains links to third-party web sites and content providers that contain information or services we believe may be of interest to you.  Our Site also carries banner advertisements that are placed by third-party advertisers.  If you follow any link or banner advertisement to a third-party site, you leave Our Site.  This Privacy and Security Statement applies to Our Site only.  We recommend that you review the privacy statement (or “policy”) and terms of use at each of these Web sites to determine how the operators of those sites protect your privacy.

**Security**

ASME uses online forms on Our Sites to collect specific information for registration for events or courses, surveys, polls and other data collection uses. In cases where Your Data is collected, all forms are secured through Secure Socket Layers (SSL) encryption, the most widely accepted and tested form of data encryption.  Of course, no transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  Therefore, you provide us with your information at your own risk.

In addition to Secure Socket Layer encryption during transmission, ASME takes these additional precautions with your information:

  * All Web Servers are protected by state of the art, managed firewalls. 
  * Data is protected at the server level by ensuring that only necessary order fulfillment staff, product managers and web server support personnel have access to collected information. 
  * Administrative screens can be accessed only from ASME offices using Secure Socket Layers. 
  * Credit Card Numbers are encrypted down to the database field level. 
  * The member directory is password-protected and SSL-enabled.



**Location of Servers and Transfer of Information to the United States**

Our servers are located in the United States.  If you are located outside of the United States, please be aware that Your Data will be transferred to and stored on a server located in the United States.  By submitting Your Data to us, you consent to this transfer and the collection, storage, processing and use of Your Data in the United States.
