1\. Introduction

This is the Privacy and Security Statement (“ **Statement** ”) for the website located at asme.org (“ **Our Site** ”). This Statement describes how we collect your information through Our Site, the types of information we collect, what we do with that information, and your choices regarding that information.

  * **(A)** This Statement does not apply to websites not directly operated by ASME, including: (i) websites operated by individual ASME sections, subsections, groups, student sections, divisions, subdivisions, boards, committees, districts and other ASME-related groups for the benefit of their members or participants; (ii) websites operated by individual ASME Members; (iii) websites operated by ASME affiliates; (iv) the websites of those who sponsor portions of Our Site ( **"Sponsors"** ); or (v) any third-party websites linked to on Our Site. You should review those sites' privacy policies before using them or submitting any personally identifiable information to them.
  * **(B)** This Statement is part of the Terms of Use ( **"Terms"** ) that govern your use of Our Site, so be sure to read those [Terms](https://web.archive.org/terms-of-use "Terms of Use") . Please check the Terms (including this Statement) regularly, because we may modify them from time to time. We will notify you of a material change to the Terms in a manner commensurate with the nature of the change. Your continued use of Our Site after we have posted amended Terms constitutes your consent to the amended Terms. If you have questions, please feel free to contact us by sending an email to webmaster@asme.org.

ASME uses your Participant Information to operate the social networking features of Our Site. For example, we will display the information you provide for your Participant profile in your Participant profile so that others may learn about you and so that you may connect with others. In addition, your activity on the social networking portions of Our Site will be shared with Participants with whom you have connected. We provide you with robust tools to control who may view (1) the information in your Participant profile (except that which is required to remain public, described in Section 3(C)(ii)) and (2) your activity. Please see Section 3(C) for more details about these tools and how to control the sharing of your Participant Information. Portions of your Participant profile information will be available to the general public, including your name, field of technical interest, and work experience.

We use your Participant Information to customize your experience on Our Site. For example, when you log in to your account, the dashboard page will display activity on Our Site that may be relevant to you. The nature of the content that is displayed is based in part on the Participant Information you provide.

If you participate in the Q&A Section, be aware that questions may be viewed by any Visitor, and answers may be viewed by other Participants. ASME is not responsible for the information and materials you choose to submit or disclosures you make in these forums.

For example, solely by way of illustration, here are some situations in which you should exercise particular caution prior to submitting an answer or comment in this forum:

The Participant Information you provide to ASME may reveal, or allow others to identify, your nationality, gender, age, professional information, and other aspects of your life. By providing your Participant Information to us, you expressly and voluntarily accept the terms and conditions of this Statement and ASME's Terms, including those governing ASME's use of your Participant Information. Providing your Participant Information to ASME is entirely voluntary. If you no longer wish to share your Participant Information you supplied to ASME for your ASME profile, you can revise your profile or close your account, as described in this section.

You can review the Participant information you provided for your profile and make changes to that information, or to the settings for your Participant account, at any time by logging in to the Participant account settings page on [Our Site](https://community.asme.org/user/accountinformation.aspx "Account Information"). After your change is processed, ASME may retain residual copies of the old information in its backup and/or archival copies of its database [for a limited period of time ].

We strive to offer you control over your Participant Information and how it is shared with other ASME Participants. We offer default settings and other pre-set settings that allow you to control how your Participant Information is displayed and used (e.g., in your profile); you may also customize these settings. You may choose these settings during the registration process, and you may adjust them at any time through your account settings. _Some fields of your profile must remain public, including the information you provide regarding your name, field of technical interest, and work experience._ If you do not wish to share this information with the public, you may deactivate or delete your account, as described in the next subsection.

If you wish to close your Participant account, you have two options. You may deactivate your account or delete your account. If you deactivate your account, your profile will not be available to other Participants or the public, but we will keep a copy of the information associated with your account to facilitate your return if you ever wish to use the social networking features of Our Site again

If you delete your account, we will delete all information associated with your account, and if you ever wish to use the social networking features of Our Site again, you will need to re-submit all information associated with your account and re-establish all connections with other Participants.

Please note that, in order to maintain the continuity and integrity of the Q&A Section, your submissions to the Q&A Section will not be removed in connection with the deactivation or deletion of your account.

### 4\. ASME Members

You can apply to be an ASME Member by registering and paying on Our Site or by submitting your application by mail or fax. For more information on membership and how to join, please [click here](https://web.archive.org/about-asme/professional-membership/join-asme "Join ASME"). ASME Members' information is made available in the ASME online membership directory, which ASME Members may view in the access-restricted Members section of Our Site. You can choose the information that will be made available to other ASME Members. Please contact us at [CustomerCare@asme.org](mailto:CustomerCare@asme.org "CustomerCare@asme.org") if you wish to make changes to this information.

With regard to ASME Members in leadership or volunteer positions, ASME provides selected portions of those ASME Members' information for use in connection with the activities of the groups to which they belong. If you would like more information about ASME's policies concerning the use of Member data, [click here](https://web.archive.org/terms-of-use "Terms of Use").

ASME also shares Member mailing lists (i.e., names, street addresses and email addresses) with carefully selected third parties who offer information, goods or services that we think may be of interest to you. If you would like more information about ASME's policies concerning the distribution of mailing lists, [click here](https://web.archive.org/terms-of-use "Terms of Use").

ASME may also disclose information Members have provided to us through Our Site as described in Section 2(B)(ii).

If you prefer that we do not share your Member information with third parties, please contact us at [CustomerCare@asme.org](mailto:CustomerCare@asme.org "CustomerCare@asme.org") and we will respect your request. Please include your name and ASME Member number for identification purposes.

ASME offers its Members an email alias. The alias is a simple "store and forward" mechanism that accepts email sent to the alias name and forwards it to the Member's actual email address. Once an email alias is issued to a Member, ASME makes no guarantees on the future privacy of the alias. Members use the email alias service at their own risk and must take sole responsibility for protecting against publication or misuse of their email aliases. ASME has taken measures to protect Members from spam in the form of adding third-party spam-blocking services; however, the software cannot guarantee complete spam blocking.
