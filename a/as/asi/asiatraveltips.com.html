         	  <p>Thank you for using <a href="http://www.asiatraveltips.com">ASIA Travel Tips.com</a>. 
			  For many 
			  years we did not had a Privacy Policy publicly displayed on ASIA Travel 
			  Tips.com for the simple reason that most Privacy Policies have a 
			  clause that state that it may change at any time. It was for this 
			  reason, that we never publicly displayed our policy even though as 
			  a company, we have always had a very strict internal Privacy 
			  Policy which is followed to the letter. In addition to this, 
			  however often do the average user check a site's privacy policy? I 
			  know most of us here never do.</p>
						<p>Further down you can 
			  read the official "more legal" Privacy Policy if you wish, however 
			  it really is very simple. Any information that we obtain from you 
			  be it, your email, name or other information is never sold or 
			  given to any third party (this excludes hotel reservations where 
			  your details are shared between us and the hotel where you are 
			  making the reservation). We never send out unsolicited email to 
			  any of our users at any time. If you feel that you have been 
			  receiving something from us which you should not, then please let 
			  us know and we will immediately look into the matter. We respect 
			  your privacy, in exactly the same way as we respect our own.</p>
						<p>Our hotel reservations are made through an encrypted and secure 
			  SSL connection meaning that the information your provide when 
			  making a reservation is shared only with us and the hotel where 
			  you are making the reservation. Also, because many users 
						startedasking for immediate confirmations to their hotel 
						reservations we signed up with a third party that allows 
						us to do just that. This added convenience however does 
						mean that the privacy policy of the third party comes 
						into effect once you pass from our site to theirs.</p>
						<p>Now for the more legal version:</p>
						<p><span class="highlight">Privacy Policy</span></p>
						<p><a href="http://www.asiatraveltips.com">ASIA Travel Tips.com</a> may be referred to 
			  below as the site, or the website, or by name.</p>
						<p><span class="highlight">INFORMATION WE 
			  REQUEST</span></p>
						<p>You will not be asked for any personal details that 
			  are irrelevant to contacting you. As you are making hotel 
			  reservations certain details are required to ensure that the 
			  reservation is processed correctly and guaranteed for you as per 
			  your reservation.</p>
						<p>The type of personal information we request 
			  are:&nbsp; <br>Name&nbsp;<br>Address&nbsp;<br>Gender&nbsp;<br>Date of birth&nbsp;<br>
			  Nationality&nbsp;<br>Email address&nbsp;<br>Credit Card Information (name of 
			  cardholder, credit card number and expiry date)</p>
						<p>Travel 
			  details, including :</p>
						<p>proposed check-in and check-out dates&nbsp;<br>
			  number of rooms required&nbsp;<br>proposed pick-up and drop-off dates &amp; 
			  time&nbsp;<br>flight information - flight number, arrival and departure 
			  time&nbsp;<br>number of passengers, rooms&nbsp;<br></p>
						<p>We request this 
			  information when you make use of our reservation services.</p>
						<p><span class="highlight">USE 
			  OF YOUR INFORMATION</span></p>

						the following purposes:</p>

			  provide you with valued and efficient customer support. <br>- To

			  disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our User Agreement.
			  We only share your information with our service providers 
			  (hotels) and third party reservation parties as the information is essential to processing your hotel 
			  reservations correctly. The sole purpose for this disclosure is to
