                    <p><strong>Please note that there are circumstances where the use or disclosure of Personal Information may be justified or permitted, or where Asia-Hotels may be obligated to disclose information without consent.</strong></p>
                    <p>Such circumstances may include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If required to comply with a subpoena or warrant issued or an order made by a court, person or body with jurisdiction to compel the production of information or to comply with the rules or court relating to the production of records. If we receive a formal request to disclose your Personal Information in connection with a legal action, we will attempt to contact you about it, if permitted by law, via the e-mail address you provided during registration, before we respond to that request. If you have not registered with us, we will attempt to contact you on the details you have provided in your transactions with us.</li>
                        <li>If a law, regulation, rule or guideline requires it.</li>

                    <h2 class="h2" id="how-we-retain-and-store-personal-information">6. How We Retain and Store Personal Information</h2>
                    <p>We will retain your Personal Information in our databases in accordance with our records management policy and applicable laws. This period may extend beyond the end of your relationship with us, but it will be only as long as it is necessary for us to fulfill the purposes for which your Personal Information was collected – this may include ensuring that we have sufficient information to respond to any issues that may arise later. For example, we may need or be required to retain information to allow you to obtain credit for a trip you Booked but had to cancel. We may also need to retain certain information to prevent fraudulent activity; to protect ourselves against liability, permit us to pursue available remedies or limit any damages that we may sustain; or where a law, regulation, rule or guideline requires it.</p>
                    <p>Your Personal Information will be stored in secured locations and on servers controlled by Asia-Hotels, located either at our offices or at the offices of our service providers as described in <a href="#how-we-protect-personal-information">'How We Protect Personal Information'</a>.</p>
                    <h2 class="h2" id="how-we-protect-personal-information">7. How We Protect Personal Information</h2>
                    <p>Asia-Hotels employs physical, administrative and technical safeguards to help protect the confidentiality and integrity of Personal Information and to reduce the risk of loss, misuse, unauthorized access disclosure or modification of Personal Information. When Personal Information is sent to our service providers, we require, in our contracts with them, that they protect all Personal Information in a manner consistent with the principles articulated in this Privacy Policy.</p>
                    <p>If you choose to contact Asia-Hotels through the Web Site, you should be aware that any information transmitted electronically via the World Wide Web might not be secure. Asia-Hotels assumes no liability for the loss of any information that you transmit to us via the World Wide Web. However, should you choose to pay by credit card when making a booking or reservation on the Web Site, your card details are encrypted for the transaction.</p>
                    <p>In communicating with you, we may send e-mail as unencrypted plain text because we are aware that most Guests or Subscribers cannot readily process encrypted e-mail. This is done for your convenience, but with the security concern that, if misrouted or intercepted, it could be read more easily than encrypted e-mail.</p>
                    <p>While being transmitted over the Internet, your credit card details are protected using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption. Credit card details are only used to pay for accommodation related costs booked through our service. These details are stored securely at all times, are not used for any other purpose and will never be provided to any unauthorised third parties.</p>
                    <h2 class="h2" id="how-to-access-or-correct-your-personal-information">8. How to Access or Correct Your Personal Information</h2>
                    <p>We endeavor to ensure that Personal Information is as accurate, complete and current as necessary for the purposes for which we use that information. All Users of the Web Site may request access to, update of correct Personal Information we hold about them by emailing us at <a href="mailto:privacy@asiahotels.com">privacy@asiahotels.com</a>.</p>
                    <p>Please remember that we may not be able to honor your request if we are legally obligated to retain that information, or for other reasons as described in <a href="#how-we-retain-and-store-personal-information">'How We Retain and Store Personal Information'</a>.</p>

                    <p>A Cookie is a small text file that our computer sends to your computer, and that your computer sends back to us each time you make a request from our Web Site. A cookie contains a unique identification number that identifies the user's browser, but not necessarily the user. A pixel tag is a small graphic image similar to a cookie.</p>
                    <p>When you access our Web Site, our computer may seek to place "cookies" or "pixel tags" on your personal computer to collect Session Data.

While we may share Session Data with third parties to help facilitate the serving of these ads, we do not share any Personal Information about you unless you give us permission to do so.
