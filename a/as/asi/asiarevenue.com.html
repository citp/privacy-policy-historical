                     <p>PRIVACY POLICY OF Asia Revenue Pte Ltd</p>
<p>Including all Related Websites Owned or Registered to Asia Revenue Pte Ltd<br>
Agreement to Access the Site:</p>
<p>Asia Revenue Pte Ltd, (“Asia Revenue Pte Ltd”), a Nevada Limited Liability Company is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains the data collection and use practices of Asia Revenue Pte Ltd and all related websites owned or registered to Asia Revenue Pte Ltd. It does not apply to any third party websites, applications, products or services for which Asia Revenue Pte Ltd is not responsible.</p>
<p>By accessing this site, you are consenting to the information collection and use practices described in this policy as well as the Acceptable Use Policy and the site’s Publisher Terms and Conditions and Advertiser Terms and Conditions.

Asia Revenue Pte Ltd may also collect such information concerning you from another source and uses that information in combination with information provided from this website.

1.3. Third Party List Information:</p>

1.5. Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Info Collected Using Technology:</p>
<p>Asia Revenue Pte Ltd currently uses cookie and web beacon technology to associate certain Internet-related information about you with information about you in its database. Additionally, Asia Revenue Pte Ltd may use other new and evolving sources of information in the future. (a) Cookies: “Cookies” are a feature on your browser software. If enabled, we may write cookies that may store small amounts of data on your computer about your visit to any of the pages of this Site. Cookies assist us in tracking which of our features appeal the most to you and what content you may have viewed on past visits. When you visit this site again, cookies can enable us to customize our content according to your preferences. We may use cookies to: keep track of the number of return visits to this site; accumulate and report aggregate, statistical information on website usage; deliver specific content to you based on your interests or past viewing history; save your password for ease of access to our Site. You can disable cookies, although the Site may not function properly for you. Your browser preferences can be modified to accept or reject all cookies, or request a notification when a cookie is set. You may read more about cookies at http://cookiecentral.com. In order to use all of the features and functionality of Asia Revenue Pte Ltd’s websites, you need to accept cookies. (b) Web Beacons: A web beacon is a programming code that can be used to display an image on a web page, but can also be used to transfer your unique user identification to a database and associate you with previously acquired information about an individual in a database. This allows Asia Revenue Pte Ltd to track certain websites you visit. Web beacons are used to track online behavioral habits for marketing purposes to determine products or services you may be interested in. In addition to using web beacons on web pages, Asia Revenue Pte Ltd also uses web beacons in email messages sent to individuals listed in Asia Revenue Pte Ltd’s database. (c) IP Addresses: Asia Revenue Pte Ltd automatically tracks certain information based upon your behavior on the site. We may use this information to do internal research on our users’ demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand, protect and serve you and our community. This information may include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on the site or not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on the site or not), your computer browser information, and your IP address. Your Internet Protocol (“IP”) is a unique Internet “address” which is assigned to you by your Internet Service Provider (“ISP”). For local area network (“LAN”), DSL, or cable modem users, an IP address may be permanently assigned to a particular computer. IP addresses are automatically logged by Web servers, collecting information about a user’s traffic patterns. While the IP address does not identify an individual by name, it may, with the cooperation of the ISP, be used to locate and identify an individual using the Web. Your IP address can, however, reveal what geographic area you are connecting from, or which ISP you are using. Finally, other websites you visit have IP addresses, and we may collect the IP addresses of those websites and their pages. (d) Computer Profiles: Asia Revenue Pte Ltd may also collect and accumulate other anonymous data which will help us understand and analyze the Internet experience of our visitors. For instance, Asia Revenue Pte Ltd may accumulate visitor data relating to referring domain names, the type of browsers used, operating system software, screen resolutions, color capabilities, browser plug-ins, language settings, cookie preferences, search engine keywords and JavaScript enablement. When you provide us with Personal Identification Information, we are able to use such visitor data to identify you. (e) Data Mining: Data Mining technology may be employed from time to time if used by a Client of Asia Revenue Pte Ltd. (f) New Technology: The use of technology on the Internet, including cookies and web beacons, is rapidly developing. As a result, Asia Revenue Pte Ltd strongly encourages individuals to revisit this policy for any updates regarding its use of new technology.<br>
1.6. No Information Collected from Children:</p>
<p>Asia Revenue Pte Ltd will never knowingly collect any personal information about children under the age of 18. If Asia Revenue Pte Ltd obtains actual knowledge that it has collected personal information about a child under the age of 18, that information will be immediately deleted from its database. Because it does not collect such information, Asia Revenue Pte Ltd has no such information to use or to disclose to third parties. Asia Revenue Pte Ltd has designed this policy in order to comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”).<br>
1.7. Credit Card Information:</p>
<p>Asia Revenue Pte Ltd may, in certain instances, collect credit card numbers and related information when an individual places an order from Asia Revenue Pte Ltd. When the credit card information is submitted to Asia Revenue Pte Ltd, such information is encrypted and is protected with SSL encryption software.
