#### Use of Cookies

recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies  
the process of recording your personal information, such as billing  
addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same

provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use The ABCs of

automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser  
setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline  
cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive  
features of the The ABCs of Attraction services or Web sites you  
visit.
