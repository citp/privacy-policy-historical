A personal network consists of a user's friends as well as the extended group of people that a user is connected to via chains of mutual friends. Favorite things can include restaurants, CDs, books, film and etc. They may also highlight their personal event calendar on their profile. To fulfill the purpose of this site, some personal information we ask for is displayed to people within these personal networks.
