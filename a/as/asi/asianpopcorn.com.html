			  <p>Asianpopcorn is an online application that helps people find local services  they can trust by soliciting and aggregating reviews. To accomplish  this, our users write reviews about local services that are posted to  the Asianpopcorn Site. These reviews can then be accessed and read by other  Asianpopcorn users. For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, a "user" is  defined as someone using the Asianpopcorn Site, and a "friend" is defined as  someone you have explicitly invited to share reviews with you. To  fulfill the purpose of our site, we need to display a limited amount of  personal information, so that users are able to evaluate the  trustworthiness of a particular review.</p>
			  <p>&nbsp;</p>
			  <p>By using Asianpopcorn, you permit the collection and use of your personal information as outlined below in our   						Privacy Policy. You should visit this page periodically to review any changes to the Privacy Policy. </p>

			  <p>Information We Collect</p>
			  <p>&nbsp;</p>
			  <p>Asianpopcorn collects user submitted account information such as name and email  address to identify you and send you notifications related to the use  of the service. Asianpopcorn also collects user submitted location information  such as city, state or zip. Asianpopcorn also collects user submitted photos,  reviews, and ratings of local businesses and service providers. </p>
			  <p>&nbsp;</p>
			  <p> Some information collected is not explicitly  submitted by the user; we log your browser-type related information, IP  address, requested URL, referring URL, and timestamp.</p>
			  <p>&nbsp;</p>

	          </div>
	          <p>How We Use Your Information</p>
	          <p>&nbsp;</p>
	          <p> Information such as your full name, profile photo and any personally identifiable information you have included in your reviews may be shown to friends or other users primarily in conjunction with reviews you have contributed. If a person is a friend they can also see your name or email address in their list of friends. In addition, we may sell your reviews to third parties, in which case your first name and last initial and any personally identifiable information you have included in your reviews may be shown to users of such third party web sites.</p>
	          <p>&nbsp;</p>
	          <p>Your full name and email address may also be used when you send an email notification to a friend (such as in an invitation, or when sharing a review). We may also use your email address to send you updates or news regarding our site, but you may choose not to receive email of this type by accessing the "Account" tab of the web site and updating your notification settings. Additionally, we use your email address to contact you on behalf of your friends (such as when someone sends you a personal message).	            </p>
	          <p>&nbsp;</p>
	          <p>Browser-type related information, IP address, requested URL, referring URL, and timestamp data help us diagnose problems with our server, administer Asianpopcorn, and otherwise provide the highest possible level of service to you. In addition, we use this information to perform statistical analyses of user behavior and characteristics in order to measure interest in and use of the various areas of the site and to inform advertisers of such information as well as the number of users that have been exposed to, or clicked on, their advertising banners. </p>
	          <p>&nbsp;</p>

              </div>
	          <p>Transfer of Information</p>
	          <p>&nbsp;</p>
	          <p>We may sell your reviews to third parties. Your first name and last  initial, profile photo, any submitted photos of businesses, and any  personally identifiable information you have included in your reviews  may be transferred to such third parties and displayed on their  websites in connection with such third parties' publication of your  reviews.</p>
	          <p>&nbsp; </p>
	          <p> Except as set forth in this Privacy  Policy, we do not sell, rent, share, trade or give away any of your  personal information. Asianpopcorn will disclose information about individual  users to governmental or judicial authorities or law enforcement  agencies, or to other individuals or entities in response to subpoenas,  court orders, or other legal processes. Further, Asianpopcorn may share  information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding  illegal activities or suspected fraud, or to enforce or apply the terms  and conditions of this Privacy Policy. </p>
	          <p>&nbsp;</p>
	          <p> We reserve the right to transfer your personal  information in the event of a transfer of ownership of Asianpopcorn, such as an  acquisition by or merger with another company. In such an event, Asianpopcorn  will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes  subject to a different privacy policy. </p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p> Asianpopcorn will notify you when information about you  may be provided to third parties in ways other than explained above,  and you will have the option to prevent such information sharing. &nbsp;</p>

	          <p>&nbsp;</p>
	          <p>Like most  websites, Asianpopcorn requires cookies to function properly. Cookies are small  text files that reside on a user's computer and identify you as a  unique user. We use cookies to refine our site and simplify the user  experience. For example, the use of cookies allows registered users to  enter our site without explicitly typing in their email address and  password every time. You should be aware that Asianpopcorn cannot control the  use of cookies by advertisers or any information advertisers may gather  from their use of cookies. If you do not want information collected  through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most  browsers that allows you to deny or accept the cookie feature; however,  you should note that cookies may be necessary to provide you certain  features (e.g., customized delivery of information) available on the  Asianpopcorn site.</p>

	          <p>You should be aware that when you voluntarily disclose personally  identifiable information (e.g., user name, e-mail address) via reviews,  messages, forums, postings, or in other areas of the Asianpopcorn site, that  information, along with any substantive information disclosed in your  communication, can be collected and correlated and used by third  parties and may result in unsolicited messages from other posters or  third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of Asianpopcorn. Please  do not post any personal information on the Asianpopcorn site or in other areas  that you expect to keep private. </p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p> As a registered Asianpopcorn user, you can modify your  personal information at any time by accessing the "Account" section of  the site.
