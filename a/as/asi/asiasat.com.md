To enable AsiaSat to better understand how we can improve our services to you, personal information ("Information") is collected by us on a voluntary basis. Such Information may include name, title, e-mail address, etc. and is used by us only for the purposes stated in AsiaSat's Personal Information Collection Statement. We will not disclose or transfer the Information to any third parties without your prior consent or except as required by law.

No data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure and while we will use our best efforts to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us via the Internet and any such transmission is therefore done at your own risk.

When browsing the AsiaSat web site, your visit will be recorded as a "hit" and no personal information will be collected about you (i.e. your identity will remain anonymous). The "hit" information is to allow us to compile general statistics to show the daily number of visitors to our site. Such general statistics may be shared with AsiaSat's affiliates or subsidiaries.

This Policy is effective as of March 19, 1999 and AsiaSat reserves the right to improve or update this policy at any time without notice. Nothing herein contains or creates any legal relationship between AsiaSat and any individual.
