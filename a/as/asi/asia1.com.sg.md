# Privacy Statement

  
SPH Asiaone Ltd respects the privacy of its users and we do not collect information about our users without their knowledge. Where information is collected, as when a user registers for an Asiaone service or takes part in a survey, that information is used for market analysis and may be communicated in broad terms to our advertisers and business partners. We do not disclose information about specific individuals to any third party.

We also collect information in order to better serve our visitors. For example, we provide a "[Remember Me](http://www.asiaone.com/html/rememberme.html)" feature on our free email service as a convenience for our users. When you activate this feature, we send a cookie (a small data file) to your hard disk. While this cookie can tell us when you enter our sites and which pages you visit, it cannot read data off your hard disk.
