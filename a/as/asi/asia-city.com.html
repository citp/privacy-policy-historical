  <strong>Use of Cookies </strong>
  <p>A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a text file stored on the user's hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. Users must enable cookies to use our site. </p>
  <p>We use cookies and tracking technologies in a variety of ways, including: </p>
  <ol start="1" type="1">
    <li>Keeping count of return visits to our site or our advertisers' or partners' sites;</li>
    <li>Accumulating and reporting anonymous, aggregate (data collected in mass), statistical information on Web-site and advertisement usage;</li>
    <li>Determining which features our overall user population likes best;</li>
    <li>Saving your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our sites;</li>
    <li>Displaying the most appropriate advertising or content based on your interests.</li>
    <li>Maintaining your previous selected city.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>We do not and will not use cookies to collect private information from any user which they did not intentionally submit to us. <br>
      <br>
  We also use technologies, including electronic images known as <em>Web bugs</em>—sometimes called <em>transparent GIFs, clear GIFs</em>, or <em>beacons</em>—that allow us to track general user-traffic patterns. We also automatically receive and record information from our servers and from your browser, including your IP address, the time of your visit to pages on our site, and information about pages you visited.

  <strong>Changes in Our Privacy Policy </strong>
  <p>If we change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our web site so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users via email or by placing a prominent notice on our site. </p>
  <strong>Invite a Friend </strong>
  <p>If a user elects to use our Invite feature to invite a friend to our site, we ask them for the friend's email address. Asia City will automatically send the friend an email inviting them to join the site. Asia City stores this email address for the purpose of automatically adding the respondent to the friends list of the user sending the invitation, and also to send reminders of the invitation.

Doing this allows the ad network to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement. In this way, ad networks may compile information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw their advertisements and determine which ads are clicked on. This information allows an ad network to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. Asia City does not have access to or control of the cookies that may be placed by the third-party ad servers or ad networks. </p>
  <p>This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by Asia City and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>
