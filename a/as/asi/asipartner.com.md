For all visitors to its websites, ASI collects general data pertaining to each Web site visitor, such as the visitor's IP address, operating system, browser type and version number, and the web pages viewed. This information is aggregated with all other visitor information.

In addition to personal information you provide to us for the purpose of ordering products, you may provide financial information to us for the purpose of extending credit to you. This data is only used to evaluate your credit worthiness and is reviewed periodically as long as your account is active. It is shared with financial institutions as a normal course of doing business. Your account status and payment history is also reported to various credit reporting agencies.

We will not sell or otherwise transfer your personal information to individuals or entities outside of us or one of our authorized partners or resellers without your approval.
