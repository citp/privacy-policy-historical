# Privacy Policy | Asian Scientist Magazine | Science, Technology and Medicine News Updates From Asia

AsianScientist.com collects non-personally identifiable information, such as overall statistics of its readership and visitor traffic, to improve the design and content of our site. However, the Site has no interest in personally identifying its users.

Each time someone visits the site, our web server logs a number of details (if available) including the I.P. address of the visitor’s computer and/or Internet Service Provider, the domain name and country of origin of that computer, its operating system, and the type of web browser being used.

In addition to the statistics that our own web server collects, the third-party advertising agencies that we work with may also collect certain information through the use of banner ads.

### Third-Party Advertising

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies may use non-personally identifiable information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you.

### Third-Party Cookies

We, our third-party service providers, advertisers or our partners may use cookies to manage and measure the performance of advertisements displayed on or delivered by or through the Site.

For example, Google, as a third-party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on AsianScientist.com. Google’s use of the DoubleClick DART cookie enables it to serve ads to our users based on their visit to AsianScientist.com and other sites on the Internet. Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google ad and content network privacy policy.

You can also change your privacy preferences regarding the use of cookies and similar technologies through your browser, or use an anonymous web browsing service such as Anonymizer.com which logs visits from the anonymizing service instead of the users’ own computers.
