In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique "cookie" on your browser.

When you surf the Internet, your Internet browser (such as Netscape Navigator® or Microsoft Internet Explorer) automatically transmits some information to MadCool Network LLC every time you access content on one of our sites. Examples of such information include the URL of the Web page you were just on (known as the "Refer"), the IP (or Internet Protocol) address of the computer you are using, or the browser version you are using to access our site. All of this information is collected by MadCool Network LLC and is used to help improve our offerings to you.

All of the information that is automatically submitted to us by your browser is considered Anonymous Information.

Other companies that place advertising on our site may collect information about you when you view or click on their advertising or content through the use of cookies.
