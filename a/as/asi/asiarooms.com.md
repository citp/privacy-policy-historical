You agree that financial compensation alone may not be adequate for us if there is a breach or threatened breach of our Terms and that we are entitled to seek all remedies available to us.  Each right or remedy of you and us in respect of these Terms shall not affect any other right or remedy of us whether under these Terms or otherwise. The rights and remedies provided under this agreement are in addition to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies provided by law. 

In the event that any provision of these Terms is found by a court or administrative body to be unenforceable, that provision shall not be a part of these Terms and the remaining provisions shall continue to apply. 

Nothing under the Terms shall give rights to any person who is not a party to it (whether under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999) or otherwise. 

If you or LateRooms waive any rights in result of a breach or default under, any part of these Terms by the other will not be deemed a waiver of any subsequent breach or default. Further it will not affect the other Terms unless expressly confirmed in writing by the party waiving its rights. 

LateRooms reserves the right to change our Terms at any time. We shall post such updated Terms on our Site and your continued use of our Site shall be deemed acceptance of such updated Terms. 

Our Site booking services are available in English, Spanish, French, Italian and German. The original English version of these Terms may have been translated into other languages. The translated versions of these Terms are provided as a courtesy and for information purposes only.  In the event of a dispute or conflict between the English version of these Terms and any other language versions, the English version shall prevail and shall be conclusive and binding.  The English version shall be used in legal proceedings.

### (3) Cookies and Web Beacons

A cookie consists of information sent by a web server to a web browser, and stored by the browser. The information is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. This enables the web server to identify and track the web browser. 

We use both "session" cookies and "short-term" cookies on the website. We will use the session cookies for such purposes as to keep track of you whilst you navigate the website. We will use the short-term cookies for such purposes as to enable our website to recognise you when you visit. 

Session cookies will be deleted from your computer when you close your browser. Short-term cookies will remain stored on your computer for a period of 30 days.
