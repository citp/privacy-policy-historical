We log your IP address in order to help diagnose problems with our server, administer our Web site and track usage statistics. Your IP address may vary each time you visit, or it may be the same.

That personal information may include your name, email address, mailing address, telephone number, payment information, travel and other preferences, user name and password, as well as contact information for other people that you provide to us. To provide an enhance personalized service, we may store all or some of that information in a cookie file on your hard drive, so that our system will recognize you each time you visit our site. In that way, we can save your preferences from visit to visit and present you with a customized Web site, without requiring you to log into our site every time you visit. Additionally, authorized personnel may update your registration information to accurately reflect any new information included in communications received from you.

**Partner Sites  
**

We work with partners to make sure that we can provide you with the best possible services. If you reach our site through one of our partners rather than directly through us and you choose to register or purchase travel or other services or goods with them while they are acting as a service provider to us, they may provide certain of the information to us so that we can still enhance your service and any such information will be covered under the parameters of this privacy statement. In addition our partners may have their own privacy statements which govern their use of information that they collect and we encourage our users to read their statements as well before submitting any personal information.

**How we use the personal information we collect.  
**

It may allow you to log into our site automatically each time you visit, rather than manually typing your user name and password every time. We may use your personal information to periodically contact you with news or important information, to provide you with other information or invitations related to your membership, and to request your feedback on our site. For instance when you purchase travel or other services or goods from us we will send you travel booking or other relevant confirmations relating to your order. In addition, we send our customers and registers users periodic newsletters as well as valuable travel specials and other offers such as a special on a dream vacation, low cost airfare rates or relevant deals that we have secured for our users. We can use the information that you give us to make our specials more relevant to you.

We will ensure those parties agree to use any such personally-identifiable data solely for the purpose of providing the specified services to us. We must cooperate with legal authorities, and may in some circumstances be required to disclose personally identifiable information in response to requests from law enforcement authorities, or in response to a subpoena or other legal process. We can turn over information about you if we believe we must in order to prevent a violation of the law, and by accepting this policy, you consent to our doing so, in our sole discretion.
