                PRINCIPLES</font></font></p>
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Because your 
                privacy is important to us, Astro operates this Web Site by the 
                following principles: </font></p>
            </div>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Principle 1. 
              <br>
              Astro explicitly asks when it needs information that personally 
              identifies you ("Profile Information"). Astro asks for your first 
              and last name, state and zip code, gender, year of birth, and occupation. 
              You may update this information at any time from within your Astro 
              web member account by clicking the "Update My Profile" button on 
              the navigation bar, and then fill in the relevant information. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Principle 2. 
              <br>
              Your Profile Information is used only for demographic statistics 
              and to display appropriate individualized advertisements. Astro 
              keeps all of your Profile Information private and does not share 
              it with any third parties. Astro will not disclose your Profile 
              Information unless acting under a good faith belief that such action 
              is necessary to: </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(1) conform 
              to legal requirements or comply with legal process; <br>
              (2) protect and defend the rights or property of Astro; <br>
              (3) enforce the Astro Terms of Service; or <br>
              (4) act to protect the interests of its members or others. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Principle 3. 
              <br>
              Astro will not send you any unsolicited information, including e-mail, 
              except as mentioned below. New users will receive a Astro welcome 
              letter explaining the features provided by the service. Under exigent 
              circumstances, Astro may be required to send you information about 
              the service or your account, but Astro will not send you unsolicited 
              e-mail regarding any commercial offers or advertisements at any 
              time. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Principle 4. 
              <br>
              If at any time you believe that Astro has not adhered to these principles, 
              please notify us by e-mail at privacy@Astro.com.my and we will use 
              all commercially reasonable efforts to promptly determine and correct 
              the problem. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Websites that 
              have links on our site may collect personally identifiable information

              Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs). </font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFCC00" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">FAQs</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(1) Does Astro 
              collect other forms of information about its users? </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In addition 
              to the use of Profile Information to operate the site, Astro also 
              gathers anonymous information, which may be used by Astro or shared 
              with its advertisers. This is information which does not personally 
              identify you, but which may be helpful for marketing purposes or 
              for improving the services we offer. Generally, this information 
              is collected through "traffic data" and may entail the use of "Cookies", 
              "IP addresses" or other numeric codes used to identify a computer. 
              </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(2) How do I 
              correct or change Profile Information that I have give to Astro? 
              </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You may update 
              this information at any time from within your Astro account by clicking 
              the "Update My Profile" button on the navigation bar, and then fill 
              in the relevant information.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(3) Is my Profile 
              Information secure from others using the Astro site?</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Profile Information 
              collected by Astro is stored in secure operating environments that 
              are not available to the public. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(4) How else 
              might someone learn of my Profile Information while visiting another 
              site? </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In addition 
              to directly providing information to Astro, you might also provide 
              Profile Information through chat sessions, e-mail exchanges or bulletin 
              board use made available to you on other sites, including other 
              sites. Chat sessions and bulletin board or newsgroup use is considered 
              public and you are responsible for your actions in these areas. 
              The Astro Privacy Statement does not cover this type of transfer 
              of your Profile Information. You should always be careful when distributing 
              your Profile Information in this manner. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(5) What are 
              cookies?</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Cookies are 
              pieces of information that a Web site transfers to your computer's 
              hard disk for record-keeping purposes. Cookies can make the Web 
              more useful by storing information about your preferences on a particular 
              site. The use of cookies is an industry standard, and many major 
              Web sites use them to provide useful features for their customers. 
              Cookies in and of themselves do not personally identify users, although 
              they do identify a user's computer. Most browsers are initially 
              set up to accept cookies. If you'd prefer, you can set yours to 
              refuse cookies. However, you may not be able to take full advantage 
              of a Web site if you do so.</font></p>
