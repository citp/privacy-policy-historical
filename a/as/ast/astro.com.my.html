              PRINCIPLES<br>
              </font>Because your privacy is important to us, ASTRO operates this 
              Web Site by the following principles: </p>
            <p>Principle 1. <br>
              ASTRO explicitly asks when it needs information that personally 
              identifies you ("Profile Information"). ASTRO asks for your first 
              and last name, state and zip code, gender, year of birth, and occupation. 
              You may update this information at any time from within your ASTRO 
              web member account by clicking the "Update My Profile" button on 
              the navigation bar, and then fill in the relevant information. </p>
            <p>Principle 2. <br>
              Your Profile Information is used only for demographic statistics 
              and to display appropriate individualized advertisements. ASTRO 
              keeps all of your Profile Information private and does not share 
              it with any third parties. ASTRO will not disclose your Profile 
              Information unless acting under a good faith belief that such action 
              is necessary to: </p>
            <p>(1) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process; 
              <br>
              (2) protect and defend the rights or property of ASTRO; <br>
              (3) enforce the ASTRO Terms of Service; or <br>
              (4) act to protect the interests of its members or others. </p>
            <p>Principle 3. <br>
              ASTRO will not send you any unsolicited information, including e-mail, 
              except as mentioned below. New users will receive a ASTRO welcome 
              letter explaining the features provided by the service. Under exigent 
              circumstances, ASTRO may be required to send you information about 
              the service or your account, but ASTRO will not send you unsolicited 
              e-mail regarding any commercial offers or advertisements at any 
              time. </p>
            <p>Principle 4. <br>
              If at any time you believe that ASTRO has not adhered to these principles, 
              please notify us by e-mail at privacy@astro.com.my and we will use 
              all commercially reasonable efforts to promptly determine and correct 
              the problem. </p>
            <p>Websites that have links on our site may collect personally identifiable 
              information about you. The data protection practices of those websites 
              linked to ASTRO are not covered by this policy statement. You are 
              advised to check the data protection policies of these third party 
              websites yourself before using those sites. </p>
            <p>If you have questions about this policy, please e-mail us at smd_sub@astro.com.my. 
              For more information about our privacy statement, see the following 
              Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs). </p>
            <p><font color="#FF9900">FAQs 
              </font><br>
              (1) Does ASTRO collect other forms of information about its users? 
            </p>
            <p>In addition to the use of Profile Information to operate the site, 
              ASTRO also gathers anonymous information, which may be used by ASTRO 
              or shared with its advertisers. This is information which does not 
              personally identify you, but which may be helpful for marketing 
              purposes or for improving the services we offer. Generally, this 
              information is collected through "traffic data" and may entail the 
              use of "Cookies", "IP addresses" or other numeric codes used to 
              identify a computer. </p>
            <p>(2) How do I correct or change Profile Information that I have 
              give to ASTRO? </p>
            <p>You may update this information at any time from within your ASTRO 
              account by clicking the "Update My Profile" button on the navigation 
              bar, and then fill in the relevant information.</p>
            <p>(3) Is my Profile Information secure from others using the ASTRO 
              site?</p>
            <p>Profile Information collected by ASTRO is stored in secure operating 
              environments that are not available to the public. </p>
            <p>(4) How else might someone learn of my Profile Information while 
              visiting another site? </p>
            <p>In addition to directly providing information to ASTRO, you might 
              also provide Profile Information through chat sessions, e-mail exchanges 
              or bulletin board use made available to you on other sites, including 
              other sites. Chat sessions and bulletin board or newsgroup use is 
              considered public and you are responsible for your actions in these 
              areas. The ASTRO Privacy Statement does not cover this type of transfer 
              of your Profile Information. You should always be careful when distributing 
              your Profile Information in this manner. </p>
            <p>(5) What are cookies?</p>
            <p>Cookies are pieces of information that a Web site transfers to 
              your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. Cookies can 
              make the Web more useful by storing information about your preferences 
              on a particular site. The use of cookies is an industry standard, 
              and many major Web sites use them to provide useful features for 
              their customers. Cookies in and of themselves do not personally 
              identify users, although they do identify a user's computer. Most 
              browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. If you'd prefer, 
              you can set yours to refuse cookies. However, you may not be able 
              to take full advantage of a Web site if you do so.</p>

              SUBMISSIONS</font> </p>

              transmitted or posted to this Web Site will be considered a voluntary
