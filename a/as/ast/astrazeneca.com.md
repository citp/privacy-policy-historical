Who Will Have Access To Your Personal Data?

Your Personal Data may be made available within the AstraZeneca group of companies.  We sometimes employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf, for example providing technical support for the systems where your Personal Data is held.  They may need access to your Personal Data in order to perform their functions but will not use your Personal Data for any other purpose.

Binding Corporate Rules

We have ensured compliance with some of Our legal obligations in relation to Personal Data by creating a set of ‘Binding Corporate Rules’ (BCRs).  The BCRs set out AstraZeneca’s data privacy commitments in respect of Personal Data that is transferred internationally from our affiliates in the European Economic Area (the EEA), and countries with similar restrictions on the use of Personal Data.

Our BCRs have been approved by a number of national privacy regulators and, in countries where they apply, require Us to:

  1.         Use Personal Data for specified purposes only;
  2.        Take steps to ensure that the Personal Data We hold is kept accurate and up-to-date;
  3.       Take appropriate measures against the risks of unlawful use and accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to, Personal Data.



You can find out more about these commitments here. The BCRs and any rights arising under them do not apply to Personal Data originating in the U.S.A.
