## What information do we collect?

In general, you can visit our website without giving us any information, and we don’t know who you are. If you are one of our anonymous visitors, please bear in mind that we may still:

  * record the areas of the website which you visit; and
  * collect information about your computer, such as which browser you are using, your network location, the type of connection you are using (e.g. broadband, ADSL etc).



We do this by using Cookies, but we can’t tell who you are. 

However, additional services may be available if you register with Aston Martin. In this case, once you register, we will know who you are, your activities on Aston Martin and information about your computer may be linked on our systems to you.

Whenever we collect your personal data, for example when you contact us, you will see the padlock symbol. The types of information we may request are: 

  * contact information - your name, address, postcode and other contact information including email address and telephone/mobile number;
  * general information about you - your personal or professional interests, experiences with our products and services or other products and services and your contact preferences;



Some information is required information and you’ll see that indicated by a red border, but other information is optional and if you don’t want to give it to us, don’t worry. But it will help us to improve our products and services if you do, so we’d be very grateful if you did.

We may also retain copies of any correspondence you send us and we will certainly keep details of your registration history with us.

## What do we do with the information we collect?

We use this information for all sorts of reasons!

The main reason we use this information is to provide you with our products and services (whether available via the website or offline). We also use the information for:

  * internal record keeping;
  * product development;
  * answering your queries;
  * contacting you for market research and marketing (for more on this see below).



We may contact you by e-mail, phone, or mail, unless you have registered with the appropriate Preference Service or opted for us not to do so.

## Direct Marketing

We may, from time to time, want to send you information about promotions, offers and other items which may be of interest either by post, email or SMS or we may want to contact you by phone. However, we respect that not everyone will want to hear about our great products and services! For this reason, we will only send you marketing if you have opted to receive it.

If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive marketing from us, you can unsubscribe here <http://newsletter.astonmartin.com/newsletter.aspx> or you can write to us at:

We will always give you an opportunity to unsubscribe from receiving any marketing from us in each communication we send to you.

## Who do we share this information with?

We may share your personal information with companies performing services on our behalf (such as direct marketing agents or courier services) who will only use the information to provide that service. We may also share your personal information with other members of our corporate group, or a purchaser or potential purchaser of our business.

In some circumstances, we may have to disclose your personal information by law, because a court or the police or other law enforcement agency has asked us for it.

On occasion we may also share your information with other reputable organisations who we believe may have products and services which they can offer you which will be of interest.

In completing our job application form or submitting your CV to us by email, you will give us personal information about yourself.

### Uses of personal data 

We will use your personal data only for the purpose of assessing your suitability for employment by us and in any subsequent interviewing process. Copies of the information you submit and any further correspondence will be retained in order to progress your job application and as a record of our employment and fair access processes.
