# Privacy Policy

Change Vision adheres to a strict policy for ensuring the privacy of your personally identifiable information (such as full name, address, e-mail address, and/or other identifiable information) and will not distribute or sell it to third parties.

### Gathering and Use of Information

  1. We will never share your information with third parties outside Change Vision unless you give express permission for us to do so, or unless we are required to do so under applicable law.
  2. In order to participate in some activities, you might be asked to provide some personally identifiable information. This could be in connection with the following: 
    * software evaluation registration
    * subscription registration for sites or services which require subscription (such as e-mail newsletters)
    * purchase transactions
    * content submissions, community postings (i.e., forums or bulletin boards), comments and suggestions, or voting
    * feature request
    * License Registration
    * Receiving Technical Support
    * Software Evaluation
  3. Employees of Change Vision or approved contractors or resellers may have access to personally identifiable customer information. All employees, contractors, and resellers are legally bound to uphold this policy and observe your right to privacy and confidentiality. We will never share your information with third parties outside Change Vision unless you give express permission for us to do so, or unless we are required to do so under applicable law.
  4. We securely store email transactions so we have a history of our interactions that can be used for Pre-Sales Support and Technical Support.
  5. We may occasionally conduct online surveys that may ask you for demographic information (your location, position, tool use, etc.) If the online survey collects contact data such as your e-mail address, we will use that data to send you further information only if the form specifically asks for your permission and you give it. You are free to revoke any such permission at any time.
  6. Change Vision's website may contain links to other sites. Change Vision is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these linked websites
  7. You can opt out of receiving e-mail communications from Change Vision at any time. You only need to e-mail us to have your name and details removed from our e-mail list or registration database. Although opt-out requests are usually processed immediately, please allow five (5) business days for the removal to be processed. Users may also opt out manually via Change Vision Members.
  8. Transactions are recorded, including, but not limited to, when a user downloads software, purchases, logs into his/her account, or generates a software license key. We do not store any credit card or bank account information on any online systems that can be accessed remotely.
  9. As you surf around Change Vision's website, it is possible that several cookies will be set on your computer.
