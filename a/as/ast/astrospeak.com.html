    <strong>INFORMATION SHARING</strong>
</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
    <br>
    TIL shares the sensitive personal information to any third party without obtaining the prior consent of the User in the following limited circumstances:
</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
    <a name="_GoBack"></a>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>a)</strong>
    When it is requested or required by law or by any court or governmental agency or authority to disclose, for the purpose of verification of identity, or
    for the prevention, detection, investigation including cyber incidents, or for prosecution and punishment of offences. These disclosures are made in good
    faith and belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary for enforcing these Terms; for complying with the applicable laws and regulations.
</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
    <br>
    <strong>b)</strong>
    TIL proposes to share such information within its group companies and officers and employees of such group companies for the purpose of processing personal
    information on its behalf. We also ensure that these recipients of such information agree to process such information based on our instructions and in
    compliance with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.
</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>ACCESSING AND UPDATING PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong>
</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
    <br>
    When you use TIL's websites, we make good faith efforts to provide you, as and when requested by you, with access to your personal information and shall
    further ensure that any personal information or sensitive personal data or information found to be inaccurate or deficient shall be corrected or amended as
    feasible, subject to any requirement for such personal information or sensitive personal data or information to be retained by law or for legitimate business
    purposes. We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such
    requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the
    privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not
    otherwise required. In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would
    require a disproportionate effort. Because of the way we maintain certain services, after you delete your information, residual copies may take a period of
    time before they are deleted from our active servers and may remain in our backup systems.
</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
    <br>
    <strong>INFORMATION SECURITY</strong>
</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
    <br>
    We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These
    include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, including appropriate encryption and physical
    security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data.
</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
    <br>
    All information gathered on TIL is securely stored within the TIL controlled database. The database is stored on servers secured behind a firewall; access
    to the servers is password-protected and is strictly limited. However, as effective as our security measures are, no security system is impenetrable. We
    cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to us over
    the Internet. And, of course, any information you include in a posting to the discussion areas is available to anyone with Internet access.
</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
    <br>
    However the internet is an ever evolving medium. We may change our privacy policy from time to time to incorporate necessary future changes. Of course, our
    use of any information we gather will always be consistent with the policy under which the information was collected, regardless of what the new policy may
    be.
