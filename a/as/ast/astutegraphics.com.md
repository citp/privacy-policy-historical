## Where will personal information about you be stored?

The information that you provide to us will be transferred to and stored by Astute Graphics, either in an email account or on a web server. By supplying such information, you consent to the above transfer and storage.

Customers may wish to consider that certain personal information is used by Astute Graphics servers/websites for the purposes of granting access to software services on the sites such as upgrade requests or license activation/deactivation. This includes your name and order number, and is sourced from the central customers database with Astute Graphics stores.

## How do we share and disclose the information to third parties?

Astute Graphics does not sell your Personal Information to third parties for the purpose of marketing activities.

We may process your personal information for our legitimate business interests e.g. direct marketing, data analytics and/or enhancing/modifying/improving our website and user experience (see 'Legitimate Interests' section below).

Under certain circumstances we may be required to disclose your Personal Information in response to valid requests by public authorities such at the Police or security services.

## Legitimate Interests

"Legitimate Interests" means the interests of our company in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the best service/products and the best and most secure experience. For example, we have an interest in making sure our marketing is relevant for you, so we may process your information to send you marketing that is tailored to your interests. It can also apply to processing that is in your interests as well. For example, we may process your information to protect you against fraud when transacting on our website, and to ensure our website and systems are secure.

When we process your personal information for our legitimate interests, we make sure to consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative), and your rights under data protection laws. Our legitimate business interests do not automatically override your interests – we will not use your Personal Data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law).

If you have any concerns you have the right to object to processing that is based on our legitimate interests.

## Is Personal Information about me Secure?

We use appropriate technical, organisational and administrative security measures to protect any information we hold from loss, misuse, unauthorised access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. Unfortunately, no company or service can guarantee complete security. Unauthorised entry or use, hardware, or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of user information at any time.
