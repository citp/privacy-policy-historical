      PRIVACY POLICY<br>
      Date of original issue: January 1, 2004</b><br>
      <br>
      <b>INTRODUCTION</b><br>
      In 2000, the federal government of Canada enacted The Protection of 
      Personal Information and Electronic Documents Act ( "PIPEDA"). Effective 
      January 1, 2004, all organizations that collect, use or disclose personal 
      information in the course of their commercial activities will be subject 
      to PIPEDA or substantially similar provincial legislation (collectively, 
      "privacy legislation").<br>
      Briefly stated, privacy legislation requires that the consent of an 
      individual be obtained for the collection and use of his or her personal 
      information, that steps be taken to protect personal information and that 
      one or more individuals be appointed to monitor compliance with the 
      provisions of applicable privacy legislation.<br>
      CanWest Global Communications Corp. ("CanWest") and its subsidiaries, 
      (collectively, the "CanWest Companies"), are committed to controlling the 
      collection, use and disclosure of personal information provided by the 
      customers and employees of each CanWest Company and have adopted this 
      Privacy Policy to ensure the accuracy, confidentiality and integrity of 
      such personal information.<br>
      <b>APPLICATION</b><br>
      This Privacy Policy applies to personal information that a CanWest Company 
      collects, uses or discloses in respect of any of its customers or 
      employees in the course of its commercial activities.<br>
      It does not, however, apply in respect of the collection, use or 
      disclosure of the following information by a CanWest Company:<br>
      * information that is publicly available, such as a customer's name, 
      address, telephone number and electronic address, when listed in a 
      directory or made available through directory assistance; <br>
      * the name, title, business address or telephone number of an employee of 
      an organization; or<br>
      * personal information that a CanWest Company collects, uses or discloses 
      for journalistic, artistic or literary purposes and does not collect, use 
      or disclose for any other purpose.<br>
      The application of this Privacy Policy is subject to the requirements or 
      provisions of any applicable legislation, regulations, tariffs or 
      agreements (such as collective agreements), or the order of any court or 
      other lawful authority. Various legal criteria independent of this Privacy 
      Policy will determine whether federal or provincial privacy legislation 
      applies to the personal information that a CanWest Company collects, uses 
      or discloses in respect of its customers or employees. This Privacy Policy 
      does not replace those criteria and nothing in this Privacy Policy should 
      be construed as indicating which privacy legislation, if any, applies to 
      the collection, use and disclosure of personal information.<br>
      <b>DEFINITIONS</b><br>
      The following defined terms are used throughout this Privacy Policy:<br>

      either express or implied and can be provided directly by the individual

      electronically or in writing but is always unequivocal and does not 
      require an inference on the part of the CanWest Companies. Implied consent 
      is consent that can reasonably be inferred from an individual's action or 
      inaction.<br>
      Customer - means an individual who:<br>
      (a) subscribes for, uses, or applies to use, the products or services of a

      information, billing records, service and any recorded complaints and, in 
      the case of an employee, includes information found in personal employment 
      files, performance appraisals and medical and benefits information. 
      Publicly available information, such as a public directory listing of 
      names, addresses, telephone numbers and electronic addresses, however, is 
      not considered personal information.<br>
      Privacy legislation - means The Personal Information Protection and 
      Electronic Documents Act (Canada) and/or substantially similar provincial 
      legislation.<br>

      <b>THE TEN PRIVACY PRINCIPLES</b><br>
      This Privacy Policy has been developed in accordance with the standards 
      set out in PIPEDA and is modeled after the Canadian Standards Association 
      Model Code for the Protection of Personal Information, CAN/CSA-Q830-96 
      (the "CSA Code"). Accordingly, the ten principles of fair information 
      practices, as identified by the Canadian Standards Association, have been 
      adopted by the CanWest Companies and represent a formal statement of the 
      minimum requirements to be adhered to by each of the CanWest Companies for 
      the protection of personal information collected from the customers and 
      employees of the CanWest Companies.<br>
      <b>PRINCIPLE 1 - ACCOUNTABILITY</b><br>
      Each CanWest Company is responsible for the personal information under its 
      control and shall designate one or more individuals who shall be 
      accountable for the company's compliance with the procedures and 
      principles set out in this Privacy Policy. <br>
      1.1. Accountability for compliance by each Canwest Company with the 
      policies and procedures set out in this Privacy Policy rests with the 
      Privacy Compliance Officer for that company, even though other individuals 
      within the company may be responsible for the day-to-day collection and 
      processing of personal information. The Privacy Compliance Officer may, 
      from time to time, designate one or more individuals within the company to 
      act on his or her behalf.<br>
      1.2. The name and contact information of the Privacy Compliance Officer 
      for each CanWest Company shall be made available on the CanWest website at 
      www.canwestglobal.com, or the CanWest Intranet site and shall be made 
      available upon request.<br>
      1.3. Each CanWest Company shall be responsible for the personal 
      information in its possession or custody, including information that has 
      been transferred to a third party for processing. Each CanWest Company 
      shall use contractual or other appropriate means to ensure a comparable 
      level of protection while the information is being processed by a third 
      party.<br>
      1.4. The CanWest Companies have implemented policies and practices to give 
      effect to the principles and procedures set out in this Privacy Policy, 
      including:<br>
      (a) implementing procedures to protect personal information such as the 
      adoption of physical, organization and technological security measures;<br>
      (b) establishing procedures to receive and respond to complaints and 
      inquiries through the establishment of a confidential e-mail address and 
      dedicated phone line;<br>
      (c) training and communicating to staff information about the Canwest 
      policies and practices; and<br>
      (d) developing public information to explain the Canwest policies and 
      procedures.<br>
      <b>PRINCIPLE 2. - IDENTIFYING PURPOSE</b><br>
      Each CanWest Company will identify the purpose for which personal 
      information is collected at or before the time the information is 
      collected. The purposes for which information is collected, used or 
      disclosed by a Canwest Company must be those that a reasonable person 
      would consider are appropriate in the circumstances.<br>
      2.1. Each CanWest Company will document the purposes for which personal 
      information is collected in order to comply with the Openness principle 
      (See Principle 8) and the Individual Access principle (See Principle 9).<br>
      2.2. Identifying the purposes for which personal information is collected 
      at or before the time of collection allows each CanWest Company to 
      determine the information it needs to collect to fulfill these purposes. 
      The Limiting Collection principle (Principle 4) requires each CanWest 
      Company to collect only that information necessary for the purposes that 
      have been identified.<br>
      2.3. The identified purposes for which personal information is collected 
      shall be specified at or before the time of collection to the customer or 
      employee from whom the personal information is collected. Depending upon 
      the way in which the information is collected, this shall be done orally 
      or in writing.<br>
      2.4. When a Canwest Company proposes to use personal information that has 
      been collected for a purpose not previously identified, it will identify 
      the new purpose before using such personal information. Unless the new 
      purpose is required by law, or consent is otherwise not required pursuant 
      to privacy legislation, the consent of the individual shall be obtained 
      before the personal information is used for the new purpose.<br>
      2.5. Individuals responsible for collecting personal information on behalf 
      of a CanWest Company will explain to customers and/or employees the 
      purposes for which the information is being collected, including any 
      purposes that may not be immediately obvious to the individual.<br>
      2.6 The purposes for which the personal information of employees is 
      collected may include, but is not limited to:<br>
      * administering payroll and employee benefit programs;<br>
      * conducting performance evaluations and discipline;<br>
      * effecting employee training;<br>
      * conducting internal reviews, investigations and complaint resolution 
      processes;<br>
      * participating in union negotiations and labour arbitrations;<br>
      * facilitating transactional due diligence reviews;<br>
      * complying with legal and regulatory obligations.<br>
      2.7 The purposes for which the personal information of customers is 
      collected may include, but is not limited to:<br>
      * processing commercial transactions;<br>
      * communicating with customers;<br>
      * establishing and maintaining commercial relations;<br>
      * developing, marketing or providing products and services;<br>
      * recommending particular products and services;<br>
      * conducting market research and surveys;<br>
      * managing and developing business opportunities; <br>
      * conducting investigations and complaint resolution processes;<br>
      * facilitating transactional due diligence reviews;<br>
      * complying with legal and regulatory obligations.<br>
      2.8 Anonymous or "non-personal" information gathered by a CanWest Company 
      through its web site may be used for technical, research and analytical 
      purposes. Information collected through surveys, existing files and public 
      archives may be used by a CanWest Company to analyze its markets and to 
      develop or enhance service offerings.<br>
      <b>PRINCIPLE 3. - CONSENT</b><br>
      The knowledge and consent of the individual are required for the 
      collection, use or disclosure of personal information, except where 
      consent is not required by privacy legislation as, for example, where the 
      collection, use or disclosure of personal information is solely for 
      journalistic, artistic or literary purposes.<br>
      3.1. Consent is required for the collection of personal information and 
      the subsequent use or disclosure of this information. Generally, each 
      CanWest Company will seek consent for the use or disclosure of the 
      information at the time of collection. In certain circumstances, consent 
      with respect to the use or disclosure of personal information may be 
      sought after the information has been collected but before the personal 
      information is used (for example, when a CanWest Company wants to use 
      information for a purpose not previously identified). In obtaining 
      consent, the CanWest Companies shall use reasonable efforts to ensure that 
      a customer or employee is advised of the identified purposes for which 
      personal information will be used or disclosed. Purposes shall be stated 
      in a manner that can be reasonably understood by the customer or employee.<br>
      3.2. In certain circumstances personal information may be collected, used 
      or disclosed without the knowledge and consent of the individual. For 
      example, a CanWest Company may collect or use personal information without 
      the knowledge or consent of its employees and/or customers if the 
      collection or use of personal information is clearly in the interests of 
      the individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way, such as 
      when the individual is a minor, seriously ill or mentally incapacitated or 
      if seeking the consent of the individual might defeat the purpose of 
      collecting the information such as in the investigation of a breach of an 
      agreement or a contravention of a federal or provincial law. Personal 
      information may also be used or disclosed without the knowledge or consent 
      of the individual in the case of an emergency where the life, health or 
      security of an individual is threatened. A CanWest Company may disclose 
      personal information without knowledge or consent to a lawyer representing 
      the company, to collect a debt, to comply with a subpoena, warrant or 
      other court order, or as may be otherwise required by law.<br>
      3.3. The CanWest Companies will not, as a condition of the supply of a 
      product or service, require an individual to consent to the collection, 
      use, or disclosure of information beyond that required to fulfill the 
      explicitly specified and legitimate purposes.<br>
      3.4. In obtaining consent, the CanWest Companies will take into account 
      the sensitivity of the personal information and the reasonable 
      expectations of its customers and employees. Consent will not be obtained 
      through deception. For example:<br>
      * A viewer who enters a contest online through www.canada.com would 
      reasonably expect that his or her relevant contact information (name, 
      phone number, personal identification) would be collected and used to 
      identify the viewer if and when he or she was selected as a contest 
      winner. However, the viewer would not reasonably expect that this 
      information would be used for a purpose other than the administration of 
      the contest, without the viewer's knowledge and consent.<br>
      * A newspaper subscriber would reasonably expect that a CanWest Company, 
      in addition to using the individual's name and address for mailing and 
      billing purposes, would also contact the subscriber to solicit the renewal 
      of his or her subscription.<br>
      * An individual filing an application for employment with a CanWest 
      Company would reasonably expect that his or her age and marital status 
      would be used for the purposes of administering benefit plans.<br>
      * An employee filing an application for CanWest's dental coverage plan 
      would reasonably expect that the relevant information (employee 
      identification number, name, date of birth) would be collected, used and 
      communicated to third parties in accordance with the dental coverage and 
      for such period of time as the coverage was in effect.<br>
      3.5 The way in which a CanWest Company seeks consent may vary, depending 
      on the circumstances and the type of information collected. A CanWest 
      Company will generally seek express consent when the information is likely 
      to be considered sensitive. It will rely on implied consent only where 
      collection and use of the personal information is directly related to a 
      transaction or exchange of information in which the individual is directly 
      participating. Consent may also be given by an authorized representative 
      (such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney).<br>
      3.6 Consent may be obtained in any one of the following ways:<br>
      * an application form may be used to seek consent, collect information and 
      inform the individual of the use that will be made of the information. By 
      completing and signing the form, the individual is giving consent to the 
      collection and the specified uses.<br>
      * a check-off box may be used to allow individuals to request that their 
      names and addresses not be given to other organizations. Individuals who 
      do not check the box are assumed to consent to the transfer of their 
      information to third parties;<br>
      * consent may be given orally when information is collected over the 
      telephone; or <br>
      * consent may be given at the time that individuals use a product or 
      service.<br>
      3.7 Generally, the use of products and services by a customer, or the 
      acceptance of employment or benefits by an employee, constitutes implied 
      consent for the CanWest Companies to collect, use and disclose personal 
      information for all identified purposes.<br>
      3.8 An individual may withdraw consent at any time, subject to legal or 
      contractual restrictions and reasonable notice. The CanWest Companies will 
      inform individuals of the implications of withdrawing consent. Customers 
      and employees may contact the relevant CanWest Company for more 
      information regarding the implications of withdrawing consent.<br>
      <b>PRINCIPLE 4 - LIMITING COLLECTION</b><br>
      The CanWest Companies shall limit the collection of personal information 
      to that which is necessary for the purposes identified by the company. 
      Personal information shall be collected by fair and lawful means. <br>
      4.1 The CanWest Companies will not collect personal information 
      indiscriminately. Both the amount and the type of information collected 
      shall be limited to that which is necessary to fulfill the purposes 
      identified. Each CanWest Company shall specify the type of information 
      collected as part of its information-handling policies and practices, in 
      accordance with the Openness principle (Principle 8).<br>
      4.2 The requirement that personal information be collected by fair and 
      lawful means is intended to prevent a CanWest Company from collecting 
      information by misleading or deceiving individuals about the purpose for 
      which information is being collected. Consent to the collection of 
      personal information must not be obtained through deception.<br>
      <b>PRINCIPLE 5 - LIMITING USE, DISCLOSURE AND RETENTION</b><br>
      Personal information shall not be used or disclosed for purposes other 
      than those for which it was collected, except with the consent of the 
      individual or as required by law. Personal information shall be retained 
      only as long as necessary for the fulfillment of the purposes for which it 
      was collected.<br>
      5.1 Where a CanWest Company intends to use personal information for a 
      purpose not previously identified, the CanWest Company shall document the 
      new purpose and shall obtain the consent of the individual prior to using 
      the information for a new purpose.<br>
      5.2 A CanWest Company may disclose the personal information of its 
      employees:<br>
      * to human resources, payroll, benefits, information management, medical 
      and security personnel;<br>
      * to third party service providers for the purposes of administering 
      payroll and benefits programs;<br>
      * to union representatives and labour arbitrators;<br>
      * to other CanWest Companies;<br>
      * to internal or external legal counsel and auditors;<br>
      * to the Privacy Compliance Officers of each CanWest Company;<br>
      * to the management personnel of each CanWest Company;<br>
      * in the context of providing references regarding current or former 
      employees in response to requests from prospective employers and/or 
      financial institutions;<br>
      * to prospective parties in the context of a transactional due diligence 
      review; and<br>
      * where disclosure is required by law.<br>
      5.3 A CanWest Company may disclose the personal information of its 
      customers:<br>
      * to third party service providers, including newspaper distributors and 
      carriers;<br>
      * to other CanWest Companies;<br>
      * to internal or external legal counsel and auditors;<br>
      * to the Privacy Compliance Officers of each CanWest Company;<br>
      * to the management personnel of each CanWest Company;<br>
      * to third parties for the development, enhancement or marketing of 
      CanWest products or services;<br>
      * to an agent retained by the CanWest Companies in connection with the 
      collection of the customer's account;<br>
      * to credit grantors and reporting agencies;<br>
      * to a third party or parties, where the customer consents to such 
      disclosure;<br>
      * to prospective parties in the context of a transactional due diligence 
      review; and<br>
      * where disclosure is required by law.<br>
      5.4 Except as required or permitted by law, when disclosure is made to a 
      party other than a CanWest Company or a third party provider of personal 
      information processing services, the consent of the individual shall be 
      obtained and reasonable steps shall be taken to ensure that any such third 
      party has personal information privacy procedures and policies in place 
      that are at least comparable to those implemented by the CanWest 
      Companies.<br>
      5.5 Unless authorized by the customer, the CanWest Companies will not 
      sell, lease or trade the personal information of their employees or 
      customers to other parties.<br>
      5.6 Personal information shall be kept only as long as it remains 
      necessary or relevant for the identified purposes or as required by law. 
      Depending on the circumstances, where personal information has been used 
      to make a decision about a customer or an employee, the relevant CanWest 
      Company shall retain, for a period of time that is reasonably sufficient 
      to allow for access by the customer or employee, either the actual 
      information or the rationale for making the decision.<br>
      5.7 The CanWest Companies have adopted guidelines and procedures with 
      respect to the retention of personal information. Personal information 
      that is no longer necessary or relevant for the identified purposes or 
      required by law to be retained, shall be destroyed, erased or made 
      anonymous in accordance with the CanWest Document Retention and 
      Destruction Policy.<br>
      PRINCIPLE 6 - ACCURACY<br>
      Personal information shall be as accurate, complete and up-to-date as is 
      necessary for the purposes for which it is to be used.<br>
      6.1 Personal information used by the CanWest Companies shall be 
      sufficiently accurate, complete and up-to-date to minimize the possibility 
      that inappropriate information may be used to make a decision about the 
      individual customer or employee. The extent to which personal information 
      will be accurate, complete and up-to-date will depend upon the use of the 
      information, taking into account the interests of the individual.<br>
      6.2 The CanWest Companies will not, however, routinely update personal 
      information, unless this is necessary to fulfill the purposes for which 
      the information was collected. Personal information about customers and 
      employees shall be updated only as and when necessary to fulfill the 
      identified purposes or upon notification by the individual.<br>
      6.3 Each CanWest Company shall ensure that personal information that is 
      used on an ongoing basis, including information that is disclosed to third 
      parties, is generally accurate and up-to-date, unless limits to the 
      requirement for accuracy are clearly set out.<br>
      <b>PRINCIPLE 7 - SAFEGUARDS</b><br>
      Personal information shall be protected by security safeguards appropriate 
      to the sensitivity of the information.<br>
      7.1 Each CanWest Company will implement security safeguards to protect 
      personal information against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized 
      access, disclosure, copying, use or modification, regardless of the format 
      in which the information is held.<br>
      7.2 The nature of the safeguards will vary depending on (i) the 
      sensitivity of the information that has been collected, (ii) the amount, 
      distribution and format of the information, and (iii) the method of 
      storage. <br>
      7.3 Physical measures such as locked filing cabinets and restricted access 
      to offices, organizational measures such as security clearances and 
      limiting access on a "need-to-know" basis, and technological measures such 
      as the use of passwords and encryption have been adopted by each CanWest 
      Company in accordance with the CanWest Document Retention and Destruction 
      Policy.<br>
      7.4 Each employee of a CanWest Company shall be made aware of the 
      importance of maintaining the confidentiality of personal information.<br>
      7.5 Personal information disclosed to third parties shall be protected by 
      contractual agreement stipulating the confidentiality of the information 
      and the purposes for which it is to be used.<br>
      7.6 The disposal or destruction of personal information shall be carried 
      out in accordance with the CanWest Document Retention and Destruction 
      Policy to prevent unauthorized access to personal information.<br>
      <b>PRINCIPLE 8 - OPENNESS</b><br>
      The CanWest Companies shall make readily available to its customers and 
      employees specific information about its policies and practices relating 
      to the management of personal information.<br>
      8.1 Each CanWest Company will be open about its policies and practices 
      with respect to the management of personal information. Customers and 
      employees shall be able to acquire information about the CanWest 
      Companies' policies and practices with respect to the management of 
      personal information without unreasonable effort. <br>
      8.2 Such information shall be made available through each of the CanWest 
      websites and through the CanWest Intranet sites and shall include: <br>
      * the name or title, and the address, of each Privacy Compliance Officer;<br>
      * the means of gaining access to personal information held by each CanWest 
      Company;<br>
      * a description of the type of personal information held by each CanWest 
      Company including a general account of its use;<br>
      * copies of any brochures or other information that explain the CanWest 
      Companies' policies, standards or codes; and<br>
      * a description of what personal information is made available to related 
      organizations (e.g. subsidiaries).<br>
      <b>PRINCIPLE 9 - INDIVIDUAL ACCESS</b><br>
      Upon request, an individual shall be informed of the existence, use and 
      disclosure of his or her personal information and shall be given access to 
      that information except where a CanWest Company is permitted or required 
      by law not to disclose personal information to the individual customer or 
      employee. An individual customer or employee shall be able to challenge 
      the accuracy and completeness of the information disclosed to him or her 
      and have it amended as appropriate.<br>
      9.1. Upon request, a CanWest Company shall inform an individual customer 
      or employee whether it holds personal information about that individual 
      (except where permitted or required by law not to disclose personal 
      information) and shall afford the individual a reasonable opportunity to 
      review the personal information in his or her file at minimal or no cost 
      to the individual. The CanWest Company shall provide an account of the use 
      that has been made or is being made of the personal information and an 
      account of the third parties to which the personal information has been 
      disclosed. Where reasonably possible, the CanWest Company shall indicate 
      the source of the personal information.<br>
      9.2 In order to safeguard personal information, a customer or employee may 
      be required to provide sufficient identification information to permit the 
      CanWest Company to account for the existence, use and disclosure of 
      personal information and to authorize access to the individual's file. Any 
      such information shall be used only for this purpose.<br>
      9.3 In certain situations, the CanWest Companies may not be able to 
      provide access to all of the personal information that they hold about a 
      customer or employee. For example, the CanWest Companies are not required 
      to provide access to information if doing so would likely reveal personal 
      information about a third party or could reasonably be expected to 
      threaten the life or security of another individual. Similarly, the 
      CanWest Companies may not be required to provide access to information if 
      disclosure would reveal confidential commercial information, if the 
      information is protected by solicitor-client privilege, if the information 
      was generated in the course of a formal dispute resolution process, or if 
      the information was collected in relation to the investigation of a breach 
      of an agreement or a contravention of a federal or provincial law. If 
      access to personal information cannot be provided, the CanWest Companies 
      shall provide the reasons for denying access upon request.<br>
      9.4 In providing an account of third parties to which it has disclosed 
      personal information about a customer or an employee, the CanWest Company 
      shall attempt to be as specific as possible. When it is not possible to 
      provide a list of the organizations to which it has actually disclosed 
      personal information, the CanWest Company shall provide a list of 
      organizations to which it may have disclosed personal information about 
      the customer or employee.<br>
      9.5 The CanWest Companies will respond to an individual's request within a 
      reasonable time and in any event within thirty (30) days of the request. 
      The time for responding to a request may be extended for up to an 
      additional thirty (30) days if meeting the time limit would unreasonably 
      interfere with the activities of the CanWest Company, or if the time 
      required to undertake any consultations necessary to respond to the 
      request would make the time limit impracticable to meet. The CanWest 
      Companies may also extend the time for responding for such period of time 
      as is necessary to be able to convert the personal information into an 
      alternative format. The CanWest Companies will provide notice to the 
      individual of any extension taken within thirty (30) days of the 
      individual's request and will advise the individual of the right to make a 
      complaint to the Privacy Commissioner about the extension. They will 
      provide the requested information or make it available in a form that is 
      generally understandable. For example, if abbreviations or codes are used 
      to record information, the CanWest Company will provide a corresponding 
      explanation.<br>
      9.6 Upon request by an individual with sensory disabilities, the CanWest 
      Company will give access to personal information about the individual in 
      an alternative format if a version of the information already exists in 
      that format or if its conversion to an alternative format is necessary to 
      allow the individual to exercise rights to request correction, challenge 
      compliance of the CanWest Company under Principle 10 or file a formal 
      complaint pursuant to applicable privacy legislation.<br>
      9.7 The CanWest Companies shall promptly correct or complete any personal 
      information found to be inaccurate or incomplete. Any unresolved 
      differences as to the accuracy or completeness shall be noted in the 
      individual's file. Where appropriate, the CanWest Companies shall transmit 
      to third parties having access to the personal information in question any 
      amended information or the existence of any unresolved differences.<br>
      9.8 A customer can obtain information or seek access to his or her 
      individual file by contacting CanWest Reader Sales and Service. An 
      employee can obtain information or seek access to his or her individual 
      file by contacting his or her immediate supervisor within the applicable 
      CanWest Company.<br>
      <b>PRINCIPLE 10 - CHALLENGING COMPLIANCE</b><br>
      An individual customer or employee shall be able to address a challenge 
      concerning compliance with the principles in this Privacy Policy to his or 
      her designated Privacy Compliance Officer.<br>
      10.1 The CanWest Companies shall maintain procedures for addressing and 
      responding to all inquiries or complaints from its customers and employees 
      about the companies' handling of personal information.<br>
      10.2 The CanWest Companies will inform their customers and employees about 
      the existence of these procedures as well as the availability of complaint 
      procedures.<br>
      10.3 The CanWest Companies shall investigate all complaints concerning 
      compliance with this Privacy Policy. If a complaint is found to be 
      justified, the relevant CanWest Company shall take appropriate measures to 
      resolve the complaint including, if necessary, amending its policies and 
      procedures. A customer or employee shall be informed of the outcome of the 
      investigation regarding his or her complaint.<br>
      10.4 If an individual is not satisfied with the response from the Privacy 
      Compliance Officer, he or she may have recourse to additional remedies 
      under applicable privacy legislation. For further information, contact the 
      applicable governmental agency listed in the attached Schedule A.<br>
