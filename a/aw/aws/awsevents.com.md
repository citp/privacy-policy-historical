# AWS Privacy

Amazon Web Services, Inc. (“AWS”) knows that you care how your information is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly.  


**What is covered by this Privacy Policy:**

This AWS Privacy Policy describes how we collect and use information that customers provide to us in connection with the creation or administration of AWS accounts, which we refer to as “Account Information”. For example, Account Information includes names, usernames, phone numbers, email addresses and billing information associated with a customer’s AWS account.

This AWS Privacy Policy applies to customers’ Account Information and does not apply to the content that customers store on our system, including any personal information of their end users. AWS will not disclose, move, access or use customer content except as provided in the customer’s agreement with AWS. See your agreement with AWS and the [AWS Data Protection FAQ](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/data-privacy-faq/) for more information about how we handle content you store on our systems.

**How AWS uses Account Information:**

AWS is a subsidiary of Amazon.com, Inc. or its affiliates (“Amazon.com”). As a subsidiary of Amazon.com, AWS follows the same information practices as Amazon.com, and Account Information we collect is subject to the [Amazon.com Privacy Notice](http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=468496). By visiting the AWS site, you are accepting the practices described in the [Amazon.com Privacy Notice](http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=468496). Please note that, if you have an account on [www.amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com/) and an Amazon.com cookie, Account Information gathered by AWS, may be correlated with any personally identifiable information that Amazon.com has and used by AWS and Amazon.com to improve the services we offer.

**Safe Harbor Programs:**

Amazon.com, Inc. and its controlled U.S. subsidiaries, including Amazon Web Services, Inc., are participants in the Safe Harbor program developed by the U.S. Department of Commerce and (1) the European Union and (2) Switzerland, respectively. Amazon has certified that we adhere to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles agreed upon by the U.S. and (1) the European Union and (2) Switzerland, respectively. For more information about the Safe Harbor and to view our certification, visit the [U.S. Department of Commerce's Safe Harbor Web site  __](http://www.export.gov/safeharbor).

In compliance with the US-EU and US-Swiss Safe Harbor Principles, we endeavor to resolve all complaints about privacy and the collection or use of customer information. If you have questions about our participation in the Safe Harbor program or have a complaint, please send an e-mail to [safeharbor@amazon.com](mailto:safeharbor@amazon.com).

Under the Safe Harbor program, any unresolved privacy complaints can be referred to an independent dispute resolution mechanism. We use the BBB EU Safe Harbor Program, which is operated by the Council of Better Business Bureaus. If you feel that we have not satisfactorily addressed your complaint, you can visit the BBB EU Safe Harbor Program web site at [www.bbb.org/us/safe-harbor-complaints  __](http://www.bbb.org/council/eusafeharbor/bbb-eu-safe-harbor-dispute-resolution-program/)for more information on how to file a complaint.
