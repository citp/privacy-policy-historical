# Privacy Management Policy | The Australian War Memorial

##  Privacy Management Policy

The Australian War Memorial (Memorial) takes the matter of information privacy seriously. It endeavours at all times to protect and handle personal information in a manner consistent with its obligations under the _Privacy Act 1988_ (Privacy Act), the _Privacy Amendment (Enhancing Privacy Protection) Act 2012_ , the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) and the APP Code for Australian Government Agencies.

This policy has been developed and is maintained in accordance with the Australian War Memorial’s Director’s Instruction _9.02 Handling of Personal Information_.

## Overview

The Memorial's purpose is to commemorate the sacrifice of those Australians who have died in war. Its mission is to assist Australians to remember, interpret and understand the Australian experience of war and its enduring impact on Australian society.

The Memorial deals with personal information in relation to its main functions as a memorial, museum and an archive and the activities that support these functions. Such activities include:

  * Commemoration, ceremony or events
  * Collections development and management
  * Exhibitions development and management
  * School education programs
  * Fundraising, including retail operations
  * Marketing
  * Sponsorship and supporters programs
  * Volunteer programs
  * Personnel recruitment and contract management
  * Communications including personal and corporate correspondence
  * Social media and online activity



These and other activities often require the Memorial to collect contact information and personal details of individuals wishing to be involved in or have access to the Memorial’s collections and programs.

All such activities are carried out by the Memorial in accordance with the powers and limitations of the _Australian War Memorial Act 1980_.

The Memorial carefully balances the need for information from those wishing to access its archives, programs and services with the amount and type of information it collects and the manner in which it stores, uses and shares this information.

The Memorial is also mindful of privacy issues when providing access to personal recollections, accounts and material held in the National Collection. These records may also be subject to government regulations in relation to classified information and public access to records may also be withheld on these grounds.

This Privacy Management Policy outlines how we will comply with the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) and the APP Code for Australian Government Agencies.

This Privacy Management Policy outlines how we will handle requests for access to or correction of personal information and complaints about our handling of privacy related matters.

## 2\. Personal information Collection (APP 1-5)

### 2.1 Personal Information collection

Personal information must only be collected by lawful and fair means and only when it is reasonably necessary or directly related to the Memorial’s activities.

Collection must not be unreasonably intrusive nor should it be collected on the basis that it may be useful in future.

_**Example:** When collecting information relating to booking a seat at a commemorative event only an email address needs to be collected to alert attendees to critical event changes. Information not necessary for this specific purpose, such as a home address or landline telephone number, should not be collected. If the Memorial is seeking additional information, such as postcode of residence, for demographic or research purposes it should be clearly labelled as such and the process should make provision of that data as ‘opt-in’ only._

### 2.2 Sensitive Information collection

Memorial Personnel must generally only collect Sensitive Information with the individual’s consent and when the information is reasonably necessary for one or more of the Memorial’s functions or activities.

_**Example:** Racial or ethnic information may only be collected from job applicants in relation to Identified or Special Measures employment opportunities and only with the express consent of applicants._

There are limited circumstances where consent is not required as outlined in the APP, the exemptions most likely to apply to the Memorial relate to security matters and include:

  * Instances where it is unreasonable or impracticable to obtain consent and the Memorial has a reasonable belief that the information is needed to lessen or prevent a serious threat to the life, health or safety of an individual or the public; or
  * the Memorial has a reasonable belief that the information is needed in order to take action on suspected unlawful activity or misconduct of a serious nature



_**Example:** Memorial Personnel attending a medical emergency may collect Sensitive Information regarding a person’s health from a third party or personal effects in order to perform first aid._

### 2.3 Collection of information from third parties

Where possible, Memorial Personnel must collect Personal Information only from the individual concerned. If Personal Information about an individual is collected from another source, Memorial Personnel must take reasonable steps to ensure that the individual is or has been made aware the Memorial has collected the information and provided with an approved Privacy Statement.

_**Example:** Bequest or donor information is sent to individuals on a mailing list acquired from a third party - the Memorial should ensure that communication with persons on this list includes how the Memorial obtained their personal information and an approved Privacy Statement._

### 2.4 Notification of data collection

Where Personal Information is collected or solicited from forms or websites, Memorial personnel should ensure that an approved Privacy Statement is included on the web page or form.

Where Personal Information is specifically sought through personal contact (e.g. on-site surveys; phone; onsite Research Centre enquiries) Memorial Personnel must inform the individual of the data being collected and availability of the Privacy Policy on the Memorial’s website.

This may be achieved through a verbal Privacy Statement or for common on-site activities through the use of approved Privacy Statement signage.

**_Example:_** _Signage with an approved Privacy Statement should be clearly visible within the Research Centre to inform visitors that personal information may be collected in order to provide appropriate access to materials held in the National Collection._

Privacy Statements should be tailored depending on the level of information collected and the purpose for which it is used. Privacy Statements can be approved by Section or Branch Heads.

Approved Privacy Statements must include at a minimum:

  * A contact phone number or email for requests for information or complaints
  * Information on where the Memorial’s Privacy Policy can be found
  * whether the information will be disclosed to a third party
  * Any significant consequences if information in not provided



**_Example:_** _A Privacy Statement included in relation to volunteering or staff recruitment should note that 'If you do not provide the required information your application may not be processed or assessed.'_

### 2.5 Unsolicited Personal Information

Unsolicited Personal Information is information that the Memorial receives but did not actively seek to collect.

Unsolicited Personal Information that is not reasonably necessary or directly related to the Memorial’s functions or activities must be destroyed or de-identified, unless it is necessary to preserve the document in order to comply with recordkeeping obligations. If retained it should be treated in accordance with the principles in this plan.

**_Example:_** _An unsolicited CV is sent to the Memorial and retained for consideration of future job opportunities, the sender should be informed the Memorial has retained their Personal Information and provided with a suitable Privacy Statement._

### 2.6 Anonymity and pseudonymity

Wherever practicable the Memorial will provide the opportunity for people to deal with us anonymously or pseudonymously.

**_Example:_** _Surveys should only include fields for name, email address or phone number if the Memorial intends to follow up with the individual completing the survey._

## 3\. Use and disclosure (APP 6-9)

The Memorial will generally only use or disclose Personal Information for the purpose of conducting activities in accordance with the Australian War Memorial Act 1980 or where an individual would reasonably expect the Memorial to use or disclose the information for another purpose.

**_Example:_** _The Memorial may use an email address provided as part of a research enquiry to contact the correspondent for the purposes of conducting that research. The Memorial may not use that information for general mailing list activities unless the correspondent has specifically ‘opted-in’ to receive such email._

The Memorial may also use or disclose Personal Information for another purpose in special circumstances as allowed for within the Privacy Act, such as with the individual's consent or for health and safety or law enforcement reasons.

### 3.3 Cross-Border Disclosure

Unless express consent has been given for cross-border transfer the Memorial must only do so after conducting a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) and only when it is assured that the cross-border party is willing and able to manage the information in accordance with the APPs.

**_Example:_** _The Memorial must conduct a PIA prior to transferring Personal Information to a cloud service including assessing the location of the server(s) the information will be held on and assuring itself that the company and nation of holding will do so in accordance with the APPs._
