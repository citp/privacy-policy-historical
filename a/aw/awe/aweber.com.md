**Here's what we do - and, more importantly, don't do - with any information you provide us.**

### "I Am An AWeber Affiliate."

Your name, address, phone and fax number, email address, tax ID number or SSN and any other information you provide are held in strict confidence. We collect this information only so we can generate your commission checks and so we can meet United States federal tax requirements.

We do not sell or share your information with anyone else.

  


### "I Am A Subscriber To An Email List Managed Using AWeber."

Your email address, name and any other information you provide such as address and phone number you provide to our customers are held in strict confidence. We only keep your information so that the customer whose email list you signed up to can email you.

We do not contact you. We do not sell or share your information with anyone else.

AWeber collects information under the direction of its Clients, and has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it processes. AWeber works with its Clients to help them provide notice to their customers concerning, the purpose for which personal information is collected.

AWeber has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it processes. An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data should direct his query to the AWeber's Client (the data controller).

### Newsletters

If you wish to subscribe to our newsletter(s), we will use your name and email address to send the newsletter to you. If you no longer wish to receive our newsletters you may follow the unsubscribe instructions contained in each of the communications you receive.

  


### What About Clear Gifs?

We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information.

We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.

  


### "I Am An AWeber Customer."

Your account information is held in strict confidence. All customers' account information is.

We do not sell or share your information with anyone. We only collect information like your name, email address, mailing address, phone number, and billing information so we can provide the [email marketing](https://www.aweber.com/) services described on this website.

  


### Service Providers

We use other third parties such as a credit card processing company to bill you for services and a Live Chat service to assist you if you have questions while using our site or regarding your order. When you sign up for our services we will share your personal information only as necessary for the third party to provide that service.

  


### Legal Disclaimer

We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site.

In the event AWeber goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personally identifiable information will likely be among the assets transferred. You will be notified via email of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.

  


### Access To Personal Information

If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct, update or deactivate it by making the change on our member information page or by emailing our Customer Support at [help@aweber.com](mailto:help@aweber.com). We will respond to your request to access within 30 days.

We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

  


### Security

The security of your personal information and our clients' information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as login credentials and credit card information) we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).

We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can [contact us](https://www.aweber.com/contact-us.htm).
