 **Here's what we do - and, more importantly, don't do - with any information you provide us.**

## "I Am An AWeber Affiliate."

Your name, address, phone and fax number, email address, tax ID number or SSN and any other information you provide are held in strict confidence. We collect this information only so we can generate your commission checks and meet United States federal tax requirements.

We do not sell or share your information with anyone else.

## "I Am A Subscriber To An Email List Managed Through AWeber."

Your email address, name and any other information you provide, such as address and phone number you provide to our Clients, are held in strict confidence. We only keep your information so that our Client, whose email list you subscribed to, can email you.

We do not contact you. We do not sell or share your information with anyone else.

We collect information under the direction of our Clients, and have no direct relationship with you, whose personal data we process. We work with our Clients to help them provide notice to their subscribers concerning the purpose for which personal information is collected.

If you are a subscriber of one of our Clients and would no longer like to be contacted by our Client, please contact the our Client that you interact with directly. If you are one of our Clients and would like to update your account, please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/web/20151226110558id_/http%3A//www.aweber.com/contact-us.htm).

We have no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data we process. An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data, should direct his or her query to our Client (the data controller). If our Client requests that we remove the data, we will respond to their request within 30 business days.

We may transfer personal information to companies that help us provide our service. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the provisions in our Policy regarding notice and choice and the service agreements with our Clients.

We will retain personal data we process on behalf of our Clients for as long as needed in order to provide services to our Clients. We will retain and use this personal information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

## "I Am An AWeber Customer."

All account information for our Clients is held in strict confidence.

We do not sell or share your information with anyone.

## Service Providers

We use other third parties, such as a credit card processing company, to bill you for services and a Live Chat service to assist you if you have questions while using our website or regarding your order. When you sign up for our services, we will share your personal information only as necessary for the third party to provide that service.

## Legal Disclaimer

We reserve the right to disclose your personal information as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or similar legal process, and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our website.

In the event we go through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personal information will likely be among the assets transferred. You will be notified via email of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.

## Access To Personal Information

If your personal information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct, update, delete or deactivate it by making the change on our member information page or by [contacting us](https://web.archive.org/web/20151226110558id_/http%3A//www.aweber.com/contact-us.htm).

The security of your personal information and our Clients’ information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information, such as login credentials and credit card information, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).

We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
