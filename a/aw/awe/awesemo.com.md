**Internet-Based Online Advertising and Google Analytics**

This section of our Privacy Policy provides details about interest-based online advertising (also called “targeted advertising”, “remarketing”, or “behavioural advertising”), Google Analytics, and your choices with respect to this type of advertising.

We use Google Analytics’ third-party audience data such as age, gender, and interests to better understand the behavior of our customers and work with companies that collect information about your online activities to provide advertising targeted to suit your interests and preferences.  For example, you may see certain ads on this website or other websites because we contract with Google and other similar companies to target our ads based on information we or they have collected, including information that was collected through automated means (such as cookies and web beacons).  These companies also use automated technologies to collect information when you click on our ads, which helps track and manage the effective of our marketing efforts.

You may opt out of the automated collection of information by third-party ad networks for the purpose of delivering advertisements tailored t your interests, by visiting the consumer opt-out page for the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising at http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ and edit or opt-out your Google Display Network ads’ preferences at http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/. Because those opt-oit and preference control pages are specific to the individual browser used to visit it, and because that page is not operated by Awesemo.com, we are unable to perform the opt-outs on your behalf.

Awesemo.com respects your privacy and, under ordinary circumstances, will not disclose the personal or personally identifiable information you provide to us to third parties.
