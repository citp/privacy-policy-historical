AWN Privacy Policy

Updated August 28, 2009

This is the official privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") and statement of AWN, Inc., AWN.com, VFXWorld.com, AWNtv.com, AIDB.com, AnimationBlogspot.com as well as the associated web pages, features and functions made available to you from these websites (collectively, "AWN") and is a part of the Terms of Service agreement we have with you regarding your use of AWN. The protection of your privacy is important to us.  AWN has established the following guidelines and procedures protecting the privacy of all our users. This Privacy Policy applies to all products, services and websites provided under the AWN name or any AWN subsidiaries (collectively, AWN’s “Services.”) It explains how AWN treats personal information that we collect and receive on the AWN website from our users and visitors. You should be aware that this Privacy Policy does not apply to websites that you visit before or after your visit to AWN, to other third party services featured on the AWN website, or to third party advertisers or affiliates (collectively, "Third Party Services").

**What information does AWN collect and how do we use it?**

Personal information is information about you that is not otherwise available to the public. This may include but is not limited to account registration information such as your desired username and password, e-mail address, country, age and gender. Personal information may also include information about your personal preferences, such as IP address (which cannot personally identify you), survey responses (from which you can always opt-out), user communication, server log records, session or cookie tracking data. We may use the information we obtain from you to display content we think may be of interest to you. AWN also aggregates user data that can help us tailor and enhance our user’s experience. We may use demographic and preference information to allow advertising on our Web sites to be targeted, in aggregate, to the users for whom they are most pertinent. This means users see advertising that is most likely to interest them, and advertisers send their messages to people who are most likely to be receptive, improving both the user’s experience and the effectiveness of the ads.

When you visit AWN, we place cookies on your computer, as is standard practice on many websites.  These cookies allow us to retain your individual preferences, uniquely identify your browser and help us enhance your user experience. Most browsers are set to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some AWN features and services may not work properly if your cookies are disabled.

**With whom do we share information?**

AWN will not distribute, sell or rent any of the personal information about you to other people or nonaffiliated companies except to enable the provision of services or products you have requested or when we have your permission to do so. Your e-mail address may be used by us for communications related to the AWN services, including but not limited to, sending you notices about new features, products, or other information of interest to you. You can always opt out of receiving these notices.

Our advertisers and affiliates may be provided general information or data regarding member usage patterns or interests, or other general demographic information so that they can better serve your needs and preferences. However, such disclosure will not include individually identifiable information. The collection of usage and interest information allows us to continually evolve AWN services, products and features so we can better serve our user needs.

However, AWN may disclose information you provide if required to do so by law or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is necessary to (1) comply with the law or with legal process served on AWN; (2) enforce the AWN Terms of Service; (3) protect the rights, property or personal safety of AWN, its users or the public; or (4) respond to claims that any published materials violates the rights of third parties.

In the event that AWN is acquired by another company, your personal information may be part of the assets transferred to the acquiring party.
