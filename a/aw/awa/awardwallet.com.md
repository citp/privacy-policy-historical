#### 1\. Information We Collect and Receive

We collect several different types of information to provide Services to you, including:

**Customer Account and Registration Data:** This includes information you provide to create your account with us and may include, first and last name, third party loyalty reward program information, travel reservation information, a password and a valid email address.

**Service Data (including Session and Usage data):**

When you use our Services, we receive information generated through the use of the Service (for example, third party reward programs), or from the Service infrastructure itself, (for example, duration of session, connection information, etc.) We may also collect usage and log data about how the services are accessed and used, including information about the device you are using the Services on, IP addresses, location information, language settings, what operating system you are using, unique device identifiers and other diagnostic data to help us support the Services.

**Third Party Data:** We may receive information about you from other sources, including publicly available databases or third parties from whom we have purchased data, and combine this data with information we already have about you. We may also receive information from other affiliated companies that are a part of our corporate group. This helps us to update, expand and analyze our records, identify new prospects for marketing, and provide products and services that may be of interest to you.

**Location Information:** We collect your location-based information and IP address for the purpose of providing and supporting the service and for fraud prevention and security monitoring.

**Device Information:** When you use our Services, we automatically collect information on the type of device you use, operating system version, and the device identifier (or "UDID").

**Legal Basis for Processing (EEA Individuals Only):** If you are from the European Economic Area (“EEA”), our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it. 

However, we will normally collect personal information from you where we have your consent to do so, where we need the personal information to perform Services, or where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect the personal information in question. 

If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to provide you with Services, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information).

Similarly, if we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our or a third party's legitimate interests and those interests are not already listed above, we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are. 

If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information, please [contact us](https://awardwallet.com/contact).

#### 3\. Analytics, Cookies and Other Web Site Technologies

AwardWallet is continuously improving our websites and products through the use of various third party web analytics tools, which help us understand how visitors use our websites, desktop tools, and mobile applications, what they like and dislike, and where they may have problems. While we maintain ownership of this data, we do not share this type of data about individual users with third parties.

Geolocation and Other Data:

We may utilize precise geolocation data but only if you specifically opt-in to collection of that data in connection with a particular service. We also use information such as IP addresses to determine the general geographic locations areas of our visitors. The web beacons used in conjunction with these web analytics tools may gather data such as what browser or operating system a person uses, as well as, domain names, MIME types, and what content, products and services are reviewed or downloaded when visiting or registering for services at one of our websites or using one of our mobile applications.

Google Analytics and Adobe Marketing Cloud:

We use Google Analytics as described in [“How Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps.”](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/) You can prevent your data from being used by Google Analytics on websites by installing the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on [here](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout). We also employ IP address masking, a technique used to truncate IP addresses collected by [Google Analytics](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/) and store them in an abbreviated form to prevent them from being traced back to individual users.

Tracking Technologies:

AwardWallet and our partners use cookies and similar tracking technologies to track user traffic patterns and hold certain registration information. Tracking technologies also used are beacons, tags and scripts to collect and track information and to improve and analyze our service. If you wish to not have the information these technologies collect used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out in your account profile if you have the AwardWallet Plus service. The Help menu on the menu bar of most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie and how to disable cookies altogether. You can still review the website if you choose to set your browser to refuse all cookies; however, you must enable cookies to establish an account and to install the Services.

We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our mobile software on your phone. This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from. We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personally identifiable information you submit within the mobile application.

These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. These services will also authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information with us such as your name and email address to pre-populate our sign-up form or provide feedback. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing them.

#### 9\. Security

AwardWallet follows generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once it is received, however, no security measure is perfect.
