**California Do Not Track Disclosures**

Certain web browsers may include settings that allow you to provide “do not track” (DNT) signals to the websites you visit. However, DNT is an evolving technology that currently lacks finalized industry protocols and standards. As such, the Websites do not currently respond to DNT signals, but instead adhere to the standards set forth in this Privacy Policy. For more information about DNT, please visit [www.allaboutdnt.com](http://www.allaboutdnt.com/).

When you visit the Websites, our third-party advertising partners, social media providers (e.g., Facebook, Pinterest) and analytics providers (e.g., Google Analytics) may collect information about your online activity on the Websites and on third-party websites. These providers may set web tracking tools (e.g., cookies and web beacons) to collect non-personally identifiable information regarding your online activity (e.g., Traffic Data). In addition, our advertising partners may use this information to deliver advertisements to you when you visit third-party websites within their networks. Please see the “Advertising” section above for more information, including how to opt-out.
