---|---  
We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete order that you submit through the AMLI.com website.

We may use your e-mail address to communicate with you, for example, to notify you of special offers or programs you might find of interest.

We use the information you provide about someone else when forwarding a job listing only to send that listing and to confirm delivery.

We use return e-mail addresses to answer the e-mail we receive. We may also use these e-mail addresses to provide order status and order tracking information, and to respond to queries.

We may, with your prior permission, use the content of your submissions on our website for promotional or marketing purposes.

We may use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and share with our advertising agencies. For example, we may tell an advertising agency that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose your Personal Information or anything that could be used to personally identify those individuals.

If you choose to register or receive products or materials from us, or to otherwise give us Personal Information, we may store some or all of that personal information and use it for internal AMLI marketing research and marketing purposes.

We will never share your Personal Information with any other company.

In the event of a criminal investigation or a suspected illegal activity, we may be required by law enforcement agencies to share certain Personal Information.

Finally, we never use or share Personal Information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.

"Cookies" are small items of data that some websites either write to your hard drive upon your visit to their site(s) or store in the browser. These data files contain information the site can use to organize the pages you have visited on a particular website. Our website may use "cookie" technology to measure site activity and tailor information to fit your personal interests. In this way, we can deliver tailor-made information suiting your personal interests upon your next visit to our site(s). Our use of "cookie" technology is, thus, to provide you with a more individualized delivery of information and an optimal viewing experience.   
**_Pixel Tags_** |  Back to top

We may use "pixel tags," which are small graphic files that allow us to monitor the use of our websites. A pixel tag can collect information such as the IP (Internet Protocol) address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the tag appears; the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) of the page on which the pixel tag appears; the time the page containing the pixel tag was viewed; the type of browser that fetched the pixel tag; and the identification number of any cookie (please see A Word On "Cookies") on the computer previously placed by that server. When corresponding with you via HTML capable e-mail, we may use "format sensing" technology, which allows pixel tags to let us know whether you received and opened our e-mail.
