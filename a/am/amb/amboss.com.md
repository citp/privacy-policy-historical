These include, for example, companies specializing in i.e. payment processing, the transfer of goods or the delivery of newsletters.

**2.2.  **Personal data shall only be transferred to third parties on the basis of legal allowances and within the framework of legal provisions. We are only transferring personal data to third parties if this is necessary on the basis of art. 6 par. 1 lit. b GDPR for the fulfillment of the contract or when we pursue our legitimate interests in accordance to art. 6 par. 1 lit. f GDPR. If third parties are assigned with the processing of data within the scope of a so-called ‘commissioned-processing contract’ this is done on the basis of art. 28 GDPR.

**2.3.**  Provided we are using services of third parties in order to perform a service, we are taking appropriate legal measures as well as technical and organisational measures in order to ensure the protection of personal data according to the relevant legal provisions.

**2.4.**  These measures may include the transfer of personal data to servers outside of the EU or trustworthy third parties based outside the EU for fulfilment of contract. You should be aware that some countries might not offer the same lawful protection of personal data as EU member states. While your personal data is stored in another country, courts, law enforcement authorities and national authorities of the respective country may access this data in conformity with the national laws. Subject to legal regulations we promise that every third party processing your personal data outside of the EU must take measures to ensure maximum security of your data according to our instructions as well as EU legislation. Therefore we only have data processed in a third country if the requirements according to art. 44 ff. GDPR are fulfilled.

What information we collect3. Fulfillment of Contractual Agreements / User-Account

**3.1.  **We are processing basic data (i.e. name, address and further contact data), contractual data (i.e. payment information, services received and/or used) for the fulfillment of the contractual obligations and services in accordance with art. 6 par. 1 lit. b GDPR.
