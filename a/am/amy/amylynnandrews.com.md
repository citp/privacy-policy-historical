# Privacy Policy - Amy Lynn Andrews

Privacy is good. I like it and I assume you do too. As a reader of mine, your privacy is important to me. 

### The Chips and Salsa Version

There may be third party advertisers and companies which utilize cookies to provide advertisements that would most interest you. I have no control over said cookies. This is not unique to my site, but is common across the internet.

Your IP address and other information (such as the day and time of your visit) is tracked for the purpose of understanding trends and helping me provide information that is most relevant and helpful. Again, this is not unique to this site, but is common practice across the internet.

On AmyLynnAndrews.com you’ll find a lot of links to other sites, over which I have no control, nor do I have control over the privacy policies of those sites. Policies of other sites may differ from mine.
