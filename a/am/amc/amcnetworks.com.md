This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) is effective as of February 13, 2013, for AMC Networks Inc. and its subsidiaries (“AMC”, “we”, “us”, or “our”). It applies to the Website and all other Websites owned or operated by AMC, including, but not limited to, AMCNetworks.com, AMCtv.com, Filmsite.org, IFC.com, IFCAdSales.com, IFCCenter.com, IFCFilms.com, Press.amcnetworks.com, Sundance.tv, SundanceSelects.com, SundanceNow.com, WEtv.com and Yeahtv.com, as well as other AMC services, features, applications or functions offered or made available on or through the Website or other services or applications, mobile applications, and/or social networking applications (collectively, “the Services”). Furthermore, the Policy applies regardless of the device used to access the Website and/or the Services (e.g., personal computer, mobile device, consumer electronics device, or any other technology or software known today or developed in the future). ****

Please carefully review this Policy. Your use of any part of the Website or Services indicates your acceptance of this Policy and your consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your information in accordance with this Policy.

As we update and expand our services, we reserve the right to modify this Policy at any time. Any changes will be posted here. Please check this page periodically for changes. Your continued use of the Website or Services after changes have been made to the Policy indicates your acceptance of the terms of any revisions to this Policy.

## INFORMATION COLLECTION

When you register for an account, visit certain portions of the Website, use the Services, or participate in a promotion, contest or sweepstakes, you may be prompted to provide, on a voluntary basis, certain information about yourself such as: (i) name; (ii) email address; (iii) date of birth; (iv) mailing address; (v) telephone numbers; (vi) cable provider, and (vii) interests and hobbies. You are not required to provide any personally identifiable information to use our Website or Services, however, certain areas may not be accessible absent registration.

Certain third parties may join with us to offer Website activities or Services, features or promotions, such as contests or special events. By submitting personal information in conjunction with these joint activities, you are providing that information to both parties simultaneously. The co-sponsor or partner may maintain a separate privacy policy governing the collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information and this Policy does not cover their collection, use, and/or disclosure.

Additionally, while visiting the Website or utilizing the Services, you may link to or view, as part of a frame on a page, certain content that is actually created or hosted by a third party, or you may be introduced to, or be able to access, information, websites, advertisements, features, promotions, contests or sweepstakes offered by other parties. Also, the Website or Services may link to certain third parties who offer services on our behalf. Your interaction with these third party sites and/or services is subject to the third parties’ privacy policies. AMC is not responsible for and assumes no liability for the actions and policies of any third party business or entity. As such, you should review the applicable third party privacy policies prior to interacting with or providing your information to these third parties.

In some circumstances, we may receive information about you from third parties (e.g., service partners and advertisers that make features available through the Website or Services, service partners through whom we provide access to the Website or Services, marketing companies that create professional marketing lists or sell other marketing data, and other websites or applications that you have registered to use, or that people you know have registered to use, when we allow those websites or applications to interact through the Website or Service to provide personalized services to you). If so, we will treat that information in accordance with this Policy.

We may also use cookies, clear GIFs and other technologies to learn about how you interact with the Website, to provide you with better service, to improve your customer experience, and for internal research and reporting purposes. We also may collect anonymous data on Website activity, such as how many people visit the site, where they are located, what pages they visit, what sites they come from, how long they stay, what items they purchase, etc. Such data is collected on an aggregate, anonymous basis, through the use of Internet server logs, cookies, clear GIFs and other technologies. We may also take non-anonymous data and de-identify it so that it becomes anonymous either by itself or when aggregated. We may use any anonymous or aggregated data for any purpose, including for research and marketing purposes, and may also share such data with any third parties, such as advertisers.

Please be careful and responsible whenever you are online. If you decide to post content on the Website or through the Services, such as on messages boards, in comments, through social networking services, or in other postings, that information is publicly available and may be collected and used by third parties without our knowledge and may result in unsolicited messages from other individuals or third parties. Such activities are outside the control of AMC and this Policy.
