The American Chamber of Commerce in Egypt (AmCham) is committed to protecting the privacy of visitors to its website.   
This "Statement of User Privacy," and the attached "Terms and Conditions of Use," describe how the information compiled by [amcham.org.eg](http://www.amcham.org.eg/) is used by AmCham, as well as the terms and conditions for using the site.

In General   
You can visit our website without identifying yourself or revealing any personal information. AmCham monitors user traffic according to users' domain names, browser types, date and time of access and pages viewed.

AmCham uses this information to better suit future content to users' needs.   
Visitors to our website may occasionally be asked to provide personal information. In most cases, such information is used only to respond to inquiries. AmCham will not provide any other organizations with visitor information or visitors' e-mail addresses.  
In some instances, AmCham may provide links to non-AmCham controlled websites. AmCham does not, however, control such third-party websites, and cannot be held responsible for the content or privacy practices employed by other sites.
