# AMD - Online Privacy Policy

## Advanced Micro Devices Online Privacy Policy  


**Advanced Micro Devices Privacy Overview**  
Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is committed to respecting your privacy. In general, you can visit amd.com without revealing any information about yourself. AMD does collect information regarding visitors to our Web site, such as domain name, number of visits, and average time spent, to measure use and _improve the content_ of our site. We analyze this data for trends and statistics to help us provide you with better service.

**Personal Information**  
There are times, however, when we may request information from you, such as your, name, address and e-mail address. When additional information is requested, we will try to let you know at the time of collection how we intend to use the personal information you provide, such as respond to your inquiry, participate in certain promotions, conduct a survey or allow you to access specific information. If you sign up for an AMD electronic newsletter or e-mail list, each message will include instructions on how to "unsubscribe" from that list. We respect your right to choose whether to give us personal information or "opt out" if you do not wish to disclose personal information. We do our best to maintain the accuracy of any personal information you do supply to us.

Any information provided by you will be used for AMD's purposes only. Your information will not be shared with individual or other companies [such as direct mail organizations or other third parties] unless required by law. However, AMD may need to provide your name and delivery address to third parties that AMD uses for delivering specific services to you (such as support services or shipping purposes when you ask us to send something to you).

Our Web sites may provide links to third party sites. Since we do not control those Web sites, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of these third party sites.

**Security and Quality**  
AMD is committed to taking reasonable steps to protect the individual identifying information that you provide. You can help AMD update and maintain the accuracy of any personal information you supply by notifying AMD of any changes to your address, title, phone number or e-mail address. In some programs, you may do this online by following the instructions on membership profile pages. You may also update your information by e-mailing [web.feedback@amd.com](mailto:web.feedback@amd.com) with a description or example of what you wish to change.

**Cookies**  
AMD uses cookies to allow us to understand what areas of our Web site are of interest to you so we can better serve and provide you with tailored information from our Web. A cookie is an element of data that a Web site can send to your browser, which may then store it on your system. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it. These cookies do not track individual information. AMD may also use cookies when you register for one of our web programs or extranets. In this case, a cookie will store useful information that enables our Web site to remember you when you return to visit, but only AMD Web sites can read that information.

**Oversight or Questions**  
AMD welcomes comments and questions on this policy. As stated above, we are dedicated to protecting your privacy and will make every reasonable effort to keep your information secure. Due to the rapidly evolving changes on the Internet, we may update this policy. All revisions will be posted to this site. Questions regarding our policy should be directed to [web.feedback@amd.com](mailto:web.feedback@amd.com).
