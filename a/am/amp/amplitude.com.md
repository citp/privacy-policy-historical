## Information Amplitude Collects Through Your Use of the Service

Amplitude collects personally identifiable information from you, such as email address, when you sign up for our service or contact us by email. We also track many of the actions you take on our site in order to improve the service. We will never share this information with anyone for any reason unless required by law.

We understand that the data you send to us is confidential and treat it as such. We will never share the data you send us with anyone unless required by law.

### End User Information

We may collect non-personally identifiable information regarding the behavior and usage patterns of users of mobile applications ("End Users") published by our customers. Use of our Services does not require collection of personally identifiable information. Our customers may request such information from End Users in order to use their mobile applications and such personally identifiable information may be included in the data sent to us. End Users should therefore review the privacy policies of the mobile applications they use to assess the security of any personally identifiable information they disclose. To the extent we do receive any personally identifiable information, we will maintain the confidentiality of such data.

### Cookies

We use cookies to access information when you sign in, store your preferences, to keep you logged in, and to store a limited amount of behavioral data. You can configure your browser to accept or reject these cookies and we will respect this decision by not using other means to track you.

## The Way Amplitude Uses Information

### Contact its Users

We do not use your email address or other personally identifiable information to send commercial or marketing messages without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. We may, however, use your email address without further consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of major changes to amplitude.com, Amplitude's Services or for customer service purposes).

We provide personally identifiable information and non-personally-identifiable information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies, or other businesses or persons for the purpose of processing such information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to process such information in compliance with our privacy policy, and we use reasonable efforts to limit their use of such information and to use other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.

In the event that Amplitude is acquired by or merged with a third party entity, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information we have collected from our users as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control. In the unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors rights generally, we may not be able to control how your personal information is treated, transferred, or used.

## Our Commitment to Data Security

Amplitude uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. Specifically, Amplitude encrypts and signs all data originating from Amplitude and verifies it on the client. Further, for Enterprise tier customers, Amplitude supports full HTTPS exchange.

Once we receive your transmission of information, Amplitude makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. If Amplitude learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. Amplitude may post a notice on Amplitude.com if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive a free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice) you should notify us at [contact@amplitude.com](mailto:contact@amplitude.com).
