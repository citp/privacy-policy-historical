          <p><strong>Last Updated: July 27, 2015</strong></p>
          <p>
            This Privacy Policy explains how information is collected and utilized by Amplitude, Inc. ("Amplitude," "we," or "us"). This Privacy Policy applies to the Amplitude website at http://www.amplitude.com and Amplitude's services ("Services").
          </p>


          <p><strong>SPECIAL NOTE TO INTERNATIONAL USERS</strong></p>
          <p>
            Amplitude.com is hosted in the United States. If you are an user accessing amplitude.com from the European Union, Asia, or any other region with laws or regulations governing personal data collection, use, and disclosure, that differ from United States laws, please be advised that through your continued use of amplitude.com, which is governed by U.S. law, this Privacy Policy, and Amplitude's Terms of Service, you are transferring your personal information to the United States and you consent to that transfer.
          </p>


          <p><strong>INFORMATION AMPLITUDE COLLECTS THROUGH YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE</strong></p>


          <p><strong>App Developer Information</strong></p>
          <p>
            Amplitude collects personally identifiable information from you, such as email address, when you sign up for our service or contact us by email. We also track many of the actions you take on our site in order to improve the service. We will never share this information with anyone for any reason unless required by law.<br><br>
            We understand that the data you send to us is confidential and treat it as such. We will never share the data you send us with anyone unless required by law. Access will be restricted to the team members you invite, and to certain Amplitude staff in order to provide support and develop the service.<br><br>
            We reserve the right to analyze this data from an aggregated standpoint, and publish aggregated studies and figures. In doing so we will never compromise the confidentiality of your data by publishing any identifying information.
          </p>


          <p><strong>End User Information</strong></p>
          <p>
            We may collect non-personally identifiable information regarding the behavior and usage patterns of users of mobile applications ("End Users") published by our customers. Use of our Services does not require collection of personally identifiable information. Our customers may request such information from End Users in order to use their mobile applications and such personally identifiable information may be included in the data sent to us. End Users should therefore review the privacy policies of the mobile applications they use to assess the security of any personally identifiable information they disclose. To the extent we do receive any personally identifiable information, we will maintain the confidentiality of such data.
          </p>


          <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
          <p>
            We use cookies to access information when you sign in, store your preferences, to keep you logged in, and to store a limited amount of behavioral data. You can configure your browser to accept or reject these cookies and we will respect this decision by not using other means to track you.
          </p>


          <p><strong>THE WAY AMPLITUDE USES INFORMATION</strong></p>


          <p><strong>Contact its Users</strong></p>
          <p>
            We do not use your email address or other personally identifiable information to send commercial or marketing messages without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. We may, however, use your email address without further consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of major changes to amplitude.com, Amplitude's Services or for customer service purposes).
          </p>


          <p><strong>Improve Amplitude.com or its Services</strong></p>
          <p>
            We use both your personally identifiable information and certain non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous end user usage data, cookies, IP addresses, browser type, clickstream data, etc.) to improve the quality and design of amplitude.com and to create new features, promotions, functionality, and services by storing, tracking, and analyzing our users' preferences and trends. We use cookies, clear gifs, and log file information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit amplitude.com; (b) monitor the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns; and (c) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, pages viewed, etc.
          </p>


          <p><strong>WHEN AMPLITUDE DISCLOSES INFORMATION</strong></p>


          <p><strong>Provide Services</strong></p>
          <p>
            We provide personally identifiable information and non-personally-identifiable information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies, or other businesses or persons for the purpose of processing such information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to process such information in compliance with our privacy policy, and we use reasonable efforts to limit their use of such information and to use other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.<br><br>
            However, we do not share your personally identifiable information (such as name or email address) or your end users' information with other, third-party companies for their commercial or marketing use without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out.
          </p>


          <p><strong>Legal Requests and Comply with State and Federal Laws</strong></p>
          <p>
            We may release personally identifiable information and/or non-personally-identifiable information if required to do so by law, or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws or respond to a court order, subpoena, or search warrant.<br><br>
            Amplitude also reserves the right to disclose personally identifiable information and/or non-personally-identifiable information that Amplitude believes, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to enforce our Terms of Service, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend itself against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, to protect the security or integrity of Amplitude.
          </p>


          <p><strong>In the Event of Merger, Sale, or Bankruptcy</strong></p>
          <p>
            In the event that Amplitude is acquired by or merged with a third party entity, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information we have collected from our users as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control. In the unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors rights generally, we may not be able to control how your personal information is treated, transferred, or used.
          </p>


          <p><strong>YOUR CHOICES</strong></p>
          <p>
            You may, of course, decline to submit personally identifiable information through Amplitude.com or the Services, in which case Amplitude may not be able to provide certain services to you.<br><br>
            You may update or correct your personal profile information and email preferences at any time by visiting your account profile page. In addition, you can request to delete your personal information by contacting Amplitude at <a href="mailto:contact@amplitude.com">contact@amplitude.com</a>.
          </p>


          <p><strong>OUR COMMITMENT TO DATA SECURITY</strong></p>
          <p>
            Amplitude uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. Specifically, Amplitude encrypts and signs all data originating from Amplitude and verifies it on the client. Further, for Enterprise tier customers, Amplitude supports full HTTPS exchange. However, Amplitude cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Amplitude and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, Amplitude makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. If Amplitude learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. Amplitude may post a notice on Amplitude.com if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive a free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice) you should notify us at <a href="mailto:contact@amplitude.com">contact@amplitude.com</a>.
          </p>

If you have any concerns about Amplitude's privacy practices, you may contact Amplitude at <a href="mailto:contact@amplitude.com">contact@amplitude.com</a>.<br><br>
