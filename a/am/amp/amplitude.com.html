<p>We may collect non-personally identifiable information regarding the behavior and usage patterns of users of mobile applications ("End Users") published by our customers. Use of our Services does not require collection of personally identifiable information. Our customers may request such information from End Users in order to use their mobile applications and such personally identifiable information may be included in the data sent to us. End Users should therefore review the privacy policies of the mobile applications they use to assess the security of any personally identifiable information they disclose. To the extent we do receive any personally identifiable information, we will maintain the confidentiality of such data.</p>

<p>We use cookies to access information when you sign in, store your preferences, to keep you logged in, and to store a limited amount of behavioral data. You can configure your browser to accept or reject these cookies and we will respect this decision by not using other means to track you.</p>
<h2>The Way Amplitude Uses Information</h2>

We may, however, use your email address without further consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of major changes to amplitude.com, Amplitude's Services or for customer service purposes).</p>
<h3>Improve Amplitude.com or its Services</h3>
<p>We use both your personally identifiable information and certain non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous end user usage data, cookies, IP addresses, browser type, clickstream data, etc.) to improve the quality and design of amplitude.com and to create new features, promotions, functionality, and services by storing, tracking, and analyzing our users' preferences and trends.

<h2>When Amplitude Discloses Information</h2>
<h3>Provide Services</h3>
<p>We provide personally identifiable information and non-personally-identifiable information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies, or other businesses or persons for the purpose of processing such information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to process such information in compliance with our privacy policy, and we use reasonable efforts to limit their use of such information and to use other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.</p>
<p>However, we do not share your personally identifiable information (such as name or email address) or your end users' information with other, third-party companies for their commercial or marketing use without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out.</p>

<p>Amplitude also reserves the right to disclose personally identifiable information and/or non-personally-identifiable information that Amplitude believes, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to enforce our Terms of Service, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend itself against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, to protect the security or integrity of Amplitude.</p>
<h3>In the Event of Merger, Sale, or Bankruptcy</h3>
<p>In the event that Amplitude is acquired by or merged with a third party entity, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information we have collected from our users as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control. In the unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors rights generally, we may not be able to control how your personal information is treated, transferred, or used.</p>
