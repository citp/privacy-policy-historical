		<img src="/images/spacer.gif" width="500" height="8"><br>

          <p>Amplify, LLC (hereinafter referred to as “Amplify,” “us” or “we”) is committed to protecting the privacy of the users and visitors of its products and services. By using the Amplify web site at <a href="http://www.amplify.com/" class="FooterLink">www.amplify.com</a> (the “Site”) and/or the Amplify Software (the “Software”) (collectively the “Amplify Services”), you agree to the collection and use of your information by us in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Please note that this policy applies only to Amplify Services, and not to other web sites to which we link or to web sites which you access via Amplify Services. </p>
          <p><strong>Definitions<br>
          </strong>The Amplify Software provides you with a toolbar which will be located in your web browser upon installation (the “Amplify Toolbar”) and which provides you with the ability to view selected online media, including text, data, software, music, sound, video, animation, graphics, images or other information (“Content”), in a personalized page. These pages, called “Amps,” can display Content from the same or different web sites as well as additional text that you provide. Each Amp contains its own toolbar (an “Amp Toolbar”) located at the top of the Amp which allows you to access features and functions of Amplify. Links to Amps can be saved remotely on Amplify’s servers for your own personal use, shared with third parties online and/or posted to the Amplify Site in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Amplify End User License Agreement (“Agreement”), available at <a href="http://www.amplify.com/eula.asp" class="FooterLink">www.amplify.com/eula.asp</a> (“Authorized Use”). As used in the Agreement and this Privacy Policy, to “Amplify” Content means to select such Content from anywhere on the World Wide Web (“Web”), place a link to such Content in an Amp and, at your option, include additional text or commentary in the Amp.</p>
          <p><strong>Changes to the Privacy Policy<br>
          </strong>We reserve the right to change the terms of this Privacy Policy. Any changes will be posted on this page. We encourage you to check this page regularly. Your continued use of the Amplify Services following any changes to this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such changes. </p>
          <p><strong>Information You Provide and How We Use It<br>
          </strong>You will be asked to provide Amplify with registration information when installing the Software. Registration information will include a username, password, email address and nickname. You will need your username and password to access certain features of the Amplify Services. Your nickname will be your alias on the Site and will be associated with all of your posts and comments on the Site. We use your e-mail address to send you a confirmation and/or reminder of your username, password or nickname if you so request. We also may send you e-mail regarding Amplify should you choose to receive such e-mail on the registration page. Your nickname will be included in a user profile created by Amplify. A link to your profile will appear on the Site next to each Amp or comment to a third party Amp that you post on the site. Your user profile may be viewed by all visitors to the Site. Your profile will include your Amplify nickname, status, point total, length of Amplify membership, prior Amps submitted and the status thereof and any additional information you provide.</p>
          <p>We may use third party contractors to help us operate our business or administer activities on our behalf and may share your information (both personal and non-personal) with these contractors for those limited purposes. Except for those third parties specified herein, we will not share your personally identifiable information with third parties, unless you allow us.</p>
          <p>If Amplify is sold to or merges with, another company, or declares bankruptcy, some or all of the information collected from you (both personal and non-personal) may be transferred to a third party as a result of the transfer of assets. We may also disclose your personally identifiable information when we determine it is necessary to comply with applicable laws or protect the interests or safety of Amplify, the Amplify Services, its users and visitors.</p>
          <p><strong>Information Collected Automatically and How We Use It<br>
          </strong>We automatically collect non-personally identifiable information from you. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you’re surfing the Web. Web servers automatically identify your computer by its IP address. When users interact with our Site or Amp’d Content, our servers log the user’s IP address. We do not link IP addresses to any personally identifiable information. Amplify collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration and the compilation of aggregate information about the usage of Amplify Services. </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Amplify collects certain information regarding your use of the Amplify Services in order to improve the functionality and performance of these Services for our users. Such information includes, but is not limited to, the number of Amps saved and shared; the number of views each Amp receives; the Uniform Resource Locator of the online source of Content within Amps; keywords associated with the online source of content within Amps; the file type of the Content within an Amp (such as image, animation, video, audio or text); titles of saved and/or shared Amps and the username of the creator of such Amps. This information may be shared with third parties, such as advertisers, business partners and sponsors, but only in anonymous form. We will not connect your name or other personally identifiable information to the foregoing information should we choose to share it with third parties.<br>
            </li>
     
            <li>Cookies are pieces of information that a Web site transfers to an individual’s hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies make Web-surfing easier for you by saving your passwords, purchases, and preferences while you’re on a web site. The use of cookies is an industry standard – you’ll find them at most major web sites. When you use the Site and/or Software we automatically receive and record information in our server logs from your browser including your IP address, Amplify cookie information, and the page you request. We will use the information collected for the purpose of improving our service and for anonymous reporting of Site and Software usage. Amplify does not use cookies to retrieve information from your computer that was not originally sent in a cookie. Amplify may share such information with advertisers, business partners, sponsors and other third parties.<br>
            </li>
            <li>Amplify may include applications, content and/or advertisements from third parties, such as Infospace, that may perform user activity tracking in addition to the activities described herein. For more information about InfoSpace’s user tracking on Amplify, please refer to its privacy policy which can be found at <a href="http://www.infospace.com/home/about/corporate/privacy.htm" class="FooterLink" target="_blank">www.infospace.com/home/about/corporate/privacy.htm</a>. <br>
            </li>
            <li>Amplify may collect information regarding the current version of the Software that you are using to determine if your software requires updating and may require you to update your version to continue using the Software.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Each user is assigned a globally unique identifier (GUID) in order to authenticate users of Amplify Services and to enable us to record the number of individual users of Amplify Services.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Advertising Policy</strong><br>
  We may serve advertisements on the Site. Amplify Software does not bundle any third party software. If you have any questions about Amplify’s advertising policy, please contact <a href="mailto:adpolicy@amplify.com" class="FooterLink">adpolicy@amplify.com</a>.</p>
          <p><strong>Saving, Sharing and Posting an Amp<br>
          </strong>The Software allows you to “save” Amps by adding them to your “My Amps” List which creates a reference link to your Amp. Amplify reserves the right in its sole discretion to access, store and disclose text or other Content from user Amps, any comments or editorial content (“Commentary”) posted by you or any other user on the Site or user registration information if Amplify believes in good faith that such action is reasonably necessary to enforce the terms of the Agreement, this Privacy Policy or its copyright and intellectual property policy (“Copyright Policy”), comply with any applicable laws, rules or regulations, operate its systems properly, or protect the rights or property of Amplify, its users, visitors or others.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Registered users have the ability to post Amps on the Site and all Site visitors may view, rate, search for and post Commentary about the Amps posted on the Site. Amps are posted and maintained on the Site in different categories. When posting an Amp, the user will select the appropriate category and provide a name and description for the Amp. Amps must be posted under the proper category. Amplify reserves the right to review all Amps posted on the Site to ensure that they are placed within the proper category and have an accurate and appropriate title and description. Amps that do not belong in a particular category may be moved to the proper category by Amplify in its sole discretion and Amplify reserves the right to modify the title and description for any posted Amp. Amplify reserves the right in its sole discretion to move any posted Amps into the Mature category that are posted to other categories. You must be at least 18 years of age to post and view Amps in the Mature category.<br>
            </li>
            <li>When you share a link to an Amp via email, instant message, blog or by any other means, please keep in mind that the recipient(s) of the Amp link can forward this link on to other people. Amplify does not limit the number of times or the number of people to whom this link can subsequently be forwarded. If you share a link to an Amp, please be aware that people who click on that link will be able to see any saved changes you make to that Amp after you have shared it unless you choose the “Save as New” option in the Save dialog box when saving changes. Notwithstanding anything stated herein, once an Amp has been posted to the Site, it will be “locked” and no further editing of the posted Amp will be possible. Visitors will not be able to view any changes made to an Amp after it has been posted. You may however, change the Amp and re-post it as another version.<br>
            </li>
            <li>When posting or sharing an Amp or Commentary, remember that any information you disclose becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal, financial or other information.<br>
            </li>
            <li>Amplify may establish general practices and limits regarding the posting of Amps to the Site and reserves the right to change these general practices and limits in its sole discretion at any time. While Amplify will use reasonable efforts to backup Site data and make such data available in the event of loss or deletion, Amplify has no responsibility or liability for the deletion or failure to post any Amp to the Site.</li>
