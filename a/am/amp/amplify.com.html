                                    <p>Last Revised: September 26, 2013</p>
                
                
                    <h2 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
                    <p>Amplify Education, Inc. (“Amplify” or “we”) recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy and security of your personal information. This Privacy Policy describes our practices in connection with information that we may collect through your use of this website (the “Site”). Please note that when you use certain of our products, services, applications or other websites, our use of your information may be governed by a separate legal agreement or a privacy policy specifically posted in connection with those offerings. If you have any question as to what legal agreement or privacy policy controls the collection and use of your information, please contact us using the contact information below.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy applies to the collection and use by Amplify of your personal information (i.e., information that identifies or permits contact with a specific person, such as full name or email address) provided in connection with your use of the Site. It also describes Amplify’s practices for handling non-personal information (e.g., site activity) in connection with the Site.</p>

<h3>Children</h3>

<p>As set forth in our <a href="/terms">Terms of Use</a>, the Site is for a general audience, is not targeted to children, and does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age.</p>

<p>By providing personal information to us or using the Site, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please discontinue your use of the Site.</p>

                
                    <h2 id="collection-of-information">2. Collection of information</h2>
                    <p>Amplify may collect information from you at various points, including the following:</p>

<h3>Product Information and Newsletters.</h3>

<p>When you submit a form to obtain information about our products and services or subscribe to one of our newsletters, you may be asked to submit information such as name, professional affiliation, email address, company name, address and phone and details on your query or interests in our products and services. This information is collected to help us process your request.</p>

<h3>Customer Support.</h3>

<p>When you submit a form to contact our customer service, you may be asked to submit information such as name, e-mail, district, customer user login and password and details on your query. In addition, some features of our Site, such as our customer live chat functionality or other customer service systems may allow you to voluntarily provide personal information to us. This information is collected to help us process your request.</p>

<h3>Product Orders.</h3>

<p>If you use e-commerce areas of our Site to order our products, we request information from you on our order form. To purchase products through the Site, you must provide contact information (such as name and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit card number). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill your orders. We will also use this information to contact you to confirm your order or to inform you of any issues or delays.</p>

<h3>Registration.</h3>

<p>You may be requested to submit information to use certain Site functionalities (such as posting comments on certain areas of the Site), register for an event or webinar, or view restricted content that may be available on the Site. For instance, you may be asked to provide your name, email address and event or webinar-related preferences to help us process your registration or content request.</p>

<h3>Social Plugins.</h3>

<p>Certain areas of our Site permit you to utilize social media functionality, such as the Facebook “Like” or Google “+1” buttons (“Social Plugins”). To use a Social Plugin, you must authorize the third-party provider of that Social Plugin, e.g. Facebook or Google, to access, collect, and/or disclose your information related to your use of that Social Plugin, subject to that company’s privacy policies, which may differ from this Privacy Policy. In addition, such providers may be able to collect information about you, including your activity on the Site, and they may notify your connections on their social networking platform about your use of the Site. Such services may also employ unique identifiers that allow your activity to be monitored across multiple websites for purposes of delivering more targeted advertising to you.</p>

<h3>Site Activity Information.</h3>

<p>When you access and interact with the Site, we and our Third Party Agents (as defined below) may collect certain information about those visits. For example, we or our Third Party Agents may receive and record information about your computer and browser, including potentially your IP address, browser type, and other software or hardware information. If you access the Site from a mobile or other device, we may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device, or other characteristics of the device hardware, operating system and configurations for that device.</p>

<h3>Cookies.</h3>

<p>Cookies and other tracking technologies (such as browser cookies, pixels, beacons, and Adobe Flash technology, including cookies) may also be used. Websites send these data to your browser when you first request a web page and then store the data on your computer or mobile or other device so the website can access information when you make subsequent requests for pages from that website or app. These technologies may also be used to collect and store information about your usage of the Site and may include search queries you have run on the Site. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, but your browser may permit you to change your settings to notify you of a cookie being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether. Please consult the “Help” section of your browser for more information. Please note that by blocking any or all cookies you may not have access to certain features, content or personalization that may be available through the Site.</p>

<h3>Public Areas and Discussion Forums.</h3>

<p>Any information you share in public areas, such as message boards or feedback sections, becomes public. Please be careful about what you disclose and do not post any personal information that you expect to keep private.</p>

<h3>Contests and Sweepstakes.</h3>

<p>When we run a contest or sweepstakes relating to the Site or Amplify, it will be accompanied by a set of rules. The rules for each contest/sweepstakes will specify how the information gathered from you for your entry will be used and disclosed.</p>

<h3>Information from Other Sources.</h3>

<p>We may supplement any information we collect via this Site with information from publicly or commercially available sources.</p>

                
                    <h2 id="notice-and-choice">3. Notice and choice</h2>

<p>Amplify may modify this Privacy Policy. Please look at the Last Revised Date at the top of this Privacy Policy to see when this Privacy Policy was last revised. Any changes to this Privacy Policy will become effective when we post the revised Privacy Policy on the Site. If you do not wish to be bound by the terms of the revised Privacy Policy, you must discontinue your use of the Site.</p>

United States data protection and other relevant laws may not be the same as those in your jurisdiction. This includes the use of cookies and other tracking technologies as described above.</p>

<h3>Linked Services.</h3>

<p>The Site may be linked to sites operated by unaffiliated companies, and may carry advertisements or offer content, functionality, games, newsletters, contests or sweepstakes, or applications developed and maintained by unaffiliated companies. Amplify is not responsible for the privacy practices of unaffiliated companies, and once you leave the Site via a link or enable an unaffiliated service, you are subject to the applicable privacy policy of the unaffiliated service.</p>

If you want to stop receiving promotional materials from Amplify, you can email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@amplify.com">privacy@amplify.com</a> or follow the unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of each email.

<h3>To share with our affiliated education companies.</h3>

<p>Amplify may share your information with Amplify’s affiliated education companies for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h3>To allow service providers to assist us.</h3>

<p>We may engage third party service providers, agents and partners (“Third Party Agents”) to perform functions on our behalf, such as marketing, analytics, credit card processing, shipping or stocking orders and providing customer service. We may disclose your personal information to such Third Party Agents to enable them to assist us in these efforts.</p>

<p>There may be instances when Amplify may disclose your information, in situations where Amplify has a good faith belief that such disclosure is necessary or appropriate in order to: (i) protect, enforce, or defend the legal rights, privacy, safety, operations, or property of Amplify, our parents, subsidiaries or affiliates or our or their employees, agents and contractors (including enforcement of our agreements, including our terms of use); (ii) protect the rights, safety, privacy, security or property of users of the Site or others; (iii) protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; (iv) comply with the law or legal process, including laws outside your country of residence; (v) respond to requests from public and government authorities, including those outside your country of residence; or (vi) allow us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain.</p>

<h3>To complete a merger or sale of assets.</h3>

<p>If Amplify sells all or part of its business or makes a sale or transfer of its assets or is otherwise involved in a merger, transfer or other disposition of all or part of its business, assets or stock (including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings), Amplify may transfer your information to the party or parties involved in the transaction.</p>

                
                    <h2 id="security">5. Security</h2>
                    <p>Amplify uses commercially reasonable administrative, technical, personnel and physical measures to safeguard information in its possession against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure or modification.</p>

                
                    <h2 id="user-control">6. User control</h2>
                    <p>If you would like to review, correct, update, suppress or otherwise limit our use of your personal information you have previously provided directly to us, you may contact us using the contact information provided below.

                    <p>We will retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or allowed by law.</p>

<p>Even after we have deleted your information from our systems, copies of some information from your account may remain viewable in some circumstances – where, for example, you have shared information with social media platforms and other unaffiliated services. We may also retain backup information related to your account on our servers for some time after cancelation for fraud detection or to comply with applicable law or our internal security policies. Because of the nature of caching technology, your account may not be instantly inaccessible to others, and there may be a delay in the removal of the content from elsewhere on the Internet and from search engines.</p>

                
                    <h2 id="sensitive-information">8. Sensitive information</h2>
