				<p>We use cookies on this website. </p>

				<p>Cookies are small chunks of data created by a web server, delivered through a web browser, and stored on your computer.

				<h2 class="h2Title colorGreen baseTitle">Network Privacy Policy</h2>

				<p>ampNetwork's network targets ads to consumers who visit our publisher's websites. ampNetwork does not track or maintain PII (personally identifiable information) about consumers. We may obtain anonymous information like behavior of a particular user, for example, visiting a particular website, clicking on a particular ad, demographic data and browser type etc. by using cookies, web beacons, pixels and IP addresses. </p>
				<ul class="listStyleNoneOutside">
					<li>A cookie is a small amount of data stored on the hard drive of your computer that allows ampNetwork to identify your IP address.  ampNetwork may use cookies to track individual responses or views of advertisements.</li>
					<li>A web beacon is programming code used to display an image on a web page.  This allows ampNetwork to determine products or services in which you may be interested and help track online behaviors for marketing purposes.</li>

					<li>Pixels can be placed on advertisers' pages in order to track when a sale is completed.  This helps ampNetwork target future ad placements, but no PII is obtained.</li>
	
					<li>ampNetwork may use your IP address to better target ads. Unless you use a static IP address, an IP address relates to households or larger communities. ampNetwork uses IP addresses to track where clicks are coming from and helps us fight click fraud, but no PII is obtained.</li>

					<li>Information can be collected directly from ampNetwork advertisements or indirectly through Publishers that ampNetwork works with.</li>
					<li>ampNetwork may set a cookie on your computer or associate behavior with your Internet service provider's IP address when you view advertisements delivered on publisher websites. After a behavior is associated to a cookie or an IP address, ampNetwork may track how you interact with the advertisement and the publisher website.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>ampNetwork may lawfully receive information about you, including demographic data, purchasing trends and similar information, from third parties, such as information located in public databases.</p>

				<br>
				<h3 class="h3Title baseTitle">Use of Information and Data</h3>

				<p>ampNetwork may share anonymous information about your behaviors with trusted publishers under confidentiality agreements. These publishers may use this information to better target advertisements to you. </p>
				<p>ampNetwork stores anonymous information in a database.  This database is password protected and secure.  ampNetwork maintains the data in an encrypted form, so that even if the data is improperly accessed, it is less likely to be in an intelligible format.  This data is stored for up to two months and then moved to our secure archive server.  The data is encrypted and password protected and only accessed  to resolve a legal or business issue. ampNetwork cannot guarantee that its security or privacy protection measures will prevent its computers from being illegally accessed and the data stolen.</p> 
				
				<br>
				<h3 class="h3Title baseTitle">Privacy Practices of Third Parties</h3>

				<p>Publishers who place advertisements on the Internet may use their own cookies, web beacons and other technology to collect information about you. ampNetwork does not control publishers' use of such technology. </p>
				<p>To learn about how a particular publisher may use your PII or anonymous information, you should read the privacy policy of that publisher. </p>
	
				<br>

				<h3 class="h3Title baseTitle">Opt-Out Information</h3>
				<p>To prevent ampNetwork from tracking your behavior on a website, turn off cookies, utilize a changing IP address, and do not click on or interact with any advertisements. </p>

				<br>

				<h3 class="h3Title baseTitle">Changes to Our Privacy Policy</h3>
				<p>As our company and services evolve, this Privacy Policy may be revised to reflect those changes, where applicable. We therefore reserve the right to amend this Privacy Policy at any time, for any reason. Notice of such amendments will be posted as an updated Privacy Policy on this website, and an effective date will be indicated.
