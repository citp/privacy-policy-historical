Amplify Education, Inc. (“Amplify” or “we”) recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy and security of your personal information. This Privacy Policy describes our practices in connection with information that we may collect through your use of this website (the “Site”). Please note that when you use certain of our products, services, applications or other websites, our use of your information may be governed by a separate legal agreement or a privacy policy specifically posted in connection with those offerings. If you have any question as to what legal agreement or privacy policy controls the collection and use of your information, please contact us using the contact information below.

This Privacy Policy applies to the collection and use by Amplify of your personal information (i.e., information that identifies or permits contact with a specific person, such as full name or email address) provided in connection with your use of the Site. It also describes Amplify’s practices for handling non-personal information (e.g., site activity) in connection with the Site.

In addition, such providers may be able to collect information about you, including your activity on the Site, and they may notify your connections on their social networking platform about your use of the Site. Such services may also employ unique identifiers that allow your activity to be monitored across multiple websites for purposes of delivering more targeted advertising to you.
