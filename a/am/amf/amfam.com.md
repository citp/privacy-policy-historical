General Privacy Notice  
Health Information Privacy Notice

## General Privacy Notice

The companies of American Family Insurance Group (see [Company Identification](https://web.archive.org/web/20041207215935id_/http%3A//www.amfam.com/company/identification.asp)) recognize the importance of our customers’ trust. Keeping our customers’ personal information confidential is a top priority for all American Family employees, agents and their staff. This Notice, which is required by state and federal law, explains our Privacy Policies.

  1. We will safeguard, according to strict standards of security and confidentiality, nonpublic, personal information our customers share with us. "Nonpublic, personal information", for example, would include such information as your name, address, social security number and credit information. We will maintain safeguards, physical and electronic, to protect that information. We will conduct our business in a manner that keeps personal customer information secure.
  2. We will limit the collection and use of customer information to the minimum we require to deliver superior service and to administer our business. We collect personal information about customers from the following sources:   

    * From customers on insurance and loan applications and related forms; 
    * From your transactions with us, our affiliates or others; 
    * From consumer reporting agencies; and 
    * From your transactions with non-affiliated third parties.   

  3. It is our policy that only authorized American Family employees, agents and their staff who need to know your personal information will access and use it. American Family workers who violate our Privacy Policies are subject to the disciplinary process. 
  4. It is our policy that we will not share personal customer information (either current or former customers) outside American Family for any purpose other than the underwriting or administration of a customer’s policy/account or for marketing of additional American Family products, unless the disclosure has been authorized by the customer or is permitted or required by law. 
  5. Whenever we retain other organizations to provide support services on behalf of American Family, we will require them to protect customers’ personal information. 
  6. To help us keep your customer information up-to-date and accurate, please contact your [agent](https://web.archive.org/web/20041207215935id_/http%3A//www.amfam.com/agent/default.asp) if there is any change in your personal information. 
  7. When necessary, we will review and revise our Privacy Policies to protect personal customer information.
