Where you have consented to data processing, your consent provides the legal basis to process your Personal Data (as defined below). You have the right to withdraw consent at any time. Please note that your withdrawal of consent to collect and process your Personal Data will not affect the lawfulness of processing your Personal Data based on your consent before you withdrew your consent.

There may also be instances where AmerisourceBergen may share your Personal Data with third-parties who have not been retained by us (directly or indirectly), for example, if we are required to do so because of an applicable law, court order or governmental regulation; if such disclosure is otherwise necessary in support of any criminal or other legal investigation or proceeding here or abroad; in order to enforce or apply our [Terms and Conditions](https://web.archive.org/web/20191211193816id_/https%3A//www.amerisourcebergen.com/global-terms-and-conditions) or other agreements; and to protect the rights, property or safety of AmerisourceBergen or our customers.

This Section provides you with additional information on our use of cookies, web beacons and other technologies.

Cookies.  A cookie is a small file placed on your computer when you visit a site that can be understood by the site that issued the cookie. We use cookies to monitor how our Web Site is used and to help personalize your online experience in order to give you the best possible experience on our Web Site.  You can accept or decline cookies. Most browsers automatically accept cookies.

You may also go to the cookie settings available in your specific web browser to learn more about cookies. Although you are not required to accept cookies or provide AmerisourceBergen information when you visit this Web Site, if you set your browser to reject cookies (or decide not to provide AmerisourceBergen certain information) you may not be able to use all of the features and functionality of this Web Site.

Web Beacons. Web beacons are small bits of code that communicate with third parties and are embedded in web pages, our ads or in e-mails.  We may use web beacons to deliver or communicate with cookies, to count users who have visited a web page or to understand usage patterns or other third-party functionality.  We also may include web beacons in e-mails to learn if messages have been opened, acted on, or forwarded.

Other Technologies.  From time to time, we may use other technologies, such as cross-device tracking, to provide better service to you. “Cross-device tracking” associates multiple devices with the same consumer and links a consumer’s activity across her devices (e.g., smartphones, tablets, personal computers, and other connected devices).

**Third-Party Advertising  **

We may use third parties, including ad networks, to display advertising on our Web Site. Some of these companies may place a cookie on your computer to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement. This enables them to understand where you, or others who are using your computer, saw their advertisement and deliver ads that they believe are of interest to you.  We do not control these companies’ use of cookies. 

Some of these companies are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”), which offers a single location to opt out of their cookies. Please visit the NAI’s website at: <http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp>, (Note: NAI’s website is an independent website not sponsored by or affiliated with AmerisourceBergen).

To better serve you and other potential customers, AmerisourceBergen has implemented Google Analytics Advertising features such as, but not limited to, Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting. Using the Google Ad settings, you can opt-out of Google Analytics Advertising.

AmerisourceBergen will not facilitate the merging of Personal Data with non-Personal Data collected through any Google Analytics Advertising features unless we provide you notice of, and obtain your prior affirmative (i.e., opt-in) consent, to that merger.  We and third-party vendors, including Google, may use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on your past visits to our Web Site.

We and third-party vendors, including Google, may use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to report how our ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to your visits to our Web Site.

We may use data from Google’s Interest-based advertising or third-party audience data (such as age, gender and interests) with Google Analytics primarily to improve our marketing campaigns and this Web Site’s content.

For more details on how AmerisourceBergen uses Google Analytics to collect and process data, please visit Google Privacy and Terms.

This Privacy Statement constitutes AmerisourceBergen’s notification to you of the type(s) of data that it intends to collect from you or your device when you use Google Maps. AmerisourceBergen’s implementation of Google Maps in connection with this Web Site will not obtain or cache your location in any manner unless we obtain your prior consent, which you may revoke at any time.

AmerisourceBergen, or a third party service provider we select, may serve ads according to information we collect during your visits to an AmerisourceBergen website, including this Web Site. AmerisourceBergen will (i) where legally required, only provide you with such information after you have opted in and (ii) provide you the opportunity to opt out if you do not want to receive further marketing-related types of communication from us. You can opt out of these at any time.
