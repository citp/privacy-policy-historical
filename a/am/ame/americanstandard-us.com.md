Our Privacy Policy has been updated and is now available.  It will become effective 30 days from publication.  If you have any questions, please reach out to us using the information provided under the “Contacting Us” section below.

Last Updated: March 21, 2017

LIXIL Water Technology Americas (“LWTA”), is a business unit of the LIXIL Corporation, and holds a leading market position in a key region of the world.  Brands in its portfolio include American Standard Brands (“ASB”), GROHE and DXV, among others.  LWTA, of course, recognizes that privacy is of key importance and we want you to be familiar with how we collect, use and disclose your information.  This Privacy Policy describes the privacy practices of LWTA in connection with information that we collect through various channels including the websites we own and operate (collectively, the “Websites”), through the software applications made available by us for use on or through computers and mobile devices (the “Apps”), through our social media pages that we control (collectively, our “Social Media Pages”), through email messages and through your communications with us (collectively, including the Websites, the Apps and our Social Media Pages, the “Online Services,” and together with offline channels, the “Services”).  Our Privacy Policy does not govern our collection of information through any means other than through the Services and it does not govern the collection of information by any third parties. This Privacy Policy applies to Websites on which it is found posted. 

**By using our Websites or Services, or by providing information to us, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.   **

**Collection of Information**

**“Personal Information”**  is information that identifies you as an individual or relates to an identifiable individual.  **“Other Information”  **is any information that does not reveal your specific identity or does not directly relate to an individual.  Personal Information and Other Information is herein collectively referred to as “ **Information** ”.

We may collect Information such as name, address, telephone number and email address, date of birth or goods and services purchased, special requests made, and information about your preferences and user account, either directly or through third parties.  We may also collect browser and device information, App usage data and information collected through other technologies, as well as demographic and aggregated information.

If you submit any Information relating to other people to us or to our service providers in connection with the Services (e.g., if you make a purchase or register for another individual), you represent that you have the authority to do so and to permit us to use the Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

We and our service providers may collect Information in a variety of ways, including:

  * **Through Our Online Services:  **We may collect Information when you place an order or otherwise purchase goods and services from us, communicate with us via online chat services, inform us of any special requests or preferences you may have, or sign up for a newsletter or participate in a survey, contest, or promotional offer.
  * **Through Our Offline Services:  **We may collect Information from you offline, such as when one of our representatives visits your home, when you place an order over the phone or contact customer service.
  * **From Other Sources:  **We may receive your Information from other sources, such as public databases, joint marketing partners, and other third parties. This may include information from your credit card provider, and other partners, and from social media platforms (including from people with whom you are friends or otherwise connected to).  Certain Information from your social media account may be linked to other Online Services and shared with us, which may include Information that is part of your social media account or your friends’ account.
  * **From Authorized Licensees:  **LWTA may from time to time enter into a license or similar agreement with a third party to sell products and services under a LWTA brand.  Such an “Authorized Licensee” is independent from LWTA and may provide information to us about your purchases or your intersection with its sales or service departments. 


  * **Through your browser or device:**  Certain Information is collected by most browsers or automatically through your device, such as your Media Access Control (MAC) address, computer type (Windows or Macintosh), screen resolution, operating system name and version, device manufacturer and model, language, Internet browser type and version and the name and version of the Online Services (such as the Apps) you are using. We use this information to ensure that the Online Services function properly.
  * **Through your use of the Apps:  **When you download and use an App, we and our service providers and business partners may track and collect App usage data, such as the date and time the App on your device accesses our servers and what information and files have been downloaded to the App based on your device number.
  * **Payment information:** While payment information may be required if you elect to pay for certain goods or services via credit card, we do not collect and do not have access to complete credit card numbers.  This information is passed through directly to our service provider, which processes payment.  We do not take any responsibility for the acts or website of the service provider regarding the processing of this information.  We do retain “masked” or portions of credit card numbers for limited purposes such as confirmation of credit card payment receipts. 
  * **Using cookies:  **We collect information through the use of cookies which allows us to tailor our advertisements or offers to you. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to automatically decline cookies or be given the choice of declining or accepting the transfer to your computer of a particular cookie (or cookies) from a particular site.  If, however, you do not accept cookies, you may experience some inconveniences such as needing to log in every time you visit or you may not receive offers from us that are relevant to your interests and needs.  At this time, we do not respond to browser “Do-Not-Track” signals.


  * **Using pixel tags and other similar technologies:  **Pixel tags (also known as web beacons and clear GIFs) may be used in connection with some Online Services to, among other things, track the actions of users of the Online Services (including email recipients), measure the success of our marketing campaigns and compile statistics about usage of the Online Services and response rates. 
  * **Google Analytics:** We also use Google Analytics and Adobe Analytics, which uses cookies and similar technologies to collect and analyze information about use of the Services and report on activities and trends. These services may collect information regarding the use of other websites, apps and online resources. You can learn about Google’s practices by going to www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners, and opt-out by downloading the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on, available at <https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout>. You can learn more about Adobe and opt-out by visiting <http://www.adobe.com/privacy/opt-out.html>.
  * **Using Adobe Flash technology (including Flash Local Shared Objects (“Flash LSOs”)) and other similar technologies:**  We may use Flash LSOs and other technologies to, among other things, collect and store information about your use of the Online Services. If you do not want Flash LSOs stored on your computer, you can block Flash LSO storage using the tools contained in the [Website Storage Settings Panel](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html "Website Storage Settings Panel"). You can also control Flash LSOs by going to the [Global Storage Settings Panel](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager03.html "Global Storage Settings Panel") and following the instructions.  Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash LSOs may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash applications, including those used in connection with the Online Services. For more information, you may also wish to refer to <https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html>.
  * **IP Address:**  Your IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). An IP address may be identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever a user accesses the Online Services, along with the time of the visit and the page(s) that were visited. Collecting IP addresses is standard practice and is done automatically by many websites, applications and other services. We use IP addresses for purposes such as calculating usage levels, diagnosing server problems and administering the Online Services. We may also derive your approximate location from your IP address.
  * **Physical Location & Mobile Location-Based Services: **We may collect the general physical location of your device by, for example, using satellite, cell phone tower, WiFi signals, or other technologies. We may use your device’s general physical location to provide you with personalized location-based services, advertising and content.  If you have downloaded one of our Apps, you may enroll to receive special offers by agreeing to the use of technologies that enable us to collect information about your precise location through your mobile device’s Bluetooth or similar capabilities. We will collect this precise location information only if you opt-in through the App (either during your initial login or later) to receive the special offers and by enabling these capabilities on your mobile device.
  * **By aggregating information:  **Aggregated Information does not personally identify you or any other user of the Services (for example, we may aggregate Information to calculate the percentage of our users who have a particular telephone area code).



**Use of Information**

We may use and disclose Information for various purposes, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law.  Such purposes include:

  * To allow you to participate in sweepstakes, contests and other promotions and to administer these activities. Some of these activities have additional rules and may be operated by service providers who have their own rules, as well.  Please read any such rules carefully as they could explain how your Information is used and disclosed. 
  * For our business purposes, such as data analysis, audits, security and fraud monitoring and prevention, developing new products, enhancing, improving or modifying our Services, identifying usage trends, determining the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns and operating and expanding our business activities.

  * **To Authorized Licensees:  **We may disclose your Information to an Authorized Licensee in connection with the Services.  An example of this is a dealer or retailer that offers our products for sale.  The third-party dealer or retailer may contact you directly by email, phone or postal mail.

  * **Sponsors of Sweepstakes, Contests and other Promotions.   **We may operate sweepstakes, contests and other promotions through the Services that may require online registration with us or with third-party providers of such contests or promotions.  You should carefully review the rules of each sweepstakes, contest or promotion in which you participate through the Services, as they may contain additional information about the third-party provider’s use or disclosure of your Information.  If there is a conflict in the treatment of Information between the rules of the sweepstakes or other promotion and this Policy, the terms and conditions of such rules control. 
  * **Through Social Media:  **We may disclose your Information to your friends associated with your social media account, to other website users and to your social media account provider, in connection with your social sharing activity.  By linking your Online Services account and your social media account, you authorize us to share information with your social media account provider, and you understand that the use of the information we share will be governed by the social media site’s privacy policy and according to the privacy settings you have chosen.  In addition, when you elect to post information on message boards, chat, profile pages and blogs and other services to which you are able to post information and materials (including, without limitation, our Social Media Pages) any such information you post or disclose through these services will become public and may be available to other users and the general public.
