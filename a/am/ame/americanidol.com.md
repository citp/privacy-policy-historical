# Privacy Policy - American Idol - American Idol

* ### Introduction

Fox Broadcasting Company, a division of Fox Entertainment Group, ("Fox", "Our", "Us", "We") operates AmericanIdol.com (the "Site"), an entertainment website. The services the Site offers include applications, community pages, message boards, music and video services, and any other _American Idol_ ("Show") related features, content, promotions, games or applications offered from time to time by Us including when accessed via the Internet, mobile or other devices (collectively, the "Services"). Fox is part of the United States based operations of News Corporation.

As set forth in Our [Terms of Use](http://www.americanidol.com/legal/terms/), the Site is a general audience site, is not targeted to children, and does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age.

This Privacy Policy applies to all "users," including both those who use some of the Services without being registered or subscribing to Services and those who have subscribed to one or more Service, and/or have registered with Us to create a profile or enter a contest or sweepstake (collectively "Members"). This Privacy Policy describes Our collection and use of users' personal information (e.g., information that identifies a specific person, such as full name or email address) where that information is not otherwise publicly available on the Services. We also provide information on the Site's Privacy Settings and describe generally Our practices for handling non-personally identifiable information (e.g., interests, demographics and site usage) to the extent such information is associated with a particular user or user account.

* ### Submission and collection of information on the services

_User Submitted Information_

**Registration Information** is the information that Members must provide at registration in order to create a profile, subscribe to a Service or enter a game, contest or sweepstake (also called an "Account"), such as display name, email address and date of birth.

**Public Information and Posts** consist of your display name and, if you provide one, your display picture and your posts and comments on the Site outside of your profile (e.g., posts and comments made on other Member profiles and on general Site content, such as site provided photos, and in general site areas, such as community forums). Your Public Information and Posts are always public, which means they are available to everyone and will be displayed in search results both on the Services and on external search engines. However, when you post content or comments to another Member's profile, that information will be disclosed consistent with that Member's Privacy Settings.

**Profile Content** consists of information Members may add to their profile. It includes information and content you may add to your profile, such as gender, location, first, middle and last name, "favorite idol moment," friends, comments and similar information. You can control whom you share some of your Profile Content with through your Privacy Settings accessible on your "Edit your Account" page.

**Third Party Information and Content.** If you access the Site or Services through a third party connection or log-in, your user submitted information may also include your user ID and/or user name associated with that third party service, any information/content you have permitted the third party to share with the Services, and any information you have made public in connection with that third party service (collectively, "Third Party Information and Content"). Third Party Information and Content obtained in this manner will be governed by this Privacy Policy, any applicable policy of the third party and the terms and conditions and/or terms of use for the Services.

_Site collected Information_

**Site Activity Information.** When users access the Site or Services, We may collect certain non-personally identifiable information about those visits. For example, in order to permit your connection to the Site, Our servers receive and record information about your computer and browser, including potentially your IP address, browser type, and other software or hardware information. If you access the Site from a mobile or other device, We may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device or other transactional information for that device in order to serve content to it. We also may use cookies and other tracking technologies (including browser cookies, pixels, beacons, and Adobe Flash technology including cookies), which are comprised of small bits of data that often include an anonymous unique identifier. Websites send this data to your browser when you first request a web page and then store the data on your computer so the website can access information when you make subsequent requests for pages from that site. We may use these technologies to collect and store information about your usage of the Site, such as pages you have visited, search queries you have run, and advertisements you have seen. American Idol may also use cookies and similar tools to relate your use of the Site to personal information obtained from you or a reputable third party. For example, if you have asked Us to provide you information about Our upcoming products or promotions, cookie and/or click stream data about your activities on the Site may allow Us to limit the materials We provide you to items We think you will find interesting, based on your prior online activities and preferences.

Third parties that support the Site by serving advertisements or providing services, such as allowing users to share content or tracking aggregate site usage statistics, may also use these technologies to collect similar information. We do not control these third-party technologies and their use is governed by the privacy policies of third parties using such technologies. For more information about third-party ad networks that use these technologies, see [www.aboutads.info](http://www.aboutads.info/).

Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, but you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether. Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for more information (e.g., http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Block-or-allow-cookies). Users can manage the use of Flash technologies, including cookies, with the Flash management tools available at Adobe's website, see <http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/security/privacy_policy/faq.html>. Please note that by blocking any or all cookies you may not have access to certain features or personalization available through the Site.

**Third Parties.** To improve the quality of the Site, We may supplement the information We collect with information from third parties. If you access the Site through a third-party connection or log-in, We may also collect Third Party Information and Content.

* ### Notice & Choice

If We make material changes to this Privacy Policy that expand Our rights to use your personal information, We will notify you to seek your consent. In the event the last email address you provided to Us is not valid or is not capable of delivering the notice to you, Our dispatch of an email containing the notice to that e-mail address shall nonetheless constitute effective notice.

**Location of Data.** The Site is hosted in the United States. If you are a user located outside the United States, you understand and consent to having any personal information you provide transferred to, processed and stored in the United States and other countries where data protection and other privacy laws may not offer the same level of protection as those in your jurisdiction, such as the European Union. This includes the use of cookies and other tracking technologies as described above. As a result, please read this Privacy Policy with care.

**Linked Websites or Services.** The Services may also be linked to sites or services operated by Fox affiliates (i.e., that are part of the News America Group: "[Affiliated Companies](http://www.newscorp.com/)") or third parties, and may carry advertisements or offer content, functionality, games, newsletters, contests or sweepstakes or applications developed and maintained by third parties, including, the online store. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of any such third parties, and once you leave the Site via a link, enable a third-party service, or click an advertisement, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third-party site. Additionally, although all Affiliated Companies adhere to the News Corporation corporate [Privacy Principles](http://www.newscorp.com/privacy.html), users who visit an Affiliated Company site should still refer to its separate privacy policy, which may differ in some respects from this Privacy Policy.
