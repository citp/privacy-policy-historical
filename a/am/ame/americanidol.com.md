# Privacy Policy -- American Idol

Fox Digital Media ("Fox Digital"), a division of Fox Entertainment Group, is part of the News America Group, which has adopted a set of Privacy Principles (the "Principles") (<http://www.newscorp.com/privacy.html>) applicable to all its U.S.-based companies. Fox Digital operates the internet web site located at www.americanidol.com (our "Site"). Fox Digital has implemented those Principles in this Privacy Policy (the "Privacy Policy"), which describes how we collect, use and share personally identifiable information ("PII") we obtain from and about individuals located in the U.S. both online and offline.

The Site is a general audience web site, and Fox Digital does not knowingly collect PII from children under 13 years of age. 

This Privacy Policy applies to "Visitors," which means that you simply browse the Site, "Subscribers," which means that you have subscribed to receive a newsletter, and "Members," which means that you have registered with our Site. The term "User" refers to a Visitor, Subscriber or a Member. By using our Site, you signify your agreement with all the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use our Site.

From time to time Fox Digital may revise this Privacy Policy to reflect industry initiatives or changes in the law, our PII collection and use practices, the features of our Site or technology. If we make revisions that change the way we collect or use your PII, those changes will be posted in this Privacy Policy and the effective date will be noted at the beginning of such Privacy Policy. Your continued use of the Site after Fox Digital posts a revised Privacy Policy signifies your acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy. Therefore, you should review it periodically so that you are up to date on our most current policies and practices. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Fox Digital materially changes its practices regarding collection or use of your PII, your PII will continue to be governed by the Privacy Policy under which it was collected unless you have been provided notice of and have not objected to the change(s). In the event the last e-mail address you provided to us is not valid or is not capable of delivering the notice to you, Fox Digital's dispatch of an e-mail containing the notice to that e-mail address shall nonetheless constitute effective notice.

*      **COLLECTION: COLLECTION OF PII BY FOX DIGITAL.**

**General**. When Fox Digital collects PII, such as your full name, email address or birth date, from you it is because you are voluntarily submitting the information to us in order to register as a Member ("Registration PII"). Fox Digital may also collect PII from you if you choose to participate in activities like sweepstakes, contests, games, surveys, in connection with content or comments you submit to us, in public forums, or because you want us to furnish you with products, services or information. We may also obtain PII from reputable third parties. 

You may also choose to voluntarily provide or store non-PII information in your personal profile ("Your Profile") or on other public forums provided on the Site, including but not limited to, text, files, images, photos, works of authorship, private messages, chats or any other materials (collectively "Content"). Content posted by any User is "User Content". If you choose to make User Content public or provide any User Content on other public forums provided on the Site, you do so at your sole discretion and risk.

Members can change their Your Profile information at any time and can control how other Members and Fox Digital communicate with them by controlling their account settings, by going to the Your Profile page and clicking on the "Edit Profile & Theme" button.

Fox Digital collects information from you at several different points on the Site in the manner set forth below:

**Member Registration and Profile** : In order to access certain information and services on the Site, you must first become a Member by completing our Member Registration form. During the registration process you will be required to provide registration data, including the Registration PII. Registration PII is not incorporated into "Your Profile" and is made private. **** You have the option of adding certain User Content to Your Profile.

If Your Profile information changes you may correct, update or remove it. You can edit Your Profile information by going to the Your Profile page and clicking on the "Edit Profile & Theme" button.

**Newsletters** : Fox Digital delivers newsletters to its Subscribers on a variety of topics related to American Idol. If you would like to subscribe to the American Idol newsletter that Fox Digital offers, please visit <http://www.americanidol.com/newsletter/>. In order to subscribe to the American Idol newsletter, you will be required to give your e-mail address, birth date and zip code. 

You may unsubscribe to the American Idol newsletter by clicking the link at the bottom of the newsletter e-mail or writing to the Privacy Officer (see contact information in "Remedies and Compliance" below). 

**Sweepstakes and Contests** : Sweepstakes, contests, games and other promotions run on the Site by Fox Digital may require the User to provide some PII such as full name, address, e-mail address, and phone number, in order to participate. Fox Digital may use a reputable third party to manage and administer some or all of its sweepstakes and/or contests. This third party may have access to some or all of the PII that is provided by the User in order to participate in the sweepstakes and/or contest. In those instances, the third party will be instructed by Fox Digital to use the PII solely for the specific sweepstakes and/or contest related purpose for which it was requested, and in compliance with this Privacy Policy. Most often this information is used only to select and contact winners of the sweepstakes and/or contests. Any other use of the PII by the third party is strictly prohibited unless expressly authorized by you. Our sweepstakes and/or contests are targeted to individuals 18 years of age and older, and individuals under 18 years of age are not eligible to participate unless specifically permitted by the official rules of the related sweepstakes or contest. Fox Digital requires proof of age in order for an individual to collect any prizes awarded. If and when Fox Digital sponsors sweepstakes and/or contests, or third parties jointly sponsor such sweepstakes and/or contests with us, the relevant privacy information will be included in the official rules and/or posted on registration area for the sweepstakes and/or contest. That privacy information, to the extent it conflicts with this Privacy Policy, will govern that particular sweepstakes or contest—please remember to read it carefully.

**Message Board, Blogs and Social Networking** : Fox Digital provides message boards, blogs and other public forums on the Site for exchanging information and social networking. Please note that information, User Content or any other materials that you post on our Site, including any information from Your Profile that you choose to make public, will be available for any User of that service to read, and is therefore no longer private and may be disclosed without limitations as to its use by a third party. If you post information, materials or User Content on the Site or other public forum you provide information that can be collected and used by others that you do not know for their own purposes, including the distribution of unsolicited communications. Fox Digital reserves the right to reproduce or publish any materials posted on the Site in any other formats. 

**Cookies**. Cookies are small bits of information that our Site places on the hard drive of your computer. Cookies remember information about your activities on our Site and enable Fox Digital to make your visits to our Site more enjoyable. For example, cookies can store your password for easy logon to a site you have previously visited and can save your preferences for a personalized home page. Information about your activities on this Site and other non-personally identifiable information about you may also be used to limit the online ads you encounter to those we believe are consistent with your interests.

Third party advertisements displayed on this Site may also contain cookies set by Internet advertising companies or advertisers. Fox Digital does not control these cookies and visitors to this Site should check the privacy policy of the Internet advertising company or advertiser to see whether and how it uses cookies. See the "Notice" section below for more information on third party advertisements. 

Fox Digital may use cookies and similar tools to relate your use of our Site to PII obtained from you or a reputable third party. For example, if you have asked us to provide you information about our upcoming products or promotions, cookie and/or click stream data about your activities on our Site may allow us to limit the materials we provide you to items we think you will find interesting, based on your prior online activities and preferences. However, if Fox Digital wishes to combine your personal and cookie or click stream information in this manner, we will obtain your express affirmative consent. 

You can program your computer to warn you each time a cookie is being sent or to refuse cookies completely. However, without cookies you may not have access to certain features on our Site. 

Fox Digital also uses web beacons (also known as action tags or single pixel gifs) to access Fox Digital cookies and in connection with the services we offer through our Site. A web beacon is a transparent image placed on a web page that sends a signal when a person visits that page. This enables us to assess the popularity and effectiveness of the materials on our Site. We may also use web beacons in connection with newsletter and other e-mails we send to Users, to let us know whether the e-mail was opened. No PII is transmitted through web beacons. We also collect IP (Internet Protocol) addresses to analyze trends, administer our Site, track a User's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.

*     NOTICE: FOX DIGITAL WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH NOTICE ABOUT ITS PII COLLECTION PRACTICES

When you voluntarily provide PII to Fox Digital, we will make sure you are informed about who is collecting the information, how and why the information is being collected and the types of uses Fox Digital will make of the information. At the time you provide your PII, Fox Digital will notify you of your options regarding our use of your PII, including whether we will share it with outside companies (See "Choice" below). This Privacy Policy describes the types of other companies that may want to send you information about their products and services and therefore may want to share your PII, provided you have given Fox Digital permission to do so (See "Use" below). 

Sometimes we collect PII from consumers in manual format or off-line, such as a post card or subscription form. Providing detailed notice in those situations often proves impractical, so consumers will instead be provided with a short notice that describes how to obtain the full text of this Policy and other relevant information from us. 

Our Site may be linked to Internet web sites operated by other companies. Some of these third party web sites may be co-branded with an American Idol logo, even though they are not operated or maintained by Fox Digital. Our Site also carries advertisements from other companies. Fox Digital is not responsible for the privacy practices of web sites operated by third parties that are linked to our Site or for the privacy practices of third party or national Internet advertising companies. Once you leave our Site via such a link or by clicking on an advertisement, Fox Digital's Privacy Policy no longer applies and you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third party or advertiser site to determine how they will handle any PII they collect from you. 

The online store is a third party web site (the "Online Store"). Once you click on the link to the Online Store, you have left our Site and this Privacy Policy no longer applies. Any PII collected from you at the Online Store, including any credit card or billing information, is subject to the privacy policy for the Online Store.

Fox Digital's web site(s) may also be linked to web sites operated by companies affiliated with Fox Digital (i.e., that are part of the News America Group). Although all News America Group entities adhere to the group's Privacy Principles located at <http://www.newscorp.com/privacy.html>, visitors to those affiliated web sites should still refer to their separate privacy policies and practices, which may differ in some respects from this Privacy Policy. 

Some of the advertisements that appear on our Site are delivered to you by national Internet advertising companies such as Doubleclick. These companies utilize certain technologies to deliver advertisements and marketing messages and to collect anonymous information about your visit to our Site, including information about the banner ads they display, any cookie they place on your computer and your IP address. To opt out of information collection by these companies, or to obtain information about the technologies they use or their own privacy policies, please visit:

*     CHOICE: FOX DIGITAL WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH CHOICES ABOUT THE USE OF YOUR PII

Fox Digital will not use the PII you provide to us for purposes different from the purpose for which it was submitted, or share your PII with third parties that are not affiliated with Fox Digital (i.e., not part of the News America Group), unless we obtain your permission. 

*     USE: FOX DIGITAL'S USE OF PII

Fox Digital will use your PII provided under this Privacy Policy in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If Fox Digital obtains PII from a third party, such as a business partner, our use of that information is governed by this Privacy Policy. Fox Digital may share your PII with companies that are affiliated with us, that is, are part of the News America Group of companies. Provided you have given us permission, Fox Digital may also share your PII with advertisers and business partners that are not affiliated with Fox Digital, but would like to send you information about their products and services. For example, some of the companies who supply prizes for Fox Digital's contests may have special offers or promotions that might be of interest to Fox Digital users. However, you will always have the opportunity to instruct us not to share your information with third parties when PII is collected. 

Fox Digital employees, agents and contractors must have a legitimate business reason to obtain access to your PII. Fox Digital may share your PII with outside contractors or agents who help us manage our information activities (e.g., sweepstakes administration, order fulfillment, statistical analyses), but they may only use your PII to provide Fox Digital with a specific service and not for any other purpose. 

Fox Digital may also enter into agreements with outside companies that possess the technology that allows Fox Digital to customize the advertising and marketing messages you receive on our Site. Your non-PII and click stream data about your activities on our Site may be shared with these companies so this customization can be accomplished. These companies will not share your information with any third party or use it for any other purpose. Anonymous click stream, number of page views calculated by web beacons and demographic information may also be shared with Fox Digital's advertisers and business partners.

There may be instances when Fox Digital may disclose PII without providing you with a choice in order to protect the legal rights of Fox Digital, other companies within the News America Group or their employees, agents and contractors; to protect the safety and security of visitors to our Site; to protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; or to comply with the law or legal process. In addition, if Fox Digital sells all or part of its business or makes a sale or transfer of assets or is otherwise involved in a merger or business transfer, Fox Digital may transfer your PII to a third party as part of that transaction. 

*     SECURITY: FOX DIGITAL PROTECTS THE SECURITY OF PII

Fox Digital uses reasonable administrative, technical, personnel and physical measures to safeguard PII in its possession against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure or modification. In addition, Fox Digital uses reasonable methods to make sure that PII is accurate, up-to-date and appropriately complete. However, no security system is impenetrable. Fox Digital cannot warrant or guarantee the security of its servers, nor can it guarantee that information that you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to Fox Digital over the Internet.

*      **ACCESS: HOW TO ACCESS, CORRECT OR DELETE YOUR PII**

Whenever possible, Members and Subscribers may review the PII we maintain about them in our records. We will take reasonable steps to correct any PII a Member or Subscriber informs us of in writing is incorrect. If you are a Member, you can view and change your Member preferences and Your Profile information by logging into your account and accessing "Edit Profile." Subscribers can unsubscribe to the American Idol newsletter in accordance with the procedure set forth above under "Collection: Collection of PII by Fox Digital – Newsletters".

If for any reason you want Fox Digital to stop using your PII, Fox Digital will honor that request; however, Fox Digital will retain any record of your PII that is necessary to comply with applicable federal, state or local law. Keep in mind, moreover, that there will be residual information that will remain within Fox Digital's databases, access logs, and other records, which may or may not contain such PII. Even after removal of PII and User Content by you or Fox Digital, PII and User Content may still be viewable in cached and archived pages or if another User has stored your User Content.
