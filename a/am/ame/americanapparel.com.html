					By accessing the Site and shopping in our Stores, you agree to be bound by the Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Accordingly, you should check the date of this Policy (which appears at the top of this page) and review any changes since the last version. If at any time you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use this Site and refrain from purchasing from us. <br> <br>
					Our products are also available for sale in other non-affiliated stores. Data collected in these stores is the property of the respective stores and is not provided to American Apparel Corporation. If you have questions about the privacy policies, for these companies, please contact them directly. <br> <br>
					Our policies relating to the transfer of Personal Information from the European Union ("EU") to the United States are contained in our Safe Harbor Privacy Policy.

				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="bodyItem">
				<div data-type="title">Use of Information Collected by Us </div>
				<div data-type="body">
					American Apparel may collect two types of information about users: "Personal Information" (such as name, email address, mailing address, phone number, credit card number and the items you purchase) and "Aggregate Information" (such as information about how many users log on to our Site on a daily basis or frequency of customer visits to American Apparel Stores). <br> <br>
					We use customer information in an effort to improve your shopping experience and to communicate with you about our products, services, promotions and contests. We may also use this information to make offers to you, to help us target specific products and services to you, and to help us develop and improve our Site and Stores and tailor our Sites and Stores to your interests. 
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="bodyItem">
				<div data-type="title">Personal Information Collected Online by AmericanApparel.net and at Our Stores</div>
				<div data-type="body">Personal Information is collected online by us or our service providers (e.g., such as Yahoo!) on our behalf when users voluntarily register with AmericanApparel.net to purchase items, receive electronic newsletters, use community and communication services, 		answer surveys and enter contests and other promotional opportunities provided on AmericanApparel.net, when users make a purchase, and when users subscribe to our newsletter. We also maintain a record of your product interests and purchases online. We may receive personal usage and demographic information from our Stores. <br> <br>
					If you accessed this store through Yahoo! Shopping, Yahoo! also automatically collects information about your shopping experience. Yahoo! automatically collects order information but may only use this information in aggregate. Please see the Yahoo! Privacy Policy for more information about how Yahoo! uses this information.<br> <br>
					In our Stores, Personal Information is collected from you in a number of ways, including the following: <br> <br>
					<ul>
					<li>When you purchase products from our Stores, we may collect your name, address, email address, telephone number(s) and credit card information (with the expiration date). In addition, we collect transaction information related to your purchase (such as what you bought, the price you paid, the payment method you used and if the product was on sale). </li>
					<li>When you fill out a tailoring order or instruct us to mail product to another location, we may collect your name, address, email address, telephone number and credit card information. </li>
					<li>When you fill out any in-store promotional surveys, we may gather certain optional Personal Information, such as your opinions on specific products and/or services, in addition to identifying information, such as your name, address, telephone number(s), email address(es), income and employment status. </li>
					</ul>
					We love our customers. We realize that you have other options, and we appreciate that you have chosen American Apparel products. We strive to be the most progressive garment manufacturer in the world, and we extend that ambition to our online sales. We understand that you are concerned about your security, privacy and the confidentiality of information we may gain about you online. We are committed to respecting your privacy.
					</div>
			</div>
			<div class="bodyItem">
				<div data-type="title">Aggregate Information Collected Online by AmericanApparel.Net and at Our Stores </div>
				<div data-type="body">Aggregate Information is non-personally identifiable/anonymous information about you, such as age, gender, types of products purchased, frequency of Store visits, Site pages you access most frequently or search terms you enter. Aggregate Information is used in a collective manner, and no single person can be identified by that compiled information. For example, the number of people who shopped at AmericanApparel.net during a specific time period or the number of people who shopped at our Stores who are 25 years of age is Aggregate Information that does not personally identify a specific user. Both AmericanApparel.Net and our Stores collect Aggregate Information. </div>

			<div class="bodyItem">
				<div data-type="title">Order-related and Promotional email </div>
				<div data-type="body">

				The Personal Information and Aggregate Information collected at our Stores may be shared with AmericanApparel.net as well as reputable third-party organizations to contact consumers for marketing and promotional purposes. Third party contacts to our customers may be initiated only by postal mail. Except as described in this Privacy Policy, our Stores will not share your telephone number or e-mail address. <br><br>
				AmericanApparel.net, affiliate sites, and our Stores may divulge Personal Information if such action is required for American Apparel or any of our service providers or consultants to comply with any valid legal process, such as a subpoena, search warrant, statute or court order, or any valid administrative request from a law enforcement agency. In addition, we may divulge Personal Information if we or any of our service providers or consultants believes that such disclosure is necessary to address any unlawful acts or acts that may endanger the health or safety of another customer or of the general public.

				<div data-type="body">A pixel tag, also known as a clear GIF or web beacon, is an invisible tag placed on certain pages of our Site but not on your computer.

				<div data-type="title">Security and SSL </div>
				<div data-type="body">Protecting your order information is a priority for us. We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to protect the security of your online order information. To check the security of your connection, look at the lower right-hand corner of your browser window after accessing the server. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending on your browser), then SSL is active and the server is secure. You can also double-check by looking at the URL line of your browser. When accessing a secure server, the first characters of the Site address will change from "http" to "https." Some versions of browsers and some firewalls don't permit communication through secure servers. In that case, you won't be able to connect to the server and therefore won't be able to place an order through a secure connection. If you cannot access the secure server for any reason, please print our shopping page and place your order by phone at +1 213 488 0226</div>
