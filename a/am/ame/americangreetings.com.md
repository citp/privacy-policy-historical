  1. ## INFORMATION COLLECTION

    1. ### Information You Provide

The Platforms may request that you provide certain personally identifiable information, which is information that may reasonably be used to identify you as a specific individual ("Personal Information"). Examples of Personal Information include your name, e-mail address, username, address, and phone number. The Platforms may also request additional information about you, such as payment information, demographic information (e.g., your gender, ZIP code, or marital status), or information about your preferences and interests. The Platforms may require that you provide certain information to use the Platforms or certain features, and the required information may change from time to time depending on, among other things, the nature of your relationship with us. If we combine demographic or similar information with the Personal Information we collect, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information under this Privacy Notice.

The Platforms may also enable you to transmit files or otherwise provide information to AG. Please note that files you transmit may contain metadata, which may contain Personal Information about you. For example, photos you transmit could include metadata indicating where (e.g., GPS coordinates) and when (date and time) the photo was taken.

    2. ### Information the Platforms Automatically Collect

We and our third-party service providers collect certain information about your use of our Platforms ("Usage Information"). Usage Information may include the browser and operating system you are using, the URL, advertisements, or search terms that referred or otherwise led you to the Platforms (if applicable), aspects of the Platforms that you use or visit, the products or services you access or view, the types of greeting cards that you send, and the time of day you accessed the Platforms, among other information.

Usage Information also includes the IP address or other unique identifier ("Device Identifier") for any computer, mobile phone or other device (any, a "Device") used to access the Platforms. A Device Identifier is automatically assigned to your Device, and our servers identify your Device by its Device Identifier. Please note that your IP address is included in the header information of every e-card notification email that we send for your e-cards. Some mobile service providers may also provide us or our third party service providers with information regarding the physical location of a Device used to access the Platforms. Usage Information is generally non-identifying, but if we associate it with you as a specific and identifiable person, we treat it as Personal Information.

The methods used to collect Usage Information may include:

      1. #### Cookies

A cookie is a data file placed on a Device when it is used to visit a Platform or otherwise access our online content. Cookies may be used for many purposes, such as remembering you and your preferences and tracking your visits to the Platforms. A Flash cookie is a data file placed on a Device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your Device. Flash cookies may be used for various purposes, such as enabling a Flash feature and remembering your preferences. Flash cookies may not be deleted when you delete other types of cookies from a Device. For more information about Flash and the privacy choices Adobe offers, visit <http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html>. If you choose to disable cookies on your Device, some features of the Platforms or our content may not function properly.

Below is information about one such vendor we use across one or more Platforms.

_Google Analytics_

AG uses a specific cookie in order to facilitate the use of Google Universal Analytics for users logged-in to the Platforms ("Logged-In User"). If you are a Logged-In User, AG may use your AG user ID in combination with Google Universal Analytics and Google Analytics to track and analyze the pages of the services you visit. We do this only to better understand how you use the Platform, with a view to offering improvements for all AG users; and to tailor our business and marketing activities accordingly, both generally and specifically to you. Google Analytics cookies do not provide AG with any Personal Information and you may opt-out of this feature by installing the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on. Note: This opt-out feature only works on your desktop browser and not on a mobile device.

AG uses other third-party performance and remarketing cookies, and further information on those third-party cookies can be obtained by contacting us at [help@amgreetings.com](mailto:help@amgreetings.com).

      2. #### Web Beacons and Pixels

Small graphic images or other web programming code called "web beacons" "clear GIFs" or "1x1 pixels" may be used on the Platforms or in our emails and may be invisible to you. Web beacons may be connected to your Personal Information, if you have provided it. Web beacons may be used for a various purposes, such as counting visitors to the Platforms, monitoring how users navigate the Platforms, counting how many emails that were sent were actually opened, or counting how many times a link was accessed. We do not sell, rent, trade, or otherwise distribute information about you gathered through the web beacons or 1x1 pixels with any third parties, except for third parties who provide us with advertising, marketing, research or analysis services.

Back to top
      3. #### Location-identifying Technologies

Additionally, the Platforms may use GPS (global positioning systems) software and other location-based technologies such as "iBeacons" to locate you so we may verify your location, deliver you relevant content based on your location, as well as allow you to share your location to other users as part of the services we provide via the Platform. We may determine your approximate and/or exact location information to provide location-based services. In addition to traditional GPS location-based services, some of the retailers and others we work with may install other types of location-tracking technology. These technologies emit a signal that we can use to detect to pinpoint your proximity to those locations (such as how close you are to retail locations and products) or otherwise interact with the Platform (such as to send you helpful information, offers, and discounts).

Back to top
      4. #### Embedded Scripts

An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Platforms, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Platforms, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.

Back to top
    3. ### Information You Provide About Third Parties

The Platforms may permit you to provide Personal Information about third parties, such as mailing address, email addresses, or significant dates (such as birthdays or anniversaries), and may permit you to do so through the use of Social Features or a Contact Importer. If you use the Platforms to send an ecard, paper card, gift card, or any other content, we collect certain Personal Information about the recipient (such as name, mailing address, and email address, as applicable). We may share the information regarding your transaction with third parties as necessary to process your transaction (i.e., to create, send or deliver the card). If you choose to provide Personal Information about third parties, we will store that information only in connection with your relationship with us (e.g., to send greeting cards).

Back to top
    4. ### Information Third Parties Provide About You

We may receive information about you from third parties. For example, if you are on another website and you opt-in to receive information from AG, the other website will forward your contact and other information to us so that we may contact you as requested. Further, we may receive certain information about you from third parties if you engage the third parties in connection with our Platforms – for example, if you download one of our Apps from an app store, make an in-app purchase, connect via Social Features, or make a payment using a third-party payment provider like PayPal, consistent with the privacy policies of the applicable third parties.

We also may supplement the information we collect with outside records from third parties in order to provide you with information, services or goods you have requested, to enhance our ability to serve you, and to tailor our content to you. We may combine the information we receive from those other sources with information we collect through the Platforms. In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Notice to the combined information.

  2. ## HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT

We may use information about you, including Personal Information and Usage Information, to: (1) allow you to use the Platforms or to provide related customer service; (2) provide or offer you information, products, or services, any of which may be tailored to you; (3) send or display special offers or advertisements from AG Companies (as hereinafter defined) and our business partners; (4) process your registration, including verifying that information you provide is active and valid; (5) process a transaction you initiate; (6) improve the Platforms and our products, and for internal business purposes, including the measurement of the Platforms' effectiveness; (7) contact you with regard to your use of the Platforms and, in our discretion, changes to our policies; (8) to identify and protect against fraudulent activities, transactions, and abuse of the Platforms, and to protect the rights and property of AG, its partners, and customers; and (9) as otherwise described in this Privacy Notice, for purposes disclosed at the time you provide your information, or with your consent.

Some of our Apps may request your location information (whether GPS or network-based). We may use the location information for a variety of purposes, including notifying you of stores or products near you. Unless otherwise stated, this location information is not tied to your Personal Information; and you may be able to prevent the collection of your location through your device settings.

If you contact us for customer support regarding the Platforms, we will not use the information you provide to contact you for marketing purposes unrelated to your request unless you agree otherwise.

Third parties may also collect non-Personal Information when you download or use the Platforms.

    2. ### Third Party Service Providers

Back to top
    3. ### When You Agree to Receive Information from Third Parties or Request That We Share Your Information

We may offer the opportunity to receive information or marketing offers from one or more third parties, or to otherwise have your information shared with a third party. We may also offer you the opportunity to order products and services from a third party directly through the Platforms or in communications you may receive from AG; and in this case, we will disclose that a third party will be fulfilling your order. If you agree to have us share your Personal Information and we do so, your Personal Information will be subject to the privacy practices of that third party. Please note that we are not responsible for the privacy policies and practices of third parties. If you later decide that you no longer wish to receive communications from a third party, you must contact that third party directly.

Back to top
    4. ### Contests, Sweepstakes and Promotions

We may sponsor contests, sweepstakes or other promotions (any, a "Promotion, and collectively, "Promotions"). If you choose to participate in a Promotion, you may be required to provide certain Personal Information. By participating in a Promotion, you agree to the official rules that govern that Promotion. The official rules may contain specific requirements of you, including, except where prohibited by law, allowing the sponsor(s) of the Promotion to use your name, voice, likeness or other indicia of persona in advertising or marketing associated with the Promotion.

    5. ### Sharing Between American Greetings Companies; Business Transitions

AG Companies are the subsidiaries and affiliates of American Greetings Corporation. We may share your information, including Personal Information, with AG Companies for a variety of purposes, such as to conduct Promotions, offer special premiums, and for business and operational purposes (such as sharing databases and equipment). We may, and reserve the right to, share your information with any other company that is not presently, but becomes one of the AG Companies. AG will facilitate payments through third party partners, but we will not share your credit card information or other payment information with anyone, including AG Companies, without your express permission.

We may also disclose and transfer your Personal Information: (i) to a subsequent owner, co-owner or operator of a Platform or applicable database; (ii) if AG (or any of its affiliated, parent, or subsidiary companies) assigns its rights regarding any of your information to a third party; or (iii) in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, liquidation, restructuring, the sale of certain of AG's ownership interests, assets, or both, or other company change, including during the course of any due diligence process (collectively, a "Business Transition").

We may also use Device Identifiers, including IP addresses, to identify users, and may do so in cooperation with copyright owners, Internet service providers, wireless service providers, or law enforcement agencies in our discretion. These transfers and disclosures may be carried out without notice to you.

  4. ## THIRD PARTY ANALYTICS AND ADVERTISING SERVICE PROVIDERS; ONLINE TRACKING

We work with certain third parties (including network advertisers, ad agencies, and analytics companies) for a variety of purposes. These purposes include providing us with information regarding traffic and use of the Platforms and our advertisements on the Platforms and across the Internet, and to engage in multi-site advertising. For example, if you click on an advertisement that led you to one of our Platforms, our service provider(s) may be able to tell us which advertisement you clicked on and where you were viewing the advertisement; or, you may be served AG advertisements elsewhere online based on your visit to or use of the Platforms. Some of these third parties may collect Personal Information when you visit the Platforms or other websites or online services. Additionally, we may share certain information derived from your Personal Information with third parties to assist us in delivering content or advertising to you, both on the Platforms and elsewhere online.

These third parties may set and access their own tracking technologies (including cookies, web beacons, and embedded scripts) and may otherwise collect or have access to your Device Identifier, Usage Information and related information about you. These service providers may use that information for their own purposes, including to target advertisements to you, prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times and to conduct research regarding the usefulness of certain advertisements to you. We may share the Device Identifier and Usage Information about visitors with third party advertising companies, analytics providers and other vendors for similar purposes.

AG does not control the information collection, use, or sharing practices of third party analytics providers or advertisers. Some of these parties may collect your Personal Information when you access the Platforms or other online websites and services.

While we may use a variety of service providers to perform advertising and analytics services, some of these companies may be members of the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI") or the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA") Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. You may want to visit <http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp>, which provides information regarding targeted advertising and the "opt-out" procedures of NAI members. You may also want to visit or <http://www.aboutads.info/choices/>, which provides information regarding targeted advertising and offers an "opt-out" by participating companies in the DAA Self-Regulatory Program. 

Back to top
  5. ## THIRD PARTY CONTENT AND LINKS TO THIRD PARTIES

Certain content found on the Platforms may be hosted and served by third parties. The Platforms may also contain links to third party websites or apps that we do not control. This includes links from advertisers, reward programs, sponsors and partners associated with the Platforms. These links may use AG's logo or the logo of one of the AG Companies as part of a co-branding agreement (e.g., a third party may be selling or providing AG products or services). In addition, AG content may be included on web pages and websites that are not associated with us and over which we have no control.

These third parties may collect Usage Information through the use of their own cookies, web beacons, or embedded scripts, and they may also independently collect data or solicit Personal Information. AG is not responsible for the privacy practices employed by any third party.

Back to top
  6. ## YOUR CONTROL OVER YOUR INFORMATION

AG may provide functionality on some Platforms to update your contact information and/or preferences through a "My Account" (or similar) section. If you submit a request to update your contact information, AG will make good faith efforts to make requested changes in our then active databases as soon as reasonably practicable. Note, however, that information may persist internally for AG's administrative purposes and that residual data may remain on backup media or for other reasons. Please also note that if you are the user of one of our Apps, you may be able to review and update your Personal Information or preferences only through the website associated with that App.

You may opt out of receiving marketing e-mails from us by following the opt-out instructions provided to you in those e-mails. Please note that we reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to your use of the Platforms and these transactional messages may be unaffected if you opt-out from marketing communications.

To opt-out of receiving direct mail, you may contact us through Customer Support at [help@amgreetings.com](mailto:help@amgreetings.com).

Note: Because mailings often are prepared well in advance you may, for a period of time, continue to receive some offers after you send us your request.

  7. ## OTHER MATTERS

    1. ### Safe Harbor Compliance

AG has certified that it adheres to the US-EU and the US-Swiss Safe Harbor Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement for the Platforms. To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view AG's certification, please visit <http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/>.

Subject to certain exceptions, upon request and provided you provide us sufficient information to confirm your identity, we will provide you the Personal Information that we have collected about you for the purpose of enabling you to correct, amend, or delete any inaccuracies. You may make this request by contacting us. If we are not able to provide the information that you are requesting within 30 days of receipt of your request, we will provide you a timeline for providing the requested information. If we deny access to your personal information, we will explain why access was denied and give you contact information for further inquiries regarding the denial of access.

If you have a complaint regarding our privacy practices that is not resolved after contacting us, AG has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the US-EU and US-Swiss Safe harbor Principles to an independent dispute resolution mechanism the BBB EU Safe Harbor, operated by the Council of Better Business Bureaus. If you do not receive timely acknowledgement of your complaint, or if AG does not satisfactorily address your complaint, please visit the BBB EU Safe Harbor Website at [www.bbb.org/us/safe-harbor-complaints](http://www.bbb.org/us/safe-harbor-complaints) for more information and to file a complaint.

    2. ### Children's Privacy

The Platforms are not intended for children, and AG does not knowingly collect information from persons younger than the age of thirteen (13). If we learn that we have inadvertently collected information from a person younger than the age of 13, we will take commercially reasonable efforts to delete that information from our databases.

Back to top
    3. ### Data Security

We take commercially reasonable steps to help protect and secure the Personal Information submitted to us against unauthorized or illegal access, modification, or destruction. For example, if you enter sensitive information such as a credit card number and CVC2 number on our checkout forms, we or our service partners use transport layer security (TSL) technology to help protect the sensitive information during transmission. However, please note that transmission over the Internet or wireless networks and the electronic storage of information cannot be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information we collect. You use our Platforms and provide us with your information at your own risk.

Back to top
    4. ### Changes to the Privacy Notice

We may change this Privacy Notice at any time without notice to you. We may also provide notice to you in other ways in our discretion, such as through contact information you have provided. Any changes will be effective immediately upon the posting of the revised Privacy Notice. However, unless you consent, we will not use your Personal Information in a manner materially different than what was stated in our posted Privacy Notice at the time your Personal Information was collected.

As always, if you have any questions, please feel free to contact us through our Customer Support Department or via our Legal Department at [legal@americangreetings.com](mailto:legal@americangreetings.com).

    5. ### Consent to Transfer

Please be aware that information we collect through the Platforms may be transferred to and processed in the United States, where the privacy laws may not be as comprehensive as those in the country where you reside and/or are a citizen. By using the Platforms or providing us with any information, you acknowledge and consent to the transfer, processing and storage of your information in the United States, or such other countries as AG may choose in its sole discretion.

    6. ### California Residents – Your California Privacy Rights

California Civil Code section 1798.83 permits California residents to request from AG certain information regarding the disclosure of certain categories of Personal to third parties for their direct marketing purposes within the immediately preceding calendar year. A company may also comply with the law by disclosing in its privacy Notice that it provides consumers choice (opt-out or opt-in) regarding sharing Personal Information with third parties for those third parties' direct marketing purposes (as AG does), and information on how to exercise that choice.

If you are a California resident and you have questions about our practices with respect to sharing information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes and your ability to exercise choice, please send your request to the following email address: [help@amgreetings.com](mailto:help@amgreetings.com) or write to us at the following mailing address: AmericanGreetings.com, One American Road, Cleveland, OH 44144. You must put the statement "Your California Privacy Rights" in the subject field of your e-mail or include it in your writing if you choose to write to us at the designated mailing address. You must include your name, street address, city, state, and zip code. We are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent properly, or do not have complete information.

If you are a California resident under the age of 18, and a registered user of any Platform, California Business and Professions Code Section 22581 permits you to request and obtain removal of content that you have publicly posted. To make such a request, please send an e-mail with a detailed description of the specific content to [help@amgreetings.com](mailto:help@amgreetings.com). Please be aware that such a request does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of the content or information that you have posted and there may be circumstances in which the law does not require or allow removal even if requested.
