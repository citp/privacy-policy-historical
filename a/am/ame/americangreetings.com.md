# AmericanGreetings.com Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy applies to the www.americangreetings.com and www.msn.americangreetings.com websites (each, a “Site,” and collectively, the “Sites”) and the mobile applications (“Apps”) that are owned or controlled by AG Interactive, Inc. (“AG,” “we,” and “us”) and that post a link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, the “Platforms”). This Privacy Policy does not apply to other AG web sites, mobile applications or interactive features, or offline information collection, unless expressly stated at the time of collection. This Policy also does not apply to the web sites of other companies or organizations, even if we link to those websites. This Privacy Policy describes what types of information we gather about you, how we use it, under what circumstances we disclose it to third parties, and your rights to change or delete it. Please note that certain features or services referenced in this Privacy Policy may not be offered on all of the Platforms, and certain features or services may not be offered on the Platforms at all times. 

AG complies with the US-EU Safe Harbor Framework and US-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union (EU) member countries and Switzerland. AG has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement.

* ##  INFORMATION COLLECTION 

  1. ###  Information You Provide 

We may request that you provide “Personal Information” (which is information that can be used to identify or contact a specific individual, such as your name, email address, and phone number), demographic information (such as your age, gender, birth date, and ZIP code), and payment information. The information we request is subject to change from time to time depending on, among other things, the nature of your use of the Platforms and our relationship with you. If you elect to purchase a Membership or redeem a promotional membership, you may be required to provide some Personal Information. Additionally, you may also provide us with information regarding your preferences and interests; however, preference information is not required and is completely optional on your part. Any information combined with Personal Information will be treated as Personal Information.

  2. ###  Information the Platforms Automatically Collect 

We and our third-party service providers may automatically collect certain information about your use of the Platforms (“Usage Information”). Usage Information may include the browser and operating system you are using, the URL, advertisements, or search terms that referred or otherwise led you to the Platforms (if applicable), aspects of the Platforms that you use or visit, the products or services you access or view, the types of e-cards you send, and the time of day you accessed the Platforms, among other information. Usage Information also includes the IP address or other unique identifier (“Device Identifier”) for any computer, mobile phone or other device (any, a “Device”) used to access the Platforms. A Device Identifier is automatically assigned to your Device, and our servers identify your Device by its Device Identifier. Some mobile service providers may also provide us or our third party service providers with information regarding the physical location of a Device used to access the Platforms. Please note that your IP address is included in the header information of every e-card notification email that we send for your e-cards. 

The methods used to collect Usage Information may include: 

    1. ####  Cookies 

We use a technology called "cookies" on the Platforms. Cookies are pieces of information or data sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your Device for a variety of purposes that enable us to optimize the Platforms and your user experience. For example, cookies allow us to recognize you when you re-enter the Platforms so that you will not have to sign-in each time you visit. In addition, we use cookies in connection with website analysis and advertising. Cookies also allow us to count the number of unique and return visitors who use the Platforms. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance their experience on the Platforms. 

A Flash cookie is a data file placed on a Device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your Device. Flash cookies may be used for various purposes, including, without limitation, enabling a Flash feature and remembering your preferences. For more information about Flash and the privacy choices Adobe offers, visit http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html. 

Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. If you prefer, you can reset your browser settings to notify you when you've received a cookie or, alternatively, to refuse to accept cookies. It is important to note that you may not be able to use certain features on the Platforms if you choose not to accept or delete cookies.

    2. ####  Web Beacons and Pixels 

We also use web beacons or 1x1 pixels to collect information on the Platforms and through emails we send. These pixels may be invisible to you and may be connected to your Personal Information, if you have provided it, to allow us to better serve you by tracking your interests on the Platforms. We do not sell, rent, trade, or otherwise distribute information about you gathered through the web beacons or pixels with any third parties, except for third parties who provide us with advertising, marketing, research or analysis services. 

Back to top
    3. ####  Embedded Scripts 

An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Platforms, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Platforms, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter. 

Usage Information is very much like television ratings that tell the networks how many people tuned in to a program. We and our third-party service providers use this type of data to help us determine the extent to which our customers use certain parts of our Platforms, which, in turn, enables us to make our Platforms as appealing as possible. Usage Information is generally non-identifying, but if we associate it with you as a specific and identifiable person, we treat it as Personal Information. 

Back to top
    4. ###  Information You Provide About Third Parties 

The Platforms may permit you to provide Personal Information about third parties, such as mailing addresses, email addresses, birth dates, anniversaries and other significant dates. If you use our Platforms to send an ecard, paper card, or any other content, we collect certain Personal Information about the recipient (such as name, mailing address, and email address, as applicable). We may share the information regarding your transaction with third parties as necessary to process your transaction (i.e., to send the card). 

The Platforms may also allow you to import information about third parties through several methods, including directly from your computer or mobile device or from a third-party service (e.g., through Social Media Interactions or by asking you for your login information to your email or other account). If you choose to provide Personal Information about third parties or to import your contacts, we will store that information only in connection with your relationship with us (e.g., to send greeting cards). Unless you consent, we will not store the password you provide if you import your contacts from a third party source.

* ##  OUR USES OF INFORMATION 

We may use information about you, including Personal Information and Usage Information, to: (1) allow you to use the Platforms or to provide related customer service; (2) provide or offer you information, products, or services, any of which may be tailored to you; (3) send or display special offers or advertisements from AG Companies (as hereinafter defined) and our business partners; (4) process your registration, including verifying that information you provide is active and valid; (5) process a transaction you initiate; (6) improve the Platforms and our products, and for internal business purposes, including the measurement of the Platforms’ effectiveness; (7) contact you with regard to your use of the Platforms and, in our discretion, changes to our policies; and (8) as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, for purposes disclosed at the time you provide your information, or with your consent.

  1. ###  General Statement Regarding Information Sharing 

We do not share your Personal Information with third parties for their marketing purposes without your consent. We may share non-Personal Information, such as aggregate user statistics, demographic information and Usage Information with third parties, including retail partners, advertisers, content providers, and analytics providers.

  2. ###  When You Agree to Receive Information from Third Parties, Request That We Share Your Information, or Make A Purchase from a Third Party 

We may offer the opportunity to receive information and/or marketing offers from, or to otherwise have your information shared with, one or more third parties. We may also offer you the opportunity to order products and services from a third party directly through the Platforms or in communications you may receive from AG; and in this case, we will disclose that a third party will be fulfilling your order. If you agree at that time to have your Personal Information shared or if you make a purchase from a third party through the Platforms, your Personal Information will be disclosed to that third party (or parties) and will be subject to the privacy policy and practices of that third party. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and practices of third parties, and, if you later decide that you no longer want to receive communications from a third party or wish to communicate regarding your order from the third party, you will need to contact that third party directly.

  3. ###  Third Party Service Providers 

We may share Personal Information with our service providers who perform services on our behalf. Such services include, for example, order fulfillment, hosting or maintaining the Platforms, providing customer support, sending email or other communications, providing marketing assistance, and providing analytics services.

  4. ###  Co-Branding Partners 

If you become a Member of AG from one of our co-branded sites (such as www.msn.americangreetings.com), we may share your information, including Personal Information, with the co-branded partner.

  5. ###  Third Party Analytics and Advertising Service Providers 

We work with network advertisers, advertising agencies, third party traffic measurement services, analytics companies and other similar service providers for a variety of purposes. These purposes include providing us with information regarding traffic and use of the Platforms and our advertisements on the Platforms and across the Internet, and to engage in multi-site advertising. For example, if you click on an advertisement on another website for the Platforms, our service providers may be able to tell us which advertisement you clicked on and where you were viewing the advertisement. In connection with providing analytics and advertisement services, these service providers may collect certain information about your use of the Platforms and other websites or apps. 

These third party service providers may set and access their own tracking technologies on your Device (including cookies, web beacons, embedded scripts) and may otherwise collect or have access to information about you, including the collection of information about you from the Platforms and other websites or apps. These service providers may use that information for their own purposes, including to target advertisements to you, prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times and to conduct research regarding the usefulness of certain advertisements to you. We may share Usage Information about visitors with third party advertising companies, analytics providers and other vendors for similar purposes. 

While we may use a variety of service providers to perform advertising and analytics services, you may wish to visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp, which provides information regarding this practice by Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) members, including the “opt-out” tool that can allow you to opt-out of certain uses of your information by NAI members.

  6. ###  Contests, Sweepstakes and Promotions 

Occasionally, we may sponsor contests, sweepstakes or other promotions (any, a “Promotion, and collectively, “Promotions”) on or through the Platforms or otherwise. Participation in such Promotions is purely voluntary. In order to participate in a Promotion, you may be asked to provide Personal Information. By participating in a Promotion, you agree to the Promotion’s terms and conditions, which will be clearly stated. Where we do not sponsor a Promotion, the identity of the sponsor will be clearly disclosed in the Promotion’s terms. We cannot be responsible for actions or policies of third-party Promotion sponsors. Those considering participating in a Promotion are encouraged to review the privacy policy of the Promotion sponsor before entering.

  8. ###  Administrative and Legal Reasons 

We may disclose your information, including Personal Information and Usage Information, to appropriate third parties if we are required to do so by law or if we believe that such action is necessary:

Please note that your IP address can be accessed by e-card recipients in the header of the notification e-mail we send for each e-card. Under certain circumstances, recipients, their legal representatives, or law enforcement authorities may be able to combine this with information disclosed by ISPs to determine the source of a particular communication. By using this service, you knowingly and voluntarily assume any risks associated with such disclosure.

* ##  THIRD PARTY CONTENT AND LINKS TO THIRD PARTIES 

Certain content found on the Platforms may be hosted and served by third parties. Additionally, the Platforms may contain links to third party websites or apps that we do not control (including links, sites, and apps operated by advertisers, third party service providers, reward programs, sponsors and partners associated with the Platforms). These links and applications may use an AG logo as part of a co-branding agreement, including third parties who may be selling or providing AG products and services. In addition, AG content may be included on web pages and websites that are not associated with AG and over which we have no control. 

These third parties may independently collect and use Usage Information and Personal Information and may have the ability to track your use of their web sites and apps. AG is not responsible for the privacy practices employed by any third party, and you should carefully review their privacy policies before providing information to any third party.

We take commercially reasonable steps to help protect and secure your Personal Information. For example, when you enter sensitive information such as a credit card number and CVC2 number on our checkout forms, that information is encrypted during transmission using secure socket layer (SSL) technology, to help protect the communications between you and our payment partners. However, no data transmission over the Internet, wireless transmission or electronic storage of information can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Please note that we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information we collect. You use our Platforms and provide us with your information at your own risk.

  6. ###  California Residents — Your California Privacy Rights 

Pursuant to California Civil Code Section 1798.83, residents of the State of California have the right to request from companies conducting business in California certain information relating to third parties to which the company has disclosed certain categories of Personal Information during the preceding year for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, the law provides that a company may comply, as we do, by disclosing in its privacy policy that it provides consumers choice (opt-out or opt-in) regarding sharing Personal Information with third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes, and information on how to exercise that choice. As stated above in this Privacy Policy, we provide you choice prior to sharing your Personal Information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. If you do not opt-in or if you do not choose to opt-out at the time we offer that choice, we do not share your Personal Information with that identified third party for its direct marketing purposes. 

If you are a California resident and you have questions about our practices with respect to sharing information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes and your ability to exercise choice, please send your request to the following email address: help@americangreetings.com or write to us at the following mailing address: AG Customer Support, AG Interactive, Inc., One American Road, Cleveland, Ohio 44144.
