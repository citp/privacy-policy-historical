**Our Privacy Policy**  
_**Overview**_   
AmericanGreetings.com is strongly committed to protecting the privacy of consumers of its interactive products and services. Throughout cyberspace, we want to contribute to providing a safe and secure environment for consumers. 

  The purpose of this AmericanGreetings.com privacy policy is to inform you, as a welcome visitor what kinds of information we may gather about you when you visit AmericanGreetings.com. We also want to tell you how we may use that information, whether we disclose it to anyone, and the choices you have regarding our use of, and your ability to correct, the information. Finally, please note that this policy applies only to AmericanGreetings.com and not to other companies' or organizations' Web sites to which we link. 

  **Information About All AmericanGreetings.com Visitors**   
In general, our service automatically gathers certain usage information like the numbers and frequency of visitors to AmericanGreetings.com and its areas, very much like television ratings that tell the networks how many people tuned in to a program. We only use such data in aggregate. This collective data helps us determine how much our customers use parts of the site, so we can improve our site to assure that it is as appealing as we can make it for as many of you as possible. 

  For example, AmericanGreetings.com uses a technology nicknamed "cookies." We may track your visit to our site by giving you a cookie when you enter. Cookies are pieces of information sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Americangreetings.com uses cookies to make visiting our site easier. Cookies allow us to save passwords for you so that you will not have to re-enter them the next time you visit. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. If you prefer, you can reset your browser either to notify you when you've received a cookie, or to refuse to accept cookies. It is important to note that if you choose not to accept cookies, or you set your browser not to accept cookies, you may not be able to use certain features on our site. AmericanGreetings.com cookies do not collect personally identifiable information and we do not combine information collected through cookies with other personally identifiable information to tell us who you are or what your email address or screen name is.  

Similarly, AmericanGreetings.com collects and tracks traffic by IP Address. An IP address is a number assigned to your computer when you are using your browser on the Internet. We log this information, but this information is never linked to any personally identifying information. It is used to audit the number of visitors coming to our web site.  

We also may provide statistical "ratings" information, never information about you personally, to our AmericanGreetings.com partners about how our members, collectively, use AmericanGreetings.com. We do this so they too can understand how often people use their areas of our site in order for them to provide you with the best possible Web experience as well.  

  _**Information About You**_   
Sometimes, we may specifically ask for information about you when you sign up to use a service when you order a product. We will need certain information \-- such as name, email address, billing address, credit card number -- in order to provide that service or product to you. We may also use that information to let you know of additional products and services about which you might be interested. 

  **Choice/Opt-out**  
You can choose not to receive such information if you don't want by letting us know on the registration page when you sign up for the product or service. You will also be given the option to opt-out every time you receive promotional communications from AMERICANGREETING.COM. From time to time we may ask you for information about your interests so that both you and we can take advantage of the interactivity of the online medium, but you may always choose to respond or not. 

  **Correct/Update**  
If you would like to change the status of your decision to receive communications from us, you can do so in the "My Account" section of the web site. Once you log in, select "edit member profile" and you will be able to edit all personal information previously collected on the registration page as well as changing your status of receiving AmericanGreetings.com communications. You can also make changes to this information by calling or emailing our customer service department.

  **Disclosure to Third Parties and Partners**  
AmericanGreetings.com has several special relationships with other web sites (partners). In some instances, the site is "co-branded" with our partners' logo or the partners' name may appear in the URL. In all instances, we do not disclose information about your individual visits to AmericanGreetings.com or information that you may give us, such as your name, address, email address or telephone number, to any of these partners or other outside companies. But as we mention above, we may share with our partners aggregated statistical "ratings" information about the use of AmericanGreetings.com. 

  _**AmericanGreetings.com Privacy Policy Changes**_   
If we decide to change our privacy policy for AmericanGreetings.com, we will post those changes here so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information and whether we will disclose it to anyone. 

**Secure Transactions**  
When you place orders or access your account information, we use the latest technology to protect the security of your information. Our secure servers use Secure Sockets Layers (SSL), an advanced encryption technology to protect the storage and transfer of your data from unauthorized parties. 

  If you have questions regarding our privacy policy, please contact us at [chris@americangreetings.com](mailto:chris@americangreetings.com) or you can contact us by mail at: AmericanGreetings.com
