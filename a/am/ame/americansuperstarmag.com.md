Let the cat fighting begin! But next time the two blonde reality stars need to rip each other's extensions off and hit each other with their Marc Jacobs shoe before re-applying make-up and heading straight to the police station. Paris Hilton and Shanna Moakler, ex-wife of Blink 182 drummer Travis Barker, were recently involved in a fight during the early hours of Wednesday morning. 

Paris - who was recently spotted kissing Travis - filed a police report in the early hours alleging that Moakler punched her in the jaw at Los Angeles' Hyde nightclub. 

Meanwhile, Shanna gave a police statement claiming that Paris' ex-boyfriend, Stavros Niarchos, pushed her down some stairs. 

The "Simple Life" star's publicist, Elliot Mintz, claims that at approximately 1:10 am his client was approached by Shanna who screamed obscenities at her and then punched her in the face. 

Mintz added that Shanna had to be restrained by several people to allow Paris - who he insists never retaliated against her assailant - to leave the nightclub.
