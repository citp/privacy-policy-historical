                    <p>Updated with posted changes: June 26, 2018</p>
                    <h3>Privacy</h3>
                    <p>NRA realizes how important privacy is to our membership. Therefore, we have adopted the following policy to advise you of your choices regarding the use of your personal information online. This policy describes what types of information we gather about you, how we use it, under what circumstances we disclose it to third parties, and how you can update it.</p>

                    <h3>Information Collection</h3>
                    <p>We gather certain broad information about website use including the number of unique visitors, the frequency with which they visit, and the programs and services preferred. We look at the data in summary form, rather than on an individual basis. We gather this information so we can learn how many people visit NRA sites, which pages are the most and least viewed, and which websites are referring visitors to our sites. We use this information to help us in restructuring sites to meet our members' needs. NRA sites do not respond to "Do Not Track" signals.</p>

                    <p>Most NRA sites and services are intended for general audiences and do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under 13 years of age. We are committed to complying fully with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998. Of course, the NRA also encourages parents to discuss privacy issues with their children.</p>

                    <p>We compile lists for communications and marketing purposes. We will provide that information to NRA affinity partners who we believe provide goods and/or services that might be useful to NRA members. Contracts with these companies require them to keep the member information strictly confidential and prohibit them from using it for any other purpose. You may ask us to remove you from the lists by: (1) emailing from our Contact Us page; (2) calling us at 1-800-672-3888; or (3) writing to us at National Rifle Association of America, 11250 Waples Mill Road; Fairfax, VA 22030. We do not provide member information to telemarketers, mailing list brokers, or other companies that are not offering NRA-endorsed services or benefits. Third parties do not collect personally identifiable information about the online activities of individuals who visit NRA sites.</p>

                    <h3>Cookies</h3>
                    <p>The NRA online network utilizes a standard technology called a "cookie" to collect information about how our sites are used. Cookies are small strings of text stored on your computer's hard drive by a Web server. For example, session cookies identify your computer during a particular session to track the items you have placed in your "shopping cart" during a visit to our online stores. </p>
					<p>The NRA uses cookies in conjunction with third parties (such as Facebook and Google) to provide measurement on marketing campaigns and send targeted advertisements to internet users. The NRA does not use any personally identifiable information when targeting users for advertisements. Using cookies allows personally identifiable information to remain undisclosed. </p>
					<p>If you would like to opt-out of cookie collection, you can disable and or block third-party cookies in the settings section of your internet browser. If you would like to choose which third parties can use cookies on your internet browser and or see a list of the third parties which are using cookies on your internet browser, you can visit: www.aboutads.info/choices.  Please note that if you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to access certain interactive features and services offered on NRA sites.</p>

                    <h3>IP Addresses</h3>
                    <p>We collect and analyze traffic on our websites by keeping track of the Internet Protocol (IP) addresses of our visitors. </p>

                    <h3>Personal Information</h3>
                    <p>You may be asked to provide different types of personal information, including your name, date of birth, email address, mailing address or telephone number. Particular services may request storage of additional information such as your billing address, credit card number and expiration date. For example, we may ask for information to process your membership application, facilitate an online store purchase, or register for one of our events. There are also optional opportunities for you to share your preferences and interests. </p>

                    <h3>Control of Personal Information</h3>
                    <p><strong>Opt Out </strong></p>
                    <p>We also use your information to send you notices in the mail or by email about special member benefits, discounts and offers. If you do not wish to receive mailings, you can: (1) opt out of email lists immediately by following the instructions at the bottom of each email; (2) email us using our Contact Us page, (3) call us at 1-800-672-3888; or (4) write to us at National Rifle Association of America, 11250 Waples Mill Road; Fairfax, VA 22030.</p>

                    <p><strong>Editing Your Personal Information</strong></p>
                    <p>Ways you can edit or update your personal information: (1) visiting <a href="http://www.nramemberservices.org">NRA Member Services</a>; (2) calling us at 1-800-672-3888; or (3) writing to us at National Rifle Association of America, 11250 Waples Mill Road; Fairfax, VA 22030.</p>
