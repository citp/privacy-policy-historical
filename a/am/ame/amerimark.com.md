Welcome to our website, operated by AmeriMark Direct LLC ("AmeriMark," "we," or "our") and located at [www.amerimark.com](https://web.archive.org/). 

We value our customers and are committed to protecting their privacy and informing them as to how their personal information will be used. We collect customer information in an effort to improve your shopping experience and to communicate with you about our products, services, contests and promotions. We recognize that we must maintain and use customer information responsibly. We have created this Privacy Policy to address our practices regarding information collected from visitors to the Site. 

This Privacy Policy only addresses information collected directly through or from the Site - it does not address or govern any information-gathering, use, or dissemination practices related to information collected from you (sometimes referred to as a "visitor," "user," "you," or "your") other than directly through or from the Site, such as from telephone, facsimile, postal mail, personal delivery, or other or additional offline means or media. 

This Privacy Policy is incorporated into our [ Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms-of-use.html), which must be reviewed and accepted by you as a condition of use of the Site. The Site is not intended for children under the age of 18. It does not knowingly collect personal information online from visitors in this age group, and will delete information from a person in that age group as quickly as possible upon receipt of notice that such information has been collected.

**Collection of Information**

We only collect personal information that is relevant to the purpose of the Site. This information allows us to provide you with a customized and efficient experience. We receive and store any information you submit to us through our Site or provide to us in any other way. You can choose not to provide us with certain information (as addressed below), but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features. For example, if you make a purchase using a credit card, we will need to collect information such as your credit card number and billing address to complete that transaction. 

We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. Our authorized agents automatically receive and record certain "traffic data" on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, cookie information, and the page you requested. We use this information to help diagnose problems with our servers, analyze trends and administer the Site. We may also collect and display the total counts that page has been viewed. Many companies offer programs that help you to visit websites anonymously. While we will not be able to provide you with a personalized experience if we cannot recognize you, we want you to be aware that these programs are available. 

Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages of the Site are visited and by how many people. Our cookies do not collect personally identifiable information. The "help" portion of the toolbar on the majority of browsers will direct you on how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to command the browser to tell you when you receive a new cookie, or how to fully disable cookies. We do not override these settings or options, including any "Do Not Track" settings. However, if you utilize the aforementioned privacy features, you may be unable to obtain certain content, features, services, products, or benefits on the Site. 

**Use of Information Collected**

Personal information collected by us may be used for limited purposes, including recordkeeping, editorial and feedback purposes, content improvement, or to customize the content and layout of the Site.

Except as specifically set forth herein, any personally-identifying information that you provide to us through the Site will not be disclosed to other third party entities not affiliated with us. Our personnel and authorized consultants and/or contractors may have access to user information if necessary in the normal course of our business. In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Moreover, if our , or substantially all of our its assets, were acquired, user information would be one of the assets transferred. Your personal information and data, whether personally identifying or not, may also be provided to third parties that contract with us to provide products, information or other services that we believe that visitors to the Site may be interested in obtaining. We may also release personal information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with a law; to enforce or apply our [ Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms-of-use.html) and other policies; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of us , our employees, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

If you do not wish to provide such information or if you opt to utilize the aforementioned privacy features, you may be unable to obtain certain content, features, services, products, or benefits on the Site. This provision does not apply to collection of the type of web browser used to visit the Site or to information provided or collected that does not meet the description hereunder. 

**Third Party Websites**

The Site may also contain links to third party websites. The Site may contain links to other websites for the convenience of users in locating information, products, or services that may be of interest. If you access a third party website from a link on this Site, any information you disclose on that website is not subject to this Privacy Policy.

It is solely your obligation to review and understand the privacy practices and policies of these other websites, advertisers and any third parties. 

**Third Party Ads**

We use third party service providers to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet and sometimes on this site. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this Site and other websites in order to provide advertisements on our Site, other websites and other forms of media about goods and services of interest to you. This anonymous information is collected through the use of pixel tags or similar technologies which are industry standard technologies used by most major web sites.

In addition, we may from time to time contract with third party vendors to serve ads to our customers on our behalf across the Internet or to send our catalogs to customers whom we think may be interested in our products or services. To do this, the vendors will collect anonymous information about your visits to our Web site and your interaction with our products and services. This anonymous information is collected through the use of a cookie or pixel tag - industry standard technology used by most major Web sites. No personally identifiable information is collected in this process. They may also pool the anonymous information that they collect with other sources of information not collected during your visit to our website, which may include your name and mailing address, for purposes of determining whether you might be interested in receiving a catalog.

If you do not wish for cookies or pixel tags to be placed on your computer, most commercially available web browsers permit you to prevent that from taking place.

Accordingly, we urge you to review this Privacy Policy at the start of each use of this Site. We will also list the date of the last revision at the bottom of the Privacy Policy. 

**Confidentiality and Security**

We use modern technology to protect the information you submit. All personally identifiable user information is stored on secured servers and behind a firewall. However, no security system is completely impenetrable, so we cannot guarantee the absolute security of our database, nor can we guarantee that information you supply won't be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet. We are not responsible for the security of information transmitted via the Internet.
