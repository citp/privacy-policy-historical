**What is a cookie?**  
A cookie is a small text file downloaded onto your computer or device when you access a website. These cookies allow a website to recognise a user’s device.

Their purpose is to help organise and store browsing information. Some cookies, such as automatic log-ins, are very useful.

 **Types of cookies**  
There are different types of cookies that allow different things to happen when you visit a website:

  * Session cookies  
These allow websites to link the actions of a user during a browser session only, for example on amecfw.com a session cookie is used to remember the details a user provides when downloading images from our image library. This means that if the user downloads more than one image they only need to enter their details once during that session.  
These session cookies expire after a browser session ie as soon as you close the browser window
  * Persistent cookies  
These are cookies which are stored on a user's device in between browser sessions which allow the preferences or actions of the user to be remembered. amecfw.com does not use these type of cookies
  * First party cookies  
This is the general name for cookies which are set by the website visited by a user
  * Third party cookies  
These are cookies set by a website other than the website which the user is visiting. This includes suppliers who set cookies on a website on a company’s behalf in order to provide a service to them. For example, on amecfw.com we use a third party to host our investor related webcasts whose website collects information provided by viewers who register to view these as they are being recorded
  * Analytical cookies  
These are cookies used to collect information about how people access and use a website and are the type mostly used on our site 



 **Why use cookies?**  
Cookies are used to improve services for you through, for example:

  * Enabling a service to recognise your device so you don't have to give the same information several times during one task
  * Recognising that you may already have given a username and password so you don't need to do it for every web page requested
  * Measuring how many people are using services, so they can be made easier to use and there's enough capacity to ensure they are fast
  * Analysing anonymised data to help us understand how people interact with our services so we can make them better 



 **amecfw.com and cookies**  
We have included a full list of cookies used on www.amecfw.com with details of what each is used for.

 **Analytical cookies**  
We use Google Analytics to collect information about how people use this site. We do this to make sure the site is meeting its users’ needs and to understand how we could make it better.

Google Analytics stores information about the pages you visit, how long you are on the site, how you got here and what you click on. We do not collect or store any personal information so this data cannot be used to identify who you are. We do not allow Google to use or share our analytics data.

 **Other first party cookies**  
There is an image download facility available in the Media section of amecfw.com which requires users to provide their name, email address and organisation name before they can download an image. This is so that Amec Foster Wheeler is assured that the image is being used for genuine purposes.

The cookie used here ensures that a visitor only needs to enter their personal information once during a session as their details are remembered and auto-complete when downloading more than one image.

We will not use your information for purposes that are not clear when you provide your details, and will not disclose it outside Amec Foster Wheeler, except in very limited circumstances and only with your agreement or where we are legally obliged to do so.
