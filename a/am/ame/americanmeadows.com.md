Privacy and Security Statements   


We at American Meadows have been selling only the finest, freshest seed for over 20 years. Our retail location, The Vermont Wildflower Farm, was founded in 1981, so we are veteran retailers, and have a healthy respect for customer service, privacy and security, whether a sale is made in person or on the internet. (If you'd prefer to order by phone, fax, or mail, go to [How to Order](https://web.archive.org/web/20051211061040id_/http%3A//www.americanmeadows.com/howto.cfm).) 

**Security for your order OnLine.** We understand that many customers have concerns about using their credit cards online, and we have invested in the finest security programming for our website to assure you.   


  When you order from this website, your credit card transaction is handled by a completely secure shopping cart program created by a company called CyberCash, a division of Verisign, Inc. This is the same security software used by some of the internet's largest and most successful sites. CyberCash handles approximately 10 million internet transactions per month for over 26,000 merchants. Internet leaders who use CyberCash include Sprint, H&R Block, Motorola, and Dell Computers.   


Once your order is filled, your credit card number is deleted from our records, and not stored.   


**Privacy.** We are anxious to make your visit to AmericanMeadows.com a pleasant experience, and we respect your privacy. When you visit, we record the following information to help us serve our visitors better: We record the web address of the site you came from before visiting us (usually a search engine), and any terms you may have used to search for our site, such as "wildflower seeds."

If you choose to communicate with us via email, we record your email address, and if requested, will send you our newsletter, "Wildflower World." In addition, we may send you email about special offers and announcements from time to time.   


We do not sell or rent your name and address information to any other company.
