        <h1>Americanidol.com  Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><em>Effective as of May 4, 2006 </em></p>
      </div>
      <p>Fox  Interactive Media, Inc.  ("FIM")  is part of the News America Group, which has adopted a set of Privacy  Principles  available at <a href="http://www.newscorp.com/privacy.html" target="_blank">http://www.newscorp.com/privacy.html</a> applicable  to all its U.S.-based companies. FIM operates the Internet Web site located at www.AmericanIdol.com.    FIM has implemented those Principles in  this Privacy Policy, which describes how   we collect, use and share personally identifiable information  ("PII") we obtain from and about individuals located in the U.S. FIM operates  general audience Web sites, and does not knowingly collect PII from children  under 13 years of age. From time to time FIM may revise  this Privacy Policy to reflect industry initiatives or changes in the law, our  PII collection and use practices, the features of our Web sites or technology.  If we make revisions that change the way we collect or use your PII, those  changes will be posted in this Privacy Policy and the effective date will be  noted at the beginning of this Policy. Therefore, you  should review it periodically so that you are up to date on our most current  policies and practices.   If FIM materially changes its practices  regarding collection or use of your PII, your PII will continue to be governed  by the Policy under which it was collected unless you have been provided notice  of and have not objected to the change.</p>
      <h3>COLLECTION:  COLLECTION OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION ("PII") BY FIM.</h3>
      <p><strong>General</strong>. FIM  collects personally identifiable information ("PII" — that is,  information such as your full name, email address, mailing address or telephone  number) in order to create or enhance our relationship  with you. When we collect PII from you it is because you are voluntarily  submitting the information to us in order to participate in activities like  sweepstakes, contests, games, surveys, forums, subscription registrations, in  connection with content or suggestions you submit to us, chats or bulletin  boards, or because you want us to furnish you with products, services or  information. We may also obtain PII  from reputable third parties. </p>
      <p><strong>Cookies</strong>.  Cookies are small bits of information that the FIM Web sites place on the hard drive of your computer. Cookies remember information  about your activities on our site(s) and enable FIM to make your visits to our  site(s) more enjoyable. For example, cookies can store your password for easy  logon to a site you have previously visited, can save your preferences for a personalized home page or can track the items you have placed in your  "shopping cart" during a visit to our online store.  Information about your activities on FIM sites  and other non-personally identifiable information about you may also be used to  limit the online ads you encounter to those we believe are consistent with your  interests.</p>
      <p>Third  party advertisements displayed on FIM sites may also contain cookies set  by Internet advertising companies or advertisers.  FIM does not  control these cookies and visitors to our Web site(s)  should check the privacy policy of the Internet advertising  company or <br>
        advertiser  to see whether and how it uses cookies. See the "Notice" section  below for more information on third party advertisements. <br>
        FIM may  use cookies and similar tools to relate your use of our  Web site(s) to PII obtained from you or a reputable third party. For example,  if you've asked us to provide you information about our upcoming products or  promotions, cookie and/or click stream data about your activities on FIM Web sites may allow us to limit the materials we provide you to items  we think you will find interesting, based on your prior online activities and  preferences. However, if FIM wishes to combine your personal and cookie or  click stream information in this manner, we will obtain  your express affirmative consent. </p>
      <p>You can  program your computer to warn you each time a cookie is being sent or to refuse  cookies completely. However, without cookies you may not have access to certain  features on News America Group’s Web site(s), such as the Fox Movie Channel  Backlot. </p>
      <h3>NOTICE: FIM  WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH NOTICE ABOUT ITS PII COLLECTION PRACTICES</h3>
      <p>When you  voluntarily provide PII to FIM, we  will make sure you are informed about who is collecting the information, how  and why the information is being collected and the types of uses FIM will make  of the information.  At the time you  provide your PII, FIM will notify you of your options regarding our use of your  PII, including whether we will share it with outside companies (See “Choice”  below). This Policy describes the types of other  companies that may want to send you information about their products and  services and therefore may want to share your personal information, provided you have given FIM permission to do so (See "Use" below). </p>
      <p>Sometimes  we collect PII from consumers in manual format or off-line, such as a post card or subscription form. Providing  detailed notice in those situations often proves impractical, so consumers will  instead be provided with a short notice that describes how to obtain the full  text of this Policy and other relevant information from us. </p>
      <p>FIM’s  Web site(s) may be linked to Internet sites operated by other companies. Some  of these third party sites may be co-branded with a FIM logo, even though they  are not operated or maintained by FIM (for example, the co-sponsored chat  pages, or advertising sponsor pages). FIM's Web site(s) also carry  advertisements from other companies. FIM is not  responsible for the privacy practices of Web sites operated by third parties  that are linked to our sites or for  the privacy practices of third party or national Internet  advertising companies. Once you've left a FIM site via such a link or by  clicking on an advertisement, you should check the applicable privacy policy of  the third party or advertiser site to determine how they will handle any PII  they collect from you. </p>
      <p>FIM’s  Web site(s) may also be linked to sites operated by companies affiliated with FIM   (i.e., that are part of the News America  Group). Although all News America Group entities adhere to the group’s Privacy  Principles located at <a href="http://www.newscorp.com/privacy.html" target="_blank">http://www.newscorp.com/privacy.html</a>, visitors to those affiliated sites should still refer to  their separate privacy policies and practices, which may differ in some  respects from this Policy. </p>
      <p>Some of  the advertisements that appear on FIM's Web site(s) are delivered to you by  national Internet advertising companies such as Doubleclick and 24/7Real Media.  These companies utilize certain technologies to deliver  advertisements and marketing messages and to collect anonymous information  about your visit to our sites, including information about the banner ads they  display, any cookie they place on your computer and your IP address. To opt out  of information collection by these companies, or to obtain information about  the technologies they use or their own privacy policies, please visit:<br>
        <a href="http://www.247realmedia.com/privacy.html" target="_blank" class="aLinkOrange">http://www.247realmedia.com/privacy.html </a> <br>
        <a href="http://www.doubleclick.net/privacy_policy" target="_blank" class="aLinkOrange">http://www.doubleclick.net/privacy_policy </a> <br>
        <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp" target="_blank" class="aLinkOrange">http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp </a> </p>
      <h3>CHOICE: FIM  WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH CHOICES ABOUT THE USE OF YOUR PII</h3>
      <p>        FIM will not use the PII  you  provide to us for purposes different from  the purpose for which it was submitted, or share your PII with third parties that are not affiliated with FIM (i.e., not part of the News America Group), unless we obtain your permission. </p>
      <h3>USE: FIM'S USE OF PII</h3>
      <p>
        FIM will use your PII provided under this Policy in a  manner that is consistent with this Policy. If FIM obtains PII from a third party, such as a business partner, our  use of that information is governed by this Policy. FIM may share your PII with companies that are affiliated with  us, that is, are part of the News America Group of companies. Provided you have given us permission, FIM may also share your PII  with advertisers and business partners that are not affiliated with FIM,  but would like to send you information about their products and services. For  example, some of the companies who supply prizes for FIM's contests may have  special offers or promotions that might be of interest to FIM viewers. However,  you will always have the opportunity to instruct us not to share your  information with third parties when PII is collected.  Moreover,  we will never share your credit card information with third parties except  those FIM uses to perform tasks (such as order fulfillment and payment  processing) required to complete purchases you make through FIM Web sites.</p>
      <p>FIM employees, agents and  contractors must have a legitimate business reason to obtain access to your  PII. FIM may share your PII with  outside  contractors or  agents who help us manage our information activities (i.e., sweepstakes  administration, order fulfillment, statistical analyses), but they may only use your PII to provide FIM with a  specific service and not for any other purpose. </p>
      <p>FIM may also enter into agreements with outside  companies that possess the technology that allows FIM to customize the  advertising and marketing messages you receive on our Web sites.  Your non-PII and click stream data about your  activities on our sites may be shared with these companies so this  customization can be accomplished.  These  companies will not share your information with any third party or use it for  any other purpose.  Anonymous click  stream and demographic information may also be shared with FIM’s advertisers  and business partners.</p>
      <p>There may be instances when FIM  may disclose PII without providing you with a choice in order to protect the  legal rights of FIM, other companies within the News America Group or their  employees, agents and contractors; to protect the safety and security of  visitors to our Web sites; to protect against fraud or for risk management  purposes; or to comply with the law or legal process. In addition, if FIM sells  all or part of its business or makes a sale or transfer of assets or is  otherwise involved in a merger or business transfer, FIM may transfer your PII  to a third party as part of that transaction. </p>
      <h3>SECURITY: FIM PROTECTS THE SECURITY OF PII</h3>
      <p>FIM uses reasonable  administrative, technical, personnel and physical measures to safeguard PII in  its possession against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure or  modification. In addition, FIM uses reasonable methods to make sure that PII is  accurate, up-to-date and appropriately complete. Passwords and other sensitive information stored by FIM are encrypted  both in transit and when stored within FIM’s online databases. </p>
      <h3>ACCESS: HOW TO ACCESS, CORRECT OR DELETE YOUR PII</h3>
      <p> FIM has implemented  procedures for you to access, correct or  delete your PII.   If you are a registered user at FIM’s  Web site, you can view and change your user preferences by following the  procedure detailed below. </p>
      <p>To access your PII, send an e-mail  with the word "Privacy" in the subject line to <a href="mailto:Idol.web@fox.com?subject=Privacy">Idol.web@fox.com</a>, or write to the FIM Internet Privacy Information at Fox  Interactive Media, Inc. Business and Legal Affairs,  345 N. Maple Drive, Suite 352, Beverly Hills,  California 90210, requesting a listing of the PII that is on file that  you have provided or that has been obtained from a third party. FIM will provide you with a list of your PII within thirty  (30) calendar days from receipt of your  request.  There may be  certain instances when FIM may not be able to provide the PII, such as when  access would violate the privacy of another individual orwhen access is  prohibited by law.</p>
      <p>In the event the PII on file is  incorrect, you may correct the PII by sending a written request for correction to  FIM Internet Privacy Information at Fox Interactive Media, Inc., Business and  Legal Affairs, 345 N. Maple Drive, Suite 352, Beverly Hills, California 90210,  including (1) all  of the incorrect PII, (2) the corrections that you wish  to make to your PII, and (3) your signature authorizing  such changes. FIM will then correct the PII in its database and send a written  confirmation to you within forty-five (45) business days. </p>
      <p>If for any reason you wish to stop  all future communications from this site, you may send an e-mail with the word  "Privacy" in the subject line to <a href="mailto:Idol.web@fox.com?subject=Privacy">Idol.web@fox.com</a>, or write to  FIM Internet Privacy Information at Fox  Interactive Media, Inc., Business and Legal Affairs, 345 N. Maple Drive,  Beverly Hills, California 90210, requesting that your PII be permanently  removed from this site’s database.
