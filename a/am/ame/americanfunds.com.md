# Privacy policy | Capital Group

###### Capital Group considers the privacy of its investors to be of fundamental importance and has established a policy to maintain the confidentiality of the information you share with us.

#### Personal information we collect

We do not sell any information to any third parties. However, we may collect and retain certain nonpublic personal information about you, including:

  * information we receive from you or your financial intermediary, such as your name, address, date of birth and tax identification number;
  * information from third-party data services (for example, to update your address when you have moved and demographic information to better understand your investment and service needs);
  * information, such as account balance and transaction activity, about your investment transactions (including, to the extent necessary for our servicing your account(s) with us, your investments with third parties); and
  * information collected from you online, information provided by you and data gathered from your activity and location. (For example, we may use cookies and web beacons to collect device and browser information, such as your IP address, so we know your online preferences and viewing behaviors and can recognize you and your devices.)



#### Personal information we may disclose

We occasionally disclose nonpublic personal information about you to affiliates and nonaffiliates as permitted by law. Some instances when we have shared information include:

  * disclosing information to a third party in order to process account transactions that you request or authorize;
  * sharing information with companies related to us, as permitted by law, to make you aware of new funds or other services that we offer;
  * disclosing your name and address to companies that mail account-related materials such as shareholder reports (note that these companies may not use the information for any other purpose);
  * disclosing information to research companies or other service providers that help to assess and improve our financial services, and help us provide tailored experiences and advertisements about our products and services; and
  * disclosing information in connection with legal proceedings such as responding to a subpoena.



#### When personally identifiable financial information is shared with third parties, they are not permitted to use the information for any purpose other than to assist our servicing of your account(s), including helping us improve the services we offer, or as permitted by law.

#### If you close your account(s) or if we lose contact with you, we will continue to share information in accordance with our current privacy policy and practices.

#### We restrict access to your nonpublic personal information to authorized persons. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard your nonpublic personal information.

These measures reflect our commitment to maintaining the privacy of your confidential information. We appreciate the confidence you have shown by entrusting us with your assets.

To comply with federal regulations, information we receive from you will be used to verify your identity.
