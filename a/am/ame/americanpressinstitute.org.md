# Privacy policy - American Press Institute

This is the website of the American Press Institute, 4401 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 900, Arlington, Va. 22203-1867. API can be reached by e-mail at hello@pressinstitute.org and by telephone at (571) 366-1200.

This site does not target children under the age of 13 and does not collect personal information about individuals except when specifically and knowingly provided by such individuals. Currently, the site collects information (e.g., name, title, employer, mailing address, telephone number, fax number, e-mail address, and payment information) voluntarily provided by individuals who register for API events or purchase API products online. API uses this information to process online requests.

Registration information may be provided to exhibitors or attendees of API events, but neither registration nor product-purchase information is sold. Third parties who receive registration information collected on this website have not agreed to maintain the confidentiality, security, and integrity of the personal information obtained.

To further enhance the relevance and value of the website, API uses web measurement tools that provide details about the ways visitors access site content (articles, reports, downloads). This non-personally identifiable information will be used by the API staff to improve the types of resources that are provided on the website.

Prior parental consent may be required before a child can submit personal information. For purposes of this policy, a child is anyone under the age of 13. A parent can consent to the collection and use of a child’s personal information (e.g., name, e-mail address) without consenting to disclosure of that same information to third parties. A child’s participation in any activity offered on this website cannot be conditioned on the disclosure of more personal information than reasonably is necessary to participate. In addition, a parent has a right to review and have deleted any personal information submitted by a child, and can refuse to permit further collection or use of the child’s information by contacting API through the postal mail address, e-mail address, or telephone number shown above and requesting review or deletion of information submitted by a child to the website.

Prior parental consent is not required for API to accept personal information from a child for the sole purpose of directly responding on a one-time basis to a specific online request. Likewise, prior parental consent is not required for API to accept personal information from a child for the sole purpose of directly responding more than once to a specific request. When responding more than once to specific request from an individual API knows to be a child, a reasonable effort will be made to notify a parent – either by postal mail or by e-mail sent to the parent, not the child – that he can refuse to allow further use of the child’s contact information. Such notice will be sent immediately after the first response to the child’s request and before any additional responses are sent. Any contest in which children are participants, and for which API knows children are registering online, shall be treated by API as a contact with a child in which it is responding more than once to a specific request.

Children: Even under circumstances where prior parental consent is not required by law, API suggests that children obtain permission from a parent before sending any information about themselves (including name, age, address, e-mail address, etc.) to API or anyone else over the Internet.

Parents: API encourages parents to get involved with their children’s online usage and to be aware of the activities in which their children are participating. Any personal information collected by API from children (if API is aware they are children) will be used only for internal purposes such as contest fulfillment, or fulfilling requests for information or materials. Such information will not be posted or published by API, or provided to any third parties, without prior parental consent. If you have any concerns regarding use of information provided by a child, please contact us at hello@pressinstitute.org, or at the postal mail address or telephone number above.

API’s website contains links to many other sites. However, we are not responsible for the content or the privacy practices employed by other sites.

Questions or concerns regarding what is done with information provided via this site should be directed to hello@pressinstitute.org before any information is submitted.
