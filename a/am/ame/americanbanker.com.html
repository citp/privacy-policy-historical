	<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>	<p>SourceMedia, publisher of American Banker, provides market information, including news, analysis, and insight to the financial services and related industries such as accounting and technology, through its publications, industry-standard data applications, seminars and conferences. Our privacy policy continues our commitment to serve you and explains how we intend to protect your privacy. </p>

<p>This policy reflects how we collect and use your information in all of our marketing and communication. Consumers interact with us online, in response to direct-mail or other promotions, or through communication with customer service. We want you to understand how we will protect and safeguard your privacy in any interaction you may have with us.</p>

<p>Our privacy pledge to you: We know that you care how information about you is used and shared, and we are committed to do so carefully and sensibly. We do not sell, share, or rent your information to others in any way that we have not mentioned in this policy statement.</p>

<p>This privacy policy was last updated in September 2007. It has been updated to provide you with additional detail and to address our use of information collected through all marketing channels.</p>

<p>Please read this privacy policy carefully so that you understand our online privacy practices regarding:</p>
<ul>

<li>Sites, products, and services covered by this Privacy policy.</li>
<li>Information we collect and how we collect it </li>
<li>About cookies </li>
<li>How your information will be used </li>
<li>Sharing personally identifiable information </li>
<li>How you can correct your information </li>
<li>Our email policies </li>
</ul>

<p>The publisher of American Banker may develop new products and services that complement our current offerings. This privacy policy will also apply to any new products or services we develop. </p>


These sites, products and services are referred to in this Privacy policy as "American Banker," "AmericanBanker.com," "we," "us," "our sites," "our Web sites," "our products," and "our products and services."

Our Web sites may contain links to other Web sites for your convenience and information. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of those other sites. We encourage you to review the privacy policy of any company before submitting your personal information. SourceMedia, the publisher of the family of American Banker products and services, maintains additional Web sites that contain separate privacy policies.

<h2>INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE COLLECT IT</h2>

<p>Some of the services on American Banker are offered without our collecting any personally identifiable information from you. You can view some of our content anonymously.</p>

<p>The information we gather through all marketing channels falls into three categories: (1) personal information you voluntarily supply to us such as when you subscribe, order, complete a survey, register for an online discussion, enter a contest or sweepstakes, or provide your email address, (2) tracking information collected as you navigate through our sites, and (3) customer service information we collect to resolve a problem or answer a question.</p>

<p><strong>Personally identifiable information</strong><br>There are many features on our sites for which no registration is required. You will need to provide us with personal information about yourself if you are interested in obtaining certain information, products, or services through any channel, or in participating in certain activities (such as making a purchase; subscribing; or participating in sweepstakes, contests, surveys, or other special initiatives). When you do this, we collect personally identifiable information about you, including, but not limited, to your name, mailing address, email address, telephone number, credit-card information, and user name and password.</p>

<p>If you do provide us with personal information we may use this to customize your experience online or provide you with personalized email and direct-mail messages. We may track what online, email or direct-mail content you are interested in. We do this to focus our communications and provide you content, services and offers we believe may be of interest to you.</p>

<p>We may supplement information you give us with information from other sources, such as information to validate or update your address, credit-card or other demographic and lifestyle information. We use this information to help us maintain the accuracy of the information we collect, to target our communications so that we can inform you of products and services that may be of interest, and for internal business analysis or other business purposes.</p>

<p>You may also provide us with information about other people. For example, you might submit a person's name and email address to share an online article or you might order a product or service as a gift either online or offline for another person and we will ask you for that person's name, postal address, and email address in order to complete delivery of the gift to the recipient.
Aggregate information collected through technologyWhen you use American Banker, we may collect tracking information such as your browser type, the type of operating system you use, the domain name of your Internet service provider, and pages visited on the site. None of this information identifies you personally; we collect it for aggregate reporting on site activity. For example, we may want to know how long the average user spends on our sites or which pages or features get the most attention. We use this information to make our sites more useful to you.</p>

<p>Most aggregate information is collected via cookies or other technical methods. We use cookies, Web beacons, and other technologies for analysis and personalization services. American Banker also places ads on other Web sites that may use cookies. To learn more, read About Cookies in the next section.</p>

<p>American Banker licenses content from various providers for our products and sites. Most such online content is provided directly by American Banker. In a few cases, however, the company licensing content to American Banker may host the content on their Web servers, although our subscribers gain access to the content through the American Banker site. In such cases, the content provider may collect aggregate tracking information such as domain name and IP addresses for those who access the hosted content.</p>

<p>Information shared under these circumstances is provided primarily to safeguard the security of the content sites, as well as that of American Banker. These companies are restricted from using the data they collect in any way other than to protect the security of their content or for certain other limited uses. They may not share or resell any information collected.</p>

<h2>ABOUT COOKIES</h2>
<p><strong>What's a cookie? </strong><br>
A cookie is a small file that is sent to your computer by a site's server. A cookie can be a record of your visit to a site, including information such as your User Name, registration information, time of last visit, pages viewed, etc. A cookie created by one site's servers can be retrieved only by that site's servers. Thus, information in the AmericanBanker.com cookies is not accessible to other sites. </p>


<p><strong>Using American Banker</strong><br>
In order to access American Banker.com successfully, your browser must be set to "accept all cookies." If you set your browser to "not accept" any cookies, you will not be able to use American Banker.com. We also do not suggest that you navigate the American Banker.com site with your browser's "cookie alert" feature enabled. While you certainly could set your browser to alert you each time a cookie is passed to your machine, you most likely will find the experience of having to respond to frequent cookie alerts quite frustrating while trying to enjoy your subscription. We suggest that you turn the "cookie alert" feature off, or perhaps use the site for a short time with it on, once you've seen firsthand how we use the technology.</p>

<p><strong>Why do we use cookies? </strong><br>
We use cookies to allow you to move quickly through our site. We accomplish this in many ways, using several different cookies. When you first enter AmericanBanker.com, for example, we use a test cookie to confirm your browser's ability to retain cookies. Next, we check our database to verify your subscription so you can gain access. A cookie is then temporarily "set" within your browser to allow you to proceed without having to confirm your identity with each subsequent page you request to view. 
Without cookie technology, we would not be able to offer you convenient features such as the ability to store your User Name and Password and save personalized news or portfolio settings.</p>


<h2>HOW YOUR INFORMATION WILL BE USED</h2>
<p>We want you to understand how we will use your information, and if you tell us that you do not want us to use this information for any further contact with you beyond fulfilling your requests, we will respect your wishes. 
Our primary goal in collecting information is to provide you with a customized experience and to make our products, programs and services more useful to you.</p>

<p><strong>American Banker information use:</strong><br>
American Banker uses personally identifiable information collected through all channels in a limited number of ways. We use the information to complete transactions and fulfill requests for our services. For instance, if you order or register for a product or service, we use your information to process or communicate with you about the status of your order, or if you contact us for help, we will use the information to reply to you. We may also use the information you provide to send you promotional materials by postal mail, email or telephone only for American Banker or American Banker's products, programs, or services that we believe may be of interest to you. If you prefer not to receive these communications, you can opt-out of email promotions by following the unsubscribe instructions included in each communication or you can indicate your preference not to receive direct mail or telephone calls from us by writing to:<br>

<p><strong>For legal purposes:</strong><br>
From time to time, we may purchase a business or sell one or more of our businesses and your personally identifiable information may be transferred as a part of the purchase or sale. In the event that we purchase a business, the personally identifiable information received would be treated in accordance with this Privacy policy, if it is practicable and permissible to do so. In the event that we sell a business, we will include provisions in the selling contract requiring the purchaser to treat your personally identifiable information in the same manner required by this Privacy policy (including any changes to this Privacy policy made prior to purchase date). We may occasionally release personal information as required by law, for example, to comply with a court order or subpoena.</p>

<p><strong>HTML verification and email tracking:</strong><br>
 When receiving email from us, we may place a small piece of code in that email to determine whether or not you can accept HTML images and whether or not you viewed and/or clicked on links contained in the email. This process does not leave any information on your computer, nor does it collect information from your computer.
Email opt-outs. In the event you decide to unsubscribe from our newsletters or promotional emails we will honor your request within thirty business days.</p>
 
<p><strong>Emails from you:</strong><br>
 You may choose to send us emails. You should be aware that information disclosed in emails may not be secure or encrypted and thus may be available to others. We suggest that you exercise caution when deciding to disclose any personal or confidential information in emails.</p>


<h2>SECURITY AND PASSWORDS</h2>
<p>We have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use the information we collect through all channels. We maintain a secure process to collect, transmit, and store your personally identifiable information. When you provide credit-card information online, we use secure socket layer (SSL) encryption to protect it. See our Security statement for details. </p>
<p>However, no method of transmitting or storing electronic data is ever completely secure, and therefore we cannot warrant or guarantee that such information will never be accessed, used or released in a manner that is inconsistent with this policy. Subscribers can review or change online subscription or credit-card information at any time at My Account.</p>
<p>We urge you to keep your online password in a safe place and not to divulge it to anyone. Also remember to sign off your account and close your browser window when you have finished your visit. This ensures that others cannot access your account, especially if you are sharing a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place, such as a library or Internet cafe.</p>


<h2>INTERNATIONAL PRIVACY</h2>
<p>Our Web sites are primarily hosted by servers in the United States and we may have site visitors and registrants as well as subscribers and buyers of our publications and products from countries around the world. Accordingly, if you are located outside of the United States, the personal information you provide to us will be transferred to the United States. By submitting your personal information, you consent to its transfer and storage in the United States and its use in accordance with the purposes for which it was originally collected and as set forth in this Privacy policy. </p>

<h2>CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
<p>This Privacy policy may be amended from time to time. Any modifications will be reflected online, so check back often. If we make a significant or material change in the way we use your personal information, we will make you aware by prominently posting a notice on our Web sites. We will provide thirty (30) calendar days advanced notice of any material change to the way we use personal information.</p>

<p><strong>Security of your information:</strong><br>
The personal information you provide to purchase American Banker, including your credit card number, is protected by encryption to minimize the possibility that it is read by unauthorized third parties as it is transmitted over the Internet. The encrypted data is transmitted using a secure socket layer (SSL) connection (a Netscape browser standard, adopted by Microsoft for their Internet Explorer and by some other browsers). The encrypted data goes to a secure site, where your information is stored on a private computer that is not directly accessible via the Internet. At the secure site, your credit-card number is validated and your order information is kept in restricted access files. </p>
