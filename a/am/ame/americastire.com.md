Our methods of information collection include tracking your Site activities through your computer settings or most-recently visited URL. We may also ask you to provide certain non-personally identifiable information about yourself, such as your age, household income, buying preferences, etc.

In the course of displaying our advertisements to you, a unique third-party cookie may be placed or recognized on your browser. In addition, we use web beacons to help manage our online advertising. These web beacons enable our ad server to recognize a browser's cookie when a browser visits this site and to learn which ads bring users to our site 

One such third-party services that we utilize is Google Analytics.

We may connect information collected automatically with information we already have about you in order to identify you as a America's Tire guest. If we are able to identify you as a guest we may, for example, link your activity on our Site to your activity in a America's Tire store or on one of our mobile applications. This allows us to provide you with a personalized experience regardless of how you interact with us – online, in store, mobile, etc. 

In order to provide the best guest experience possible, we also use automated information collection technologies for reporting and analytics purposes. We examine metrics such as how you are shopping on our Site, in our stores, and on our mobile applications, the performance of our marketing efforts, and your response to those marketing efforts.
