## Privacy Policy

American Apparel respects your privacy. Consistent with our commitment to providing you a satisfying and helpful shopping experience, we have found that collecting Personal Information (defined below) through [www.AmericanApparel.net](http://www.americanapparel.net/) (the "Site"), affiliate sites and our stores, including but not limited to American Apparel stores and American Apparel Factory Stores (referred to in this Privacy Policy as the "Stores"), helps us better understand the products and services most helpful to you. Our Privacy Policy describes the types of information we gather online and in our Stores and how we use this information. Please read this information carefully.

By accessing the Site and shopping in our Stores, you agree to be bound by the Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Accordingly, you should check the date of this Policy (which appears at the top of this page) and review any changes since the last version. If at any time you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use this Site and refrain from purchasing from us. 

Our products are also available for sale in other non-affiliated stores. Data collected in these stores is the property of the respective stores and is not provided to American Apparel Corporation. If you have questions about the privacy policies, for these companies, please contact them directly.

Our policies relating to the transfer of Personal Information from the European Union ("EU") to the United States are contained in our Safe Harbor Privacy Policy. 

## Use of Information Collected by Us

American Apparel may collect two types of information about users: "Personal Information" (such as name, email address, mailing address, phone number, credit card number and the items you purchase) and "Aggregate Information" (such as information about how many users log on to our Site on a daily basis or frequency of customer visits to American Apparel Stores).

We use customer information in an effort to improve your shopping experience and to communicate with you about our products, services, promotions and contests. We may also use this information to make offers to you, to help us target specific products and services to you, and to help us develop and improve our Site and Stores and tailor our Sites and Stores to your interests. 

## Personal Information Collected Online by AmericanApparel.net and at Our Stores

Personal Information is collected online by us or our service providers (e.g., such as Yahoo!) on our behalf when users voluntarily register with AmericanApparel.net to purchase items, receive electronic newsletters, use community and communication services, answer surveys and enter contests and other promotional opportunities provided on AmericanApparel.net, when users make a purchase, and when users subscribe to our newsletter. We also maintain a record of your product interests and purchases online. We may receive personal usage and demographic information from our Stores.

If you accessed this store through Yahoo! Shopping, Yahoo! also automatically collects information about your shopping experience. Yahoo! automatically collects order information but may only use this information in aggregate. Please see the Yahoo! Privacy Policy for more information about how Yahoo! uses this information.

In our Stores, Personal Information is collected from you in a number of ways, including the following:

  * When you purchase products from our Stores, we may collect your name, address, email address, telephone number(s) and credit card information (with the expiration date). In addition, we collect transaction information related to your purchase (such as what you bought, the price you paid, the payment method you used and if the product was on sale).
  * When you fill out a tailoring order or instruct us to mail product to another location, we may collect your name, address, email address, telephone number and credit card information.
  * When you fill out any in-store promotional surveys, we may gather certain optional Personal Information, such as your opinions on specific products and/or services, in addition to identifying information, such as your name, address, telephone number(s), email address(es), income and employment status.



We love our customers. We realize that you have other options, and we appreciate that you have chosen American Apparel products. We strive to be the most progressive garment manufacturer in the world, and we extend that ambition to our online sales. We understand that you are concerned about your security, privacy and the confidentiality of information we may gain about you online. We are committed to respecting your privacy. 

## Aggregate Information Collected Online by AmericanApparel.Net and at Our Stores

Aggregate Information is non-personally identifiable/anonymous information about you, such as age, gender, types of products purchased, frequency of Store visits, Site pages you access most frequently or search terms you enter. Aggregate Information is used in a collective manner, and no single person can be identified by that compiled information. For example, the number of people who shopped at AmericanApparel.net during a specific time period or the number of people who shopped at our Stores who are 25 years of age is Aggregate Information that does not personally identify a specific user. Both AmericanApparel.Net and our Stores collect Aggregate Information.

## Order-related and Promotional email

You agree that AmericanApparel.net is authorized to transmit email to you for the purpose of informing you about your particular transaction.

In addition, AmericanApparel.net and its affiliates may offer electronic newsletters and promotional emails to those who have agreed to receive emails during registration or directly from our email sign-up form. Unsubscribe instructions are included in each promotional email. 

## Sharing Information with Third Parties

AmericanApparel.net does not share, sell or trade with third parties your Personal Information gathered online, such as email addresses, Personal Information collected as part of an online survey or other specific details about you, except with your consent or as described in this Privacy Policy. AmericanApparel.net does not contribute to or participate in cooperative databases, which give other companies access to such Personal Information.

The Personal Information and Aggregate Information collected at our Stores may be shared with AmericanApparel.net as well as reputable third-party organizations to contact consumers for marketing and promotional purposes. Third party contacts to our customers may be initiated only by postal mail. Except as described in this Privacy Policy, our Stores will not share your telephone number or e-mail address.

AmericanApparel.net, affiliate sites, and our Stores may divulge Personal Information if such action is required for American Apparel or any of our service providers or consultants to comply with any valid legal process, such as a subpoena, search warrant, statute or court order, or any valid administrative request from a law enforcement agency. In addition, we may divulge Personal Information if we or any of our service providers or consultants believes that such disclosure is necessary to address any unlawful acts or acts that may endanger the health or safety of another customer or of the general public. 

## Service Providers, Consultants and Affiliates

We may share Personal Information with service providers we have retained to perform services on our behalf (such as internet and technology service providers, mail houses, call centers, and delivery companies). We require service providers to whom we disclose Personal Information and who are not subject to laws based on the European Union Data Protection Directive to contractually agree to provide at least the same level of protection for Personal Information as is required by the relevant Safe Harbor principles.

A pixel tag, also known as a clear GIF or web beacon, is an invisible tag placed on certain pages of our Site but not on your computer. When you access these pages, pixel tags generate a generic notice of that visit. They usually work in conjunction with cookies, registering when a particular computer visits a particular page. If you turn off cookies the pixel tag will simply detect an anonymous website visit.

## Security and SSL

Protecting your order information is a priority for us. We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to protect the security of your online order information. To check the security of your connection, look at the lower right-hand corner of your browser window after accessing the server. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending on your browser), then SSL is active and the server is secure. You can also double-check by looking at the URL line of your browser. When accessing a secure server, the first characters of the Site address will change from "http" to "https." Some versions of browsers and some firewalls don't permit communication through secure servers. In that case, you won't be able to connect to the server and therefore won't be able to place an order through a secure connection. If you cannot access the secure server for any reason, please print our shopping page and place your order by phone at +1 213 488 0226

## Children and Privacy

AmericanApparel.net is concerned about the safety of children when they use the internet, and understands that children may not understand all the provisions of our Privacy Policy or make informed decisions about the choices that are made available to adult users of the Site. We encourage parents and guardians to spend time with their children online and to be familiar with the sites their children visit.

American Apparel does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of thirteen. Any service requiring the collection of personal data will have an opt-in agreement that states the person using the service is 13 years of age or older. All users must acknowledge and agree to this statement prior to using such services.

If we become aware that a customer is under the age of 13 and has registered without prior verifiable parental consent, we will remove his or her personally identifiable registration information from our files. 

## Links to Other Sites

AmericanApparel.net and affiliate sites may contain links to sites other than our own. Those sites may have their own privacy policy or no privacy policy at all. Neither we nor any of our service providers have any responsibility for those sites, and we provide these links solely for the convenience of our visitors. Such links may be to advertisers, content providers or other companies who may use our logo and/or style as a result of a co-branding agreement. These sites may send their own cookies to you and may collect information and use it in a way inconsistent with this Privacy Policy. We encourage you to review the privacy policies and terms of use of any third-party sites or services before providing any of them with any of your Personal Information. Neither American Apparel nor any of our service providers control the content that appears on these sites or take any responsibility for their content, nor should it be implied that AmericanApparel.net endorses or otherwise recommends such sites or their products or services offered.

These limitations shall apply notwithstanding any failure of essential purpose or the existence of any limited remedy.

**American Apparel's mobile app was built on top of functionality referenced as Gimbal. In using the app, you agree to Gimbal collecting, using and storing information as described below.**

## Data Collection

End-user Location fixes - latitude / longitude coordinates, accuracy estimate and time stamp. Sourced from native OS location APIs. Location collection occurs periodically, based on significant location change events as reported by the native OS.

Information about the end-user device (e.g., make, model, OS, and other similar information). But not phone number or UDID. The version of the Gimbal software.

Information that end-users may enter in American Apparel's app that is passed to Gimbal. Such as designating a private place (e.g., "my favorite store").

## Data Use

Gimbal monitors end-user location to create place events ("at" or "left"). These events are used to notify American Apparel's app when the end-user has arrived at or left places designated (based on user preference.) Gimbal generates a list of the location clusters (identified by lat/longs) that the end-user visits frequently.

## Data Storage

Location fixes that do not generate place events are not stored. The single location fix that does generate a place event is stored on the client, along with the corresponding place event. The set of generated PPOIs are stored on the client.

Place events and the location fix that caused the event are stored on the Gimbal servers. The set of generated PPOIs are stored on Gimbal servers. Gimbal Servers are located in the United States. All data transmission is sent encrypted via SSL.

## Data Retention

Gimbal stores information on the client for up to sixty days, at which point it is overwritten on a rolling basis. Gimbal stores information on Gimbal managed servers for up to one year, at which point it is overwritten on a rolling basis.

## Data Sharing

We do not share personal information with others, except as follows:  
We may share personal information with agents, service providers, vendors, contractors, or affiliates who (i) are bound to data privacy and security terms and conditions at least as restrictive as those in the Agreement and (ii) process the data only on our behalf for the purposes set forth above. We may also share personal information as required by law or in the interest of protecting or exercising our or others' legal rights, e.g., without limitation, in connection with requests from law enforcement officials and in connection with court proceedings. We may share or transfer personal information in connection with a prospective or actual sale, merger, transfer or other reorganization of all or parts of our business.
