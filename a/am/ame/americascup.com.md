America’s Cup Event Authority LLC (“ACEA”, “us”, “our” or “we”) is committed to preserving the privacy of all visitors to our website at www.americascup.com (the “Website”).  Before you proceed with use of the Website, please read the following privacy policy (the “Policy”) carefully to understand how we use and protect the information that you provide to us.

Please be aware that this Policy only governs our use of personally identifiable information that is collected when you are on the Website.  This Policy does not extend to the use of data submitted to or through any third party websites, including, without limitation, America’s Cup Team pages, to which links may be provided on the Website, and we encourage you to review the privacy policies of those other websites and the America’s Cup Team pages in order that you understand how they collect, use and share information.

**1.   Information That We May Collect From You**

1.1  In general, you can access and browse the Website without providing personal information.  However, there may be times when we will request personally identifiable information from you in order that you may participate in the Website’s services, activities or features.  The personally identifiable information collected may include (without limitation) your first name, last name, e-mail address, address, country of residence, nationality, gender, date of birth, preferences, billing address, credit or debit card information, account name, account password, answer to security question and/or mother’s maiden name.  We may also collect information about your usage of the Website as well as information about you from messages you post to any forum or message board and emails, letters and other communications you may send to us from time to time.

1.2  When you submit personally identifiable information to us through the Website, you agree that such information may be stored and processed by us and/or on our behalf.  We may also collect information about your interaction with the Website and the services on the Website.  We receive and record information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, cookie information (see further below) and the page(s) you requested.  In particular, we reserve the right to perform statistical analysis of user behaviours and characteristics in order to measure interest in and use of the various areas of the Website and to ascertain the number of users that have visited particular pages of the Website.  We will provide only aggregated data from these analyses to third parties, and such statistical data will not identify any individual.

1.3  Please note that if you submit your personally identifiable information to us, you will be giving your consent to the transfer of such information to other countries.  Collected information may be processed, stored and used elsewhere depending on the location of affiliates, business partners and other entities who are permitted to access such information under the terms of this Policy.

**2.   Use of Your Information**

2.1  We collect and use your information in order to give you a better service and to provide you with information you request, including information about ACEA events and/or the America’s Cup.  Your information is also used to fulfil your requests for certain services and/or to participate in certain activities and/or to make the Website more useful to you.  Where you have consented when providing us with your details, we may also allow carefully selected third parties to contact you from time to time about events, products and services which may be of interest to you.

2.2  You have the right to prevent marketing information being sent direct to you, whether by us or by our carefully selected third parties.  If you prefer not to receive information from us or from any other organisation to which we may wish to disclose your personal information, ensure that you tick the appropriate box which appears where you are submitting your personal data.  If you change your mind, at any time, about being contacted by us or our third parties, please let us know.  Please understand that where you have opted out of receiving further communications, it may take us a few days to process your request.

2.3  We may disclose your personally identifiable information without your express consent where we believe disclosure to be required by law or regulation, or necessary to protect or defend our rights or property, the safety of the public and/or the users of the Website.

**3.   Cookies**

3.1  In common with many other website operators, we may use standard technology called ‘cookies’ on the Website.  Cookies are small amounts of information that are stored by your browser on your computer’s hard drive.  We use cookies to improve the Website, to monitor Website traffic and to deliver a better and more personalised service for you.  Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser setting to prevent cookies being stored.  However, if you adjust your browser setting in this way, you may be unable to access certain parts of the Website.

3.2  Other companies that are advertising on our Website may also use cookies, over which we have no control.  Other companies’ use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this Policy.  Such third party advertisers do not have access to our cookies.

**4.   Security and Data Retention**

We employ security measures to help safeguard the information we collect from you on the Website, including technical and organisational measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorised access, use, alteration or disclosure.  However, the Internet is an open system and we cannot guarantee that unauthorised third parties will never be able to access or use your personal information for improper purposes.  We will retain your information for a reasonable period or as long as the law requires.
