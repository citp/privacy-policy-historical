# Privacy Policy - America Saves

Privacy Policy:  The [main CFA privacy policy](http://consumerfed.org/privacy-policy/) applies to America Saves websites with these additions.

America Saves collects personal information from visitors who sign up voluntarily to participate in the savings program.  Visitors who participate provide their name, savings goal, email address, and zip code.  Participants may also sign up for America Saves through local organizations.

CFA maintains the America Saves database.  Information about participants may be shared with and among local America Saves organizations to coordinate area campaigns and for similar activities.  America Saves does not otherwise share personal information about participants with program sponsors or other third parties.  Local organizations may have their own privacy policies.

America Saves sends occasional emails to those who agree to receive them unless recipients opt-out.  Those who provide a cell phone number receive text messages if they opt-in.  We do not post any personal information about America Saves participants on the America Saves webpage without their affirmative permission.

We do not offer any of the America Saves programs to anyone under the age of 14.
