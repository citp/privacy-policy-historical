By accessing or using any features on www.studenthousing.com or an American Campus Communities property website, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. We may periodically change these terms without providing prior notice. So, we recommend that you read these terms carefully each time you use one of these websites.

Privacy   
Our goal is to provide you with an excellent customer experience. We will take reasonable measures to protect the privacy of our applicants, residents, prospective residents, and website visitors. We collect personal information only for purposes that a reasonable person would consider appropriate in the circumstances. This Privacy Policy is intended to inform you of the information we collect and the ways in which we will protect that information. 

Information Submitted by Applicants   
In order for one of our properties to process a lease application, applicants must provide some personal information. This information will be used to identify and consider the applicant for residency, and to contact the resident and/or the resident’s guarantor. We may also request contact information from prospective residents who visit or call one of our properties. This information may be used to contact prospective residents, or to inform them of news or promotions. Any personal information you submit to one of our properties will only be used to conduct official business. We do not sell, rent, or trade this information to unrelated third parties or telemarketers. The information you submit to one of our properties may be accessed by the property, and by American Campus Communities and its affiliates. It may also be disclosed to a credit bureau or investigative agency during the application process, or to a collection agency in the event of contract default. If law enforcement officials or judicial authorities request information, we may, without your consent, provide such information. In matters involving a danger to personal or public safety, we may voluntarily provide information to appropriate government authorities. Non-personally identifiable, aggregate information operating our website. 

E-commerce   
Some lease applicants may choose to apply for residency online and pay any applicable fees at that time. Current residents may also wish to pay their rent online. E-commerce information is encrypted and securely transmitted via SSL or equivalent technology. These transactions are processed by third parties and we are not responsible for their privacy practices. American Campus Communities does not store the e-commerce information of online applicants.
