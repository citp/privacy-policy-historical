<h2>CISCO PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
      <p>Cisco respects your privacy and is committed to protect the personal 
        information that you share with us. Generally, you can browse through 
        our website without giving us any information about yourself. When we 
        do need your personal information to provide services that you request 
        or when you choose to provide us with your personal information, this 
        policy describes how we collect and use your personal information.</p>
      
	  <h3>Information Collection</h3>
	  <p>Personal information means any information that may be used to identify 
        an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, email 
        address, a home, postal or other physical address, other contact information, 
        title, birth date, gender, occupation, industry, personal interests, other 
        information when needed to provide a service you requested.</p>
      <p>When you browse our website, you do so anonymously, unless you have previously 
        indicated that you wish Cisco to remember your login and password. We 
        don't automatically collect personal information, including your email 
        address. We do log your IP address (the Internet address of your computer) 
        to give us an idea of which part of our website you visit and how long 
        you spend there. But we do not link your IP address to any personal information 
        unless you have logged in to our website. Like many other commercial websites, 
        the Cisco website may use a standard technology called a "cookie" to collect 
        information about how you use the site. Please go to <a href="#cookies">"Cookies and Tracking 
        Information"</a> below for more information.</p>
		
      <p>Cisco collects personal information when you register with Cisco for 
        a Cisco account, when you use certain Cisco products or services, when 
        you register to attend a seminar or participate in an online survey, when 
        you ask to be included in an email or other mailing list, or you submit 
        an entry for a sweepstakes or other promotions, or when you submit your 
        personal information to Cisco for any other reason. From time to time, 
        Cisco receives personal information from business partners and vendors. 
        Cisco only uses such information if it has been collected in accordance 
        with acceptable privacy practices consistent with this Policy and applicable 
        laws.</p>
		
      <p>Access to certain Cisco web pages require a login and a password. The 
        use of those web pages, and the information or programs downloadable from 
        those sites, may be governed by a written agreement between your employer 
        and Cisco. Unless you request deletion of your personal information as 
        specified below, your personal information may be retained by Cisco to 
        verify compliance with the agreement, log software licenses granted, to 
        track software downloaded from those pages, or track usage of other applications 
        available on those pages.</p>
		
	<h3>Notice</h3>
		
      <p>When personal information is collected, we will inform you at the point 
        of collection the purpose for the collection. Cisco will not transfer 
        your personal information to third parties without your consent, except 
        under the limited conditions described under the discussion entitled <a href="#information_sharing">"Information 
        Sharing and Disclosure"</a> below.</p>
      
	  <p>If you choose to provide us with your personal information, we may only 
        transfer that information, within Cisco or to Cisco's third party service 
        providers with your permission. Upon receiving your permission, we may 
        transfer your information across borders and from your country or jurisdiction 
        to other countries or jurisdictions around the world.</p>
      
	  <p>We will always give you the opportunity to "opt out" of receiving direct 
        marketing or market research information. This means we assume you have 
        given us your consent to collect and use your information in accordance 
        with this Policy unless you take affirmative action to indicate that you 
        do not consent, for instance by clicking or checking the appropriate option 
        or box at the point of collection. In some cases, when applicable, we 
        will provide you with the opportunity to "opt in." This means we will 
        require your affirmative action to indicate your consent before we use 
        your information for purposes other than the purpose for which it was 
        submitted.</p>
      
	  <a name="cookies"></a><h3>Cookies and Tracking Technology</h3>
	  <p>A cookie is a small data file that certain Web sites write to your hard 
        drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain information such 
        as a user ID that the site uses to track the pages you've visited, but 
        the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you 
        supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie 
        files created by other sites. Some parts of Cisco's website use cookies 
        to track user traffic patterns. We do this in order to determine the usefulness 
        of our website information to our users and to see how effective our navigational 
        structure is in helping users reach that information.</p>
		
      <p>If you prefer not to receive cookies while browsing our website, you 
        can set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies and refuse the 
        cookie when your browser alerts you to its presence. You can also refuse 
        all cookies by turning them off in your browser, although you may not 
        be able to take full advantage of Cisco's website if you do so. In particular, 
        you may be required to accept cookies in order to complete certain actions 
        on our website. You do not need to have cookies turned on, however, to 
        use/navigate through many parts of our website, except access to certain 
        of Cisco's web pages may require a login and password.</p>
      
	  <h3>How We Use Information Collected</h3>
	  <p>Cisco uses information for several general purposes: to fulfill your 
        requests for certain products and services, to personalize your experience 
        on our website, to keep you up to date on the latest product announcements, 
        software updates, special offers or other information we think you'd like 
        to hear about either from us or from our business partners, and to better 
        understand your needs and provide you with better services. We may also 
        use your information to send you, or to have our business partners send 
        you, direct marketing information or contact you for market research.</p>
		
		<a name="information_sharing"></a><h3>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h3>
      <p>Because Cisco is a global company, your personal information may be shared 
        with other Cisco offices or subsidiaries around the world. All such entities 
        are governed by this Privacy Policy or are bound by the appropriate confidentiality 
        and data transfer agreements.</p>
      
	  <p>Your personal information is never shared outside Cisco without your 
        permission, except under conditions explained below. Inside Cisco, data 
        is stored in controlled servers with limited access. Your information 
        may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country 
        where Cisco, its subsidiaries, affiliates or agents are located.</p>
      
	  <p>Cisco may send your personal information to other companies or people 
        under any of the following circumstances: when we have your consent to 
        share the information; we need to share your information to provide the 
        product or service you have requested; we need to send the information 
        to companies who work on behalf of Cisco to provide a product or service 
        to you (we will only provide those companies the information they need 
        to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information 
        for any other purpose); or we want to keep you up to date on the latest 
        product announcements, software updates, special offers or other information 
        we think you'd like to hear about either from us or from our business 
        partners (unless you have opted out of these types of communications). 
        We will also disclose your personal information if required to do so by 
        law, to enforce our <a href="/public/copyright.html">Terms of Use</a>, 
        or in urgent circumstances, to protect personal safety, the public or 
        our websites.</p>
      
	  <h3>Your Ability to Review and Delete Your Account and Information</h3>
	  <p>If you are a registered CCO user, you can review your personal information 
        by accessing <a href="www.cisco.com/common/profile.shtml">www.cisco.com/common/profile.shtml</a>. 
        You may also request deletion of your Cisco account or any of your personal 
        information held by us by sending an email to <a href="mailto:privacy@cisco.com">privacy@cisco.com</a>.</p>
      
	  <h3>Data Security</h3>
	  <p>Your Cisco account information is password-protected for your privacy 
        and security. Cisco safeguards the security of the data you send us with 
        physical, electronic, and managerial procedures. In certain areas of our 
        websites, Cisco uses industry-standard SSL-encryption to enhance the security 
        of data transmissions. While we strive to protect your personal information, 
        we cannot ensure the security of the information you transmit to us, and 
        so we urge you to take every precaution to protect your personal data 
        when you are on the Internet. Change your passwords often, use a combination 
        of letters and numbers, and make sure you use a secure browser.</p>
      
	  <h3>Children and Privacy</h3>
	  <p>Our websites do not target and are not intended to attract children under 
        the age of 13. Cisco does not knowingly solicit personal information from 
        children under the age of 13 or send them requests for personal information.</p>
      
	  <h3>Third Party Sites</h3>
	  <p>Cisco's website contains links to other sites. Cisco does not share your 
        personal information with those websites and is not responsible for their 
        privacy practices. We encourage you to learn about the privacy policies 
        of those companies.</p>
      
	  <p>Our website may contain links to websites operated by other companies. 
        Some of these third-party sites may be co-branded with a Cisco logo, even 
        though they are not operated or maintained by Cisco. Although we choose 
        our business partners carefully, Cisco is not responsible for the privacy 
        practices of web sites operated by third parties that are linked to our 
        site. Once you have left our website, you should check the applicable 
        privacy policy of the third party website to determine how they will handle 
        any information they collect from you.</p>
      
	  <h3>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>
	  <p>Cisco will amend this policy from time to time. If we make any substantial 
        changes in the way we use your personal information we will make that 
        information available by posting a notice on this site.</p>
      
	  <h3>Questions or Suggestions</h3>
	  <p>If you have questions or concerns about our collection, use, or disclosure 
        of your personal information, please email us at privacy@cisco.com.</p>
