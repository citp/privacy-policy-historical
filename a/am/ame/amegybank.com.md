Privacy Policy

At Amegy Bank National Association (Amegy Bank N.A. or Amegy Bank), we take seriously the trust you place in us to provide both superior financial services and to protect the privacy of your records. We understand how important the issues of privacy are to you. We pledge to continue maintaining all records in a confidential and discreet manner.

Please review this brochure to learn more about how we protect your privacy – even when we occasionally share information with third parties who offer a service that complements the financial products and services we offer. When we share information, we take steps to ensure that those companies, when acting on our behalf, keep your information confidential.

We also recognize that it is possible you may not value the benefits from sharing such information. We respect that, and would like you to have a choice. That is why you can “opt out” of these opportunities with the enclosed brochure.

Remember: If you previously exercised your opt out rights, you do not need to make another election; we are required by law to continue mailing you our Privacy Policy annually. Your opt out election remains in effect until revoked in writing. Opt out requests cannot be accepted over the phone. 

The Amegy Bank Privacy Policy is our pledge that you can count on us to protect the privacy and security of your information, while continuing to supply you with the finest financial products and services.

We appreciate your business and thank you for your continued confidence and trust.
