SSL is a proven, industry standard coding system that lets your browser automatically encrypt or scramble data before you send it to us.&nbsp; On all pages of our Site, including secure donation pages, the user will notice the website address at the top of the browser screen starts with an "https" instead of an "http", and a closed lock symbol appears at the end of the address window – indicating that the pages are secure. We do not store sensitive information from our visitors or donors, such as credit cards or social security numbers. We also protect account information by placing it on a secure portion of the Site that is only accessible by certain qualified employees of Americares.&nbsp;</span> <a id="anchornameDrawer2"></a></p>
<p><span>Protecting your information is of great importance to Americares and something we take very seriously. While our methods are the accepted industry standard for security protocol, and make it extremely difficult for your credit card data to be intercepted by anyone else, no data transmission over the Internet, is ever 100% secure. So while we strive to protect your information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of such information. If you prefer to donate by mail, please send your check to Americares 88 Hamilton Ave. Stamford, Ct 06902, or to make a credit card donation over the phone, please call us at (800) 486-4357 or (203) 658-9500.</span></p>
