Privacy Policy and Disclaimer</h3></td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2"><p>The American Meteorological Society (AMS) respects the privacy of members,
  users of its services, and visitors to its various websites and operates according
  to the following policies.</p>
<h3>Personal Information</h3>
<p>Some personal information including addresses, phone numbers, e-mail addresses,
  and other demographic information is collected for membership, subscriptions
  and publications, meeting registrations, submission of articles, and other
  similar transactions. AMS takes precautions to protect your individual information
  from unauthorized use. AMS may make internal use of your contact information
  to inform you of situations or services that may interest you. </p>
<p>The AMS online Membership Directory is a service restricted to use by members.
  It contains basic contact information and membership data. E-mail addresses
  are not released to outside organizations, except when a vendor performs a
  service for AMS under its supervision. Member postal mailing lists are sold
  on a carefully screened basis, and only when the mailed material is thought
  to be of significant interest or benefit. </p>
<p>AMS members may change and update their addresses, e-mail address, suppress
  use of their contact information in the Membership Directory, decline to receive
  AMS-generated e-mail messages, or request to be excluded from externally sold
  mailing lists by visiting &nbsp; <a href="http://www.ametsoc.org/MEMB/onlinemembservices/index.html"><strong>"AMS Member Online Services"</strong></a> or
  by contacting the Membership Department at <a href="mailto:amsmem@ametsoc.org"><strong> amsmem@ametsoc.org</strong></a>. &nbsp; </p>
<p>Author or referee information is never sold, and is only used for purposes
  related to AMS, its journals, and/or manuscripts which have been submitted
  to them. </p>
<p>When you submit credit card transaction information to our site online, we
  use a secure server with commercial encryption software.</p>
<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>A “cookie” is a file a Web site places in your computer for future
  reference. AMS uses cookies to improve some of its services, such as membership
  renewal online. Information supplied through an AMS cookie is used only by
  AMS and is not shared with others. </p>
<h3>Server Logs</h3>
<p>As you travel through the AMS website, our servers log information about your
  session. Information logged includes items such as your IP address, what browser
  you are using, the time and date you visited, how long your session lasted,
  and what pages you visited. We use this information from our server logs primarily
  to learn about our visitors as a group. It helps us to improve services on
  the site and plan for future needs so that we can assure continuity of service.
  Systematic (“robotic”) downloads of journal material are not permitted,
  and an individual log may be examined and/or access terminated when this activity
  is observed. Or, we may check an individual log for editorial purposes or when
  an individual has reported trouble accessing an AMS system.</p>
<h3>Future Changes</h3>
<p>AMS reserves the right to change this policy in any manner at any time without
  prior notice. If we make material changes to our privacy policy, these changes
  will be posted on this page. </p>
<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
<p>AMS encourages you to exercise discretion while browsing the Internet. The
  AMS website provides links to other websites which are not controlled by AMS.
  A link from the AMS website is not an AMS endorsement for any company or organization.
  AMS is not responsible for the accuracy, copyright compliance, legality or
  decency of material contained on any other website. We encourage you to be
  aware when you leave our website and to read the privacy statements of each
  website that collects personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>We take measures to protect our website but there is no guaranty that the
  AMS website will be free of infection by viruses or any other contaminating
  or destructive properties. The user accepts sole responsibility and risk associated
  with the use and results of AMS website materials, irrespective of the purpose
  to which such use or results are applied. </p>
