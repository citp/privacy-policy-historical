# American Century | Privacy & Security

Privacy & Security   
It's a Matter of Privacy — Yours   
Trust is the foundation of any relationship. At American Century, trust takes on even greater importance. After all, when you entrust your money to our care, you also entrust us with your goals, plans and perhaps even your dreams for your financial future. We take that responsibility seriously. We work hard to do the right thing – by striving to provide solid value, excellent investment management and the best service possible. We apply that same integrity to protecting your privacy. 

  * We do not sell your personal information to anyone.
  * Because we limit our use of your personal information, there is no opportunity for you to opt out of third party sharing.
  * The service providers with whom we share personal information are not authorized to use it for any purpose other than to assist American Century.

  
  
Our Privacy and Security Policy is divided into the following sections:

  * What Types of Information Do We Collect?
  * How Do We Use the Information We Collect?
  * Do We Use This Information for Marketing?
  * How Do We Protect Your Information?
  * Our Use of Cookies and Clear Gifs 
  * Secure Online Account Access
  * Web Browser Requirements
  * Contacting American Century
  * Notification of Changes

  
What Types of Information Do We Collect? | back to top  
   
The information we collect about you generally falls into one of the following categories. 

  * Information, such as your address, Social Security number, phone number, bank information, income, net worth and investment profile, which you may provide in account applications and other forms you submit to us. 
  * Account information, such as your fund choices, account balances and transaction history. 
  * Personal information about you, such as age, gender and marital status, that consumer reporting agencies and other organizations may provide to us. 
  * Information relating to your use of our Web site, such as your User Name, Password, failed attempts to log in and the last time you logged in.



Also, when you conduct business with American Century online, you may notice our use of Internet "cookies." See our discussion below of cookies and how we use them.   
  
How Do We Use the Information We Collect? | back to top  
   
We use the information we collect primarily to maintain your accounts and process your transactions. In doing so, we may share this information with other financial service companies in the American Century corporate family, such as the funds' transfer agent, distributor and investment advisor. We also may share this information with outside companies that we hire to perform administrative services on our behalf. 

Examples include transaction processing and servicing organizations, including our clearing broker, that administer transactions you request or authorize, and print and mail service providers that assist us in distributing materials such as transaction confirmations, annual reports, prospectuses and tax forms. We also may share this information with others under certain limited circumstances permitted by law, such as to resolve a dispute or prevent fraud. When required by law, we may need to disclose personal information where such action is deemed necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, court order or legal process served on americancentury.com.   
  
Do We Use This Information for Marketing? | back to top  
   
American Century's vision, which drives all our company activities, is to help people achieve their dreams. We do rely on the information we collect to help us better understand you and your investing needs. This allows us to offer investment products and services that may be of interest to you. From time to time we may share this information with other financial service companies in the American Century corporate family and with others we hire to help us with our research efforts, mailings or other American Century marketing or communications activities. 

In the next section of this policy, we explain how we protect your information. If, after reading that section, you choose to opt out of future marketing mailings, you may do so in one of the following ways.

  * Mailing your request to:

How Do We Protect Your Information? | back to top  
   
We treat all personal information we collect as confidential information offered to us solely and exclusively so that we may provide financial products and services for your benefit. 

We do not sell the personal information we collect. The non-American Century service providers with whom we do share personal information are not authorized to use or share it for any purpose other than to assist American Century.

Our policies allow certain individuals to have access to your personal information — those who must have it to service your account. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect this information. We treat information about our former investors with the same care we take with our current investor's information.
