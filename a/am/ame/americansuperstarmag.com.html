    <p><b>OUR COMMITMENT TO PRIVACY</b></p>
<p>American Superstar is dedicated to protecting your privacy and  handling any personal information that we obtain from you with care and  respect. We strive to deliver outstanding products, services and  experiences. We value your support, and most importantly, your loyalty.  This Privacy Policy ("Policy") is designed to answer your questions  regarding our privacy policies and principles, and demonstrate our  commitment to a strong and meaningful customer relationship.</p>
<p><b>WHAT THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVERS</b></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This policy covers how American Superstar treats personal information  that American Superstar collects and receives, including information  related to your past use of American Superstar products and services.  Personal information is information about you that is personally  identifiable like your name, address, email address, or phone number,  and that is not otherwise publicly available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This Site contains links to other Web sites over which we have no  control. We are not responsible for the privacy policies or practices of  other Web sites to which you choose to link from our Site. We encourage  you to review the privacy policies of those other Web sites so you can  understand how they collect, use and share your information.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT</b></p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">General</span></b></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>American Superstar collects personal information when you register  with American Superstar, when you use American Superstar products or  services, when you visit American Superstar pages or the pages of  certain American Superstar partners, and when you enter promotions or  sweepstakes. American Superstar may combine information about you that  we have with information we obtain from business partners or other  companies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you register we ask for information such as your name, address,  email address, zip code, phone number, birth date, gender, industry,  work experience and personal interests. Once you register with American  Superstar and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a user elects to use our Invite feature to invite a friend to our  site, we ask them for the friend's email address. American Superstar  will automatically send the friend an email inviting them to join the  Site. American Superstar stores this email address for the purpose of  sending reminders of the invitation. American Superstar does not sell  these email addresses or use them to send any other communication  besides invitations and invitation reminders. The friend may contact  American Superstar to request the removal of this information from our  database.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>American Superstar collects your credit card information if you  purchase a product from the Site. Your credit card information is not  collected or retained by American Superstar. It, along with the personal  identifying information you submit, is transferred to and used by third  party financial institutions to verify the credit card numbers and to  authorize the processing of the transaction. Be sure to review all  privacy policies published by our third-party service providers and  contact them directly if you have questions as they may have privacy  terms that differ from American Superstar's Privacy Policy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>American Superstar automatically receives and records information on  our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, American  Superstar cookie information, and the page you request.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>American Superstar uses information for the following general  purposes: to customize the advertising and content you see, fulfill your  requests for products and services, improve our services, contact you,  conduct research, and provide anonymous reporting for internal and  external clients.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Children</span></b></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Children should always ask parents for permission before providing  any personal information online. No information should be submitted to  or posted on this Site by any Minor (a guest under 18 years of age)  without the consent of a parent or guardian. Unless otherwise disclosed  during collection, we do not knowingly provide any personally  identifying information about Minors, regardless of its source, to third  parties, nor is this information knowingly used by American Superstar  for any marketing or promotional purposes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE</b></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>American Superstar does not rent, sell, or share personal information  about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies except to  provide products or services you've requested, when we have your  permission, or under the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of  or with American Superstar under confidentiality agreements. These  companies may use your personal information to help American Superstar  communicate with you about offers from American Superstar and our  marketing partners. However, these companies do not have any independent  right to share this information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to  establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We believe it is necessary to share information in order to  investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities,  suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical  safety of any person, violations of American Superstar's Terms of Use,  or as otherwise required by law.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We transfer information about you if American Superstar is acquired  by or merged with another company. In this event, American Superstar  will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes  subject to a different privacy policy.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>American Superstar displays targeted advertisements based on personal  information. Advertisers (including ad serving companies) may assume  that people who interact with, view, or click on targeted ads meet the  targeting criteria - for example, males ages 18-24 from a particular  geographic area.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>American Superstar does not provide any personal information to the  advertiser when you interact with or view a targeted ad. However, by  interacting with or viewing an ad you are consenting to the possibility  that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting  criteria used to display the ad.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>American Superstar advertisers include financial service providers  (such as banks) and non-financial companies (such as stores, media, and  entertainment companies).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>American Superstar works with vendors, partners, advertisers, and  other service providers in different industries and categories of  business.</p>
</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Your Choice to Accept or Deny Cookies</span></b></p>
