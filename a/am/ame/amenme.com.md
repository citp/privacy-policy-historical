Privacy Information

### Our Third-Party Ads May Use Visit Information From Your Browser

We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information ( **not including** your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, [click here](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html).

  


### Password Protection

When you provide Amen Me! your password, you can rest assured that it is safe. As soon as you send it to us it is immediately scrambled. It is stored in the scrambled state so that even our administrators cannot read it. For this reason, we cannot send your password to you when you forget it. Instead, we can send you a password we generate which we scramble and forget. You can also log on using that new password and immediately change it to something else that we didn't generate.

Each password gets scrambled using an irreversible scramble. When you log in, the password you log in with is also scrambled before it is compared the one we have on our database.

We have also taken precautions to make sure that if the database is ever stolen, that common passwords couldn't be matched as well.

When you come to Amen Me! we want you to rest assured that you can enjoy it without worrying about your security.

  


### Email Addresses

If we collect it, your email address is never shared with anyone for any reason. We may occasionally send you notifications that we believe are important regarding the service itself. We do not send you anything else unless you specifically request to have it sent to you by signing up for it.

  


### Usage Information

We do keep and analyze usage information in order to provide you with the most optimal service we can.

  


### Personal Information

We don't keep any personal information other than your email address and your scrambled password.
