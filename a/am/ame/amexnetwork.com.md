**The American Express Network does not sell or share PII collected via this Website or via the e-mails covered by this Online Privacy Statement with third parties so that they can independently market their own products and services directly to you.** To provide products and services to you, we may also share your information with carefully selected Vendors and "Business Partners" with whom we work.

All companies that act on our behalf are required to safeguard PII. We may also use or disclose your information, including PII, to comply with the law or in response to a subpoena, court order, government request, or other legal process, or as otherwise permitted by law; to perform charge verifications; to report or collect debts owed; to reduce fraud or criminal activity; to protect our legal rights and the legal rights of American Express Company, its subsidiaries, and affiliates ("American Express"), our customers, this Website, or the users of this Website; to allow a purchaser of an American Express division, or American Express as a whole, to continue using your information to serve you; or as otherwise permitted by this Online Privacy Statement.
