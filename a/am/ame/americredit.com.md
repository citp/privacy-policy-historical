You may make changes to the information that you provide to us on the MyAccount Site by logging into MyAccount and selecting “My Profile.” You may also select the “Contact Us” tab on the Site to ask us any questions. 

### Do Not Track 

Certain web browsers may provide an option by which you can have the browser inform websites, or Internet services you visit that you do not wish to have your activities tracked by cookies or other persistent identifiers across time and across third-party Internet websites, online or cloud computing services, online applications, or mobile applications. These are commonly called "Do Not Track" signals. At this time, the Site does not honor Do Not Track signals from web browsers because it may diminish the optimal performance of the Site. However, you may refuse or delete cookies. Please refer to your browser’s Help instructions to learn more about cookies and other technologies, and how to manage their use. If you do elect to refuse or delete cookies, you will need to repeat this process if you use another computer or change browsers.

### Security

We maintain reasonable physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards designed to protect against loss or unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction of the information you provide on the Site. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage technology is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. The security of your information also depends on the security of the electronic devices and Internet Service Provider network that you use to access the Site. We are not responsible for the security of your information accessed on those devices or networks.

### Mobile Application

We may offer you the ability to access your GM Financial account on your mobile devices via the GM Financial My Account Mobile Application (“My Account App”). When you use the My Account App, we may collect information described in the section above, titled Collecting Personal Information. We may also collect information about your mobile device, device settings, screen resolution, information about your location, and analytical information about how you use your mobile device. Some mobile devices may allow you to limit the sharing of personal information collected by applications that run on those devices, or information collected by the devices themselves. We may ask permission before collecting certain information (such as precise geo-location information) through the My Account App.

For your convenience, you may be able to use biometric authentication (using Touch ID, Fingerprint, or Face ID) provided through your mobile device manufacturer to access your GM Financial account. (Please refer to your mobile device manufacturer’s product information for details on biometric functionality for your device.) To enable biometric authentication for logging into the My Account App, you are required to save your GM Financial user name and password on your device.

You understand and agree that any fingerprint or facial recognition information stored on this device can be used to access your GM Financial customer account information. We recommend that you employ a strong device password as an additional layer of security.

Please contact us if you believe we may have unknowingly collected information about a child under 13, and we will take immediate steps to delete any such personal information.

### Changes to the Privacy Policy

We may modify this Privacy Policy at any time. If we do, we will post the revised version on this page. You should periodically check here for the most up-to-date version of this Privacy Policy.
