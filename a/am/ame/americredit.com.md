### AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE CONCERNING YOUR PRIVACY

  
At AmeriCredit’s family of companies, we value our customers’ trust and confidence. This statement outlines the safeguards we employ to protect your personal information, and it explains how we collect and use that information. It also describes the instances when we may share information with other parties and affiliates and when and how you can “opt-out” of sharing certain information. We recognize the importance of trust, and we greatly appreciate your business. Please read the following privacy policy carefully. 

### OUR PRIVACY POLICY

This disclosure is our privacy policy. Your understanding of our information sharing practices is important to us. In this statement, we will tell you (among other things): 

  * Information we collect about you;
  * With whom we might share any of that information, and why;
  * What you can do if you don't want us to share certain information about you; and
  * What we do to protect the information we have about you from unintended users.

We do not share information about you except as disclosed in this policy or as allowed by law without your specific consent or notice.

  * Is a former customer; or
  * Provides nonpublic personal information on our Web site.

Here are other terms we will use in this disclosure:

  * **"Information"** means "nonpublic personal information," which is a technical term that generally means: 
    1. Information that can identify you;
    2. That is not available publicly; and
    3. That we collect in connection with providing a financial product or service to you.
  * We will use the word "information" in this statement to mean "nonpublic personal information."
  * **"Affiliate"** is any member of the AmeriCredit family of companies, for example, a company one of us owns, a company that owns one of us, or a company that is owned or controlled by a company that owns one of us.
  * **"Nonaffiliate"** includes a person who is not employed by one of us, or a company that is not an affiliate.
  * **"Opt-out"** means a choice you make to prevent us from sharing certain information about you with others.
  * **"Unsubscribe"** means a choice you make to prevent us from sending you specific electronic communications.

If you have a joint account with us, you should share this notice with the persons who share your account. They may not get a separate notice. Persons who share your account may obtain a copy of this notice by visiting our Web site at [www.americredit.com](http://www.americredit.com/) or contacting us at 1-888-249-2763.
