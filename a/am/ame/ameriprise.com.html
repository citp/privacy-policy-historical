    <h3>Information We Collect About You Online</h3>
    <p>We want you to get the most out of your visits to our website. From offering 
      special promotions to new users, to providing Ameriprise Financial clients 
      with secure online account access and management options, we strive to make 
      the most of every unique users visit to our website. To provide our user's 
      with these and other online tools, we will, from time to time request that 
      you provide us with your personal information, such as your name, address, 
      e-mail address and telephone number. We may also receive your contact information 
      via a third-party website if you request information about financial products 
      and services on another website.</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Website users:</strong> We will ask you for certain contact 
        information when you register for online services and products.</li>
      <li><strong>Ameriprise Financial clients:</strong> We will ask you for certain 
        personal information if you want to access your Ameriprise Financial accounts 
        online or request online services and products so we can provide you with 
        secure online account access or the requested services or products. In 
        some instances, we will need to supplement the information you provided 
        with certain personal information about you obtained from third parties 
        to process your online transaction, such as a credit check when applying 
        for a brokerage margin account.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>We will maintain information about your account, online account activity, 
      online services and products requested and your usage of our website to

    <h3>How We Use The Information We Collect</h3>
    <p>Whether you are a new website user or an Ameriprise Financial client, we 
      use personal information collected on our website to handle the transactions 
      you initiate. In some instances, we will share your contact information 
      with carefully selected service providers to assist us in processing your 
      online transactions or to deliver the services products, and marketing you 
      request online. For example, in order to mail you the financial guide you 
      request online, we will supply your contact information to a third party 
      vendor who will process and mail the guide, and other materials you request 
      on Ameriprise Financial's behalf.</p>
    <p>We will also share your personal information with carefully selected non-affiliated 
      companies who provide transactional services or send offers on behalf of 
      Ameriprise Financial. For example, Ameriprise Financial may offer frequent 
      flyer miles to prospective clients upon meeting with an advisor for a complimentary 
      consultation. Consumers who accept the offer and meet with an advisor will 
      have their information shared with the airline company only for purposes 
      of ensuring that the consumers receive the miles in their frequent flyer 
      accounts.</p>
    <p>In an effort to ensure that you get the most out of your visits to our 
      website, we may use your personal information in combination with other 
      information we have about you as an Ameriprise Financial client and information 
      provided to us by third parties to present you with customized and relevant 
      information and offers. For example, we may send offers pertinent to your 
      home ownership that may help you protect your assets.</p>
    <p>To better meet your overall financial needs, we may also share your information 
      with our affiliates who we believe can offer complementary services or products 
      to our clients or that we believe may be of particular interest to Ameriprise 
      Financial clients.</p>
    <p><strong>TO WORKPLACE RETIREMENT ACCOUNT(S) USERS:</strong><br>
      If you have a Workplace Retirement Account, Ameriprise will not use information 
      collected from your Workplace Retirement Account to provide you with offers 
      for services or products unless your employer thinks such services or products 
      may be of interest to you. The Ameriprise Internet Privacy Statement will 
      apply to information collected from you from other parts of our website.</p>

    <h3>Tracking Activity On Our Website</h3>
    <p>In order to make your visit to our website as productive as possible, we 
      track activity on our website. However, we want you to know that the tracking 
      technology we use does not identify any personal information about you. 
      They cannot retrieve data from your hard drive, pass on computer viruses, 
      or capture any personal information about you, such as your name, address, 
      phone number, or e-mail address. We only know who you are if you tell us. 
      You may, however, be asked to provide personal information such as name, 
      address, phone number or e-mail address to us when you register for online 
      services or products.</p>
    
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Cookies:</strong> One way we track activity is by using cookies. 
        A "cookie" is an electronic file that holds small strings of 
        text. When you visit our website, we send a cookie to your browser so 
        that we can recognize it when you or another user of your computer return 
        to our website. We want to recognize your browser so we can make the best 
        use of your time when visiting our website. For example, when you visit 
        our website, we present an introductory page to all new users. The fact 
        that you have already visited the introductory page is recorded in a cookie 
        so you won't see the introductory page again. For your security, if you 
        are registered for online services and/or have an account with Ameriprise 
        Financial we can not give you access to your account information on our 
        website unless your browser is set to accept cookies from us.</li>
      <li><strong>Advertising</strong>: When you visit our website by clicking 
        on certain banner ads or special offers on our partners' website, we track 
        this information to improve navigation and deliver relevant information 
        when you arrive at our website. We also do this because we want to determine 
        if our ads and special offers are appealing to our users.<br><br>In the course of serving our ads to you, a unique third-party cookie may 
      be placed or recognized on your browser. In addition, we use web beacons, 
      provided by our third-party ad server, to help manage and optimize our online 
      advertising. These web beacons enable us to learn which ads we place on 
      third-party sites bring users to our website. They do not capture or convey 
      any personal or sensitive information about you.</li>
      <li><strong>Browser settings</strong>: You can adjust many browser preferences 
        so that you are alerted when a cookie is placed in your browser, or adjust 
        preferences to decline cookies altogether. Recognize that cookies enable 
        you to visit our website without reviewing introductory information. In 
        addition to allowing us to recognize you, cookies also enable us to securely 
        provide our registered users with account information.</li>

    <h3>How We Use Your E-Mail Address</h3>
    <p>We recognize that e-mail can be the preferred mode of communication for 
      some of our website users. If you provide us with your e-mail address when 
      registering for an online service or product or when accessing your account 
      online, we will use it to contact you about online services and products 
      for which you have registered or about your account.</p>
    <p><strong>We may use your e-mail address to send you the following types 
      of e-mail messages:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Service notifications related to your accounts(s) </li>
      <li>Regularly scheduled e-mail newsletters related to Ameriprise Financial</li>
      <li>Products or services you are enrolled in</li>
      <li>Optional e-mail communications which you have signed up for (e.g. newsletters 
        on a selected financial topic)</li>
      <li>Occasional updates about our products and services as well as Ameriprise 
        Financial marketing offers</li>
      <li>Valuable offers from non-affiliated companies that we send you on their 
        behalf</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Also, once you have requested information from us, we may communicate with 
      you via e-mail regarding your request to provide additional information 
      related to your initial information request. For example, we may send you 
      materials to help you prepare for an upcoming meeting with an Ameriprise 
      Financial advisor. However, we will never ask you to send personal information 
      such as account or Social Security numbers by non-secure e-mail.</p>
    <p>To make our e-mail offers more relevant to you, we may use information 
      you provided in your initial transaction with us, in surveys, from information 
      we have about you as an Ameriprise Financial client and information available 
      from external sources such as census bureau data.</p>
    <p>We do not share your e-mail address with non-affiliated companies for them 
      to market their products or services directly to you. However, we may partner 
      with selected non-affiliated companies to offer certain products or services 
      we believe may be of interest to you.</p>
    <p>You may receive e-mail offers from other companies for Ameriprise Financial 
      products and services if you registered to receive third-party offers on 
      their website, or if you receive ongoing e-mail newsletters from the other 
      companies that include third-party ads. If you have recently opted out of 
      receiving email offers from Ameriprise Financial, we will process and honor 
      your request as soon as administratively possible. In certain circumstances, 
      you may receive e-mail offers for Ameriprise Financial products and services 
      from other companies during the time period when we are processing your 
      opt-out request.</p>
    <p>To opt-out of receiving offers or e-mail newsletters from other companies, 
      follow the instructions provided by those companies.</p>

    <h3>Ads That Link To Our Website</h3>
    <p>Ameriprise Financial may use third parties to place banner ads on other 
      websites and will perform tracking and reporting activities through use 
      of Ad Servers. We do not provide Ad Servers with your personal information 
      and Ad Servers do not collect your personal information.</p>
    <p>Ad Servers are subject to their own privacy policies. If you would like

  <h2 class="page-subheader">How We Safeguard Your Information</h2>
  <div class="component-box"> 
    <p>Ameriprise Financial realizes how important security is to you, so we've 
      taken a number of steps to enhance the protection of personal or confidential 
      information sent to, or from Ameriprise Financial over the Internet. First, 
      we require that a "secure session" be established, using Secure 
      Socket Layer (SSL) Technology. This is done any time you supply or access 
      personal or confidential information in one of our secure online areas.</p>
    <p>SSL Technology creates a private conversation that only your computer and 
      Ameriprise Financial systems can understand. The SSL Technology encodes 
      information as it is being sent over the Internet between your computer 
      and Ameriprise Financial systems, helping to ensure that the transmitted 
      information remains confidential. The use of SSL requires two components: 
      an SSL-compatible browser and a Web server to perform the "key-exchange" 
      that establishes a secure connection to Ameriprise Financial Web server 
      systems. In addition, all of our secure sites require that your browser 
      support 128-bit encryption.</p>
    <p>In order to securely access your personal information via our website, 
      you will need the latest browser version available with SSL and 128 bit 
      encryption capabilities.</p>
    <p>Second, many areas of the site require the use of a User ID and Password 
      as an additional security measure that helps protect your confidential information. 
      This allows Ameriprise Financial to verify who you are, thereby allowing 
      you access to your account information, and preventing unauthorized access.</p>
    <p>When you have finished using a secure area of Ameriprise Financial, make 
      sure you always click on the "Log Out" link which appears on the 
      top of every secure page. When you click on it, no further secure transactions 
      can be conducted without re-entering your User ID and Password. This also 
      helps prevent unauthorized access to your account if you walk away from 
      your computer.</p>
    <p>You should be aware that browser software often "caches" a page 
      as you look at it, meaning that some pages are saved in your computer's 
      temporary memory. Therefore, you may find that clicking on your "Back" 
      button shows you a saved version of a previously viewed page. Caching in 
      no way affects the security of your confidential User ID or Password. If 
      you use a computer in a public place to access your account information, 
      simply quit/exit the browser software before leaving to minimize the possibility 
      of anyone else viewing your confidential information.</p>
    <p>Third, in order to bring you the many online products and services offered 
      on <a href="http://www.ameriprise.com">ameriprise.com</a>, we work with 
      carefully selected vendors and non-affiliated companies. If we have to share 
      any information with these companies in order to provide a product or service 
      to you, we first conduct a careful evaluation of their information and security 
      systems and practices, and require administrative, technical, and physical 
      safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of Ameriprise Financial 
      client information. At any time, we may audit these companies to verify 
      the continued security of their systems and practices.</p>
    <p>Lastly, you should be aware that other Internet sites that you link to 
      from the Ameriprise Financial site or an Ameriprise Financial e-mail may 
      contain privacy provisions that differ from the provisions of our Privacy 
      Statement. To ensure your privacy is protected, we recommend that you review 
      the privacy statements of other Internet sites you visit.</p>

  <h2 class="page-subheader">Your Opt-Out Choices</h2>
  <div class="component-box"> 
    <p>We strive to send you e-mail communications that are informative and relevant, 
      but also appreciate that you are in the best position to evaluate the type 
      and frequency of our communications to you.</p>
    <p>There are two types of e-mail communications we will send to you: service 
      communications and marketing communications. Service communications may 
      include information about your online registration, verification that your 
      account has been accessed online, in response to a service related inquiry 
      or confirmation of an online transaction. Marketing communications may include 
      information about Ameriprise Financial's services and products, newsletters, 
      and joint or special offers or information from our selected non-affiliated 
      companies and Ameriprise Financial affiliates.</p>
    <p>To opt-out of receiving e-mail offers or newsletters, <a href="https://www65.americanexpress.com/emailcpt/EmailPrivacy?request=epref&amp;country=us&amp;organization=ameriprise">click 
      here</a>. All e-mail offers and e-mail newsletters sent to you by Ameriprise 
      Financial provide instructions on how to opt-out of receiving future offers 
      or newsletters. These instructions are located at the bottom of the e-mail 
      message. You may receive separate newsletters pertaining to different Ameriprise 
      Financial products and services that you are enrolled in automatically when 
      you register for those products or services. In this case, you must reply 
      to and decline the newsletters individually. If you opt-out, we will still 
      send you e-mail with service updates as well as other important information 
      related to the Ameriprise Financial online products or services for which 
      you have signed up.</p>

    <p>Identity theft occurs when someone uses your name or personal information, 
      such as your Social Security number, driver's license number, credit card 
      number, telephone number or other account numbers, without your permission. 
      Identity thieves use this information to open credit accounts, bank accounts, 
      telephone service accounts, and make major purchases - all in your name. 
      Information can be used to take over your existing accounts, or to open 
      new accounts. Identity theft can result in damage to your credit rating 
      and denials of credit and job offers.</p>
    <p><strong>EXAMPLE #1</strong> - One evening, you sit down to pay your monthly 
      bills. You write the checks, toss the statements in the trash and put the 
      container out on the curb for the morning's trash pick-up. While you sleep, 
      "dumpster-divers" go through your trash looking for the papers 
      you've thrown away. They discover a gold mine of information that can be 
      used for fraudulent purposes - your name, address, phone number, utility 
      service account numbers, credit card numbers, and your Social Security number.</p>
    <p><strong>EXAMPLE #2</strong> - You receive an e-mail message from what appears 
      to be your Internet Service Provider (ISP). The message requests that you 
      update the information they have on file about you - your name, credit card 
      number, bank account number, etc. - by replying to the e-mail or going to 
      a specific website address to provide the information. However, neither 
      the message nor the website address is from your ISP. They belong to someone 
      who wants to get your information to steal your identity.</p>

    <h3>Preventing Identity Theft</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Secure your personal information at home and at work.</strong> 
        Consider keeping your sensitive personal information such as bank, mortgage, 
        and credit card statements, Social Security cards, and other documents 
        and passwords, in a safe location accessible only to you.</li>
      <li><strong>Shred documents containing your personal information before 
        discarding them.</strong> Identity thieves have been known to “dumpster 
        dive” to obtain discarded documents with personal information.</li>
      <li><strong>Obtain your credit report from each of the three major credit 
        bureaus once every 6-12 months.</strong> Review these reports for any 
        inaccurate information, or any transactions that you were not aware of 
        or did not authorize. You may wish to consider occasionally reviewing 
        Credit Bureau Reports on your children. Identity thieves have been known 
        to steal children's Social Security numbers in order to create fraudulent 
        accounts, as their information is not likely to be reviewed regularly.</li>
      <li><strong>Avoid giving out personal information over the phone</strong> 
        especially when the telephone call is initiated by another party. Identity 
        thieves may pose as a representative of a legitimate organization with 
        whom you do business and may contact you to "verify" your information.</li>
      <li><strong>Before disclosing any personal information,</strong> make sure 
        you know why it is required and how it will be used.</li>
      <li><strong>Do not give out your Social Security number</strong> to people 
        or companies that you do not know.</li>
      <li><strong>Carry only the information you need.</strong> Only take with 
        you the credit cards you need, and avoid carrying your Social Security 
        card, your birth certificate or passport, except when necessary.</li>
      <li><strong>Have the Postal Service hold your mail if you are going to be 
        gone for a few days or more.</strong> Since identity thieves have been 
        known to obtain personal information by collecting an individual's mail, 
        promptly remove your incoming mail from your mailbox and place outgoing 
        mail in post office collection boxes. Have the Postal Service hold your 
        mail at the post office if you are planning on being away for any period 
        of time. Install a locking mailbox if mail theft is a problem in your 
        neighborhood.</li>
      <li><strong>Create unique passwords and personal identification numbers 
        (PINS)</strong> and avoid using easily available information such as mother's 
        maiden name, date of birth, or the last four digits of your Social Security 
        number. Use passwords on your banking and brokerage accounts, and update 
        all of your passwords regularly.<p></p></li>
    </ol>
    <p>If you need further guidance, you may wish to consult the consumer affairs 
      office of the company involved, the U.S. Better Business Bureau, or your 
      local or state consumer protection agency.</p>

    <h3>Detecting Identify Theft</h3>
    <p>Fortunately, detecting identity theft can be fairly simple for diligent 
      consumers. Just follow these three steps:</p>
    <ol>
      <li> 
        <p><strong>Contact the Credit Bureaus</strong></p>
        <p>First contact each of the three national bureaus and request copies 
          of your credit report.</p>

      </li>
      <li> 
        <p><strong>Review Your Credit Reports</strong></p>
        <p>Review all three of your credit reports carefully and make sure you:</p>
        <p>Recognize all accounts listed in your report and confirm that the balances 
          are in line with your records.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Recognize all persons and entities that have requested or received 
            a copy of your report. (If you do not recognize a person or entity, 
            you may want to inquire further).</li>
          <li>Find no inquiries to your credit report for loans or accounts you 
            did not apply for. (If there are accounts you do not recognize, this 
            may be a sign that an identity thief has fraudulently opened an account 
            in your name).</li>
          <li>Confirm there are no addresses listed for places you have never 
            lived. (If there are addresses you do not recognize, this may be a 
            sign that an identity thief has redirected your mail).</li>
          <li>Check that your Social Security number and employment history are 
            accurate.</li>
          <li>Check that all this information is consistent across all three credit 
            bureaus.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li> 
        <p><strong>Correct Your Information</strong></p>
        <p>If you find any incorrect or suspicious information, contact the credit 
          bureau(s) immediately. If the incorrect or suspicious information concerns 
          a particular creditor, you will want to contact that creditor as well.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Restoring your good name</h3>
    <p>These step-by-step guidelines were developed by the FTC, and are provided 
      by Ameriprise Financial to help you repair the damage caused by identity 
      theft. Here you'll find contact information on the relevant authorities, 
      forms and sample documents you can download, as well as useful identity 
      theft links. More information is available from your local police and the 
      agencies themselves.</p>
    <p><strong>1. Contact the police</strong><br>
      Contacting the police allows them to start investigating the crime. You 
      will also want to obtain a copy of the police report, the police report 
      number, and the name of the investigator. Banks, credit card companies, 
      and other agencies may require this information as proof of a crime.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>When filing a police report, provide as much documentation as you can 
        to prove you have been a victim of identity theft. Documentation including 
        collection letters, credit reports, and an Identity Theft Affidavit can 
        help the police create a thorough report.</li>
      <li>If the identity theft occurred while you were away from home, you may 
        also need to file a police report in the jurisdiction where the theft 
        actually occurred.</li>
      <li>Get a copy of the police report to submit to your creditors and others 
        that may require proof of a crime.</li>
      <li>Be persistent if necessary. You may be told they cannot provide a report. 
        Be sure to let the police know that you need a report to provide to other 
        agencies in order to resolve the identity dispute. If your local police 
        will not file a report, contact the county and state police. You may also 
        ask that they file a Miscellaneous Incident Report instead.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>2. Contact the credit bureaus</strong><br>
      Notify the three major credit bureaus (Equifax, Experian, Trans Union) that 
      you have been a victim of identity theft and request that your file be flagged 
      with a "Fraud Alert." Fraud Alerts expire after six months, so 
      you may want to ask how you can extend it if needed.</p>
    <p>Request copies of your credit report from each bureau to review. If information 
      contained within your report is inaccurate, you may dispute it and request 
      that it be changed. Request your credit report again in a few months. This 
      will help you confirm that the requested changes have been made and whether 
      your report has been changed without your knowledge. This may also identify 
      additional occurrences of identity theft.</p>

      <a href="http://www.transunion.com">www.transunion.com</a></p>
    <p>You may also want to file a "Victim Statement" with the bureaus 
      asking them to notify you before any new accounts are opened or any existing 
      accounts are changed in your name. This may reveal illicit attempts to open 
      additional accounts in your name.</p>
    <p><strong>3. Close Suspect Accounts</strong><br>
      Close the accounts you know or suspect involve identity fraud. </p>
    <p><strong>Checks:</strong> If your checks have been stolen or you suspect 
      they have been misused, contact your financial institution to stop payments. 
      Familiarize yourself with your state's laws concerning stolen and forged 
      checks. You can contact your State Attorney General's office or local consumer 
      protection agency to find out about any laws in your state related to identity 
      fraud. Most states hold the financial institution responsible for losses 
      related to a forged check. However, it may be your responsibility to notify 
      the financial institution of the possible forgery in a timely manner.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You may also want to contact the major check verification companies 
        directly. These companies can alert retailers who use their databases 
        not to accept your checks:</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Telecheck: 1-800-710-9898<br>
      Certegy, Inc: 1-800-437-5120 </p>
    <ul>
      <li> You can also find out if the thief has been passing bad checks on your 
        account by calling SCAN at 1-800-262-7771.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Credit Accounts and ATM Cards: <br>
      </strong>Report the incident to all institutions with which you hold credit 
      card and ATM cards. Ask the financial institution or agency to send you 
      a fraud dispute form to complete. When reopening new accounts, be sure to 
      use new PINs to reduce the risk of future identity theft.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If your financial institution is not assisting you with the issues related 
        to your identity theft, you may contact the agency with jurisdiction over 
        your financial institution. If you are not sure what agency has jurisdiction 
        over your particular financial institution, you can find out by visiting 
        <a href="http://www.ffiec.gov/enforcement.htm">www.ffiec.gov/enforcement.htm</a>.</li>
      <li>If you suspect your investment or brokerage accounts have been altered 
        without your permission, report it to the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
        You can file a report using their online Complaint Center at <a href="http://www.sec.gov/complaint.shtml">www.sec.gov/complaint.shtml</a>.</li>
      <li>Keep in mind that each creditor may have its own process for handling 
        a case of identity theft. Therefore, be sure to specifically ask each 
        creditor what its process is, what is expected of you, and what you can 
        expect from them.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>4. Contact the authorities</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Federal Trade Commission</strong><br>

    <h3>What is phishing?</h3>
    <p><strong>Phishing (pronounced "fishing") refers to fraudulent 
      communications designed to deceive consumers into divulging personal, financial, 
      or account information. Phishing e-mails often appear to come from legitimate 
      financial institutions or retailers. Such requests may ask for information 
      including account numbers, passwords, user names or Social Security numbers.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>These fraudulent e-mails often create a false sense of urgency 
      intended to provoke the recipient to take immediate action; for example, 
      phishing e-mails frequently instruct recipients to "validate" 
      or "update" account information or face cancellation. In addition, 
      marketing offers may also be used for attempted phishing. Phishers use a 
      variety of techniques, which may include false "From" addresses, 
      authentic-looking logos, or Web links and graphics. These techniques mislead 
      consumers into believing that they are dealing with a legitimate request 
      for sensitive information.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Attachments within an e-mail can also facilitate phishing. Do not 
      open attachments in unfamiliar e-mails, as they may place programs known 
      as "key stroke loggers" on your PC, which capture keystrokes you make (including 
      when you logon to a site and enter your password). The data obtained can 
      then be used to commit fraud.</strong></p>

    <h3>What does phishing look like?</h3>
    <p>The nature of phishing schemes has evolved and is likely to continue to 
      do so in the future. Currently, online/e-mail phishing is best described 
      by the following characteristics:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>E-mails using company logos and familiar language reporting a problem 
        and asking you to update your account information by prompt return e-mail 
        or by filling out a website form.</li>
      <li>E-mails with attachments asking you to install software so that fraudsters 
        can use it to record your key strokes (called Keystroke Logging) and online 
        activity.</li>
      <li>E-mails that contain typographical or grammatical errors. Spelling errors 
        allow fraudsters to bypass spam filters used by Internet Service Provides 
        (ISP's).</li>
      <li>Windows that pop up over a legitimate company's website asking you to 
        enter personal information.</li>
    </ul>
    <div> <a class="btp" href="#a5">Back to Top</a> 
      <div class="clear"></div>
    </div>
    <a name="d3" id="d3"></a> 
    <h3>How does phishing work?</h3>
    <p>Phishing works by making an e-mail or website appear to be legitimate, 
      thereby providing potential victims with a false sense of security. The 
      e-mail or website requests the recipient to provide sensitive information, 
      which may later be used to commit fraud.</p>
    <div> <a class="btp" href="#a5">Back to Top</a> 
      <div class="clear"></div>
    </div>
    <a name="d4" id="d4"></a> 
    <h3>How do I protect myself?</h3>
    <p>Consider whether the company would be likely to ask you for the kind of 
      information being requested. If you are at all in doubt about the authenticity 
      of the communication, contact the company through familiar communication 
      channels (e.g., the phone number provided on account statement).</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Do not click on a link in an e-mail when you are not sure of its legitimacy, 
        even if it looks genuine. If you are at all in doubt, contact the company 
        directly.</li>
      <li>Avoid e-mailing personal and financial information.</li>
      <li>Never open e-mail attachments from unknown sources.</li>
      <li>If you receive an e-mail that you believe could be fraudulent, immediately 
        forward it to <a href="mailto:anti.fraud@ampf.com">anti.fraud@ampf.com</a>.</li>
      <li>Regularly review your account statements.</li>
      <li>Do not share IDs/user names and passwords.</li>
      <li>Change your passwords regularly.</li>
      <li>Be aware that other Internet companies that you do business with may
