### Our use of data and analytics

In order to maintain a high level of customer service, we may use your personal information to:

  * provide you with products and services that you request (e.g. to complete a reservation);
  * process your financial information to complete a purchase;
  * communicate with you about your Hello Rewards membership;

  * improve our services and website content via market research, such as customer feedback surveys;
  * respond to an employment request; and to improve your overall RLH Corporation experience.



We evaluate, categorize and profile personal data to help us personalize services and communications on our platforms and on third party platforms such as social media. This also helps prevent unwanted communications from filling up your inbox. This helps us understand and provide a better experience to our customers, improve and protect our organization and carry out research connected to our products and services.

**Internal research and analysis:** We carry out research and analysis on our customers to determine the success of campaigns and promotions, better understand behavior and responses and identify patterns and trends. This helps inform our approach and make RLH Corporation a stronger and more effective organization. Understanding our customers, their interests, and what they care about also helps us provide a better experience.

**Analysis and grouping:** We analyze the data we collect about customers to identify common characteristics and preferences. We do this by assessing various types of information including behavior, for example, previous activity or demographic information, such as age or location. This allows us to ensure you receive the communications, products and information which are most important to you.

**Profiling to help us understand our customers:** We profile customers on the basis of various criteria including their interests, general geographic location, website/app activity and socioeconomic and age groups. At times, we may also use aggregated, anonymized lifestyle data obtained from third parties to supplement our profiles. This information helps us to ensure communications are relevant and timely and to offer new products and services that may be of interest to our customers.

Several of these analytics activities rely on the use of cookies. You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when websites set or access cookies. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of our website or platforms may become inaccessible or not function properly.
