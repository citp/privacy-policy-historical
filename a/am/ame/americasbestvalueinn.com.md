# Vantage Hospitality Group, Inc. Privacy Policy

**Vantage Hospitality Group, Inc. Privacy Policy**

Vantage Hospitality Group, Inc. and its affiliates (referred to herein as "Vantage," "we," and "us") are concerned about privacy issues and want you to be familiar with how we collect, use and disclose certain information. This Privacy Policy (the "Policy") describes our practices in connection with information that we collect through our websites, which include, [www.americasbestvalueinn.com](http://www.americasbestvalueinn.com/), [www.lexingtonhotels.com](http://www.lexingtonhotels.com/), [www.canadasbestvalueinn.com](http://www.canadasbestvalueinn.com/) (collectively, the "Sites") and by other means.

By providing certain information to Vantage, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Policy. If you do not agree to the terms and conditions of this Policy, please do not provide any information to Vantage through our Sites or otherwise. We reserve the right to change this Policy without prior notice. Any changes to our Policy will become effective upon our posting of the revised Policy on the Sites. Use of the Sites following such changes constitutes your acceptance of the revised Policy then in effect. 

**What Types of Information Does Vantage Collect?**

Vantage gathers three basic types of information from you: "Personally Identifiable Information," "Non-Personally Identifiable Information," and "IP Addresses." Personally Identifiable Information is information that identifies you as an individual. Non-Personally Identifiable Information is aggregated information, demographic information and any other information that does not reveal your specific identity. An IP Address is the Internet Protocol address of the computer that you are using to access our Sites. All types of information described above shall collectively be referred to as "Information." 

We may collect Information through the Sites, through reservation and call centers, from affiliates, any of our brand hotels, which includes Americas Best Value Inn, Lexington by Vantage, Canadas Best Value Inn and Value Inn Worldwide lodging properties ("Member Hotel") or other third parties, or when you otherwise voluntarily provide it to us, including in connection with reservations, reward programs, and our various promotions and drawings. We do not collect or store information unless it is voluntarily provided by you.

  
**How Does Vantage Use the Information Collected?**  
Vantage collects Information so that we can provide a better experience that is responsive to our guests' and visitors' needs. For example, Vantage may use collected Information in:

  * Fulfilling your requests to complete your transactions and/or to book reservations at any Member Hotel through our central reservations system, or in response to your, requests that we send marketing, informational or other newsletters to you. 
  * Administering and operating membership loyalty programs to allow you to receive discounts, earn and redeem rewards, points or credits in connection with Member Hotels and rewards partners. 
  * Sending important information regarding the Sites, changes to our terms, conditions and policies and/or other administrative information or otherwise to inform you of products, programs, services and promotions that we believe may be of interest to you. 
  * Conducting drawings, contests and other marketing or promotional activities (collectively, "Promotions"). We typically ask you for certain Information when you enter and, if applicable, win a prize, and we use such Information to administer the applicable Promotion. 
  * Tracking, processing and responding to guest relations inquiries. We may also transmit your Information to third party service providers and Member Hotels in connection with such guest relations inquiries. 
  * For our internal business purposes, such as data analysis, audits, enhancing the Sites, tracking our users, improving our services, identifying usage trends and visiting patterns, determining the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns and meeting contractual obligations. 
  * In compliance with legal and regulatory requirements or demands. 



**How Is Information Shared?**  


  * We may share your Information with Member Hotels and other third parties for purposes described in this Policy. Vantage relies on numerous third party service providers to provide certain products and services on our behalf, including, but not limited to, credit card billing, reservation services, credit card/payment processing, IT services, guest relations, communication and delivery of promotional and marketing materials via e-mail and direct mail, Promotions, guest surveys, social networking, administration, data analysis and other similar services. We may share your Information for the purpose of enabling these third parties to provide services you have requested or as otherwise necessary for the ongoing operation of our business. 
  * We also may use and/or disclose your Information (i) when we have reason to believe that it is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against persons or entities that may be causing injury to you, Vantage, Member Hotels or others; (ii) when we believe a law or regulation (including laws and regulations outside your country of residence) requires it; (iii) as mandated by subpoena, court order, or legal process; (iv) to establish or exercise our legal rights, defend against legal claims or protect our operations or those of any Member Hotels; (v) to protect the rights, privacy, safety or property of Vantage, Member Hotels, you or others; and (vi) to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Vantage's terms of use, or as otherwise required or permitted by law. 



**Non-Personally Identifiable Information**

Because some Information (e.g., Non-Personally Identifiable Information) does not personally identify you, we may use it (and share with Member Hotels and other third parties) for any purpose, including to facilitate your ongoing access to and use of our Sites, to better tailor our services to suit personal interests, and/or to analyze visiting patterns. We and our service providers may collect such Information from sources such as environmental variables, including computer type (Windows or Macintosh), screen resolution, OS version, Internet browser and Internet browser version.

We may also collect such Information from sources such as "cookies" and so-called "pixel tags," "web beacons," "clear GIFs" and other similar technologies, and may engage third party tracking and advertising providers to act on Vantage's behalf to track and analyze your usage of our Sites through the use of such technologies. These third parties collect and share with us, as we may request, Site usage information about visits to our Sites, measure and research the effectiveness of our advertisements, track page usage and paths followed during visits through our Sites, help us target and track use of our Internet banner advertisements on our Sites and on other sites, and track use of other links from our marketing partners' sites to our Sites.

If you do not want Information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to automatically decline cookies, or to be given the choice of declining or accepting the transfer of a particular cookie, or cookies from a particular website, to your computer. Please be aware, however, that some functionality on the Sites may not work if cookies are disabled. To learn more about cookies, please visit <http://www.allaboutcookies.org/>. We also collect Information (e.g., interests, geographic location, etc.) when you voluntarily provide this information to us. Additionally, we may aggregate Information in a manner such that the end-product does not personally identify you or any other user of the Sites, for example, by using Information to calculate the percentage of our users who are from a particular geographic location.

In instances where Non-Personally Identifiable Information is combined with Personally Identifiable Information (such as combining your name with your geographical location), the combined information will be treated by us as Personally Identifiable Information.

**IP Addresses**  
Your IP Address is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). This number is identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever users visit the Sites, along with the time(s) of such visit(s) and the page(s) that were visited. Collecting IP Addresses is standard practice on the Internet and is done automatically by many web sites. We use IP Addresses for purposes such as calculating Sites usage levels, helping diagnose server problems and administering the Sites. Please note that we treat IP Addresses, server log files and related information as Non-Personally Identifiable Information, except when we are required to do otherwise under applicable law.

**Third Party Sites**  
The Sites may contain links to third party web sites. These linked sites (including, without limitation, the independent web sites of Member Hotels) are not under Vantage's control and we are not responsible for the privacy practices or the contents of any such linked site, or any link contained in any linked site. We provide such links only as a convenience, and the inclusion of a link on the Sites does not imply endorsement of the linked site by Vantage. If you provide any Information through any such third party web site, your transaction will occur on such third party's web site (not on the Sites) and the Information you provide will be collected by, and controlled by, the privacy policy of that third party. PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS POLICY DOES NOT ADDRESS THE PRIVACY OR INFORMATION PRACTICES OF ANY THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, MEMBER HOTELS AND AFFILIATE ORGANIZATIONS.

**Security**  
Vantage believes that we have implemented security measures that provide reasonable precautions against the unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction of Information. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or data storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Please do not send us credit card information or other sensitive information through e-mail or any undesignated area (such as, for example, submission of your credit card number in a "comment" field). If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), you must immediately notify us of the problem as set forth below in this Policy (note that if you choose to notify us via physical mail, this will delay the time it takes for us to respond to the problem).

**Opt-Out**  
If you change your mind, and no longer wish to receive marketing-related e-mails from us and on a go-forward basis, or if you would prefer that we do not share your Information on a go-forward basis with Member Hotels and/or with other third parties (other than Vantage service providers), you may opt-out of receiving such marketing-related e-mails or from such sharing by contacting us as set forth below in this Policy. 

Please keep in mind that if Vantage cannot disclose your Information to Member Hotels and/or third parties, we may be unable to provide you with all or certain reservation services, other services or membership-program-related benefits (e.g., earning of reward points with such companies) or such services may not be delivered as quickly or not at all. 

We will endeavor to comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable. Please note that if you opt-out as described above, we will not be able to remove your Information from the databases of Member Hotels or other third parties with which we have already shared your Information. 

**Access Rights**  
We take reasonable steps to ensure that the Information we use is accurate, complete and current to the extent necessary for the purposes for which we use the Information. Vantage will make all corrections and/or deletions of erroneous Information brought to its attention within a reasonable time period and as required by applicable data privacy regulations. We may need to retain certain information for recordkeeping purposes, and there may also be residual information that will remain within our databases and other records, which will not be removed therefrom. Finally, we are not responsible for removing or suppressing information from the databases of Member Hotels and other third parties with whom we have already shared your Information, or for limiting their use of your Information.

**Retention Period**  
Vantage only collects the Information that it believes is necessary to perform the services that you seek from Vantage and to comply with its obligations as otherwise outline in this Policy. We will keep your Information only as long as we need it for the purposes for which we collected it, or as permitted by law.

**Note Regarding the Use of the Sites by Children**  
The Sites are not directed to individuals under the age of thirteen (13), and we request that such individuals do not provide Information through the Sites.

**Jurisdictional Issues**  
Vantage does not represent or warrant that the Sites or any part thereof is appropriate or available for use in any particular jurisdiction. Those who choose to access the Sites do so on their own initiative and at their own risk, and are responsible for complying with all local laws, rules and regulations. We may limit the Sites' availability, in whole or in part, to any person, geographic area or jurisdiction we choose, at any time and in our sole discretion. By submitting any Information to us, you consent to the transfer of Information to other countries, which may provide a different level of data security than in your country of residence.
