	  <p><strong>Use of Cookies or Similar Technologies on Our Website</strong><br>
		When you visit our website, we collect information in order to service your accounts, save you time and better respond to your needs.  A "cookie" is a small piece of information that a website transfers to the hard drive of a visitor's computer for record-keeping purposes. Traditional browser based cookies or a Flash cookie (Shared Object) may be used.   We use "<a href="http://www10.americanexpress.com/sif/cda/component/0,,128685,00.asp#C">cookie</a>" technology to collect site statistical information and improve your customer experience. They provide visitors a personalized experience on our site by enabling us to determine unique preferences and trends based on visits to our website and to other websites. However, none of this information is associated with you as an individual and is measured only in aggregate. Cookies set by  the American Express Network do not capture any personally identifiable information, such as your individual e-mail address. </p>
		<p>We also automatically collect some statistical data as you browse this website. For example, we automatically collect a number that is assigned to your computer automatically and required for using the Internet (your "<a href="http://www10.americanexpress.com/sif/cda/component/0,,128685,00.asp#IA">IP address</a>"), which is used to connect your computer to the Internet, browser type and version, operating system and platform, average time spent on our site, pages viewed, information searched for, access times, information that users generate as they move from page to page and click on items within a website ("clickstream data"), and other relevant information about your online experience.  Note that clickstream data is usually stored in log files and Website designers use it to improve users' experiences with a site.</p>
		<p>You may browse our Website anonymously by choosing not to provide us with any "<a href="http://www10.americanexpress.com/sif/cda/component/0,,128685,00.asp#PII">personally identifiable information (PII)</a>," or by choosing not to register during your visits to our sites.  PII is individually identifiable data about a consumer collected online from you and maintained by us, including name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, any other identifier that permits the physical or online contacting of an individual, and information collected from the user in combination with another identifier. When you browse this way, we will not link your online activity with the accounts you may have with us. </p>
		<p>The American Express Network may use "<a href="http://www10.americanexpress.com/sif/cda/component/0,,128685,00.asp#WB">Web beacons</a>" to present offers on AmexNetwork.com, other sites on which  The American Express Network advertises, or in our e-mails. Web beacons, also known as "clear GIFs" (a common format for image files), are invisible files located on webpages that you visit. They are often used in combination with a "cookie" to track navigation of a site. If you visit a page on  AmexNetwork.com that contains a Web beacon, it communicates with your computer to determine, among other things, whether you have been to that page before or viewed a particular advertisement. This enables us to enhance e-mail offers and track website usage. We sometimes use entities that performs business operations on behalf of  the American Express Network, such as: statement printing, mailing services, data processing, customer servicing, or collections ("<a href="http://www10.americanexpress.com/sif/cda/component/0,,128685,00.asp#V">vendors</a>") and  or merchants with whom we conduct transactions on your behalf, co-marketers, and providers of loyalty campaigns ("<a href="http://www10.americanexpress.com/sif/cda/component/0,,128685,00.asp#BP">business partners</a>") to manage web beacons and the data they collect; however, Web beacons do not capture your individual e-mail address or any other personal information that you enter on the the American Express Network website. </p>
		<p>Web beacons are sometimes used on AmexNetwork.com webpages where transactions take place. In addition, e-mail offers that we send may contain web beacons to help us record response rates and to assist us in measuring the offer's effectiveness.</p>

	  </p><h3>How We Safeguard Information</h3>
		<p><strong>We use reasonable administrative, technical and physical measures to safeguard your personal information.</strong></p>
			<a href="#3a">Site Security Features</a><br>
			<a href="#3b">Selected Business Partners</a><br>
			<a href="#3c">Linking to Other Internet Sites</a>
		<p></p>

		<a name="3a"></a>
		<p><strong>Site Security Features</strong><br>
		<em>SSL Technology and how you benefit from it</em><br>
		We realize how important security is to you, so we've taken a number of steps to enhance the protection of personal information sent to or from our site over the internet. This includes Card and other account information. First, we require that a "secure session" be established, using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) Technology. This is done any time you supply or access personal information in one of our secure online areas. </p>
		<p>SSL Technology creates a private conversation that only your computer and our site can understand. The SSL Technology encodes information as it is being sent over the internet between your computer and our site, helping to ensure that the transmitted information remains confidential.</p>
		<p>The use of SSL requires two components: an SSL-compatible browser and a Web server to perform the "key-exchange" that establishes a secure connection to The American Express Network Web server systems.</p>
		<p>The technological requirements needed to benefit from SSL Technology:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>A Compliant Browser<br>
				In order to securely access your personal information via the internet, you will need a browser with SSL capabilities. We recommend you use the latest browser versions available to ensure you have a browser with SSL capabilities. Examples of SSL browsers include Netscape 2.0 and above, Microsoft's Internet Explorer 2.0 and above, and the Web browser for America Online version 3.0 for Windows and above. (Note that some older versions of browsers will not support SSL sessions and some older versions of browsers are not JavaScript-enabled, which means that you may not be able to view all the features on the website). If you don't already have a JavaScript-enabled browser with SSL capabilities, you can download an SSL and JavaScript-enabled browser from any of the links below.
				<ul>
					<li><a href="http://www.aol.com">AOL</a></li>
					<li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/default.mspx">Internet Explorer</a></li>
					<li><a href="http://browser.netscape.com/ns8/">Netscape Navigator</a></li>
					<li><a href="http://www.mozilla.com/">Firefox</a></li>
				</ul>
				<br>
			</li>
			<li>A Compliant Internet Service Provider<br>
				Nearly all Internet Service Providers (ISPs) automatically enable the SSL session described above. If you use your company's internal connection to access the internet and you find you cannot access the secure pages on our site with an SSL browser described above, your company may be blocking access via a "firewall." Please speak to your firm's internet access systems administrator for further details on your network's internet access.
				<br><br>
			</li>
			<li>Enabled Cookies<br>
				You also must have enabled cookies on your browser in order to access personal information. If you have chosen to disable cookies on your browser, you will not be able to access your personal information.
				<br><br>
			</li>
		</ol>

		<p><em>User ID and Password</em><br>
		Some areas of our site may require the use of a User ID and Password as an additional security measure that helps protect your personal information. This allows us to verify who you are, thereby allowing you access to your account information, and preventing unauthorized access. When you log off such an area, make sure you always click on the red "Exit Secure Area" or "Log Out" link which appears on the left-hand side of every secure page. When you click on it, you will be given the option to end your secure session. No further secure transactions can be conducted without re-entering your User ID and Password.  </p>

		<p><em>Services</em><br>
		This section is where you load on your information, e.g. name, address, email address You should be aware that browser software often "caches" a page as you look at it, meaning that some pages are saved in your computer's temporary memory. Therefore, you may find that clicking on your "Back" button shows you a saved version of a previously viewed page. Caching in no way affects the security of your confidential User ID or Password. If you use a computer in a public place to access your account information, simply quit/exit the browser software before leaving to minimize the possibility of anyone else viewing your personal information. </p>

		<p><strong>Selected Business Partners</strong><br>
		In order to bring you the many online products and services offered on AmexNetwork.com, we work with carefully selected vendors and business partners. If we have to share any information with these companies in order to provide a product or service to you, we first conduct a careful evaluation of their information and security systems and practices, and require reasonable administrative, technical, and physical measures to safeguard the personal information of holders of American Express-branded cards. We may audit our partners and vendors to verify the continued security of their systems and practices. </p>
		<p class="backToTop"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

		<a name="3c"></a>
		<p><strong>Linking to Other Internet Sites</strong><br>
		You should be aware that other internet sites that you link to from the website or The American Express Network e-mail may contain privacy provisions that differ from the provisions of our Privacy Statement. To ensure your privacy is protected, we recommend that you review the privacy statements of other internet sites you visit.</p>
