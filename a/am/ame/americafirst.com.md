#### What kind of security is being used for Web Access Home Banking? 

America First Credit Union uses the latest technology to protect your account information from exposure to unauthorized persons. Below are some of the components of this security system:

  * An account number and PIN are required to access the system. 
  * 128-bit encryption scrambles your transmissions when crossing the Internet. 
  * After entering a PIN incorrectly three times, access to an account is blocked. 



VeriSign, the recognized leader in Internet security, allows you to see the security features of the Web Access home banking program before you use it.

Your are responsible for protecting the secrecy of your PIN in accordance with the terms contained in your Membership Account Agreement. We recommend you not store secured pages in your cache or leave your computer unattended while you are logged into Web Access. 

#### What is encryption?

Encryption takes meaningful text and numbers and scrambles them into numerical nonsense before transmitting them across the Internet. Your account information becomes "all mixed up and nonsense" when encryption is in place. For example, "pay $40 from checking to loan #1" could become something like "752144835628174317312". 

The encryption process occurs for information going both directions - from your computer to the credit union and vice versa. Encryption uses complex algorithmic formulas to create a key that is used to translate the nonsense back to "pay $40 from checking to loan #1". There are billions of potential keys, and a different key is used for each Web Access session. Your computer and America First's computer establish this key when they make your Web Access connection. 

Because there are billions of potential keys, it would take a thief several lifetimes to come up with the exact key a specific transmission uses. Netscape estimates the basic level of encryption (40-bit or international) would take a 64-MIPS computer a year of dedicated processor time to break. Domestic, or 128-bit, encryption is exponentially more difficult to break. Web Access supports only 128-bit encryption to give you Internet services with your security in mind.

#### Why does Web Access set cookies?

Why does Web Access set cookies? In order to better serve you and protect your account information, we use "cookies," nuggets of data that are stored on your hard drive as a file. We use cookies to verify who you are while using Web Access home banking. Cookies make it easier, quicker, and more secure for you to log into and use Web Access.

Cookies do not compromise privacy. Their data is usually stored on your computer's hard drive as a file or folder called "cookies," and you can delete this file anytime if you choose. The cookies in Web Access are only valid for the current session and shortly become invalid. Finally, cookies created by one site will only work with that specific site. Site A, for example, cannot read cookies generated by Site B and then use that information for purposes for which it was not intended. America First's express policy is to use cookies only for your account security while using Web Access.
