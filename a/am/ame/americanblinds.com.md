When you place an order or register on our site, we require you to provide your name, e-mail address, mailing address, phone number, and credit card information (when ordering products only). We may also require you to create a username and password. This allows us to keep a user profile so that we may customize preferences for each user, as well as provide a more efficient method for users to submit information to americanblinds.com when placing an order or a request for product information. When you order a product and/or register, we also give you the option of submitting personal information such as your phone number, gender, date of birth, and/or other information. This allows us to know you better and possibly tailor any specific features, promotions, or other notifications to you. When registering with our site, you are also given a choice whether you would like to be on our mailing list, or whether you would prefer to opt-out and not receive such mailings. When you enter a contest or other promotional feature at our site, we may again ask for your name, address, username and password so that we are able to better administer the contest and notify winners.
