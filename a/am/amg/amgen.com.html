		  Amgen Inc. and Amgen USA Inc. (collectively "Amgen," We" or "Our") are committed to respecting your privacy. Because facts about a person's demographic, health, health interests, and health care are private and sensitive, we know that you may have concerns about sharing information with us. This Privacy Policy is designed to answer your important 
            questions about privacy, whether you are a consumer looking for health 
            information, or a health care provider mining the experience of Amgen to 
            refine your expertise in meeting the needs of your patients. 
			<br><br>
            <span class="textBold">If you are a consumer</span>, you'll want to know 
              how we use the information you provide when you register with us 
              as a site user or when you participate in activities on our site, 
              and how we protect this information from unauthorized use or disclosure.
            <br><br> 
            <span class="textBold">If you are a health care professional</span>, 
              you'll want to know what steps we take to protect the sensitive 
              data you may choose to share with us, and how we use information 
              you provide about yourself and your professional services.
            <br><br> 
            <span class="textBold">We urge all users of our site to read this 
              Privacy Policy to learn more about the policies and practices that 
              we have developed to safeguard personal and health information, 
              and to better understand our relationships with the third parties 
              who may have access to this information.</span> 
			<ol type="I" class="text">
			  <li><span class="textBold">Information We Collect</span>
				<br><br>
				We have access to the following categories of information regarding 
				you and your visit to our website. Only some of these categories 
				of information identify you directly, but each category offers 
				some information about your interests and activities that could 
				be used to make inferences about you. The next section of this 
				policy describes how Amgen uses the information we collect.
				<br><br>
				<ul class="text">
				  <li>Information That You Voluntarily Provide 
					<br><br>
					Site Registration. We have constructed this website 
					so that you may visit us and review information about the 
					services we offer without revealing your identity or volunteering 
					any personally identifying information. If you register to 
					use the website's features and services, either as a consumer or a 
					health care professional, we will collect "personally identifying 
					information" from you. Personally identifying information 
					is information such as name, address, telephone number, and 
					e-mail address that could be used to contact you. When this 
					information is combined with any information on your health 
					or medical status (pursuant to all applicable laws), we refer to the resulting information as "health-related personal information." 
					<br><br>
					Interactive Services. If you choose to participate 
					in our interactive services such as questionnaires and surveys, 
					you may disclose health-related information as well as personal 
					facts that could be used to identify you or your family members. 
					Providers who use our benchmarking services and quality of 
					care assessments may choose to disclose facts about their 
					practice and patients that are extremely sensitive, personal 
					data. We do not request or require you to disclose personally 
					identifying information in these forums, but apart from warning 
					you to be prudent in your statements, we do not have the ability 
					to keep you from disclosing private facts.
					<br><br>
					Correspondence with Amgen. You may use our site to 
					ask questions or report problems regarding our products to 
					healthcare professionals hired by Amgen to address consumers' 
					and health care professionals' questions regarding use of 
					our products. If you communicate with or request information 
					from Amgen personnel, they will have your e-mail address as well 
					as whatever health-related and/or personal facts you chose 
					to include in your e-mail. If you are reporting a product experience, 
					we may ask you for specific facts, including patient initials, 
					age, and gender, and prescribing physician. Federal regulations 
					require us to collect patient-identifiable information in 
					order to file reports with the Federal Food and Drug Administration 
					regarding the safety of our products.
					<br><br>
					</li>
				  <li>Information That Is Routinely Collected By Our Site Technology: 
				  	<br><br>
					IP Address. We record the Internet Protocol (IP) address 
					of your computer when you visit our site. Without more, the 
					IP address does not identify you personally, but it is what 
					allows us to maintain communications with you as you move 
					about our site.
					<br><br>
					Cookies. We also collect information about your 
					use of our site through cookies and similar technology. A 
					"cookie" is a unique numeric code that we transfer to your 
					computer so that we can keep track of your interests and preferences 
					and recognize you as a return visitor to our site. Cookie 
					technology allows us to collect "clickstream" data, which 
					is not personally identifying information, but which reflects 
					your activities on the site, including your interest in certain 
					health care conditions. A cookie does not collect or keep 
					your name or other personal identifying information, but when 
					you revisit our site the cookie allows us to bring you the 
					content and features likely to be of greatest interest to 
					you based on your previous activities on our site.
					<br><br>
					DoubleClick. We use third-party 
					  advertising companies to serve ads on other websites. These 
					  companies may use information (not including your name, 
					  address e-mail, address, or telephone number) about your 
					  visits to this and other web sites in order to measure advertising 
					  effectiveness and to provide advertisements about goods 
					  and services of interest to you. If you would like more 
					  information about this practice and to know your choices 
					  about not having this information used by these companies, 
					  <a href="http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy/default.asp" target="new" class="dynLink" id="dynLink">click here</a>.
				  </li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<br>
			  <li><span class="textBold">How We Use Your Information</span> 
				<br><br>
				Whether you are a consumer or a health care professional, we use 
				the information about your use of the services and activities 
				on our websites to monitor user traffic patterns and try to analyze 
				what our users prefer so that we can design better services for 
				you. The personally identifying information and health-related 
				personal information that you provide may be used to create customized 
				offers, information, and services tailored to your interests and 
				preferences. 
				<br><br>
				Personally Identifying Information. You do not have to 
				register to use most of the information and services available 
				for consumers on our websites. If you choose to register, we 
				will use the personally identifying information you give us to 
				send you an e-mail confirming your registration with our site and 
				to respond to questions from you. Upon your request, we may also, from time to time, 
				send you e-mail with special promotions or newsletters with information 
				that we think may be of interest to you. 
				<br><br>
				Health-Related Information. If you choose to participate 
				in our interactive services, we will collect the information you 
				may choose to disclose and analyze it to discover new facts that 
				could help us better understand how our products are used in coping 
				with the diseases for which they are marketed. 
				<br><br>
				We may offer interactive services such as health questionnaires 
				and care management tools that ask you to furnish health-related 
				information about you or your family. The information you disclose 
				and provide in interactive services may be linked (pursuant to all applicable laws) with the personally 
				identifying information you may choose to provide elsewhere on 
				our site to provide us with personally identifying information 
				about your health and health care. We may combine your health-related 
				information with that from other site users to create summary 
				data that we will use for our business purposes, including research 
				to improve our products and analyses that may help us better market 
				our products. <br>
				<br>
				Product Reports. If you contact Amgen regarding your experience 
				in using one of our products, we may use the information you provide 
				in submitting reports to the Federal Food and Drug Administration, 
				and as otherwise required of us by law. We also may use the information 
				to contact the prescribing physician to follow up regarding an 
				unexpected event involving use of our product. <br>
				<br>
				IP Address. In addition to using the Internet Protocol 
				(IP) address of your computer to maintain communications with 
				you as you move about our site, we also may use your IP address 
				to personalize content provided on the website. We retain IP 
				addresses, and we retain them together with personally identifying 
				information. <br>
				<br>
				Cookies. We use the data we obtain through the use 
				of cookies to customize your site experience by anticipating the 
				information and services that may be of interest to you. We also 
				analyze the information collected with cookie technology to help 
				us improve the functioning of our site by monitoring traffic in 
				popular areas and to modify the services and information we provide 
				to meet customer demand. We will link the clickstream data available 
				to us through the use of cookies to the personally identifiable 
				information and health-related information that you may choose 
				to provide elsewhere on our site. We use the information we collect 
				through the use of cookies for our business purposes, including 
				operation of our site, as well as research and product analyses 
				to help us better market our products. <br>
				<br>
				Law Enforcement. In certain limited circumstances, Amgen 
				may be called upon to release your personal information in response 
				to a court order, subpoena, search warrant, law, or regulation. 
				We plan to cooperate in responding to such requests, taking 
				appropriate measures to ensure that the requester understands 
				the sensitive nature of the health-related personal information 
				that they may receive. We also reserves the right to cooperate 
				with law enforcement authorities in investigating and prosecuting 
				users who violate our rules or engage in behavior that is illegal 
				or harmful to other websites.
				</li>
				<br><br>
			  <li> <span class="textBold">Our Relationship to Third Parties</span> 
				<br><br>
				We may use third parties to provide services and information 
				on our site and we may provide some co-branded services in partnership 
				with others. We also may use third parties to analyze data collected 
				on our site. We will not disclose your personally identifying 
				information or health-related personal information to anyone other 
				than Amgen employees and those third parties with whom we have 
				a business relationship. If we allow a third party contractor 
				to have access to your personally identifying information, we 
				will not authorize them to take it or use it for any purpose that 
				is not consistent with this privacy policy. <br>
				<br>
				<span class="textBold">We pledge that we will not sell or disclose 
				any personally identifying information or health-related personal 
				information you provide on our site to an unrelated third party 
				without your express permission, except as explained below:</span> 
				<br><br>
				<ul>
				  <li class="text"><span class="textBold">Cookies.</span> 
					We do not allow other sites or third parties to use our 
					cookies for their own purposes or to place their own cookies 
					on your computer when you access services through our site. 
					<br><br>
				  </li>
				  <li class="text"><span class="textBold">Vendors and Suppliers.</span> 
					We have relationships with different vendors and suppliers 
					who help us design and maintain our systems and our computer 
					security, respond to e-mail and customer inquiries, analyze our data and create 
					special promotions. We will not authorize our vendors and 
					suppliers to use our customer information for any purpose 
					not related to Amgen's joint business operation. <br>
					<br>
				  </li>
				  <li class="text"><span class="textBold">Co-branded Sites.</span> 
					We will partner with other companies to provide you with 
					content or services on a joint or "co-branded" basis. At a 
					co-branded site you will see both the Amgen logo and the logo 
					of the co-branded partner displayed on your screen. To access 
					the services available on a co-branded site you may have to 
					complete a new on-line registration form, and this registration 
					information may be shared with Amgen's co-branded partners. 
					<span class="textBold">You should read the individual privacy 
					policies of our co-branded partners, as these may differ in 
					some respects from ours.</span> 
					Reading these policies will help you to make an informed decision 
					about whether to provide your information to a given site. 
					Remember, you may always opt-out of sharing your information 
					with a partner site by choosing not to use the service or 
					content provided by the co-branded site. </li>

				<span class="textBold">Other Important Information About Our Relationship 
				With Third Parties</span>
				<br><br>
				<ul>
				  <li class="text"><span class="textBold">Links to Other Sites.</span> 
					We also feature links to websites that we believe you

					that we do not endorse or recommend these sites' content 
					or services, and we are not responsible for the privacy 
					practices of these other sites. We encourage you to be aware 
					of and read the privacy policy of each site you visit. <span class="textBold">Remember,

				  <li class="text"><span class="textBold">Advertisers.</span>

			  <li><span class="textBold">Our Children's Policy</span>
				<br><br>
				Amgen's website content and services are intended for adult users 
				over the age of 13. The site is not designed to attract child 
				users. If we learn that an under-13 user has volunteered personal 
				or health-related information on our site, or that a provider 
				has volunteered information about a patient who is identified 
				as younger than 13, we will delete such information from our active 
				databases in accordance with our deletion policy, which is described

				provide the requested information. You may always choose not to 
				provide the requested information. <br>
				<br>
				<ul>
				  <li><span class="textBold">Receive E-mail.</span> 
					When you register with our site, you will be given the option 
					of requesting to receive e-mail with information we think you might 
					find useful, including promotions, announcements of new services 
					and products, and newsletters on particular health topics. 
					If you decide, at any later time, that you no longer wish

					*Deletion Policy. The information that you provide Amgen is 
					stored in servers that are operated and maintained by Amgen 
					and third parties under contract with Amgen. Website users 
					should be aware that it is not technologically possible to 
					remove from our servers each and every record of the information 
					you have provided to Amgen. The need to back-up our 
					systems to protect information from inadvertent loss means 
					that a copy of information about you or your health-related 
					interests may exist in a non-erasable form that will be difficult 
					or impossible for us to locate. Nevertheless, we promise that 
					upon receiving your request, Amgen will delete all personal 
					and/or health-related personal information stored in the databases 
					Amgen actively uses for research and daily business activities, 
					or stored in other readily searchable media. In addition, 
					we will use commercially reasonable efforts not to disclose 
					any personal information stored in a non-erasable format after 
					receiving your request for removal, except as required by 
					law.

					<span class="textBold">Please be aware that Amgen may not comply

				<br><br>
				We want your personal information to remain as secure as reasonably

				health and health care with our researchers.</li>
				<br><br>
				<ul>
				  <li> <span class="textBold">Data Security.</span> We 
					use encryption practices to help insure the integrity and 
					privacy of some of the personal and health related personal 
					information you provide to us. As an added security precaution, 
					all personal and/or health related personal information is 
					kept physically behind firewalls that meet or exceed industry 
					standards to prevent intruders from gaining access. Although 
					we will make reasonable efforts to protect personal and/or 
					health-related personal information from loss, misuse, or 
					alteration by third parties, you should be aware that there 
					is always some risk that an unauthorized third party could 
					intercept an Internet transmission, or that thieves will find 
					a way to thwart our security systems.</li>

			  <li><span class="textBold">Changes in Our Privacy Policy</span>
			  <br><br>
				We will only use personal information in the manner described 
				in the Privacy Policy in effect when the information was collected 
				from you. However, we reserve the right to change the terms of 
				this Privacy Policy at any time by posting revisions to our site. 
				If at any point, we decide to use personally identifiable information 
				in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, 
				we will notify users by e-mail to the extent that we have your 
				e-mail address. You will be given the choice at that time to "opt-in" 
				for any additional uses or disclosures of your personally identifiable 
				information that you made available to us prior to the change 
				in our policy.</li>
