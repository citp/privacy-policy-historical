				<br>
				We have access to the following categories of information regarding 
				you and your visit to our Web site. Only some of these categories 
				of information identify you directly, but each category offers 
				some information about your interests and activities that could 
				be used to make inferences about you. The next section of this 
				policy describes how Amgen uses the information we collect. <br>
				<br>
				</span> 
				<ul class="text">
				  <li><span class="text">Information That You Voluntarily Provide 
					<br>
					<br>
					<u>Site Registration</u>: Amgen has constructed this website 
					so that you may visit us and review information about the 
					services we offer without revealing your identity or volunteering 
					any personally identifying information. If you register to 
					use Amgen features and services, either as a consumer or a 
					health care professional, we will collect "personally identifying 
					information" from you. Personally identifying information 
					is information such as name, address, telephone number, and 
					email address that could be used to contact you. When this 
					information is combined with any information on your health 
					or medical status, we refer to the resulting information as 
					"health-related personal information." <br>
					<br>
					<u>Interactive Services</u>: If you choose to participate 
					in our interactive services such as questionnaires and surveys, 
					you may disclose health-related information as well as personal 
					facts that could be used to identify you or your family members. 
					Providers who use our benchmarking services and quality of 
					care assessments may choose to disclose facts about their 
					practice and patients that are extremely sensitive, personal 
					data. Amgen does not request or require you to disclose personally 
					identifying information in these forums, but apart from warning 
					you to be prudent in your statements, we do not have the ability 
					to keep you from disclosing private facts. <br>
					<br>
					<u>Correspondence with Amgen</u>. You may use our site to 
					ask questions or report problems regarding our products to 
					healthcare professionals hired by Amgen to address consumers' 
					and health care professionals' questions regarding use of 
					our products. If you communicate with or request information 
					from our personnel, they will have your email address as well 
					as whatever health-related and/or personal facts you chose 
					to include in your email. If you are reporting a product experience, 
					we may ask you for specific facts, including patient initials, 
					age, and gender, and prescribing physician. Federal regulations 
					require us to collect patient-identifiable information in 
					order to file reports with the Federal Food and Drug Administration 
					regarding the safety of our products. <br>
					<br>
					</span></li>
				  <li><span class="text">Information That Is Routinely Collected 
					By Our Site Technology: <br>
					<br>
					<u>IP Address</u>. We record the Internet Protocol (IP) address 
					of your computer when you visit our site. Without more, the 
					IP address does not identify you personally, but it is what 
					allows us to maintain communications with you as you move 
					about our site. <br>
					<br>
					<u>Cookies</u>. Amgen also collects information about your 
					use of our site through cookies and similar technology. A 
					"cookie" is a unique numeric code that we transfer to your 
					computer so that we can keep track of your interests and preferences 
					and recognize you as a return visitor to our site. Cookie 
					technology allows us to collect "clickstream" data, which 
					is not personally identifying information, but which reflects 
					your activities on the site, including your interest in certain 
					health care conditions. A cookie does not collect or keep 
					your name or other personal identifying information, but when 
					you revisit our site the cookie allows us to bring you the 
					content and features likely to be of greatest interest to 
					you based on your previous activities on our site. </span> 
					<p><span class="text"><u>DoubleClick</u>. Amgen uses third-party 
					  advertising companies to serve ads on other web sites. These 
					  companies may use information (not including your name, 
					  address email, address, or telephone number) about your 
					  visits to this and other web sites in order to measure advertising 
					  effectiveness and to provide advertisements about goods 
					  and services of interest to you. If you would like more

				<br>
				<br>
				Whether you are a consumer or a health care professional, we use 
				the information about your use of the services and activities 
				on our Web sites to monitor user traffic patterns and try to analyze 
				what our users prefer so that we can design better services for 
				you. The personally identifying information and health-related 
				personal information that you provide may be used to create customized 
				offers, information, and services tailored to your interests and 
				preferences. <br>
				<br>
				<u>Personally Identifying Information</u>. You do not have to 
				register to use most of the information and services available 
				for consumers on our Web sites. If you choose to register, we 
				will use the personally identifying information you give us to 
				send you an email confirming your registration with our site and 
				to respond to questions from you. We may also, from time to time, 
				send you email with special promotions or newsletters with information 
				that we think may be of interest to you. <br>
				<br>
				<u>Health-Related Information</u>. If you choose to participate 
				in our interactive services, we will collect the information you 
				may choose to disclose and analyze it to discover new facts that 
				could help us better understand how our products are used in coping 
				with the diseases for which they are marketed. <br>
				<br>
				We may offer interactive services such as health questionnaires 
				and care management tools that ask you to furnish health-related 
				information about you or your family. The information you disclose 
				and provide in interactive services may be linked with the personally 
				identifying information you may choose to provide elsewhere on 
				our site to provide us with personally identifying information 
				about your health and health care. We may combine your health-related 
				information with that from other site users to create summary 
				data that we will use for our business purposes, including research 
				to improve our products and analyses that may help us better market 
				our products. <br>
				<br>
				<u>Product Reports</u>. If you contact Amgen regarding your experience 
				in using one of our products, we may use the information you provide 
				in submitting reports to the Federal Food and Drug Administration, 
				and as otherwise required of us by law. We also may use the information 
				to contact the prescribing physician to follow up regarding an 
				unexpected event involving use of our product. <br>
				<br>
				<u>IP Address</u>. In addition to using the Internet Protocol 
				(IP) address of your computer to maintain communications with 
				you as you move about our site, we also may use your IP address 
				to personalize content provided on the Web site. We retain IP 
				addresses, and we retain them together with personally identifying 
				information. <br>
				<br>
				<u>Cookies</u>. Amgen uses the data we obtain through the use 
				of cookies to customize your site experience by anticipating the 
				information and services that may be of interest to you. We also 
				analyze the information collected with cookie technology to help 
				us improve the functioning of our site by monitoring traffic in 
				popular areas and to modify the services and information we provide 
				to meet customer demand. We will link the clickstream data available 
				to us through the use of cookies to the personally identifiable 
				information and health-related information that you may choose 
				to provide elsewhere on our site. We use the information we collect 
				through the use of cookies for our business purposes, including 
				operation of our site, as well as research and product analyses 
				to help us better market our products. <br>
				<br>
				<u>Law Enforcement</u>. In certain limited circumstances, Amgen 
				may be called upon to release your personal information in response 
				to a court order, subpoena, search warrant, law, or regulation. 
				Amgen plans to cooperate in responding to such requests, taking 
				appropriate measures to ensure that the requester understands 
				the sensitive nature of the health-related personal information 
				that they may receive. Amgen also reserves the right to cooperate 
				with law enforcement authorities in investigating and prosecuting 
				users who violate our rules or engage in behavior that is illegal 
				or harmful to other Amgen users. <br>
