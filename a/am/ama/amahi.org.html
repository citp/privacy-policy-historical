	<h1>Our Privacy Policy</h1>

	<h2>In Short</h2>

	<p>Your privacy is very important to us.</p>
	
	<p>Your privacy and personally-identifying information
	(email, and any personally-identifiable information that is not
	publicly available on the site) will not be shared without your
	explicit permission, or unless required to operate our services
	or comply by law.</p>
	
	<p>We will only ask for information that is truly needed to give you a better service.</p>

	<p>Please go on to the actual details of the policy.</p>

	<p><a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/">
	<img border="0" align="right" alt="Creative Commons License" src="http://creativecommons.org/images/public/somerights20.png"></a>
	We've decided to adopt the Privacy Policy adapted from our friends at <a href="http://wordpress.com">wordpress.com</a>, which they graciously
	made available under a Creative Commons
	Sharealike license.</p>

	<h2>Amahi Privacy Policy</h2>

	<p>	Amahi Inc. (“<strong>Amahi</strong>”) operates
	several websites including 
	<a href="http://www.amahi.org/">amahi.org</a> and subdomains (blog,
	wiki, etc.). It is Amahi’s policy to respect your privacy
	regarding any information we may collect while operating our
	websites.</p>

	<h3>Website Visitors</h3>
	<p>Like most website operators, Amahi collects
	non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web
	browsers and servers typically make available, such as the
	browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date
	and time of each visitor request. Amahi's purpose in collecting
	non-personally identifying information is to better understand
	how Amahi's visitors use its website. From time to time, Amahi
	may release non-personally-identifying information in the
	aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of
	its website.</p>

	<p>	Amahi also collects potentially
	personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP)
	addresses. Amahi does not use such information to identify its
	visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other
	than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses
	personally-identifying information, as described below.</p>

	<h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>

	<p>	Certain visitors to Amahi’s websites choose to
	interact with Amahi in ways that require Amahi to gather
	personally-identifying information. The amount and type of
	information that Amahi gathers depends on the nature of the
	interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for an account
	at <a href="http://www.amahi.org/">amahi.org</a> to provide a
	username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with
	Amahi – by purchasing services, for example – will be asked to
	provide additional information, including as necessary the
	personal and financial information required to process those
	transactions. In each case, Amahi collects such information only
	insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of
	the visitor’s interaction with Amahi. Amahi does not disclose
	personally-identifying information other than as described below.
	And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying
	information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from
	engaging in certain website- and service-related activities.</p>

	<h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>
	<p>	Amahi may collect statistics about the behavior
	of visitors to its websites. Amahi may display this information
	publicly or provide it to others. However, Amahi does not
	disclose personally-identifying information other than as
	described below.</p>

	<h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>

	<p>	Amahi discloses potentially
	personally-identifying and personally-identifying information
	only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated
	organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to
	process it on Amahi’s behalf or to provide services available at
	Amahi’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to
	others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated
	organizations may be located outside of your home country; by
	using Amahi’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such
	information to them. Amahi will not rent or sell potentially
	personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to
	anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated
	organizations, as described above, Amahi discloses potentially
	personally-identifying and personally-identifying information
	only when required to do so by law, or when Amahi believes in
	good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the
	property or rights of Amahi, third parties or the public at
	large. If you are a registered user of an Amahi website and have
	supplied your email address, Amahi may occasionally send you an
	email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or
	just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Amahi and our
	products. We primarily use our blog and newsletter to
	communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this
	type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example
	via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we
	reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or
	respond to your request or to help us support other users. Amahi
	takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the
	unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of
	potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
	information.</p>

	<h3>Cookies</h3>
	<p>	A cookie is a string of information that a
	website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s
	browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns.
	Amahi uses cookies to help Amahi identify and track visitors,
	their usage of Amahi website, and their website access
	preferences. Amahi visitors who do not wish to have cookies
	placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse
	cookies before using Amahi’s websites, with the drawback that
	certain features of Amahi’s websites may not function properly
	without the aid of cookies.</p>

	<h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
	<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor,
	Amahi may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in
	Amahi’s sole discretion. Amahi encourages visitors to frequently
	check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. If you
	have a amahi.org account, you should also check your blog’s
	dashboard for alerts to these changes. Your continued use of this
	site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your
	acceptance of such change.
