**Amazon Services Privacy Notice**

Last updated: December 1, 2005

Amazon Services knows that you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly. **By visiting www.amazonservices.com, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Notice.**

**What Personal Information About Users Does Amazon Services Gather?**

The information we learn from users helps us personalize and continually improve your experience at www.amazonservices.com. Here are the types of information we gather. 

  * **Information You Give Us:** We receive and store any information you enter on our Web site or give us in any other way. Click here to see examples of what we collect. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, improving the site, and communicating with you. 
  * **Automatic Information:** We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many Web sites, we use "cookies," and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses www.amazonservices.com. Click here to see examples of the information we receive. A number of [companies](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/browse/-/501098/002-0524907-7464825) offer utilities designed to help you visit Web sites anonymously. Although we will not be able to provide you with a personalized experience at www.amazonservices.com if we cannot recognize you, we want you to be aware that these tools exist. 
  * **E-mail Communications:** To help us make e-mails more useful and interesting, we often receive a confirmation when you open e-mail from Amazon Services if your computer supports such capabilities. If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please [click here](https://web.archive.org/web/20060617073312id_/http%3A//www.amazonservices.com/site/unsubscribe.html).
  * **Information from Other Sources:** We might receive information about you from other sources and add it to our information. Click here to see examples of the information we receive. 



**What About Cookies?**

  * Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and to provide various features. 
  * The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. However, you may not be able to use certain features on this site if you do not use cookies, and we recommend that you keep them turned on.



**Does Amazon Services Share the Information It Receives?**

Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. We share customer information only as described below and with Amazon.com, Inc. and the subsidiaries it controls that either are subject to this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Notice.

  * **Use of Third Party Service Providers:** We may, from time to time, employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include sending postal mail and e-mail. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. 
  * **Promotional Offers:** Sometimes we send offers to selected groups of Amazon Services customers on behalf of other businesses. When we do this, we do not give that business your name and address. If you do not want to receive such offers,  [please click here](https://web.archive.org/web/20060617073312id_/http%3A//www.amazonservices.com/site/unsubscribe.html).
  * **Business Transfers:** As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy subsidiaries, or business units. In such transactions, user information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the user consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that Amazon Services, Inc., or substantially all of its assets are acquired, user information will of course be one of the transferred assets. 
  * **Protection of Amazon Services and Others:** We release personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our [Conditions of Use](https://web.archive.org/web/20060617073312id_/http%3A//www.amazonservices.com/site/terms.html) and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Amazon Services, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Notice. 
  * **With Your Consent:** Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about you might go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information. 



**What Choices and Access Do I Have?**

  * As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide information, even though it might be needed to request information about Amazon Services or take advantage of a feature on this site.
  * If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please [click here](https://web.archive.org/web/20060617073312id_/http%3A//www.amazonservices.com/site/unsubscribe.html). (If you do not want to receive [Conditions of Use](https://web.archive.org/web/20060617073312id_/http%3A//www.amazonservices.com/site/terms.html) and other legal notices from us, such as this Privacy Notice, those notices will still govern your use of www.amazonservices.com, and it is your responsibility to review them for changes.)
