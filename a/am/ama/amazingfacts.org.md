For example, if you personalize Amazing Facts pages, or register with Amazing Facts site or services, a cookie helps Amazing Facts to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same Amazing Facts Web site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Amazing Facts features that you customized.
