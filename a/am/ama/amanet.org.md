# AMA - Privacy Policy

## Your privacy on the Internet is important to AMA.

This Website (“Website”), located at amanet.org, including any services and features available on or through the Website such as blogs and user communities, is published and maintained by American Management Association International **** (“AMA”). AMA is referred to in this Privacy Policy as “we,” “us,” “our,” or other similar pronouns.

This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) covers AMA’s privacy practices with respect to “Personally Identifiable Information” (as further defined below) that is transmitted electronically to or collected by AMA via this Website and addresses the following items: 

  * How AMA collects and uses Personally Identifiable Information 
  * With whom AMA may share Personally Identifiable Information 
  * The choices available to you, as a Website visitor, regarding collection, use and sharing of Personally Identifiable Information 
  * The security procedures that AMA has in place for Personally Identifiable Information under our control 



By visiting this Website, and/or using the Website’s services, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy as they may be amended from time to time. As we update and expand our services, this Privacy Policy may change, so check back to this page from time to time. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into, and part of, the AMA Website Terms of Use, which governs your use of and access to this Website in general.

Advertisements displayed to you on this Website and on other sites on the Web may be customized to your interests, based on the terms that you search for on Google and the Web pages that you visit on our Website and other Websites. We work with Google to make this happen, and to do so Google places a cookie on your computer. We encourage you to read Google's privacy policy at [www.google.com/privacy_ads.html](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html) if you have any concerns about how Google will use your information. To opt-out of this, [click here](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html). Unless you opt-out, you consent to the use of cookies on your computer in this way.

**You may opt out of our sharing of your Personally Identifiable Information with third parties for marketing purposes, by following the directions in the Sharing Personally Identifiable Information.**

**Collection and Use**

AMA does not collect any Personally Identifiable Information from you except when you expressly volunteer the information. This includes when you:

  * Register for a seminar, become a Member, purchase or download an AMA product or service. 
  * Request information (electronically) about AMA’s products and services, subscribe to newsletters, or enter a promotional contest. 
  * Use or participate in various services or features made available on the Website (including, for example and without limitation, blogs and other user communities). 
  * Use various tools to select AMA products and services that are suitable for your Website visit. 
  * Request contact with an AMA sales representative. 
  * Provide AMA with comments, questions or feedback about AMA products and services or your Website experience. 



“Personally Identifiable Information” includes, for example, your name; home or business address; e-mail address; telephone, wireless and/or fax number; short message service or text message address or other wireless device address; instant messaging address; credit card and other payment information; employment information and work experience; demographic information and/or other information that may identify you as an individual or allow online or offline contact with you as an individual.

AMA will not sell, share, or rent Personally Identifiable Information other than as disclosed below in the “Sharing Personally Identifiable Information” section of this Privacy Policy. AMA does not sell, share with or rent to other e-mail addresses solely for the purpose of third party marketing, other than as disclosed below in the “Sharing Personally Identifiable Information” section of this Privacy Policy, but we may include third party advertisements within e-mails that we may send to you.

Among other things, we may use your Personally Identifiable Information to respond to your requests and inquiries and to provide you with the services and features offered on or through the Website. We may also use your Personally Identifiable Information to communicate timely information and special offers (for example, in the form of e-mails, mailings, and the like) about products, services, companies and events, sponsored by us and others, that we think might interest you **. You may choose not to receive such information by e-mailing[customerservice@amanet.org](mailto:customerservice@amanet.org) or by calling AMA Customer Service at 1-877-566-9441.** Please understand that if you choose not to receive promotional correspondence from us, we may still contact you in connection with your relationship, activities, transactions and communications with us.

If you register for a seminar or pay for products and services using a credit card, Personally Identifiable Information (such as your name and shipping address) and financial information (such as your credit card number and expiration date) may be required. This information may be used for billing purposes and to fill orders. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information may be used to get in touch with you. Personally Identifiable Information also may be collected when you apply for a position with AMA or a program sponsored by AMA. In these cases, Personally Identifiable Information is used only for the purpose of processing and evaluating the application.

The Personally Identifiable Information you give us via the Website and information about your order may be combined with other Personally Identifiable Information (such as demographic information and past purchase history) available from our records and other sources (including, without limitation, our worldwide databases). This information may be used to make our future marketing efforts more efficient and will help us to improve the operations and maintenance of our Website and business.

**When You Refer a Friend/Colleague**

AMA respects the privacy of your friends and coworkers. AMA will not keep or maintain names or e-mail addresses when you use our refer-a-friend function. The refer-a-friend function is solely to provide your friends and coworkers with the information you have requested we pass along to them.

**Webcasts, Online “Meetings” and Similar Services**

Users may be able to access or participate in Webcasts, online “meetings” or similar services on the Website, certain of which may be hosted or operated by our service provider, Adobe Systems Incorporated (“Adobe”). In some cases, users may be able to register for such Webcasts and services directly with Adobe, and any such Personally Identifiable Information collected by Adobe in connection with such registration and such user’s participation in the services thereafter may be shared with AMA, and will also be subject to Adobe’s privacy policy, located at http://adobe.com/go/privacy. In other cases, some users may be able to access Webcasts, online “meetings” or similar services hosted by Adobe on the Website by registering with AMA, and in such situations, any Personally Identifiable Information that may be disclosed during participation in such services would be collected by Adobe on AMA’s behalf but would be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

**Sharing Personally Identifiable Information**

AMA may share Personally Identifiable Information collected electronically through its Website in the following ways:

  * AMA or AMA partners may use an outside shipping company to ship orders, and/or a credit card processing company to bill for goods and services purchased through the AMA Website, and AMA will share Personally Identifiable Information with those entities. 
  * From time to time, AMA works with business partners, service providers and sponsors to provide specific products and services, such as jointly developed and marketed products and services. When you sign up for or utilize such products or services, we will share Personally Identifiable Information necessary for the partner/sponsor to provide these products or services to you. 
  * AMA does provide certain firms with its postal mailing address list (which includes names and postal addresses) on a rental basis, and, in some cases, AMA may also provide these firms with information about your order so that they can more easily identify offers that may interest you. **If you wish to be excluded from such lists and from receiving third party mailings, or if you prefer that we do not share your order information,  
please e-mail [customerservice@amanet.org](mailto:customerservice@amanet.org) or call AMA Customer Service at   
1-877-566-9441.**
  * AMA may provide Personally Identifiable Information obtained from non-U.S. individuals to its licensee located in the country or region where the individual is located, and our licensee may use this information to communicate with the user. **If you prefer that we do not provide your information to our licensee, please e-mail[customerservice@amanet.org](mailto:customerservice@amanet.org) or call AMA Customer Service at 1-877-566-9441.**
  * E-mailings of AMA newsletters and other materials, as well as various operations of the Website, are handled both in-house and by outside service companies (such as e-mail service providers, address list hosting companies, distribution companies, suppliers and other service providers, such as Caspio, Inc.). On occasion, where AMA contracts with a service provider, it may request or it may be necessary that the provider collect and/or provide information (including Personally Identifiable Information) directly from our customers on our behalf. In all such situations, AMA restricts how its suppliers and other service providers may access, use and disclose Personally Identifiable Information. AMA does not permit these suppliers and other service providers to sell **** Personally Identifiable Information to third parties. If you receive information through AMA or through a third party supplier about AMA that you prefer not to receive, you should request to be removed from the active mailing list by e-mailing [customerservice@amanet.org](mailto:customerservice@amanet.org) or by calling AMA Customer Service at 1-877-566-9441. 
  * When you contribute to a public area or feature of our Website, such as one of our online communities, messaging services, chat services, bulletin boards, message boards, blogs or other such open forums, the information that you submit will be made available to the general public. For this reason, we recommend that you exercise caution in the submission of Personally Identifiable Information to these areas of our Website as it will be publicly accessible. 
  * We may disclose to third parties aggregate, non-personally identifiable data regarding user behavior, such as overall patterns or demographic reports, as a measure of interest in, and use of, our Website and e-mails. 
  * We may use or disclose Personally Identifiable Information in order to investigate any claim or suspicion of a violation of our Website Terms of Service, to assist with law enforcement investigations, or as otherwise required by law. 



AMA may transfer Personally Identifiable Information to a third party in the event of a sale of stock, merger or consolidation, or other transfer of all or a portion of the assets of AMA, whether voluntarily or by operation of law. In addition, such a transfer may mean that your Personally Identifiable Information is transferred to countries outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”). In using the Website and the various features and services made available thereon, you consent to such transfer of your Personally Identifiable Information.

**Website Usage information—Not Linked to Personally Identifiable Information**

**Cookies**

A cookie is a piece of data that is stored on a visitor’s hard drive. These cookies do not identify, monitor or track any Personally Identifiable Information. AMA uses this information to analyze trends, track visitors' movements and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.

Most Web browsers can be set to inform you when a cookie has been sent to you and provide you with the opportunity to refuse that cookie. You should consult your Web browser to choose the appropriate setting to accept or reject cookies. 

In addition, AMA uses various third party service providers and third party provided services that use cookies, including, for example, a service provided by Eloqua, which uses sophisticated cookie technology to measure site traffic and visitor behavior in aggregate. While these cookies remain on your hard drive after the conclusion of your site visit, they do not contain or collect any Personally Identifiable Information and do not read any other information on your computer’s hard drive.

We may use “clear GIFs” (aka “Web beacons” or “pixel tags”) or similar technologies in the Website and/or in our communications with you. A clear GIF is typically a one-pixel, transparent image (although it can be a visible image as well), located on a Web page or in an e-mail or other type of message, which is retrieved from a remote site on the Internet enabling the verification of an individual’s viewing or receipt of a Web page or message.
