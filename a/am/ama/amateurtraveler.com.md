Your privacy is very important to us. At Amateur Traveler we have a few fundamental principles that we follow:

We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.  
We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.  
We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of our site.  
Frankly we are just too busy to do anything creepy with your personal information, even if we wanted to… and we don’t.

Website Visitors

Like most website operators, Amateur Traveler collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Amateur Traveler’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Amateur Traveler’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Amateur Traveler may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

Amateur Traveler also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on our blogs. Amateur Traveler only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.

Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to Amateur Traveler’s websites choose to interact with Amateur Traveler in ways that require Amateur Traveler to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Amateur Traveler gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who comment on our blog to provide a username and email address. Those who wish to receive Amateur Traveler updates via email, we collect their emails. In each case, Amateur Traveler collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Amateur Traveler. Amateur Traveler does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

Amateur Traveler may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Amateur Traveler may monitor the most popular pages on the Amateur Traveler.com site or use spam screened by the Akismet service to help identify spam.

Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Amateur Traveler discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Amateur Traveler believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Amateur Traveler, third parties or the public at large.

We primarily use our blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Amateur Traveler takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
