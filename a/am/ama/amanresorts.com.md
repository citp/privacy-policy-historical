You can also prevent the use of cookies by modifying your browser, although you may not be able to access our full suite of services if you prevent the use of cookies.

Rest assured that Amanresorts maintains a comprehensive information security program designed to ensure the security and confidentiality of your Personal Information. We do not share or disclose your Personal Information with / to any third party except to the extent necessary for the technical dissemination of our email communications by our external service provider.
