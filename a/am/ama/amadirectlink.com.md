# PrivacyPolicy

* * *

These terms and conditions (these “Terms”) govern membership in the American Motorcycle Association, Inc., an Ohio corporation, d/b/a the American Motorcyclist Association and the All-Terrain Vehicle Association (collectively “we,” “us,” “our,” “ours”). Purchase or use of a membership in the American Motorcyclist Association and the All-Terrain Vehicle Association (a “Membership”) at any time subjects the purchaser or user (“you,” “your,” “yours,” “Member”) to the provisions of these Terms, as amended by us from time to time.

**By accepting your Membership, you certify that you have read, understand, and will abide by the following Terms:  **   


Benefits.  As a holder of a Membership, you are entitled to certain benefits.  These benefits only become active upon the issuance of your Membership number, and may be changed by us from time to time. 

Membership Fee.  The annual Membership fee is currently $49.00.  Membership fees are subject to taxation in accordance with applicable federal or state law. The annual Membership fee of $49.00 does not include applicable taxes. We may change the Membership fee at any time, but changes will apply only to new and renewal annual Memberships, to include those occurring as part of the automatic renewal program. 

Refunds.  There will be no Membership fee refunds, except for Members enrolled in our Auto-Renewal program who have requested a refund at least 30 days prior to the start or renewal of their Membership.  However, you may cancel your Membership at any time, without a refund, by contacting us at:

AMA  
13515 Yarmouth Dr.  
Pickerington, OH 43147  
(800) AMA-JOIN (262-5646)

We may terminate your Membership, including any associated accounts, without notice, for any reason in our sole discretion, including without limitation our belief that continued use of such Membership would violate any provisions of these Terms, applicable law, or otherwise be harmful to our interests. In the event of any such termination, you will be entitled to a pro rata refund of your Membership fee.   


Term and Termination.  Membership term is one year from the date of purchase.  Renewals or automatic renewals within a current term extend the existing expiration date by one year.  When an expired Membership is renewed, the new term begins on the date that membership dues are processed, and expires one year from that date.  Your Membership will not automatically renew unless you opt in to our automatic renewal program.

Automatic Renewal.  You may opt into our automatic renewal program.  This program allows us to automatically renew your Membership each year with no action on your part. You understand that by agreeing to automatic renewal of your Membership, the annual Membership fee (at the then-current rate) will automatically be charged once a year in your Membership anniversary month to the credit card that you have registered with us, unless you alter or cancel your membership as provided below.  You understand that we will notify you by e-mail at least 30 days before your credit card is charged, and that you reserve the right at that time to alter or cancel your Membership.  If you wish to alter or cancel your Membership, you must provide us at least 10 days notice of your desire to cancel at the following address or telephone number:

AMA  
13515 Yarmouth Dr.  
Pickerington, OH 43147  
(800) AMA-JOIN (262-5646)   


In the event that you wish to dispute any charge to your credit card made pursuant to the automatic renewal authorization, you agree to contact us first at the address or telephone number above to resolve the dispute. You also authorize us to charge or credit your credit card as needed to account for any undercharge or overcharge errors, or to resubmit a failed or declined charge. As a result of your agreeing to this automatic renewal, you will enjoy the benefits of free enrollment in the AMA Roadside Assistance Program. All 24-Hour Roadside Assistance Program services are provided by Brickell Financial Services Motor Club Inc., dba Road America Motor Club, administrative offices at 7300 Corporate Center Drive, Suite 601, Miami, Florida 33126. (For Mississippi and Wisconsin customers, services are provided by Brickell Financial Services Motor Club, Inc.  For California customers, services are provided by Road America Motor Club, Inc.)

Risk/Liability. You acknowledge the risk of injury to your person and property while participating in AMA/ATVA-sanctioned events, and by accepting the Membership, you assume all risks of injury or damage arising out of participation in all AMA/ATVA-sanctioned events. You agree to release, hold harmless and indemnify the AMA/ATVA, its district organizations and its employees, directors, officers, agents, contractors, including the organizers of all AMA/ATVA-sanctioned events from all liability as a result of my participation in any such events.  This means that you agree not to sue the AMA or the ATVA for any resulting injury to yourself or your property at any AMA/ATVA-sanctioned event.

Restrictions on Transfer.  Your Membership may not be transferred or used by any other party other than you.   


Your Information.  We expect Members to submit and maintain accurate and current user information in connection with their Memberships.  Such information includes name, address, e-mail address, and telephone number. Members can change their account information by (i) updating Member profile data through an authenticated www.americanmotorcyclist.com account, or (ii) contacting us at:
