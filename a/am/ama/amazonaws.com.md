# AWS Privacy

Amazon Web Services, Inc. (“AWS”) knows that you care how your information is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly.  


**What is covered by this Privacy Policy:**

This AWS Privacy Policy describes how we collect and use information that customers provide to us in connection with the creation or administration of AWS accounts, which we refer to as “Account Information”. For example, Account Information includes names, usernames, phone numbers, email addresses and billing information associated with a customer’s AWS account.

This AWS Privacy Policy applies to customers’ Account Information and does not apply to the content that customers store on our system, including any personal information of their end users. AWS will not disclose, move, access or use customer content except as provided in the customer’s agreement with AWS. See your agreement with AWS and the [AWS Data Protection FAQ](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/data-privacy-faq/) for more information about how we handle content you store on our systems.
