HUAMI recognizes that privacy concerns differ from person to person. Therefore, we provide examples of ways HUAMI makes available for you to choose to restrict the collection, use, disclosure or processing of your personal information and control your privacy settings:

· Log in and out of the HUAMI Account;

· Delete any information stored on Mi Cloud through www.mi.com/micloud; and

· Toggle on/off for other services and functionalities which deal with sensitive or personal information.

If you have previously agreed to us using your personal information for the abovementioned purposes, you may change your mind at any time through your device or privacy settings as described above. If you have any questions, please email us at [privacy@huami.com](mailto:privacy@huami.com).

**RETENTION POLICY**

HUAMI retains personal information we receive as described in this Privacy Policy for as long as you use our products, services and websites or as necessary to fulfill the purpose(s) for which it was collected, provide our services, resolve disputes, establish legal defenses, conduct audits, pursue legitimate business purposes, enforce our agreements, and comply with applicable laws.

**ACCESS, UPDATING, CORRECTING OR ERASURE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION**

   · You have the right to request access to and/or correction of any other personal information that you have provided that we hold about you. When you update your personal information, you will be asked to verify your identity before we proceed with your request. Once we obtain sufficient information to accommodate your request for access to or correction of your personal information, we shall respond to your request within a reasonable period of time, but not longer than any timeframe set out under your applicable data protection laws.

   · A copy of your personal data collected and processed by us will be provided to you upon your request free of charge. For any extra request of the same information, we may charge a reasonable fee based on actual administrative costs according to the applicable laws.

   · If you would like to request access to your personal data held by us or if you believe any information we are holding on you is incorrect or incomplete, please email us as soon as possible at the email address below. Email: privacy@huami.com

   · For details relating to the personal information in your Mi Account, you may also access and change them at [http://account.mi.com](http://account.mi.com/) or by logging into your account on your device.

   · Where otherwise permitted by applicable law, you may send an e-mail to privacy@huami.com or use any of the methods set out in this Privacy Policy to request access to, receive (port), seek rectification, or request erasure of personal information held about you by HUAMI. Please include your full name, email address associated with your account, and a detailed description of your data request. Such requests will be processed in line with local laws.

   · Although HUAMI makes good faith efforts to provide individuals with access to their personal information, there may be circumstances in which HUAMI is unable to provide access, including but not limited to: where the information contains legal privilege, would compromise others’ privacy or other legitimate rights, where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the individual’s privacy in the case in question or where it is commercially proprietary. If HUAMI determines that access should be restricted in any particular instance, we will provide you with an explanation of why that determination has been made and a contact point for any further inquiries. To protect your privacy, HUAMI will take commercially reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access to or making any changes to your personal information.

**WITHDRAWAL OF CONSENT**

If you have previously provided us consent to use your personal information, you may withdraw your consent by submitting a request. This may be done by sending an e-mail to [privacy@huami.com](mailto:privacy@huami.com). We will process your request within a reasonable time from when the request was made, subject to applicable law.

**TRANSFER OF PERSONAL INFORMATION OUTSIDE OF YOUR JURISDICTION**

To the extent that we may need to transfer personal information outside of your jurisdiction, whether to our affiliated companies (which are in the communications, social media, information technology, and cloud businesses) or Third Party Service Providers, we shall do so in accordance with the applicable laws. In particular, we will ensure that all transfers will be in accordance with requirements under your applicable local data protection laws by putting in place appropriate safeguards. You will have the right to be informed of the appropriate safeguards taken by HUAMI for this transfer of your personal information.

HUAMI may use overseas facilities operated and controlled by HUAMI to process or back up your personal information. All personal information collected via or by HUAMI may be stored anywhere in the world. Currently, HUAMI has data centers in China, the United States, Singapore and Germany. These overseas jurisdictions may or may not have in place data protection laws which are substantially similar to that in your home jurisdiction. We may transfer to and store your personal information at our overseas facilities. However, this does not change any of our commitments to safeguard your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Your personal information may be accessible to law enforcement or other authorities pursuant to a lawful request. By providing information to HUAMI, you consent to the storage of your personal information in these locations.

**MINORS/CHILDREN’S PRIVACY**

Our products and services are not directed to children under 13 (and in certain jurisdictions under the age of 16) years of age. If you are under the age of 16, you must have your parent’s permission to access the products and services. HUAMI urges parents to instruct their children never to give out their real names, addresses, or phone numbers, without parental permission, when online.

HUAMI does not seek or intend to seek to receive any personal information from minors. Should a parent or guardian have reasons to believe that a minor has provided HUAMI with personal information without their prior consent, please contact us to ensure that the personal information is removed and the minor unsubscribes from any of the applicable HUAMI services. If we learn that we have collected any personal information from children under 13 (and in certain jurisdictions under the age of 16) and we do not obtain permission from a parent, we will promptly take steps to delete such information and terminate the minor’s account.

**UPDATES TO THE PRIVACY POLICY**

We keep our Privacy Policy under regular review and may update this privacy policy to reflect changes to our information practices. You understand and agree that you will be deemed to have accepted the updated Privacy Policy if you use the products or services after the updated Privacy Policy is posted. If, at any point, you do not agree to any portion of the Privacy Policy then in effect, you must immediately stop using the products and services. If we make material changes to our Privacy Policy, we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) or post the changes on all the HUAMI websites or through our software, so that you may be aware of the information we collect and how we use it. Such changes to our Privacy Policy shall apply from the effective date as set out in the notice or on the website. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices. Your continued use of products and services on the websites, mobile phones and/or any other device will be taken as acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy. Before we use personal information for any new purpose not originally authorized by you, we will endeavor to provide information regarding the new purpose and give you the opportunity to opt-out. Where your consent for the processing of personal information is otherwise required by law or contract, HUAMI will endeavor to comply with the law or contract.

**CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS**

California law permits users who are California residents to request and obtain from us once a year, free of charge, a list of the third parties to whom we have disclosed their personal information (if any) for their direct marketing purposes in the prior calendar year, as well as the type of personal information disclosed to those parties. HUAMI does not share personal information with third parties for their own marketing purposes.

**THIRD PARTY TERMS AND CONDITIONS**

Our Privacy Policy does not apply to products and services offered by a third party. HUAMI products and services may include third parties’ products, services and links to third parties’ websites. When you use such products or services, they may collect your information too. For this reason, we strongly suggest that you read the third party’s privacy policy as you have taken time to read ours. We are not responsible for and cannot control how third parties use personal information which they collect from you. Our Privacy Policy does not apply to other websites linked from our services.

**OUR APPROACH TO MANAGE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION UNDER GDPR**

If you are a European Union user under GDPR, HUAMI will provide a systematic approach to managing personal information through our people, management processes and information systems by applying a risk management methodology. According to the GDPR, for instance, (1) HUAMI set up a Data Protection Officer (DPO) in charge the data protection, and the contact of the DPO is dpo@huami.com, (2) HUAMI designated a representative in Europe, a professional attorney with data protection experience, and the contact of representative is representative@huami.com and (3) a procedure for conducting data protection impact assessments.
