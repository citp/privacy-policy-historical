## What Personal Information About Customers Does Amazon.co.uk Gather?

The information we learn from customers helps us personalise and continually improve your shopping experience at Amazon.co.uk. We use the information to handle orders, deliver products and services, process payments, communicate with you about orders, products, services and promotional offers, update our records and generally maintain your accounts with us, display content such as wish lists and customer reviews and recommend merchandise and services that might be of interest to you. We also use this information to improve our store and website, prevent or detect fraud or abuses of our website and enable third parties to carry out technical, logistical or other functions on our behalf. 

Here are the types of information we gather: 

  * **Information You Give Us:** we receive and store any information you enter on our website or give us in any other way. Click here to see examples of what we collect. You can choose not to provide certain information but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customising future shopping for you, improving our stores, and communicating with you. 
  * **Automatic Information:** we receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many websites, we use "cookies" and we obtain certain types of information when your web browser accesses Amazon.co.uk or advertisements and other content served by or on behalf of Amazon.co.uk on other websites. Click here to see examples of the information we receive. 
  * **Mobile:** When you download or use [apps created by Amazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&docId=1000501923) or its subsidiaries and, where applicable, have requested or consented to location services, we may receive information about your location and your mobile device, including a unique identifier for your device. We may use this information to provide you with location-based services, such as search results, and other personalised content. Most mobile devices allow you to turn off location services. For more information about how to do this, click here. 
  * **E-mail Communications:** to help us make e-mails more useful and interesting, we often receive a confirmation when you open e-mail from Amazon.co.uk if your computer supports such capabilities. We also compare our customer list to lists received from other companies in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our customers. If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please adjust your [ Customer Communication Preferences](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/gss/ccp). 
  * **Information From Other Sources:** we might receive information about you from other sources and add it to our account information. Click here to see examples of the information we receive. 



## What About Cookies?

To enable our systems to recognise your device and to provide features to you, we use cookies. For more information about cookies and how we use them, please read our [Cookies & Internet Advertising policy](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/BIT/InternetBasedAds). 

## Does Amazon.co.uk Share the Information it Receives?

Information about our customers is an important part of our business and we are not in the business of selling it to others. Amazon.co.uk shares customer information only as described below and with Amazon.com, Inc. and the subsidiaries which Amazon.com, Inc., controls and that are either subject to this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Notice. 

  * **Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control:** We work closely with affiliated businesses. In some cases, such as Marketplace sellers, these businesses operate stores at Amazon.co.uk or sell offerings to you at Amazon.co.uk. In other cases, we operate stores, provide services or sell product lines jointly with or on behalf of these businesses. Click here for some examples of co-branded and joint offerings. You can tell when a third party is involved in your transactions and we share customer information related to those transactions with that third party. 
  * **Third Party Service Providers:** We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analysing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing credit card payments and providing customer service. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. Further, they must process the personal information in accordance with this Privacy Notice and as permitted by applicable data protection laws. 
  * **Promotional Offers:** Sometimes we send offers to selected groups of Amazon.co.uk customers on behalf of other businesses. When we do this, we do not give that business your name and address. If you do not want to receive such offers, please adjust your [ Customer Communication Preferences](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/gss/ccp). 
  * **Business Transfers:** As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy stores, subsidiaries or business units. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that Amazon.com, Inc. or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets. 
  * **Protection of Amazon.co.uk and Others:** We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property or safety of Amazon.co.uk, our users or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting, sharing or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in a way that is contrary to the commitments made in this Privacy Notice. 
  * **With Your Consent:** other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about you might go to third parties and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information. 



Whenever we transfer personal information to countries outside of the European Economic Area in the course of sharing information as set out above, we will ensure that the information is transferred in accordance with this Privacy Notice and as permitted by the applicable laws on data protection. 

## How Secure is Information About Me?

  * We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input. 
  * We reveal only the last four digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing. 
  * We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in connection with the collection, storage and disclosure of personally identifiable customer information. Our security procedures mean that we may occasionally request proof of identity before we disclose personal information to you. 
  * It is important for you to protect against unauthorised access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when you finish using a shared computer. For more information on how to sign off [click here](https://web.archive.org/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=1093784). 



## What About Third-Party Advertisers and Links to Other Websites?

Our site may include third-party advertising and links to other Web sites. For more information about third-party advertising at Amazon.co.uk, including personalised or interest-based ads, please read our [Cookies & Internet Advertising policy](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/BIT/InternetBasedAds). 

## What Information Can I Access?

Amazon.co.uk gives you access to a broad range of information about your account and your interactions with Amazon.co.uk for the limited purpose of viewing and, in certain cases, updating that information. Click here to see some examples. This list will change as our website evolves. 

## What Choices Do I Have?

  * As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide information, even though it might be needed to make a purchase or to take advantage of such Amazon.co.uk features as [ Your Profile](https://web.archive.org/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=200039420), [ Wish Lists](https://web.archive.org/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=748390), [ Customer Reviews](https://web.archive.org/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201468010) and [ Amazon Prime](https://web.archive.org/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=200182130). 
  * You can add or update certain information on pages such as those referenced in the Which Information Can I Access? section. When you update information, we usually keep a copy of the previous version for our records. 
  * If you don't want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please adjust your [ Customer Communication Preferences](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/gss/ccp). (If you do not want to receive [ Conditions of Use & Sale](https://web.archive.org/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=1040616) and other legal notices from us, such as this Privacy Notice, those notices will still govern your use of Amazon.co.uk and orders placed with Amazon.co.uk, and it is your responsibility to review them for changes.) 
  * If you don't want us to use personal information that we gather to allow third parties to personalise advertisements we display to you, please adjust your [Advertising Preferences](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/advertising/oo). 
  * The Help feature on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie or how to disable cookies altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the website of its manufacturer. However, because cookies allow you to take advantage of some of Amazon.co.uk's essential features, we recommend that you leave them turned on. For instance, if you block or otherwise reject our cookies, you will not be able to add items to your Shopping Basket, proceed to Checkout, or use any Amazon.co.uk products and services that require you to Sign in. 



## Are Children Allowed to Use Amazon.co.uk?

Amazon.co.uk doesn't sell products for purchase by children. We sell children's products for purchase by adults. If you're under 18, you may use Amazon.co.uk only with the involvement of a parent or guardian.

Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Notice applies to all information that we have about you and your account. We stand behind the promises we make, however, and will never materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of customer information collected in the past without the consent of affected customers.
