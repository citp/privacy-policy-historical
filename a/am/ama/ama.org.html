<p>The American Marketing Association and MarketingPower, Inc. ("MarketingPower") are committed to protecting the privacy of our customer's personal information. This Policy explains how we gather and use the information that we collect from the AMA Web site, located at <a href="http://www.marketingpower.com/">http://www.marketingpower.com</a>. This policy may change over time. Amendments to this statement will be posted at this URL and will be effective when posted. Your continued use of this site following the posting of any amendment, modification or change shall constitute your acceptance thereof. </p>
<p>MarketingPower Inc. is a subsidiary of the American Marketing Association. MarketingPower manages the AMA’s Web site (<a href="http://www.marketingpower.com/">www.marketingpower.com</a>) as well as other programs.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Collection &amp; Use of Information</strong> </p>
<p>When users register on the MarketingPower.com site, the site collects several types of information. First, the site collects contact information such as name, e-mail address, mailing address, phone and fax numbers. Second, the site collects information about the type of work you do (i.e. advertising, marketing research, student, etc.) and your marketing responsibilities. </p>
<p>How this information is used is summarized below: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Site navigation: <br></strong>In order to guide site users to relevant content on the site, the personal information from site registration is used to build a Personal Home Page. For example, a market researcher’s Personal Home Page includes links to market research Best Practice papers, articles, and other such resources on the site. <br>&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>User Convenience:</strong><br>The MarketingPower.com Web site includes links to selected affiliate partners (designated by the “powered by” logo). In some circumstances, we will pass over information to pre-register users on the affiliate’s site. This is done to reduce the number of clicks for users, or to qualify users for various promotional benefits (discounts, etc.). <br>&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Access Privileges:<br></strong>Information collected during registration is used to verify that users have the rights to access AMA-member only content, and that users qualify for various AMA-member discounts and promotions. <br>&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Communications:</strong><br>The AMA and MarketingPower.com run educational programs and events that may be of use to individual marketers to develop new skills or advance their careers. Information from registration is used to determine whom to contact, typically via e-mail, with an invitation to participate. Users can opt-out of such communications at any time at <a href="http://www.marketingpower.com/unsubscribe">http://www.marketingpower.com/unsubscribe</a>.<br>&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Site Monitoring &amp; Maintenance:</strong> <br>Information from user registration is used to measure the user traffic of various sections of the site. This information is used on an aggregate level only, and the site does not record the specific content viewed by an individual user. <br>&nbsp;<br>We may also employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance (including direct and targeted marketing), processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.<br>&nbsp;<br>In certain circumstances, we may share your customer information with trusted service providers that need access to your information to provide operational or other support services. We also may provide information to regulatory authorities and law enforcement officials in accordance with applicable law or when we otherwise believe in good faith that the law requires it. </li></ul>
<p>Your personal information collected during site registration or when you sign up for an AMA membership will not be sold to third parties for e-mail marketing or telemarketing campaigns.</p>
<p><br><strong>Use of IP Address</strong> </p>
<p>We may use your IP Address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. </p>
<p><br><strong>E-Commerce Transactions</strong> </p>
<p>The AMA and MarketingPower offer a wide variety of products and services which may be offered either directly or through an affiliate acting on behalf of the AMA and MarketingPower, or by third parties to whom we have established links from our Web site to make their products and services available to you.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ecommerce Transactions<br>&nbsp;<br></strong><strong>Directories on MarketingPower.com:</strong> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana" size="1">(including the M-Guide, Events Directory and Course Materials Directory)</font> When you place an order online with MarketingPower, your personal details and credit card information are scrambled using industry-standard SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption technology before being sent over the Internet. Although we cannot guarantee encryption or the privacy of your personal details and credit card information, SSL makes it very difficult for your information to be stolen or intercepted while being transferred.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Credit card transactions are maintained by a company called VeriSign. All information sent to VeriSign is encrypted, which will protect it against disclosure to third parties. When we receive your order, it is kept encrypted until VeriSign is ready to process it. For further information about VeriSign’s privacy and security practices, please click here.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>AMA Memberships &amp; Registration at AMA Conferences</strong>: Credit card transactions with the American Marketing Association – which would include membership applications, and conference registrations – are encrypted via VeriSign SSL certificate. All credit card information is retained by AMA, and does not leave the AMA network. The transactions are handled in-house on a PC Charge Payment Server with SSL encryption.<br>&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Affiliate Sites:</strong> <br>Affiliate sites (designated by the “powered by” logo) are responsible for their own policies and procedures during e-commerce transactions. Review the vendor's policy regarding e-commerce transactions on affiliate sites. The AMA and MarketingPower are not responsible for products and services transactions that are consummated at third party Web sites. <br>&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Advertisers: <br></strong>Advertisers on MarketingPower.com, which could include traditional banner-style ads, listings in directories or advertisements in the newsletter, are responsible for their own policies and procedures during e-commerce transactions. We recommend that you review the vendor's policy regarding e-commerce transactions on advertiser sites. The AMA and MarketingPower are not responsible for products and services transactions that are consummated at advertiser Web sites.</li></ul>
<p><br><strong>Use of Cookies</strong> </p>
<p>When you view our Web site we might store some information on your computer. This information will be in the form of a "cookie" or similar file. Cookies are small pieces of information stored on your hard drive, not on our site. Cookies do not spy on you or otherwise invade your privacy, and they cannot invade your hard drive and steal information. Rather, they help you navigate a Web site as easily as possible. </p>
<p>We use cookies to display registered user names on their Personal Home Page, to confirm users access rights to certain “access restricted” areas of the site, and their content preferences.&nbsp; We also use cookies to track visitor traffic by visitor type (aggregated, not individual) for the purpose of understanding what content users find most valuable.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Because of our use of cookies, we can deliver faster service, consistent, updated results and a more personalized site experience. You have the option of setting your browser to reject cookies. However, doing this will hinder performance and negatively impact your experience on our site. </p>
<p><br><strong>Resumes</strong> </p>
<p>AMA and MarketingPower operate a Career Center that enables you to store your resume in our database. When you create a resume, you have the option of making the resume searchable or non-searchable and confidential or non-confidential. Not allowing your resume to be searchable means that you can use it to apply for a job online, but employers and recruiters will not have access to search it through our resume database product. If you choose to make your resume searchable, then all employers and recruiters who pay for access to our resume database product will have access to your resume. In addition to making your resume searchable or non-searchable, you may designate specific information contained within your resume as confidential. Such confidential information will not be shared with employers and recruiters who search the resume database or to whom you deliver your resume. </p>
<p>We use our best efforts to grant access to the resume database only to paying employers, recruiters, hiring managers, and human resource professionals, but cannot guarantee that other parties will not, without our consent, gain access to this database. You may remove your resume from our searchable database at any time. However, employers and recruiters who have paid for access to the database, and other parties who have otherwise gained access to the database, may have retained a copy of your resume in their own files or databases. We are not responsible for the retention, use, or privacy of resumes in these instances, or for the use or privacy of resumes by any of such parties while resumes are in the database. </p>
<p><br><strong>Public Forum</strong> </p>
<p>This Web site may make public chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups available to you from time to time. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose any personal information. </p>
<p><br><strong>Children</strong> </p>
<p>We do not specifically collect online contact information from children nor do we target or sell products for purchase by children. </p>
<p><strong><br>Security </strong></p>
<p>This Web site has industry standard security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. While there is no such thing as "perfect security" on the Internet, we will take reasonable steps to insure the safety of your personal information. </p>
<p><br><strong>Links to Other Web Sites</strong></p>
<p>This Web site contains links to other Web sites. The AMA and MarketingPower are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. If you want to know the privacy policies of the other Web sites, please refer to the organization sponsoring such Web site. </p>
<p><br><strong>Consent</strong> </p>
<p>By registering on the MarketingPower.com site or registering for an AMA online event, you expressly consent to the collection and use by AMA and MarketingPower of personally identifiable information according to this Privacy Policy. </p>
<p>The information may be used by the AMA, MarketingPower, or designated site partners to send you information and services that we think will be useful to you. </p>
<p><strong><br>Opting Out of Receiving Communications</strong></p>
<p>You may opt-out of receiving communications from the AMA, and MarketingPower,&nbsp; at <a href="http://www.marketingpower.com/unsubscribe">http://www.marketingpower.com/unsubscribe</a>.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong><br>Updating Your User Profile</strong></p>
<p>The AMA and MarketingPower allow users the ability to correct or update online information previously provided by the users. Unfortunately, to the extent that such information is also stored in other databases, we cannot always ensure that such corrections or deletions will reach the other databases. We will use all reasonable efforts to ensure that your information is removed from or corrected in our records. </p></font>
