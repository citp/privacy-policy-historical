                    through third party handling services. The exchange is conducted 
                    through third party mail handling services, whereby the customer’s 
                    name and address is not provided to the renter but rather

                    number information to these parties. In the event the customer

                    he/she should contact AMA customer service through the website: 
                    www.amanet.org or by calling customer service at 1-800-262-9699.</p>

                    E-mailings of AMA newsletters and other materials are processed 
                    both in-house and by outsourced service companies. On occasion, 
                    where AMA contacts with a service provider, it may request 
                    that the provider collect and/or provide information directly 
                    from our customer on our behalf. In these cases, customers 
                    will be notified of the involvement of the supplier or service 
                    provider, and all information disclosures provided will be 
                    solely at the customer’s discretion. In all situations, 
                    AMA restricts how its suppliers and other service providers 
                    may access, use and disclose customer information. AMA does 
                    not permit these suppliers and other service providers to 
                    sell customer information to third parties. If information 
                    is received by a customer/subscriber through AMA or through 
                    a third party supplier which is not desired, the customer/subscriber 
                    should request to be removed from the active mailing list 
                    through customer service through our website at www.amanet.org
