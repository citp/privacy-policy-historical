							<h4 class="challenge">Amazon Services Privacy Notice</h4>

							<p>Last updated: December 1, 2005</p>

							<p>Amazon Services knows that you care how information about you is
							used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and
							sensibly. <b>By visiting www.amazonservices.com, you are accepting the
							practices described in this Privacy Notice.</b> </p>

							<p><b>What Personal Information About Users Does Amazon Services Gather?</b></p>

							<p>The information we learn from users helps us personalize and
							continually improve your experience at www.amazonservices.com. Here are the
							types of information we gather. </p>

							<ul type="disc">
							 <li><b>Information You Give Us:</b> We receive and store any
								 information you enter on our Web site or give us in any other way. 
								 <a href="#example">Click here</a> to see examples of what we collect. You can
								 choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able
								 to take advantage of many of our features. We use the information that you
								 provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, improving
								 the site,
								 and communicating with you. </li>
							 <li><b>Automatic Information:</b> We receive and store certain
								 types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many
								 Web sites, we use "cookies," and we obtain certain types of
								 information when your Web browser accesses www.amazonservices.com. <a href="#example">Click
								 here</a> to see examples of the information we receive. A number of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/browse/-/501098/002-0524907-7464825" target="_blank">companies</a>
								 offer utilities designed to help you visit Web sites anonymously. Although
								 we will not be able to provide you with a personalized experience at www.amazonservices.com
								 if we cannot recognize you, we want you to be aware that these tools
								 exist. </li>
							 <li><b>E-mail Communications:</b> To help us make
								 e-mails more useful and interesting, we often receive a confirmation when
								 you open e-mail from Amazon Services if your computer supports such
								 capabilities. If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please <a href="/unsubscribe">click here</a>.</li>
							 <li><b>Information from Other Sources:</b> We might receive information
								 about you from other sources and add it to our information. <a href="#example">Click
								 here</a> to see examples of the information we receive. </li>
							</ul>

							<hr class="green"> 

							<h4 class="challenge">What About Cookies?</h4>

							<ul type="disc">
							 <li>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer
								 to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our
								 systems to recognize your browser and to provide various features. </li>
							 <li>The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will
								 tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to
								 have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to
								 disable cookies altogether. However, you may not be able to use certain
								 features on this site if you do not use cookies, and we recommend that you
								 keep them turned on.</li>
							</ul>

							<hr class="green"> 

							<h4 class="challenge">Does Amazon Services Share the Information It Receives?</h4>

							<p>Information about our customers is an important part of our
							business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. We share customer
							information only as described below and with Amazon.com, Inc. and the subsidiaries
							it controls that either are subject to this Privacy Notice or follow practices
							at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Notice.</p>

							<ul>

							<li><b>Use
							of Third Party Service Providers:</b> We may, from time to time, employ other
							companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include
							sending postal mail and e-mail. They have access to personal information needed
							to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. </li>

							<li><b>Promotional
							Offers:</b>
							Sometimes we send offers to selected groups of Amazon Services customers on
							behalf of other businesses. When we do this, we do not give that business your
							name and address. If you do not want to receive such offers, 							<a href="/unsubscribe">please click here</a>. </li>

							<li><b>Business
							Transfers:</b> As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy
							subsidiaries, or business units. In such transactions, user information
							generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the
							promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the user
							consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that Amazon Services, Inc., or
							substantially all of its assets are acquired, user information will of course
							be one of the transferred assets. </li>

							<li><b>Protection
							of Amazon Services and Others:</b> We release personal information when we
							believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our <a href="../terms">Conditions of Use</a> and other agreements; or protect the
							rights, property, or safety of Amazon Services, our users, or others. This
							includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for
							fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does not
							include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally
							identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in violation of
							the commitments set forth in this Privacy Notice. </li>

							<li><b>With
							Your Consent:</b> Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when
							information about you might go to third parties, and you will have an
							opportunity to choose not to share the information. </li>

							</ul>

							<hr class="green"> 

							<h4 class="challenge">What Choices and Access Do I Have?</h4>

							<ul type="disc">
							 <li>As discussed above, you can always choose not to
								 provide information, even though it might be needed to request information
								 about Amazon Services or take advantage of a feature on this site.</li>
							 <li>If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail
								 from us, please <a href="/unsubscribe">click here</a>. (If you do not want to receive <a href="../terms">Conditions
								 of Use</a> and other legal notices from us, such as this Privacy Notice,
								 those notices will still govern your use of www.amazonservices.com, and it
								 is your responsibility to review them for changes.)</li>
							 <li>If you do not want to accept cookies, please use the
								 Help portion of the toolbar on your browser to disable cookies. Please
								 see "What About Cookies?" above for more information.</li>

								 the Federal Trade Commission provides useful information about online
								 privacy on its own Web site, <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/online/sitesee.html" target="_blank">Site Seeing

							<h4 class="challenge">What About Third-Party Advertisers and Links to Other
							Web sites?</h4>

							
							<p style="text-autospace:none">Our site may include third-party advertising and links to
							other Web sites. These Web sites and advertisers, or Internet advertising
							companies working on their behalf, sometimes use technology to send (or
							"serve") the advertisements that appear on our site directly to your
							browser. They may also use cookies, web beacons (also known as action tags or single-pixel
							gifs), javascript, and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their
							ads and to personalize advertising content. We do not provide any personally
							identifiable customer information to these advertisers or third-party
							Web sites. Further, we do not have access to or control over cookies or other
							features that they may use, and the information practices of these advertisers
							and third-party Web sites are not covered by this privacy notice. Please
							contact them directly for more information about their privacy practices. In
							addition, the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/" target="_blank">Network Advertising Initiative</a>
							offers useful information about Internet advertising companies (also called
							"ad networks" or "network advertisers"), including
							information about how to opt-out of their information collection.</p>

							dispute over privacy is subject to this Privacy Notice and our <a href="../terms">Conditions
							of Use</a>, including limitations on damages, arbitration of disputes, and

							about privacy at Amazon Services, please <a href="mailto:info@amazonservices.com">contact
							us</a> with a thorough description, and we will try to resolve it. </p>

							<p>Our business changes constantly, and our Privacy Notice and the <a href="../terms">Conditions
							of Use</a> will change also. We may e-mail periodic reminders of our notices
							and conditions, unless you have instructed us not to, but you should check our
							Web site frequently to see recent changes. Unless stated otherwise, our current
							Privacy Notice applies to all information that we have about you and your
							account. We stand behind the promises we make, however, and will never
							materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of
							customer information collected in the past without the consent of affected users.
