We classify your data based on importance and sensitivity, and ensure that your personal information has the highest security level. We make sure that our employees and Third Party Service Providers who access the information to help provide you with our products and services are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet such obligations.

You may have a legal right to receive this notice in writing.</p> <p><br></p> <p><strong>WHAT YOU CAN DO</strong></p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;· You can play your part in safeguarding your personal information by not disclosing your login password or account information to anybody unless such person is duly authorized by you. Whenever you log in as a Mi Account user on HUAMI websites, particularly on somebody else's computer or on public Internet terminals, you should always log out at the end of your session.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;· HUAMI cannot be held responsible for lapses in security caused by third party accesses to your personal information as a result of your failure to keep your personal information private. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you must notify us immediately if there is any unauthorized use of your account by any other Internet user or any other breach of security.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;· Your assistance will help us protect the privacy of your personal information.</p> <p><br></p> <p><strong>OPT-OUT (RIGHT TO RESTRICT PROCESSING)</strong></p> <p>You have the right to opt out of certain uses and disclosures of your personal information.
