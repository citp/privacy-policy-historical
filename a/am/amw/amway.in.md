# Privacy Policy

The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to inform you about the type of information we may collect when you visit http://[www.amway.in](http://www.amway.in/), how we may use the information and the choices you have regarding our use of your information and your ability to correct the information or its use at any point.

**_What Information We Collect and How We Use It ?_**

Any information we collect on our Site generally falls into the following two categories: Personally Identifiable Information and Aggregate Information. 

**_Personally Identifiable Information:_**

This refers to information that lets us know specifically who you are. In general, you can visit our Site without telling us who you are or revealing any Personally Identifiable Information. You may however, voluntarily provide Personally Identifiable Information (such as name, e-mail address, and country of origin) for us to contact you, including via e-mail, to respond to your comments or inquiries. In such event, we might maintain a record or your contact, including such Personally Identifiable Information, in a file specific to you. We use this information to provide better service incase you contact us again.

**_Aggregate Information:_**

This refers to information that does not by itself identify you as a specific individual. Such information would include the Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") or the Web site that referred you to our Site, your Internet Protocol ("IP") address (a number automatically assigned to your computer whenever you surf the Web), your operating system and browser type, and any search terms that you enter on our Site. Our Web server aggregates this information in order to monitor the level of activity on our Site, evaluate its effectiveness, and improve the content of our Site in order to make your visit an easy and enjoyable experience.  
We may collect, compile, store, publish, promote, report, or otherwise disclose or use any Aggregate Information, provided that, such information does not personally identify you. We do not correlate any Personally Identifiable Information with the Aggregate Information that we collect on our Site. If we do correlate any Aggregate Information to you, it will be protected like any other Personally Identifiable Information under this Privacy Policy. 

**_Sharing Your Information_**

Except as disclosed in this Privacy Policy, we do not sell, trade, rent, or otherwise retransmit any Personally Identifiable Information we collect online unless we have your permission. Any Personally Identifiable Information you provide to us will be stored in Amway India’s databases in India.   
Where we engage third-party agents or contractors to perform services on our Site, we will require them to observe the intent of this Privacy Policy. From time to time, we may be required to provide Personally Identifiable Information in response to court order, subpoena, or government investigation. We also reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we in good faith believe to be unlawful. We may release Personally Identifiable Information when we believe that such release is reasonably necessary to enforce or apply our Terms of Use or to protect the rights, property, and safety of others and ourselves. Amway India Enterprises Pvt. Ltd. or its related entities could merge with or be acquired by another business entity, or their respective assets could be acquired. Should such a merger or acquisition occur, you should expect that we would share some or all of your Personally Identifiable Information to companies serving you and other users of our Site.

**_Your Choices_**

Your permission is always secured first. Except as provided under this Policy, we will not use or share the Personally Identifiable Information collected on our Site in ways unrelated to the purpose for which you provided the information, including those described above, without providing you a choice whether to permit any such unrelated uses. 

**_Accessing and correcting Your Information_**

We take reasonable measures to ensure that any Personally Identifiable Information we collect on our Site is accurate, current, complete, and reliable for its intended use. If you wish to update or otherwise correct Personally Identifiable Information you have provided us, you may contact us as described in the "Contact Us" section, below. 

**_Protecting Your Information_**

We acknowledge your trust and are committed to take reasonable steps to protect Personally Identifiable Information you provide online from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access. We employ physical, electronic, and managerial processes to safeguard and secure your information. 

**_Use of Cookies on the Web Site_**

A "cookie" is a small data file transferred to your computer's hard drive that allows a Web site to respond to you as an individual, gathering and remembering information about your preferences in order to tailor its operation to your needs, likes and dislikes. Overall, cookies are safe, as they only identify your computer to customize your Web experience. Accepting a cookie does not provide access to your computer or any Personally Identifiable Information about you, other than the information you choose to share. Other servers cannot read them, nor can they be used to deliver a virus. 

Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually adjust yours (Microsoft Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator) to notify you of cookie placement requests, refuse certain cookies, or decline cookies completely.

**_Use of Active-X and Java Applets on this Site_**

Active-X programs and Java Applets are executable programs transferred to your computer's hard drive that cause your computer to perform functions in connection with your visit to a Web site. 

**_Use of Third-Party Media and Research Companies_**

Our Site does not run third-party advertisements, nor do we use third-party media and research companies to place advertisements for us on other parties' Web sites. 

**_Links To Other Web Sites_**

Links to third party Web sites may be provided solely for your information and convenience. If you use these links, you will leave our Site. This Privacy Policy does not cover the information practices of those Web sites linked to our Site, nor do we control their content or privacy policies. We suggest that you carefully review the privacy policies of each site you visit. 

Currently we do not provide any links to other Web Sites from our Web Site http://www.amway.in
