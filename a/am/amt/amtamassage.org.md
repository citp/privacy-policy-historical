# Privacy Policy — American Massage Therapy Association

This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the American Massage Therapy Association (AMTA) website and via email or other forms of communication.

### Acknowledgement

By accessing or using the AMTA website (the Site), you agree that you have read and agreed to abide by the terms and conditions of our Privacy Policy.

### Collection of Information

Any and all personally identifiable information you provide to AMTA through this Site is provided on a voluntary basis, and how much you disclose is up to you. The personally identifiable information collected on these pages may include, but is not limited to, name, title, organization, mailing address, email address, phone and fax numbers, and credit/debit card information. We also may collect information on your views and preferences as they relate to AMTA services.

In some cases, such as blogs or public forums, any personal information you provide may become publicly available to other members and possibly the general public. When you voluntarily disclose such personal information, that information may be collected and used by others, resulting in unsolicited messages from others.

Unless otherwise expressly stated, no confidential relationship is established when any user of this Site voluntarily provides comments, e-mail addresses, and/or other information to AMTA or posts the same in conference rooms, on profile pages, or in other interactive programs and features that may be developed and placed on-line from time to time. Such information is considered non-confidential, and AMTA is free to reproduce, publish, or otherwise use such information for any purposes whatsoever.

We also may record information about the computer you are using to connect to the Internet (IP address) and about your browser.

### Use and Disclosure of Information

We store and use the information you provide about yourself when placing a request or order or to complete the applicable transaction. We may share or sell the information you provide with business partners or other outside parties to deliver content, materials, and services available on or through the Site to you or to the extent necessary to complete an applicable transaction or for any other lawful purpose.

We also may use information you provide to conduct other business or to contact you about AMTA news, activities, membership, surveys, products, and services, and for other legitimate and lawful business purposes. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications. However, AMTA expressly reserves the right to contact any member or other visitor regarding account status, renewals, or other matters relevant to subscription or service.

We use non-identifying and aggregate information collected to generate statistical information, monitor and analyze demographic information and site traffic and usage, and improve our website. AMTA reserves the right to study users’ movement throughout, and use of, this Site and to inform advertisers of this movement and usage.

AMTA further reserves the right to provide personally identifiable information to third parties if AMTA reasonably believes that this release of information is necessary: 1) to comply with legal requirements or legal process; 2) to protect or defend the rights or property of AMTA; or 3) to protect other users of the Site or the public.

### Members

Members may have been assigned or have created a user name and password to be used for accessing portions of the Site. We maintain that information to allow you to access the Site and to maintain our relationship with you as a member or provide specific services to you.

AMTA uses measures designed to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information provided over the Site.  However, we cannot guarantee the absolute safety of your information.  If you become aware of any breach of Site security or this Privacy Policy, please notify us immediately.

### Choices You Have

You choose what information to supply to this Site.  Please share only information as is needed or that you believe is appropriate.  You are under no obligation to provide us with personally identifiable information, but without it we may not be able to respond to your request.

If you wish to access or update the personal information you submit to us, please contact us as indicated below. We provide individuals with access to their personal information where we deem appropriate, including in situations where you are entitled to access and correct your information under applicable data protection and privacy laws.

### Cookies

When you visit our web site, a “cookie” may be placed on your computer to track your visit and help us to improve the Site. You may set your browser to refuse or disable cookies, but if you do so, some features of the Site may not function properly.

### Children’s Privacy

AMTA does not market its products or services to children. We do not knowingly collect information from Site users under 18 years of age.

### International Users

Personally identifiable information that is voluntarily submitted to the Site or to AMTA online via electronic communication or otherwise may be maintained or accessed in servers or files located in the United States. If you are located in a non-US jurisdiction and you do not consent to having your information processed and stored in the United States, please do not provide it to AMTA or this Site. If you are located in a non-US jurisdiction, your provision of information to this Site or other online or electronic access to AMTA constitutes your transfer of such data to the United States, a jurisdiction that may not provide an equivalent level of data protection to the laws in your home country.

### Links

We are not responsible for, and this Privacy Policy does not apply to, the privacy practices of any other website(s) that you may link to through the Site.  We encourage you to seek out and read the privacy policy of each website that you visit.
