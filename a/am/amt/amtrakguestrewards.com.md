We do not use the names of these other passengers for any other purpose, however. We may also ask for your telephone number so that we can contact you in the rare event that there is a major scheduling change or cancellation of your train.

 **Amtrak Guest Rewards Program  
** In order to become a Member of the Program, we need to collect your name, address, country and home telephone number. Other information may be requested and is optional. This includes your email address, company name and address, income range, work telephone number, purpose of most travel and home station location, and date of birth.

 **4.  What are cookies and how does Amtrak use them on amtrak.com?**

Some information is collected automatically every time you visit amtrak.com. Amtrak collects information about your computer and assigns a “cookie”, a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive, when you visit amtrak.com. You can always choose not to receive a cookie file by enabling your Web browser to refuse to accept a cookie. 

**Cookies  
** Generally, we use cookies on amtrak.com to:

 **1**.  Remind us of who you are and to access your account information (stored on our secure servers) in order to deliver to you a better and more personalized service. This cookie is set when you enter the booking process or enter your user ID and password.

 **2**.  Estimate our audience size. Each browser accessing the site is given a unique cookie which is then used to determine the extent of repeat usage, usage by a registered user versus by an unregistered user, and to help target advertisements based on your interests and behavior.

 **3**.  Measure and track certain traffic patterns, which areas of the site you have visited, and your visiting patterns in the aggregate. We may use this information to better personalize the content, banners, and promotions that you and other users will see on the site.

 **5.   What security precautions are in place to protect the loss, misuse, or alteration of your personal information, including your credit card information?**

When you make reservations, place orders, or access account information from the site, your personal information is secure. Amtrak uses SSL encryption technology to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal information and protect your credit card information as it travels over the Internet. Once we receive your credit card information, it is stored offline in our secure data center. All of the customer data we collect is protected against unauthorized access through the use of firewalls and other security measures.

Your Amtrak Member Profile Information and Membership Account Information (should you enroll in the Amtrak Guest Rewards Program) are password-protected. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. Also remember to sign out of your Amtrak account and close your browser window when you have finished. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library or Internet "café."

When you give Amtrak personal information online, that information may be sent electronically to servers outside and separate from Amtrak and outside of the state where you originally entered the information. In addition, that information may be used, stored and processed outside of Amtrak and outside of the state where you entered that information. Whenever Amtrak handles personal information as described above, regardless of where this occurs, Amtrak takes steps to ensure that your personal information is treated securely.

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, Amtrak cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to amtrak.com, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems. However, Amtrak cannot accept liability for disclosure of any personal information due to errors in transmission or unauthorized acts or errors and omissions of third parties.

If you have processed a request to delete, correct, or update any part of your Member Profile, or Membership Account (in the case of the Amtrak Guest Rewards Program), Amtrak will make reasonable effort to see that your instructions to delete and/or make revisions are also communicated to and/or accessed by our contract service providers who may have received the original information and that they too have either deleted and/or revised the information in accordance with your latest instructions. Please note that there will be a passage of time between the time when you seek to update, correct, or delete the information and the time when our contract service providers have changed the information in accordance with your latest instructions.
