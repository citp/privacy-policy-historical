Amtrak uses SSL encryption technology to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal information and protect your credit card information as it travels over the Internet. Once we receive your credit card information, it is stored offline in our secure data center. All of the customer data we collect is protected against unauthorized access through the use of firewalls and other security measures.</font></p><p><font size="2">Your Amtrak Member Profile Information and Membership Account Information (should you enroll in the Amtrak Guest Rewards Program) are password-protected. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. Also remember to sign out of your Amtrak account and close your browser window when you have finished. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library or Internet "café."</font></p><p><font size="2">When you give Amtrak personal information online, that information may be sent electronically to servers outside and separate from Amtrak and outside of the state where you originally entered the information. In addition, that information may be used, stored and processed outside of Amtrak and outside of the state where you entered that information. Whenever Amtrak handles personal information as described above, regardless of where this occurs, Amtrak takes steps to ensure that your personal information is treated securely.</font></p><p><font size="2">Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, Amtrak cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to amtrak.com, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems. However, Amtrak cannot accept liability for disclosure of any personal information due to errors in transmission or unauthorized acts or errors and omissions of third parties.</font></p><p><u><font size="2"><a href="#Top"><font color="#004080" size="2">Back to Top</font></a></font></u></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b><font size="2">6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is Amtrak's policy on allowing you to access, update, correct, or delete your personal information collected from amtrak.com?</font></b></p><p><font size="2">When you create a Member Profile in the Reservations area, you will have the right to elect not to receive special information and offers by email.
