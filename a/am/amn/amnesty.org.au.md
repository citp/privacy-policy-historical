#### What personal information we collect

We collect personal information about individuals including members, supporters, volunteers, contractors, job applicants and people whose human rights we work to protect. The personal information which we collect and hold generally includes your name, address, date of birth and contact details (such as your phone number, fax number and email address).

You do not have to provide us with your personal information. However if you do not provide us with your personal information, it will be difficult for us to contact you. Without your personal information, we may not for example, be able to issue you with a receipt, offer you employment, help you if that is what you require, or provide you with more information about our work.

We may also collect and hold sensitive information to provide some services. For example, if you are a case work client, we will collect information specific about your case, including your racial and ethnic origin. There is a view that by signing a petition in support of international human rights law, that this could amount to the collection of sensitive information. Sensitive information is defined by the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) as including information about your philosophical and political beliefs. In any event, we will only collect sensitive information directly from you and by providing it to us you consent to us collecting, using or disclosing it as specified in this Privacy Policy or as otherwise authorised by law.

#### How we collect personal information

We collect personal information you provide to us directly, for example, in person, over the phone, by email, via our website or by completing our online or hard copy petition forms to take action in particular campaigns we may be running. We may also collect your personal information from publicly available sources and third parties.

During your communications with us, please do not provide us with personal information (including any sensitive information) of any other individual unless you have the express consent of that individual to do so. If you do provide us with such information about another individual, you:

  * must tell that individual that you will be providing their information to us and that we will handle their information in accordance with this privacy policy
  * warrant that you have that individual's consent to provide their information to us.



#### Use of personal information

We use personal information you provide us for the purpose for which it was provided to us, other related purposes or as permitted or required by law. Such purposes include:

  * processing donations, memberships and Human Rights Defender pledges
  * issuing receipts
  * responding to your comments or questions
  * providing follow-up information about Amnesty International’s activities
  * supporter research, for example asking you to participate in a survey about your involvement with AIA
  * requesting financial or activism support
  * improving our website
  * measuring the level of support received and the effectiveness of our campaigns
  * providing you with marketing material such as our newsletter (if you opt-in to receive such information); and 
  * any other purposes identified at the time of collecting your information. 



If we also obtain your sensitive information, we will only use your sensitive information (such as your racial or ethnic origin or health information) for the purposes listed above, or other directly related purposes or purposes to which you otherwise consent.

#### Disclosure of personal information

Any personal information you provide to us may be disclosed, if appropriate, to third parties who provide services on our behalf, such as mail, database, telephone, IT, audit, professional advice, payment processing and research services. We may also disclose your personal information to our volunteers who assist with many of our tasks.

We have confidentiality agreements in place with many of our service providers and external agencies, and with staff and volunteers who handle personal information that we provide to them. We will only disclose your personal information for the purposes for which it was initially collected, other directly related purposes or purposes to which you otherwise consent.

Other than as stated above we will we not share your personal information. However, it is possible, though unlikely, that we might be forced to disclose personal information in response to legal process or when we believe in good faith that the law requires it, for example, in response to a court order, subpoena or a law enforcement agency's request.

#### Data Security

We take commercially reasonable steps to ensure your personal information is protected from misuse, loss, interference and unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. For example, whenever we ask for your financial details online, we use security-encrypted response forms.

However, data protection and security measures are never completely secure (particularly for information sent online) and, despite the measures we have put in place, we cannot guarantee the security of your information. You must take care to ensure you protect your personal information (for example, by protecting any usernames and passwords, etc) and you should notify us as soon as possible after you become aware of any security breaches. If you don’t wish to make your financial contribution online, please contact us to receive a hard copy form.
