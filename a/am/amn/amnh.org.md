###### COOKIES & PIXEL TAGS

Like most websites, the Museum’s uses cookies and pixel tags. These technologies do not capture or store any personal information. The Museum uses them to better understand its online visitors, to improve its marketing efforts, and to make improvements to website content, navigation, and structure.

A cookie is a small text file that is sent to your browser from a website and is stored on your computer's hard drive. A cookie acts as an anonymous tag that identifies your computer or device but not you personally. Cookies can store information about which webpages you’ve viewed, or what you’ve put in your online cart.

A pixel tag is a small graphical image, embedded on a webpage or in an email. When you access a page or email with a pixel tag, the tag generates a generic notice of that action. Pixel tags usually work in conjunction with cookies, registering when a particular device visits a particular page or opens an email.

If you are concerned about the use of cookies, the Museum suggests that you explore your browser's options to notify you whenever a cookie is set, or to disallow cookies altogether. Users should be aware, however, that prohibiting the use of cookies may restrict users' access to certain types of content or features.

###### AGGREGATE INFORMATION

The Museum also collects some anonymous, non-personal information on an aggregate basis about its website visitors. This information is used for statistical purposes and to help the Museum monitor how visitors navigate our website. Examples of such information include IP address, browser type, and device type.

Additionally, the Museum may collect anonymized location data for WiFi-enabled devices visiting the Museum campus. This data is not correlated to specific users and no personal information is collected – the data is used to understand the flow of visitors through the Museum to improve the visitor experience.

###### LINKS TO OTHER SITES

Users may find content on the Museum's website that links to the websites and services of our partners, or other third parties. In many cases, these links represent cooperative projects or are established with persons or entities that have a significant connection to or relationship with the Museum. Although every effort is made to ensure that website referrals are to reputable and relevant sources, the Museum does not control the content or links that appear on these websites. In addition, these websites or services, including their content and links, may change without the Museum’s knowledge. In addition, these websites and services may have their own privacy policies and customer service policies, or no policy at all, and those too may change from time to time, and you are encouraged to review the privacy policies of any websites you visit.
