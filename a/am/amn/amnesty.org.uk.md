# aiuk :: Amnesty International UK Privacy Policy

**For www.amnesty.org.uk**

Your online privacy and security is very important to Amnesty International UK (AIUK). 

**What types of information does AIUK log?**  
In order to consider and improve AIUK’s web site, we log certain types of information when people visit our site in order to help us understand more about how the site is used. For example, information such as IP addresses, so that we can see how many unique visitors come to the site each week and what pages are accessed (and when).

**What does AIUK do with the personal information you provide?**  
If you provide us with personal information (for example, when signing up for our crisis response list or when taking part in an action) your details are stored securely and used only for the purpose for which you have signed up. We do not pass your details to other organisations without your express consent (except if you use our secure financial pages - in which case they are passed to our partner company, Worldpay - see below for further details).

**Does anybody else have access to your personal information?**  
If you use our secure financial pages to join Amnesty International UK or to donate money to us online, you are going through to the web site of our reputable partner company, World Pay (part of the The Royal Bank of Scotland Group). World Pay handles all the secure financial transactions on the AIUK site on our behalf. The information you provide as part of any online financial transaction (such as your credit card number and contact information) is collected only so that the transaction can take place. 

**Can you access your membership records online?**  
We are working towards a time when we can give all members of Amnesty International UK online access to their own membership records, in order to be able to update these themselves. Until this is possible, you can amend your membership details by e-mailing our supporter administration team (members@amnesty.org.uk).

**Can AIUK guarantee the security of your personal data while it is being transmitted on the Internet?**  
It is not possible to guarantee the total security of _any_ data transmission over the Internet. This means that we cannot ensure the security of any information you send to us, and you therefore do this at your own risk. However, once we receive your data, we do everything we can to make sure that it is secure on our systems.

_This policy will be updated if there are any changes in our practice._
