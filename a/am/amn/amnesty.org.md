### Legal basis of processing

Data protection law requires us to have a legal justification to process your personal information. We use the following depending on the type of data and the type of processing:

**Consent** We require your consent to send you our communications for example to send you emails to update you on our work and our campaigns and to request donations. We will only process your information in this way if you consent. If you apply for a job with us and provide us with sensitive personal information (including details of your race, ethnicity, gender) we will only process that information with your consent.

**Legitimate interest**  
We sometimes share your personal information with other parts of the Amnesty International global movement (see below). This is done to fulfil our legitimate interest in promoting our organisation as effectively as possible and enabling our message to reach people who may be interested in human rights.

**To fulfil a contractual obligation**  
If you donate to us or express an interest in joining our movement we will process the personal data you provided to process that donation or action your membership request.

**Legal obligation**  
We will process your personal information to fulfil any legal obligations placed upon us, such as the prevention of fraud or money-laundering. We will also process your personal information if lawfully required to do so by a legal authority or a court of law.

**Necessity**  
For example where you are applying for an employment or volunteering opportunity with us, processing certain information is necessary for employment purposes.

**Security**  
We take appropriate security measures to ensure that we keep your information secure, accurate and up to date. We also take care to ensure that we have secure systems for processing payments through our payment services provider. However the transmission of information over the Internet is never completely secure, so while we do our best to protect personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of information transmitted to our websites.

### Third Party Websites

On our website we sometimes have links to third party websites or applications. This policy does not apply to such pages or applications hosted or operated by other organisations. This includes the websites or applications of Amnesty International sections or related organisations or third party sites. These other sites may have their own privacy policies which apply to them.

### Sharing of your personal information

We will only share your personal information in the following circumstances:

**Sharing with other parts of the Amnesty International global movement**  
Amnesty International Limited is one part of Amnesty International’s global movement. Our movement is made up of over 60 membership organisations working to end human rights violations globally, including within the UK. Some of these bodies are formally constituted and others not. We may share your information with these entities who may then use your personal information in connection with their activities. For example, if you have expressed an interest in joining Amnesty International or sign a petition, we may share your contact details with your local Amnesty International organisation. To the extent that sharing your information in this way requires us to transfer your personal information outside of the EU, we have contractual arrangements in place to ensure that your data is shared and processed by the recipient organisation to an EU standard.

**Hosting and processing arrangements**  
Our websites are hosted by third party service providers and therefore any personal details you submit through them may be processed by that third party service provider. 

We also use other third parties to process your personal details including in the following areas:

  * to action all online expressions of interest to join Amnesty International or take actions and manage all related communications
  * to process online payments
  * to process all information associated with applications for employment or volunteering opportunities and related recruitment processes.



All third party services providers process your personal information only on Amnesty International Limited's behalf and are bound by contractual terms that are compliant with data protection law.

We participate in Facebook’s custom audience and lookalike audience programs, which, depending on your privacy settings with Facebook, enable us to display our content to our existing or potential supporters on Facebook. We provide personal information such as your email address to Facebook which securely encrypts it. That personal information is then deleted by Facebook if it does not match a Facebook account or once they confirm you have an account.

**Payment processing and fraud**  
Where submitted, your card details may be disclosed to banks or relevant financial institutions to arrange payments. In the case of a suspected fraudulent transaction, your details may be further disclosed for the sole purpose of performing further checks (for example, disclosure to a credit checking agency).

**Other sharing**  
We may also share your personal information with your permission, or if we are legally required to disclose your information in circumstances where this cannot be reasonably resisted.

We remove personal data from our systems once it is no longer required, in line with our guidelines on how long important information must remain accessible for future use or reference, as well as when and how data can be destroyed when it is no longer needed.

The length of time each category of data will be retained will vary depending on how long we need to process it for, the reason it was collected and in line with any statutory requirements. After this time the data will either be deleted or we may retain a secure anonymised record for research and analytical purposes.
