This information may be compiled by the ad provider into a summary format without identifying you specifically, to provide the advertiser client with profiles of the types of individuals responding to the ads.

These codes allow statistical tracking of how many times you view an ad. Cookies received from AM News Abuse ads are never used for the purpose of setting unique identifiers to identify you when you visit other web sites. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent cookies, if you desire.
