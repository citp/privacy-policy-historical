As used in this Privacy Policy, "personal information" means information about you that is personally identifiable, such as your name, e-mail address, phone number or physical address.

#### Voluntary Disclosure Of Personal Information

You may choose to disclose personal information in our online community features, blogs, in-game chats or other public forums, directly to other users while using the Site service.  
Please be aware that such information is public information and you should not expect privacy or confidentiality under these circumstances. AMZGame shall not be liable in any way for such disclosure of personal information.

#### Use Of Personal Data

We use your personal information for operational purposes only. For example, we may use your information to send you administrative communications either about your account with us or about features of our Site, including any changes to this Privacy Policy. Whatever the purpose may be, we will only collect information to the extent reasonably necessary to fulfill your requests and our legitimate business objectives. We attempt to limit access to personal information about you to employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs.  
We use e-mail addresses to fulfill requests for services. For example, mailing addresses are used for the delivery of prizes. Occasionally, we share your personal information (e.g., e-mail address) with a third party sponsor, co-sponsor, or other reputable third party that provides products or services that may be of interest to you. We may occasionally employ other companies to perform services necessary for our internal operations, such as companies that personalize our web pages, process credit card transactions, analyze customers' interaction with our Site, and process consumer surveys.  
Finally, we may take your personal information and make it non-personally identifiable. We do this either by combining it with information about other individuals (aggregating your information with information about other individuals), or by removing characteristics (e.g., your name) that make the information personally identifiable to you. This process is known as de-personalizing your information. Given the non-personal nature of this information, no restrictions apply under this Privacy Policy on our right to de-personalize your personal information. We may use de-personalized information in any way and share it with third parties without your consent.

(i) our Terms of Use, contests, sweepstakes, promotions, or game rules; (ii) protect your safety or security, including the safety and security of your property; or (iii) protect the safety and security of our website or third parties.
