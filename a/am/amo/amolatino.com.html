<p>Depending on what you do when you visit any Web site, you are providing information about your visit to the site's owners. This includes AmoLatina.com. 
    We value privacy and think you do too, so we want you to have the information you need to make your own decisions about your personal privacy. When you visit 
    or supply information to any Web site, we think it's a good idea for you to first understand what that site's privacy policies are. If the site doesn't tell 
    you, don't hesitate to ask.</p>

<p>The bottom line at www.AmoLatina.com is that we only use the information that we get from your visit for internal tracking purposes, to make AmoLatina.com

<h3>What personal information we collect:</h3>
<p>When you visit the amolatina.com Web site, we capture the Internet provider's domain name and country that you came from (e.g., 'aol.com') 
and the paths taken as you move from page to page (i.e., your "click stream" activity).</p>
<h3>Visitor Registration or Requests for Information:</h3>
<p>amolatina.com only collects personal information that you choose to provide voluntarily when using or registering with the AmoLatina.com site.

affiliate agreements, your name and company name. While you can browse our site without registering, you will need to register in order to take advantage of 
certain features.</p>
<h3>Browsing and the use of Cookies:</h3>
<p>AmoLatina.com uses cookie technology as part of our Web site's statistical reporting. A cookie is a small piece of information sent by a Web site that 
is saved on your hard disk by your computer's browser. It holds information a site may need to personalize your experience (i.e., rotating images on AmoLatina.com 
home page) and to gather Web site statistical data, such as which pages are visited, what is downloaded, the internet provider's domain name and country that our 
visitors come from (e.g. 'aol.com,' or 'umich.edu') and the addresses of sites visited immediately before, and after, coming to AmoLatina.com. However, 
none of this is associated with you as an individual. It is measured only in aggregate. The information in the cookies lets us trace your "click stream" activity 
(i.e., the paths taken by visitors to our site as they move from page to page. Cookies do not capture your individual email address or any private information about you.</p>

We record information on site traffic but not information on individual visitors to our site, so no information about you in particular will be kept or used.</p>

the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.)</p>
