<p>Depending on what you do when you visit any Web site, you are providing information about your visit to the site's owners. This includes AmoLatina.com. 
    We value privacy and think you do too, so we want you to have the information you need to make your own decisions about your personal privacy. When you visit 
    or supply information to any Web site, we think it's a good idea for you to first understand what that site's privacy policies are. If the site doesn't tell 
    you, don't hesitate to ask.</p>

<p>The bottom line at www.AmoLatina.com is that we only use the information that we get from your visit for internal tracking purposes, to make AmoLatina.com

<p>AmoLatina.com uses cookie technology as part of our Web site's statistical reporting. A cookie is a small piece of information sent by a Web site that

visitors come from (e.g. 'aol.com,' or 'umich.edu') and the addresses of sites visited immediately before, and after, coming to AmoLatina.com. However, 
none of this is associated with you as an individual. It is measured only in aggregate. The information in the cookies lets us trace your "click stream" activity 
(i.e., the paths taken by visitors to our site as they move from page to page. Cookies do not capture your individual email address or any private information about you.</p>
