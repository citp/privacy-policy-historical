**How Ammo To Go Protects Your Personally Identifiable Information**

Ammo To Go respects individual privacy and values the confidence of its customers, employees, vendors, consumers, business partners and others. Ammo To Go strives to uphold the highest ethical standards in its business practices. This Privacy Notice outlines how Ammo To Go collects, uses, and shares your Personally Identifiable Information, defined as the following:

* Name,
* Physical Address,
* Phone Number,
* Email Address,
* Credit Card.

We require the above-defined Personally Identifiable Information to be provided on all orders. From time to time, state legal rules require us to collect other information. Your Personally Identifiable Information will only be collected if you create an Ammo To Go account, or if you enter your Personally Identifiable Information into the Ammo To Go checkout process.

Ammo To Go does not sell or give away your Personally Identifiable Information to any web marketers, and you won’t see Ammo To Go ads following you around the web because we do not use your information to retarget you. Ammo To Go also does not allow third parties to collect your Personally Identifiable Information while you are on our site. The only people who we share your Personally Identifiable Information with are people who are critical to fulfilling your order: our credit card processor, our warehouse fulfillment folks, common carriers, email coordinator, and other administrative workers. You can edit the Personally Identifiable Information you provide to Ammo To Go by updating your Ammo To Go account. Subject to the above, Ammo To Go will not disclose your Personally Identifiable Information to any third parties unless we receive your permission to do so or we are legally obligated to do so. Ammo To Go does not collect any information about your browsing habits on other Internet sites (with the exception of Google Analytics described below). Ammo To Go does not respond to DNT signals.
