## The Online Privacy Policy of [Ask Agent™](http://www.askagent.com/)

We believe that it is in our best interest and yours to protect your privacy.

We do not sell or redistribute our e-mail lists to third parties or spammers. All email addresses are kept strictly confidential

When submitting a query, if you wish your name and query to be kept confidential, you should tick the "private" option (requires a User Value of 10). Alternatively, if you do not tick that box, or don't have enough User Value, but still wish to remain anonymous, we recommend using a pseudonym or generic name and not including information in your query that allows others to identify you.

We will not send you a newsletter or any other promotional material unless you chose to receive it.

We also believe you should be able to remove yourself from any mailing list quickly and easily. All newsletters allow you to remove your email address from the mailing list 

Queries and responses cannot be removed from the system once they are entered. However, you can mark queries "private" at a later date (requires a User Value of 10). And if you are an advisor, you can change your name and site title at any time, thereby disassociating yourself from the information.

Any e-commerce transaction through our site will take place through secure servers, utilizing encryption technology to safeguard all transactions (credit card/online purchases) from unauthorized viewing, using standard SSL encryption, or the equivalent, with a certificate from VeriSign or its equivalent. Credit card numbers will be used only for payment processing and will not be retained on our system in any format, for any reason. 

Any cookies used in our web development will not track individual information and cookies from Ask Agent™ can only be read by Ask Agent™. If you are still uncomfortable with the transfer of cookies between our system and yours, we recommend that you disable the cookies function in your browser. Our intent in using cookies is simply to improve the quality of your web experience by preventing you from entering information over and over again.

These measures, along with our belief that it is up to the individual to determine who receives and what may be done with their personal information, insure that any information submitted on our site will be kept confidential. If you have any questions or concerns regarding this matter, please [contact us](mailto:info@ammas.com).
