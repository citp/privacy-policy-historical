You can reach us at the aforementioned address or by email at info@amsterdam-dance-event.nl or in case of specific privacy issues at privacy@amsterdam-dance-event.nl. 

We organize the annual Amsterdam Dance Event, an international platform combining a business conference, a platform for brand activation and a(n) (indoor) festival consisting of events featuring electronic music (‘the ADE’), in part through our website(s), including but not limited to www.amsterdam-dance-event.nl, and/or the website(s) (of organization(s)) affiliated to our website(s) (the ‘Website(s)), web interfaces on our own and/or affiliated website(s) and our own social media pages and/or those of companies we work together with for the purpose of organizing the ADE (our ‘Partner Companies’), where our visitors to the business conference (‘Delegates’) and visitors to the festival (‘Visitors’) can directly make agreements or bookings, and the ADE Foundation apps linked to the Website(s) (together referred to as: the ‘Platform’). 

For the purpose of organizing the ADE, we may use (some of) the personal data of Visitors and/or and Delegates. 

It is very important to us that data obtained from our visitors is used in a responsible manner. As such, we process and protect your personal data carefully and in compliance with the relevant provisions of the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). 

It is not compulsory to provide personal data to make use of the Platform. However, for some of our services it might be necessary to provide certain personal data.

We primarily use your Registration Data to carry out our agreement with you as best as we can or for the purposes of our internal administration.

our Promoters (companies that organize an event that is part of the ADE festival and are responsible for the said event), but only in case you have provided them with such data in order to make use of their services;  
and/or Third Parties (companies that provide certain online services through the Platform, such as Spotify, YouTube, Xaton, Paylogic or Facebook), upon providing them with your data and after registering with us through their (website(s) or app(s)) or when you make a payment for a purchase on the Platform.

Furthermore, we may use anonymized and combined data for various purposes, such as testing of our IT systems, research, data analyses, development of marketing and promotional models and new and improved appliances and services. 

2\. How we use your data

Registration and use of account  
To create an account on the Platform, and to offer, deliver and invoice the products and/or services you order on our Platform through this account, we will use your Registration Data and/or External Data if you register through one of our Third Parties.  
Upon registration with us, or if you have pre-registered, we will send you a welcoming email.  
Furthermore, we will use your Registration Data and your Surf Data (such as user cookies) to verify that you are the same user who purchased certain products and/or services on the Platform, for example tickets, wrist bands and merchandise.  
Only when you are registered as a Delegate, some of your Registration Data may become visible to other Delegates, in their accounts or in a physical guide. This is only possible for Delegates and is part of our agreement with Delegates to offer the  
full experience of a delegate ticket: to know which other Delegates will be attending in order to optimize their participation in the Conference by, for instance, networking and making new business contacts. Any other information besides your name, such as your e-mail address or telephone number, will only be made visible if you have given us permission to do so and as long as you have not withdrawn your permission.  
We collect External Data when you register through one of our Third Parties. We may use such External Data to adapt and be able to provide services adjusted to your tastes and interests.  
On the Platform you also have the possibility to register for services from our Partners. In case you do so, we will not collect or use such External Data. It will be provided directly to those Partners and their privacy policy applies to further use they make thereof. We will make sure it is always clear to you when you are providing your data to such Partners. We will, however, collect Surf Data and Commercial Data about the interaction you have with our Partners in order to adjust and optimize our services to your interests in the future.  
We may collect your Registration Data, Venue Data, Commercial Data and/or Surf Data to analyze the way in which you visit and use the Platform and purchase our products and services, or to make an anonymous profile of your interests and behavior, including the way in which you interact on various parts of the Platform such as purchase of products through us or our Partners or Third Parties.  
From time to time, we may use the Registration Data to contact you for the purpose of market research.  
The legal ground for the use of your data in the above is the necessity to perform our agreements with you and legitimate interests to know who makes use of our services and how. Where we use your data based on your explicit permission, you are always entitled to withdraw such permission in the way as set out below.  
In order to offer you a personalized experience of the use of our Platform, we may lease data in an electronic form, for instance by placing third party pixels on our Website(s), to our carefully selected Third Parties, so that they are able to offer products or services. But only if you have given us permission to do so.  
Subscriptions and forms  
You will only receive our newsletters if you have subscribed to our newsletter, in which you will always have the possibility to unsubscribe.  
If we have your explicit permission, we may use your Registration Data, Venue Data, Commercial Data and/or Surf Data to send you information about artists or speakers performing at ADE and events that might interest you.  
To make (targeted) offers via advertising, email and/or social media networks and to keep you up-to-date on the latest news and/or updates and/or service announcements, we may use your Registration Data, Surf Data and/or Commercial Data;  
The legal ground for this use of your data is your explicit permission and/or our legitimate interests to know how you make use of our services and improve our business.  
Venue Data  
In principle, these data shall only be processed as anonymized data for internal purposes such as statistics and to gain insight into visitor numbers. We will only use Venue Data in a non-anonymized form if you have explicitly given your prior permission.  
Use of Venue Data helps us to improve our services, because it shows us which events and performances as part of the ADE have been popular and which have not. It also helps us to try to adapt our services to suit your wishes and expectations even more.  
Anonymized Venue Data enable us to check whether our Promoters actually meet their obligation to us and allow the agreed minimum number of Delegates to enter the event in question.  
You are able to link your Venue Data to your profile on selected social media networks. If you choose to do so, your Venue Data will be available on the selected social media network in a way that depends on the settings in your social media account settings. As long as you don’t explicitly choose for this option, the Venue Data will not be disclosed.  
The social media networks in question are responsible for the use of data through this functionality, including the use of cookies they could use for this purpose. From the moment you choose this functionality, what the social media network does with your data is out of our hands. The privacy statements and conditions of those social media networks apply.  
The legal ground for this use of your data is your explicit permission and/or our legitimate interests to improve our services.

3\. Third parties

We only share your Data with Partners, Promoters and Third Companies where we explicitly let you know.  
We will never transfer your personal data to third parties without your explicit permission, except when it is necessary to carry out our agreement with you – for instance, to deliver products, services or tickets where we share data with our carefully selected processors – or if we are required to do so by law.  
To be able to provide our services, we use companies to process and store information including your Data (‘third party processors’). In order for them to carry out their agreement, we may transfer your Data to them. In such cases we will always make sure they are obliged to apply our same standards of processing and protection of your Data.
