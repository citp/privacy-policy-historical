<hr> <h3>Cookie Information</h3></a> <p>The American Statistical Association uses 
cookies on this Web site, <a href="/index.html">www.amstat.org</a>, when we need 
to keep track from one screen to another, such as when you log in to <a href="https://www.amstat.org/membersonly/">Members 
Only</a> using a password or when you use a shopping cart. A "magic cookie" 
is a datum sent by our Web server to your Web browser, stored in RAM while your 
browser is in use, or in a file called something like "cookies" on your 
machine. Cookies helps keep track of your Web session with <a href="/index.html">www.amstat.org</a>.&nbsp; 
</p><p>Cookies store information that the Web site uses. Some of this information 
(e.g., last visited Web site, your IP address, the browser and version you use) 
are available to ANY Web site you visit, regardless of your security settings. 
This information is built into the Internet and its communication methods and 
protocols. Generally, you cannot stop this information from going out. Other information 
is gathered by user input, typically by forms. In other words, a cookie will not 
know your home phone number unless you give that information to a form or other 
input device on a Web site.</p><p>Some sites are now using cookies to differentiate 
between repeat users and new users rather than going by general "hit" 
statistics, which are not very specific. In this way, a Web site administrator 
can form a clearer picture of how the site is used. Cookies cannot access any 
other file on your computer. Cookies created by one site will only work with that 
specific site. Site A, for example, cannot read cookies generated by Site B and 
then use that information for purposes for which it was not originally intended.</p><p>It 
is the express policy of <a href="/index.html">www.amstat.org</a> that data generated 
by cookies and related databases will be used only in aggregate form for the purpose 
of improving the site and site-related services for users. Information from individual 
cookies will only be accessible to Web site administrators within the ASA office. 
The aggregated data compiled via cookies and related databases are considered 
confidential and will not be provided to entities outside of the organization 
under any circumstances. Our cookies crumble after 24 hours.&nbsp;</p><p>You can 
manage cookies if you edit your browser Preferences/Internet Options (check the 
Advanced features). You can also periodically remove the cookies file on your 
machine. However, if you disallow cookies, you may disable access to advanced 
functionality on our Web site (<a href="#memcookie">members: see next paragraph</a>). 
For more information on cookies, consult the Help button of your browser or visit

Cookies are NOT used to verify your authority to access the <a href="https://www.amstat.org/membersonly/">Members 
Only</a> area of our website. However, they ARE used once the authorization has 
been verified to allow you access to each of page in <a href="https://www.amstat.org/membersonly/">Members 
Only</a>, and access to secure committee or other official pages where you serve 
as an officer. In other words, your password is not contained in a cookie, but 
your authority level is. Your authority to view each page in the member's area 
is verified at the time you access that page. While you can access the <a href="https://www.amstat.org/membersonly/">Members

policies below are in development, pending use of this web site for other activities 
that might affect privacy. If you have any comments, please feel free to share 
them with <a href="mailto:webmaster@amstat.org">webmaster@amstat.org</a>.</p><h4>Surveys</h4><p>Our 
online surveys may ask visitors for contact information (such as email address) 
and demographic information (like their zip code, age, or income level). Responses 
are kept confidential and are not provided to any third party. If the survey is 
at the request of a third party who will receive the information, the survey will 
prominently identify the name and link to their privacy policy. We may use contact 
date from our surveys to send the user information about our association. Users 
may opt out of receiving future mailings; see the <a href="#optout">choice/opt 
out section</a>. Demographic and profile data may be collected at our site. This 
information is shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis.</p><h4>Public Forums</h4><p>This 
site may make chat rooms, list servers, forums, message boards, and/or news groups 
available to its members. Please remember that any information that is disclosed 
in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when 
deciding to disclose your personal information.</p><p> This page was constructed
