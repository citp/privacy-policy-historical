## Cookie Information

**What is a cookie?**

A cookie is a simple text file stored on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Most websites use cookies to improve your experience by allowing the website to “remember” you, either for the duration of your visit (using a “session cookie”) or for repeat visits (using a “persistent cookie”). Cookies may be set by the website you are visiting (“first-party cookies”) or they may be set by other websites that run content on the page you are viewing (“third-party cookies”). 

**What do cookies do?**

Cookies perform different functions, like letting you navigate between pages efficiently, storing your preferences, and improving your experience of a website. Cookies make the interaction between you and the website faster and easier. If a website doesn’t use cookies, it will think you are a new visitor every time you move to a new page on the site. For example, even after you log in, the site won’t recognize you or be able to keep you logged in if you move to another page. 

**How does the American Statistical Association use cookies?**

The American Statistical Association uses different types of cookies to enhance and improve your experience. By continuing to browse our site, you are agreeing to our use of cookies. The American Statistical Association uses the following types of cookies: 

  * **Strictly necessary cookies:** These cookies are required for the operation of our website. These include, for example, cookies that enable you to log in to secure areas or use the shopping cart.
  * **Analytical/performance cookies:** These cookies allow us to recognize and count the number of visitors and to see how visitors move around our website when they are using it. This helps us improve the way our website works, for example, by ensuring you are finding what you are looking for easily.
  * **Functionality cookies:** These cookies are used to recognize you when you return to our website. This enables us to personalize our content for you, greet you by name, and remember your preferences (e.g., your mailing and notification preferences).



Note that third parties (e.g., providers of external services like web traffic analysis services) may also use cookies, over which we have no control. These cookies are likely to be analytical/performance cookies or targeting cookies. 

Most internet browsers are initially set up to automatically accept cookies. You can change the settings to block cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent to your device. There are many ways to manage cookies. Help in turning off cookies can be found in your browser or mobile phone help files or at [this website](http://www.usa.gov/optout-instructions.shtml).

## Possible Future Privacy Policies

The policies below are in development, pending use of this website for other activities that might affect privacy. If you have any comments, please feel free to share them with the [webmaster](mailto:webmaster@amstat.org). 

### _Surveys_

Our online surveys may ask visitors for contact information (e.g., an email address) and demographic information (e.g., ZIP code, age, or income level). Responses are kept confidential and are not provided to third parties. If the survey is at the request of a third party who will receive the information, the survey will prominently identify their name and link to their privacy policy. We may use contact data from our surveys to send you information about our association. You may opt out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt out section. Demographic and profile data may be collected on our site. This information is shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis.
