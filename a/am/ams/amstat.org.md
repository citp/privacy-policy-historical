### User Information

Users of this Web site may differ in their access or needs. We recommend that you read this policy in its entirety to understand your and our responsibilities. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Web site.

Our site uses an order form for customers to request information, products, and services. We collect visitors' contact information (such as name and email address) and financial information (such as account or credit card numbers). Financial information that is collected is used to bill the user for products and services. Contact information from the order form is used to send orders, information about our association, and promotional material from some of our partners to our customers. This contact information is also used to get in touch with the customer when necessary. Users may opt out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt out section below.

### Cookie Information

The American Statistical Association uses cookies on this Web site, [www.amstat.org](https://web.archive.org/), when we need to keep track from one screen to another, such as when you log in to href="https://www.amstat.org/membersonly/">Members Only using a password or when you use a shopping cart. A "magic cookie" is a datum sent by our Web server to your Web browser, stored in RAM while your browser is in use, or in a file called something like "cookies" on your machine. Cookies helps keep track of your Web session with [www.amstat.org](https://web.archive.org/). 

Cookies store information that the Web site uses. Some of this information (e.g., last visited Web site, your IP address, the browser and version you use) are available to ANY Web site you visit, regardless of your security settings. This information is built into the Internet and its communication methods and protocols. Generally, you cannot stop this information from going out. Other information is gathered by user input, typically by forms. In other words, a cookie will not know your home phone number unless you give that information to a form or other input device on a Web site.

Some sites are now using cookies to differentiate between repeat users and new users rather than going by general "hit" statistics, which are not very specific. In this way, a Web site administrator can form a clearer picture of how the site is used. Cookies cannot access any other file on your computer. Cookies created by one site will only work with that specific site. Site A, for example, cannot read cookies generated by Site B and then use that information for purposes for which it was not originally intended.

It is the express policy of [www.amstat.org](https://web.archive.org/) that data generated by cookies and related databases will be used only in aggregate form for the purpose of improving the site and site-related services for users. Information from individual cookies will only be accessible to Web site administrators within the ASA office. The aggregated data compiled via cookies and related databases are considered confidential and will not be provided to entities outside of the organization under any circumstances. Our cookies crumble after 24 hours. 

You can manage cookies if you edit your browser Preferences/Internet Options (check the Advanced features). You can also periodically remove the cookies file on your machine. However, if you disallow cookies, you may disable access to advanced functionality on our Web site (members: see next paragraph). For more information on cookies, consult the Help button of your browser or visit other information sources such as the [EPIC Cookies Page](http://www.epic.org/privacy/internet/cookies/) or [Cookie Central](http://www.cookiecentral.com/). See also the [list of cookies pages at Texas Tech University](http://www.tltc.ttu.edu/Library/cookies.htm). 

**ASA members** : Cookies are NOT used to verify your authority to access the [Members Only](https://www.amstat.org/membersonly/) area of our website. However, they ARE used once the authorization has been verified to allow you access to each of page in [Members Only](https://www.amstat.org/membersonly/), and access to secure committee or other official pages where you serve as an officer. In other words, your password is not contained in a cookie, but your authority level is. Your authority to view each page in the member's area is verified at the time you access that page. While you can access the [Members Only](https://www.amstat.org/membersonly/) area of our website without cookies, the quality of your session may be reduced if they are prohibited.

### Possible Future Privacy Policies

The policies below are in development, pending use of this web site for other activities that might affect privacy. If you have any comments, please feel free to share them with [webmaster@amstat.org](mailto:webmaster@amstat.org).

#### Surveys

Our online surveys may ask visitors for contact information (such as email address) and demographic information (like their zip code, age, or income level). Responses are kept confidential and are not provided to any third party. If the survey is at the request of a third party who will receive the information, the survey will prominently identify the name and link to their privacy policy. We may use contact date from our surveys to send the user information about our association. Users may opt out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt out section. Demographic and profile data may be collected at our site. This information is shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis.

#### Public Forums

This site may make chat rooms, list servers, forums, message boards, and/or news groups available to its members. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.
