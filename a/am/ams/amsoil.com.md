We store any information you enter on our website through the actions you take and any submissions you make to forms, menus or other inputs. Examples include the following:

We may also collect technical information to help us identify your device for fraud prevention and diagnostic purposes.

For information about specific devices, see your device manufacturer's support documentation or your carrier's website. If you have questions about how to disable your device's location services, we recommend you contact your mobile service carrier or your device manufacturer. If you have not disabled your device's location services, that information would be available to us

####  How Can My Visit be Associated with Personal Information?

Because AMSOIL associates traffic from our visitors with a leads program for individual AMSOIL Dealers, various methods are employed to ensure that Dealers who are generating traffic to the main corporate website are associated with visitor activity. Internet browser cookies or query string parameters passed through a page URL are typically used to facilitate this association. Their individual uses are as follows: 

  * **Internet Browser Cookies**   
Cookies are unique identifiers that we occasionally transfer to your device to enable our systems to recognize your device and to provide various personalization features, including advertisements on other websites and storage of items in your Shopping Cart between visits. 

The Help feature on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie or how to disable cookies altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-ons' settings or visiting the website of their manufacturer. Because cookies allow you to take advantage of some of the advanced features of the AMSOIL website, we recommend that you leave them turned on. 

  

  * **Query String Parameters Passed in the Page URL**   
The following is an example of a typical URL for the AMSOIL website containing a query string: /shop/by-product/motor-oil/diesel/?filters=81. The bold portion of this URL page address at AMSOIL is passing user preference information to the website and changing the page layout accordingly. 

Parameters such as these are used to customize the user experience at the AMSOIL website by tailoring the content and interaction options available. These parameters are also used to attribute new visitors to AMSOIL.com via the websites of independent AMSOIL Dealers to the appropriate Dealer. Such visitors may be considered "leads" in the system after taking actions such as creating a new online account or requesting more information, and the information they supply will be shared with the Dealers who generated the website traffic. Leads will typically be contacted by a Dealer within one to three business days following a qualifying action. 

  

  * **Log Files**   
We may collect demographic information, such as your ZIP code, age, gender, preferences, interests and favorites, using log files that are not associated with your name or other personally identifying information. We also automatically collect information about your computer hardware and software. This information can include your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring website addresses. This information is used by AMSOIL to maintain the quality of our marketing and product development, and to provide general statistics regarding use of the AMSOIL website. For these purposes, we link this automatically collected data to personal information, such as name, email address, address and phone number. 
  

  * **Third-Party Tracking Technologies**   
The use of cookies and web beacons by any tracking utility company is not covered by our privacy statement. We do not have access or control over these third-party tracking technologies. 
  

  * **Advertising**   
We partner with a third-party ad network to either display advertising on our website or manage our advertising on other sites. Our ad network partner uses cookies and Web beacons to collect various specific information about your activities on this and other websites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests. If you do not want this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt out by clicking here: http://preferences.truste.com/, or by contacting [info@marketing.amsoil.com](mailto:info@marketing.amsoil.com) and requesting that your information be changed or removed from our records. Please note this does not opt you out of being served all advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads delivered by other websites' cookies.

####  How Does AMSOIL Use the Information It Collects?

AMSOIL uses the data we collect to run our business and improve our products, to send communications, and for advertising purposes. The information we collect will only be used in compliance with this Privacy Policy. Furthermore, AMSOIL will never sell your personal information to any third party. 

  * **Use of Personal Information**   
In addition to the uses identified elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, we may use your personal information to (a) improve your browsing experience by personalizing our websites and improve services; (b) send information to you which we think may be of interest to you by post, email or other means; (c) send you marketing communications relating to our business or the businesses of carefully selected third parties which we think may be of interest to you and (d) provide other companies with statistical information about our users. We may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business partners about a particular offer that may be of interest to you. In those cases, we do not transfer your unique personal information to the third party. In addition, we may share data with trusted partners to contact you based on your request to receive such communications, help us perform statistical analysis or provide customer support. Such third parties are prohibited from using your personal information except for these purposes, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information. 
  

  * **Use of Automatic Information**   
We use navigational information to operate and improve the websites and MyAMSOILGarage. We may also use navigational information alone or in combination with personal information to provide you with personalized information about AMSOIL and its products. 
  

  * **Customer Testimonials and Comments**   
We post customer testimonials and comments on our websites that may contain personal information. We obtain each customer's consent via email prior to posting the customer's name and testimonial. 
  

  * **Use of Credit Card Information**   
We use credit card information solely to collect payment from you. We use a third-party service provider to manage credit card processing. This service provider is not permitted to store, retain or use information you provide except for the sole purpose of credit card processing on our behalf. In addition to standard credit card processing, some services we provide to customers allow for automatic reordering of products or renewal of services and memberships. Where such services are provided, customers are presented with the terms and conditions as a prerequisite to enrollment, and have the capability to control which card information is kept on file and to unsubscribe at any time. Any third-party services we allow or accept for payment at our website will also have additional terms and conditions of processing available as part of their respective service agreements.

####  Sharing Information with Third Parties?

We may use third parties, such as independent companies or independent AMSOIL Dealers, to provide services to our customers and visitors to our websites. To this end, we may need to share your information, with your consent or as necessary to fulfill an order or furnish a service you have requested or authorized. Examples may include: 

  * Third-Party Service Providers 



We occasionally use other companies to perform functions and offer services on behalf of AMSOIL and our subsidiary businesses. Examples include oil analysis; Dealer promotional and advertising services such as the Dealer Print Center® and Lowen TM Custom Vehicle Wraps portal; various vendors for order fulfillment purposes and businesses that are involved in computer services for AMSOIL INC. and our subsidiary businesses. Vendors such as these have access to personal information only as needed to perform their functions and are prohibited from using it for other purposes. Additional terms and conditions may apply and are made available as part of each respective third-party service agreement. 

  * Sweepstakes and Contests Managed by Third-Party Providers 



AMSOIL may occasionally use a third-party provider to manage a promotional contest, sweepstakes or giveaway campaign. The third parties involved in these situations will have access to your personal information only as long as the contest is active and only AMSOIL will use the information for prize notification and marketing purposes. Individual contest rules will always be available at the time of entry for more details and opt-out opportunities. 

  * Social, Search and Display Networks 



Ordering online with AMSOIL or engaging in other activities with our digital properties can result in small amounts of personally identifiable information (email, phone number or name) being encrypted and shared anonymously with social and search networks such as Facebook™, Google and Twitter™. You may opt out of any information sharing of this nature by contacting [info@marketing.amsoil.com](mailto:info@marketing.amsoil.com) and requesting that your information be changed or removed from our records.   
In all cases where we share your information with other parties, we explicitly require that party to acknowledge and adhere to our privacy and customer data handling policies. AMSOIL may access, transfer, disclose and/or preserve personal data when doing so is required in order to (1) comply with applicable law or respond to legal inquiries from governmental bodies; (2) protect AMSOIL's customers from harassment or fraud; (3) block or halt attempts at the intrusion of our computer systems or networks; or, (4) protect the property or safety of AMSOIL, its users, or others.

####  How Secure Is My Information with AMSOIL?

A variety of sophisticated security measures are in place at AMSOIL to protect our website visitors, anyone who does business with AMSOIL or any of our affiliated businesses and partners. 

  * We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input. 
  * Credit card numbers and card security codes are required to be re-entered when confirming and processing payment for each online order. AMSOIL retains this information only long enough to transmit the credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing. 
  * We require several examples of personal information as a safeguard to assist with password resetting, account maintenance and the opening of new accounts.
