####  What personal information does AMSOIL gather?

We store any information you enter on our website through the actions you take and any submissions you make to forms, menus or other inputs. Examples include the following: 

  * **Information You Give Us**  
You provide most such information when you search, buy, post, participate in a contest or questionnaire or communicate with customer service. For example, you provide information when you search for a product; place an order through our online store; provide information in your account or profile; communicate with us by phone, email or otherwise; complete a questionnaire or a contest entry form; use our services such as MyAMSOILGarage™; and request information. As a result of those actions, you might supply us with such information as your name, address, phone number and email address; names of persons or businesses to whom purchases have been shipped, including addresses and phone numbers; email addresses of your associates and other people with whom you share our content; emails directly to us; credit card information or financial information, including Social Security or tax identification numbers, which might be needed if applying for credit or associated with different account types. 
  * **Navigational Information**  
Examples of navigational information we collect and analyze include the Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet; login; email address associated with your activities; password(s) to our services; computer and connection information, such as browser type, version and time zone setting; browser plug-in types and versions; operating system and platform; purchase history; the full Uniform Resource Locator (URL) clickstream to, through and from our website, including date and time; cookie number (when applicable); and pages/products you viewed or searched for during your visit. We may also use browser data such as cookies, Flash cookies (also known as Flash Local Shared Objects) or similar data on certain parts of our website for fraud prevention and other purposes. During some visits we may use software tools such as JavaScript to measure and collect session information, including page response times, download errors, length of visits to certain pages, page interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks and mouse-overs) and methods used to browse away from the page. We may also collect technical information to help us identify your device for fraud prevention and diagnostic purposes. 
  * **Mobile**  
Most mobile devices provide users with the ability to disable location services. These controls are often located in the device's settings menu. For information about specific devices, see your device manufacturer's support documentation or your carrier's website. If you have questions about how to disable your device's location services, we recommend you contact your mobile service carrier or your device manufacturer. If you have not disabled your device’s location services, that information would be available to us. 
  * **Call Center Logs**  
AMSOIL uses voice recording and tracking software for customer service training and improvement. In addition to information we collect on our website, our call recording software monitors all calls to the AMSOIL call center. When you call us to place an order or request technical service assistance, any information provided may be used in future interactions, such as assistance with order completion, answering inquiries or resolving a customer issue. This information may also be used to send you email about our products and services. You can opt out of receiving specific types of email by selecting the "Unsubscribe" link included in each email. We may link information we store with analytics software to personal information you submit at our call center. 
  * **Information from Other Sources**  
Examples of information we receive from other sources include updated delivery and address information from our carriers or other third parties, which we use to correct our records and deliver your next purchase or communication more easily; account information, purchase or redemption information and page-view information from some third parties with which we operate co-branded businesses or for which we provide technical, fulfillment, advertising or other services; search-term and search-result information from some searches conducted through the Web search features offered by Google Analytics; search results and links, including paid listings (such as Sponsored Links); and credit history information from credit bureaus, which we use to help prevent and detect fraud and to offer certain credit or financial services to some customers.

####  How can my visit be associated with personal information?

Because AMSOIL associates traffic from our visitors with a leads program for individual AMSOIL Dealers, various methods are employed to ensure that Dealers who are generating traffic to the main corporate website are associated with visitor activity. Internet browser cookies or query string parameters passed through a page URL are typically used to facilitate this association. Their individual uses are as follows: 

  * **Internet Browser Cookies**   
Cookies are unique identifiers that we occasionally transfer to your device to enable our systems to recognize your device and to provide various personalization features, including advertisements on other websites and storage of items in your Shopping Cart between visits.

The Help feature on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie or how to disable cookies altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-ons’ settings or visiting the website of their manufacturer. Because cookies allow you to take advantage of some of the advanced features of the AMSOIL website, we recommend that you leave them turned on. 

  

  * **Query String Parameters Passed in the Page URL**  
The following is an example of a typical URL for the AMSOIL website containing a query string: http://www.amsoil.com/shop/by-product/motor-oil/diesel/?filters=81. The bold portion of this URL page address at AMSOIL is passing user preference information to the website and changing the page layout accordingly.   
Parameters such as these are used to customize the user experience at the AMSOIL website by tailoring the content and interaction options available. These parameters are also used to attribute new visitors to AMSOIL.com via the websites of independent AMSOIL Dealers to the appropriate Dealer. Such visitors may be considered "leads" in the system after taking actions such as creating a new online account or requesting more information, and the information they supply will be shared with the Dealers who generated the website traffic. Leads will typically be contacted by a Dealer within one to three business days following a qualifying action. 
  

  * **Log Files**  
We may collect demographic information, such as your ZIP code, age, gender, preferences, interests and favorites, using log files that are not associated with your name or other personally identifying information. We also automatically collect information about your computer hardware and software. This information can include your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring website addresses. This information is used by AMSOIL to maintain the quality of our marketing and product development, and to provide general statistics regarding use of the AMSOIL website. For these purposes, we link this automatically collected data to personal information, such as name, email address, address and phone number. 
  

  * **Third-Party Tracking Technologies**  
The use of cookies and web beacons by any tracking utility company is not covered by our privacy statement. We do not have access or control over these third-party tracking technologies. 
  

  * **Advertising**  
We partner with a third-party ad network to either display advertising on our website or manage our advertising on other sites. Our ad network partner uses cookies and Web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this and other websites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests. If you do not want this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt out by clicking here: http://preferences.truste.com/. Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads.

We may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business partners about a particular offer that may be of interest to you. In those cases, we do not transfer your unique personal information to the third party. In addition, we may share data with trusted partners to contact you based on your request to receive such communications, help us perform statistical analysis or provide customer support. Such third parties are prohibited from using your personal information except for these purposes, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information.

We use navigational information to operate and improve the websites and MyAMSOILGarage. We may also use navigational information alone or in combination with personal information to provide you with personalized information about AMSOIL and its products. 
  

  * **Customer Testimonials and Comments**  
We post customer testimonials and comments on our websites that may contain personal information. We obtain each customer’s consent via email prior to posting the customer’s name and testimonial. 
  

  * **Use of Credit Card Information**  
We use credit card information solely to collect payment from you. We use a third-party service provider to manage credit card processing. This service provider is not permitted to store, retain or use information you provide except for the sole purpose of credit card processing on our behalf. In addition to standard credit card processing, some services we provide to customers allow for automatic reordering of products or renewal of services and memberships. Where such services are provided, customers are presented with the terms and conditions as a prerequisite to enrollment, and have the capability to control which card information is kept on file and to unsubscribe at any time.

#### Does AMSOIL share the Information it receives?

Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. We share customer information only as described below, and with subsidiaries AMSOIL controls. Shared Information is subject to this privacy policy or to the requirement that those third parties follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Notice. 

  * **Third-Party Service Providers:**   
We occasionally use other companies to perform functions and offer services on behalf of AMSOIL and our subsidiary businesses. Examples include oil analysis; soil analysis (AGGRAND Natural Fertilizer Division); Dealer promotional and advertising services such as the Dealer Print Center® and Lowen™ Custom Vehicle Wraps portal; various vendors for order fulfillment purposes and businesses that are involved in computer services for AMSOIL INC. and our subsidiary businesses. Vendors such as these have access to personal information only as needed to perform their functions and are prohibited from using it for other purposes. 
  

  * **Sweepstakes and Contests Managed by Third-Party Providers:**   
AMSOIL may occasionally use a third-party provider to manage a promotional contest, sweepstakes or giveaway campaign. The third-parties involved in these situations will have access to your personal information only as long as the contest is active and only AMSOIL will use the information for prize notification and marketing purposes. Individual contest rules will always be available at the time of entry for more details and opt-out opportunities. 
  

  * **Protection of AMSOIL and Others:** We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property or safety of AMSOIL, our users or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. However, this does not include selling, renting, sharing or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this privacy policy.

#### How secure is my information with AMSOIL?

A variety of sophisticated security measures are in place at AMSOIL to protect our website visitors, anyone who does business with AMSOIL or any of our affiliated businesses and partners. 

  * We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input.
  

  * Credit card numbers and card security codes are required to be re-entered when confirming and processing payment for each online order. AMSOIL retains this information only long enough to transmit the credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing.
  

  * We require several examples of personal information as a safeguard to assist with password resetting, account maintenance and the opening of new accounts.

  * As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide information, even though it might be needed to make a purchase or to take advantage of certain AMSOIL.com features.
  

  * You can add or update certain information on pages such as those referenced in the "Which Information Can I Access?" section.
