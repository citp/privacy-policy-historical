# AMS Privacy Statement

**The American Mathematical Society** (AMS) is committed to providing a secure private environment for its members and customers to communicate and carry out transactions online. This page summarizes our current information gathering and dissemination practices.  


### Email Privacy

Your email address will be used only within the AMS. AMS-generated email includes three types of communications: 1) automatically-generated email services to which individuals may subscribe and easily unsubscribe (e.g. article posting and new title notifications), 2) periodic notifications provided as a service to members (e.g. dues renewal information) and/or to others in the mathematical community (e.g. subscription access information) and 3) correspondence with individuals.

We do not sell or rent email addresses to anyone outside the AMS. 

###  You may "Opt-Out"/Choose to be removed from AMS emails:

By email: [cust-serv@ams.org](mailto:cust-serv@ams.org). Or, if you have subscribed to a majordomo (automatically-generated) email notification service, instructions to “unsubscribe” are at the bottom of each message you receive.

By mail: American Mathematical Society, Attn: Membership and Customer Services, 201 Charles Street, Providence, RI 02904, USA

By telephone: 800-321-4267 (U.S. and Canada) or 401-455-4000 (worldwide) 

By fax: 401-331-3842 

### Security

Security falls into two areas: data encryption during transmission and data processing.

The AMS website uses SSL (Secure Sockets Layer, the industry-standard security protocol used to communicate with browsers). Data are strongly encrypted during transmission to ensure that personal and payment information are secure. SSL is used on the AMS Website where individuals register for meetings, purchase products, renew membership, join the AMS, make contributions, and/or subscribe to services. 

Once your information is received at the AMS, procedures are in place to protect it from loss, misuse, or alteration. 

###  Registration and Membership Renewal Forms

Our site's registration and membership renewal forms require users to give us contact information (e.g. name and email address), method of payment, unique identifiers (such as AMS membership codes), and, sometimes, demographic information. We use contact information from the registration forms to contact you when necessary. The unique identifiers are used to verify the user's identity and to establish account numbers in our record system. Information regarding method of payment is collected for member enrollment and renewal, and to process orders for products and services.

Demographic information about individuals (ascertained from communications, transactions or surveys) is kept confidential and is used by the AMS only in compiling statistical information in the aggregate about and for the mathematical community. 

###  **E-Commerce**

The AMS Bookstore provides an order form for customers. We collect contact information (e.g. email address) and method of payment. Contact information from the order form is used to process orders and to send information about the organization, products, and services. User payment information that is collected is used to check the users' qualifications and to bill the user for products and services. 

###  **Use of Cookies**

A cookie is a piece of data that is stored by your browser. The AMS uses cookies for two purposes: to keep track of your shopping cart and to maintain user session identity. 

The cookie function on your browser may be disabled or the contents erased. Consult your browser help for instructions. Certain functions of the AMS website that require user identification depend on cookies being accepted by your browser. 

###  **Use of IP Addresses**

The AMS uses IP addresses for two purposes: to help diagnose problems with our server in order to best administer our website, and to verify access by a licensed subscriber (for publications that require license agreements, such as AMS journals and MathSciNet). 

Aggregate data such as domain names (not email addresses) are collected to record the number of hits on a page and to compile usage statistics. 

###  **How to tell if a Website is secure**

SSL-capable browsers have a symbol on the browser window that indicates a secure mode: 

  * Netscape 1.2, 2.0, and 3.0 have a complete key in the lower left when in a secure area; the key is broken in a normal area. 
  * Netscape Communicator 4.0 has an closed lock in the lower left corner when in a secure area; they lock is open in a normal area. 
  * Microsoft Internet Explorer has a closed lock in the lower right 

In addition, the http: portion of the URL has the letter s added so it reads https: 

### External Links

The AMS website provides links to other sites as a service to the mathematical community. The AMS is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites. 

### Public Forums

The AMS provides the server for other mathematics-related organizations (Young Mathematicians Network and Association for Women in Mathematics), who on their websites manage or moderate some mathematics-related mail lists. Please remember that any information that you disclose on these "listservs" becomes public information and therefore you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information. 

### Third Party Use

The AMS collects names, mailing addresses, job title, and areas of mathematical interest from members, customers, and meeting attendees. This information may be rented in the form of a mailing list to third parties (professional societies, commercial publishers, for example) for one-time use. Promotional and informational materials are subject to approval by the AMS prior to rental of a mailing list. You may choose to not receive promotional mailings by contacting [cust-serv@ams.org](mailto:cust-serv@ams.org). Email addresses are never included in mailing lists. See Email Privacy for more information.
