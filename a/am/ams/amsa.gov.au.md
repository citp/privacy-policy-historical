# Privacy

This is a summarised version of our privacy policy which tells you how we collect and use information. You can read the [complete privacy policy](https://web.archive.org/about-us/who-we-are/guide-our-privacy-policy) here.

## Scope

The condensed privacy policy applies to personal information we collect from you, our clients.

We have adopted the layered privacy policy format. This document provides you with an overview of how we handle your personal information.

## Personal information handling practices

### Collection

We usually collect personal information about individuals directly from those individuals or their authorised representatives. 

We sometimes collect personal information from a third party or from a publicly available source, but only if:

  * the individual has consented to such collection
  * we are required or authorised by law to collect information from someone other than the individual, or
  * it is unreasonable or impracticable to collect the information from the individual.



We only collect personal information for purposes which are related to our functions or activities under [legislation related to and enabling AMSA's operations](https://web.archive.org/about-us/who-we-are/enabling-legislation "Links to the Australian Maritime Safety Authority legislation related to and enabling our operations"), and only when it is necessary for or directly related to such purposes. We only collect information by lawful and fair means.

### Use of personal information collected

Any personal information you choose to provide will only be used for the purpose for which it was provided and will not be disclosed to other persons or organisations without your prior consent unless required by law.

The internet is an insecure medium and users should be aware that there are inherent risks transmitting information across the Internet.

Information submitted unencrypted via electronic mail or web forms may be at risk of being intercepted, read or modified. If you do not wish to email or send an online form to us, you can [send by post](https://web.archive.org/contact-us).

### Use and disclosure

Subject to the following paragraph, we only use and disclose personal information for the purposes for which we collected it—purposes which are directly related to one of our functions or activities.

Beyond this, we do not use personal information, or give personal information about an individual to other Government agencies, private sector organisations or anyone else, unless one of the following applies:

  * the individual has consented
  * the individual would reasonably expect us to use or disclose the information for the secondary purpose and the purpose is related (or directly related in the case of sensitive information) to the purpose for which it was collected
  * we are required or authorised by law or by an order of a court/tribunal
  * we believe that the use or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary for one or more enforcement related activities conducted by, or on behalf of, an enforcement body
  * it will prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat to somebody's life or health, or where it is necessary to assist with the location of a person who has been reported missing
  * it is necessary for the establishment, exercise, or defence of a legal or equitable claim or in relation to an alternative dispute resolution process.



## Data security

We take steps and use up-to-date techniques and processes which meet current government requirements to protect the personal information we hold against loss, unauthorised access, use, modification or disclosure, and against other misuse. These steps include maintaining up-to-date computer and network security systems with appropriate firewalls, access controls and passwords to protect electronic copies of personal information, and securing paper files and physical access restrictions.

When the personal information that we collect is no longer required, we destroy or delete it in a secure manner, in accordance with our Records Disposal Authority _._
