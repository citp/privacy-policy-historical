### Personal Data Collected

AMI defines Personal data as any data about an identified or identifiable natural person, or any information that in combination with other non-personal information can reasonably be used to identify a natural person.

As a part of AMI’s standard business operations with your company, AMI collects personal data, so it may provide services, respond to requests, offer customer support, and fulfill legal, contractual or financial obligations to your company. The type of personal data AMI collects from you depends upon the type of interactions you have with AMI websites and services, including the context of your interactions with AMI, the choices you make (including privacy settings) as well as the products and services you use.

You may choose to voluntarily give personal data to AMI directly in a variety of methods such as through our websites, products, online services, software, apps, tools, and other online and offline services and functionality we provide. When you subscribe to a newsletter, create an account, make a purchase or request information from AMI, we will ask for information related to your business, such as contact name, email address, phone number, company name, billing address, shipping address communication information, company financial information and account ID or credentials in order to fulfill your request. If you attend a trade show or marketing event, or otherwise contact us, you may also voluntarily provide similar personal data.

We may also collect information relating to your use of our websites and our services through the use of various technologies. For example, when you visit our websites, we may log certain information that your browser sends, such as your IP address, browser type and language, access time, and referring web site addresses. We may collect information about the pages you view within our websites and other actions you take while visiting us. In addition, some of our services include technologies that allow us to collect certain information about product use.

We may also collect information that pertains to your company, from other sources, such as vendors. When we do so, we ask the vendors to confirm that the information was legally acquired and that we have the right to obtain it from them before we use it.

### Security Measures

AMI protects the personal data you provide us. Access to personal data is limited to people who need it to perform their job functions and have a need to know. Authorized third-party agents may also need access to some of the personal data. For example, if AMI needs to ship products to customers, it shares the customer's name and address with the shipping company. AMI only provides third-party agents with the minimum amount of information needed to complete the requested transaction.

### How We Use Your Personal Data

We collect and use your personal data to operate our business; for example, to perform accounting, auditing, billing, reconciliation, and collection activities. Other business purposes that depend on use of your personal information include crime or fraud monitoring and prevention, protecting our legal rights, and performing contractual obligations. We also use personal information to contact you to advertise, market and sell AMI products and services in accordance with your communication preferences. As an example, we collect and use your personal data, for the following purposes: 

  * To communicate and provide you with the information you have requested;
  * Process, fulfill and follow up on transactions and requests for products, services, support, and information;
  * Customize the content, products and services that are offered to you;
  * Contact you with information about AMI and affiliated third-parties;
  * Communicate, interact and build our relationship with you for purposes such as marketing and product support;
  * Verify your authority to enter and use our services;
  * Engage in market research and analysis;
  * Measure, analyze and improve our products and services, the effectiveness and user experience of our websites, and our advertising and marketing;
  * Consider an employment application;
  * Comply with legal requirements;
  * Provide targeting advertising, including the use of re-targeting technology; and
  * Deter, detect, and prevent fraud and other prohibited or illegal activities.



We may link or combine information we collect from multiple sources to provide better service to you and to improve our products and services.

### Why You are Required to Provide Personal Data

In general, your provision of any personal data or granting of consent to a processing activity is entirely voluntary. However, there are certain circumstances in which AMI cannot act without processing certain personal data, for example to process your orders, to assist you with use of our products or services, or to provide access to a web offering or newsletter. In these cases, it will not be possible for AMI to provide what you request without the relevant personal information. In some circumstances, AMI may need to terminate your ability to use the services without access to your personal data.

### Sharing of Your Personal Data

AMI is a global organization with business processes, management structures and technical systems that are worldwide.

We may use your personal data as evidence in litigation in which we are involved, to protect the rights or safety of any person or entity, to respond to a judicial process or valid government inquiry or as otherwise required by law.

### Where We Process Personal Data
