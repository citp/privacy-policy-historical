# Amie Street - Privacy Policy

Our privacy policy is designed to let you know what information we collect from you, how that information is used, and how can you tailor your Amie Street experience to your personal preferences. For complete details, please see the [Terms Of Agreement ](https://web.archive.org/userAgreement.php).

## What Information We Collect

We store information that we collect through cookies, log files, and clear gifs to create a "profile" of your preferences. Personally identifiable information is used by Amie Street in order to provide tailored services and to improve the content of the site for you. All userís profiles are initially set to "Do Not Disturb," which means we will only email you regarding administrative matters regarding your account. Should you wish to receive newsletters, information on bands touring in your area, promotions, etc. you have the option to opt-in to those services. Non-personally identifiable, group information may be shared or sold to Amie Street partners. 

## Who We Share Your Information With

For Amie Street users, it is necessary to share billing information with a payment processing company to bill you for your purchases. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any other purposes. We will _never_ charge you for any goods or services without your explicit consent. 

For artists, royalties will be paid through Paypal. Only the information necessary to complete these transactions will be shared.

Amie Street will comply with demands made by law enforcement or other governmental officials, in response to a verified request relating to a criminal investigation.

## Who We Do Not Share Your Information With

With the exception of payment processing companies as listed above, we absolutely do NOT share your personally identifiable information (email address, phone number, first or last name, street address, social security number, or billing information) with ANY third-party or partner unless you explicitly request that we do.

## Customer Service

Based upon the personally identifiable information you provide us, we will send you a welcoming email to verify your username and password. We will also communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, and to manage your account.

Amie Street will never ask for your login, personally identifiable or billing information in emails, instant messages, or pop-ups. If you witness any of these possible scams, ignore them and [inform Amie Street](https://web.archive.org/page/contact).

We take your privacy _very_ seriously; if you feel Amie Street is violating your privacy in any way, please contact us at feedback [at] amiestreet.com
