  To this end, we have prepared the following privacy policy to ensure all 
  measures are taken to protect the interests of our visitors and provide a more 
  pleasant site experience. </span>            
            <p class="style3"><u>INFORMATION COLLECTION</u></p>
            <p class="bolder">SUBMISSION</p>
            <p class="content">During the A1webdirectory.org Submit service, we require information from the user on our order form. A user must provide contact information (such as name amd email).

            <p class="style3"><u>INFORMATION USE </u></p>
            <p class="bolder">PROFILE</p>
            <p class="content"> We store information that we collect through log files, and via the information provided during the A1webdirectory.org submit service, to create a profile of our users. A profile is stored information that we keep on individual users that details their characteristics. Consequently, collected information is tied to the users personally identifiable information to provide offers and improve the user experience. We DO NOT share your profile with other third parties.</p>
            <p class="bolder">LOG FILES</p>
            <p class="content"> Like most standard web site servers we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information.</p>
            <p class="style3"><u>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SITE </u></p>
            <p class="bolder"> SPECIAL OFFERS AND UPDATES</p>
            <p class="content"> Established members will occasionally receive information on products, services, or special deals. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications. </p>
            <p class="bolder">SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENTS</p>
            <p class="content">              On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send users an email. Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications - these communications are not promotional in nature.</p>
            <p class="style3"><u>SHARING</u></p>
            <p><span class="bolder">LEGAL DISCLAIMER</span></p>
            <p>              <span class="content">Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web site.</span></p>
            <p><span class="bolder">THIRD PARTY INTERMEDIARIES</span></p>

            <p> <span class="content">If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.</span></p>
            <p class="content">If, however, we are going to use users’ personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users via email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. However, if users have opted out of all communication with the site, or deleted/deactivated their account, then they will not be contacted, nor will their personal information be used in this new manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our Web site notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post a notice we will also email users, who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.</p>
