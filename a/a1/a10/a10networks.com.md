## Log Data

When you visit the Site, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website ("Log Data"). This Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type or the domain from which you are visiting as Internet domain and host names; operating system types; clickstream patterns; and dates and times that our site is accessed. For most users accessing the Internet from an Internet service provider (or "ISP"), the IP address will be different every time you log on. We use it to monitor use of the Site and the services we offer via the Site and for the Site’s technical administration. 

## Cookies

Like many websites, we also use "cookie" technology to collect additional website usage data and to improve the Site and the services we offer via the Site. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk. We do not use cookies to collect personally identifiable information. However, IP addresses are collected by the use of cookies. We mainly use "session cookies", which enable certain features of the Site and services we offer via the Site, to better understand how you interact with the Site and services we offer via the Site, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on the Site, and to improve the Site and services we offer via the Site. This session cookie is deleted from your computer when you disconnect from or leave the Site. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. 

## Information Sharing and Disclosure

Service Providers. A10 Networks may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate the provision of services via the Site, or to perform certain Site-related services (e.g. hosting and maintenance services, database management and improvement of the Site’s features). We may from time to time share your personally identifiable information with such third parties to administer or complete these tasks. These third parties only have access to your information as necessary to perform their functions and may not use it for any other purpose. 

Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement. A10 Networks may need to access or disclose your personal information to comply with the law or legal process and to exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. 

A10 Networks may share personal information and any additional information available to us in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, and situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Intel's terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.

## Security

A10 Networks is very concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your personally identifiable information.

We will disclose any compromise of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored "personal data" (as defined in applicable state statutes on security breach notification) to you via email or conspicuous posting on this Site in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system. 

## International Transfer

Your information may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. 

## Links to Other Sites

Our Site may contain links to other websites including those of our clients. If you choose to visit an advertiser by "clicking on" a link or other type of advertisement, you will be directed to that third party’s website.

These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. This Privacy Policy addresses the use and disclosure of information that we collect from you through this Site.
