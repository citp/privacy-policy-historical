					<p>

</p><p>
Emergency Preparedness Center takes every precaution to protect our users information. When users submit sensitive information via Emergency Preparedness Center’s website (the “Website”), your information is protected both online and off-line.
</p><p>
When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card numbers), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL.  While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just "surfing."
</p><p>
Security remains the primary concern of on-line consumers. Our site is part of the VeriSign Secure Site Program.  By clicking on the VeriSign logo at the bottom of our web page, you can learn more the security of our web site before you submit any confidential information.
</p><p>
While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users’’ information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information.  Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers’’ information is protected. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment, in an access-controlled room.
</p><p>
If you have any questions about the security at our website, please email us at info@areyouprepared.com to request additional information.
