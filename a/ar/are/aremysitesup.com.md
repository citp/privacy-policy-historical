# Are My Sites Up?

This policy was last updated on April 8, 2013.

Shiftedfrequency developed this service to make it easy for you to be notified and aware of the uptime, downtime and status of your websites. We understand that privacy is important to our online visitors and registered users. We respect your privacy and will take reasonable steps to protect your information as if it was our own. You've given us access to data that is very important to you, and that is very important to us.

**Information Gathering and Usage**  


We collect the e-mail addresses of those who communicate with us via e-mail, aggregate information on what pages consumers access or visit, and information volunteered by the consumer (such as site registrations). The information we collect is used to improve the content of our Web pages and the quality of our service, and is not shared with or sold to other organizations.

It is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Terms of Service of the specific application, or as otherwise required by law.

We transfer information about you if Shiftedfrequency is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, Shiftedfrequency will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

**Cookies**  
Similar to many commercial websites, we use cookies. A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier, that is sent to your browser from a web site's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies are required to use Are My Sites Up. We use cookies to record current session information, but do not require permanent cookies.

**Sharing and disclosure of information**  
We may store your Personal Information in locations outside the direct control of Shiftedfrequency, for instance, on servers or databases co-located with hosting providers. We do not share your information with others in any other way.

**Your Customers**  
We send email to your customers on your behalf, but we will never communicate with them on our own behalf. We only send them the emails and communications that you have set up, and you have full control over the content of the emails, the addresses they are sent from, and turning them on and off.

**Changes and notifications**  
We reserve the right, in our sole and absolute discretion, to make changes to this Policy from time to time. Please review this Policy periodically to check for updates. If any changes are material and/or retroactive, we may provide additional notice and/or an opportunity to “opt-in,” as appropriate under the circumstances.

Shiftedfrequency will provide you with disclosures and alerts regarding this Policy by posting them on our Website and/or by emailing the email address listed in your Stripe account. You agree that electronic disclosures and notices have the same meaning and effect as if we had provided you with a paper copy. Such disclosures and notices in relation to this Policy shall be considered to be received by you within 24 hours of the time it is posted to our Website or emailed to you (unless we receive notice that the email was not delivered).

**Contact us**  
If you have any questions or suggestions about this Privacy Policy or any of our privacy-related practices, please contact us at 774-234-7424.
