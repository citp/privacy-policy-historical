_Personal Information_. “Personal Information” is information that would allow someone to identify or contact you, including, for example, your name, address, telephone number, or email address. Personal Information does not include aggregated information that, by itself, does not permit the identification of individual persons (such as statistics about how many persons visited our Site last month, or how many visitors are male and how many are female).

_Acceptance_. This Privacy Policy is a part of our [Website Terms of Use](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/legal/website-terms-of-use/) and by using the Sites, you agree to be bound by their terms and conditions. This Privacy Policy only addresses activities from our servers. Other sites (including those to which we may link) and other service providers may have their own policies, which we do not control, and thus are not addressed or controlled by this Privacy Policy.  


### (1) Collection of Personal Information

  
You provide certain Personal Information to us when you: (a) register to use the services, (b) register for contests or giveaways, (c) complete questionnaires, (d) order products and services from us, (e) send email messages, submit forms, or send other information to us, or (f) when you use our service and the communication tools.

#### Logging of Chats or Messaging Features

Please note that NCsoft will store all communication exchanged between you and any other person while using any game served by NCsoft. This not only includes “public” chats but also includes all messages exchanged in private chats; “party,” “guild,” or “alliance” chats; as well as all messages sent using the mail system in our game (herein collectively referred to as “Communication Data”).  
Please note that ArenaNet and NCsoft Interactive are not based within the European Union and have their place of business in the United States of America and that by agreeing to this Privacy Policy, you are consenting to the transfer of your Personal Information to the United States of America – please also refer to section 8 of this Privacy Policy. ArenaNet and NCsoft Interactive have also entered into a data processing agreement with NCsoft Europe which ensures adequate safeguards for your Personal Information when it is transferred outside of the European Economic Area.  
The Communication Data will be stored by NCsoft on its own servers which are maintained only by internal IT staff of NCsoft. Staff members have been advised not to access the Communication Data unless expressly requested by NCsoft’s executive management.  
Customer Support, including 3rd party support contractors, and a subset of software development staff may access the Communication Data but only from within the local area network of NCsoft or via a secure, encrypted tunnel from an approved site. Every access to the Communication Data is logged and such log files are controlled on a regular basis for compliance with the rules of the data processing agreement. Any outside access is restricted by technical measures. Physical access to the servers is restricted by physical access controls and identification requirements. Customer Support staff of NCsoft have been instructed to access the Communication Data only upon the receipt of a Customer Support request relating to that specific set of Communication Data. Software development staff of NCsoft have been instructed to access the Communication Data only when necessary to perform development and debugging tasks related to the collection, querying, and parsing of Communication Data for Customer Support related tools. Customer Support and software development staff are instructed not to access Communication Data under any other circumstances. Communication Data is not transferred to any third party under any circumstances unless such disclosure is legally required by law enforcement authorities or by a court order of a US court or a court of a member state of the European Union.  
The Communication Data is stored as long as it is required to provide customer support. Unless any Communication Data is used to aid a customer’s support request, or is used to investigate a breach of the User Agreement (or any other agreement) between you and NCsoft or is the subject of a request from law enforcement authorities, all Communication Data is deleted after two months. Mail sent to other players outside of the control of NCsoft may be stored longer depending on the time the recipient deletes the mail from his inbox.  
Should you have any questions in relation to the logging of chats or messaging features you may contact either NCsoft Europe or ArenaNet at [Privacy@Arena.Net](mailto:Privacy@Arena.Net)

#### Use of Email Address

Your email address will be used to contact you regarding specific issues related to your active account(s). You may also receive special notices and offers for products and services offered by NCsoft. You will be given the opportunity to “opt out” of any mailings that do not include critical information regarding your active game account(s).  
Please see “Sweepstakes, Contests and Promotions, and Related Third-Party Services” below for specific information on how your Personal Information may be used by third parties in those special cases.

#### Payment Method

You will also be asked to submit Personal Information depending on the payment method you choose when accessing, purchasing or subscribing to one of our products or services. For example, if you choose to pay for NCsoft products or services by credit card, you will be required to provide us the name of your credit card issuer, credit card number, billing address, CVV number, and expiration date.  
If you choose to pay for NCsoft products or services and/or the services NCsoft performs on behalf of its affiliates by using, without limitation, cheque, PayPal, SMS, paysafecard, Gem cards, Game Time Cards, or ELV, you will be required to provide us with applicable Personal Information in order to permit us to process such payment.

#### Non-personal Information

In addition to the login information, we will automatically collect certain non-personal information about your use of our Sites and services. We might collect, among other things, information concerning the type of Internet browser, computer, or computer operating system you are using, the domain name of your Internet service provider, your “click path” through the Sites, and the web site or advertisement that was linked to or from the Sites when you visited. To do this, we may use cookies and other technology (see below).  
Your visits to our Sites, and information provided through these technologies, will be anonymous unless you provide us with Personal Information or have provided such information in the past. For example, if you’ve created a membership account, your account information (including name, email address, and billing and shipping information) may be linked to the items you purchased at our online store (i.e., purchase order history).  
This information is only used for our internal purposes (such as to improve the Site or to customize content).

#### Cookies and Related Technologies

We use a feature of your browser called a “cookie” to assign a unique number that automatically identifies your computer when you visit our Site. A cookie is a piece of text-only data stored on your hard drive. By setting a cookie on our Site, you would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our Site.  
If you reject the cookie, you may still use our Site. The only drawback to this is that you may be limited in some areas of our Site, or may have to enter passwords or identifying information more than once.

#### Sweepstakes, Contests and Promotions, and Related Third Party Services

To participate in some of our sweepstakes, contests, surveys, or other promotions, you may be asked to provide additional Personal Information such as your mailing address. In each such case, no new Personal Information will be collected from you without your consent. This information may be collected by NCsoft or by third parties such as co-sponsors or vendors for the promotion.  
Our use of any such information will be governed by this Privacy Policy. The names of third parties such as co-sponsors (other than vendors hired by NCsoft to conduct, administer, and execute a promotion on behalf of NCsoft) will be disclosed to you when you are asked to sign up for the promotion. You should review such third parties’ privacy policies to see how they may use any information that they collect.  
Certain NCsoft services, sweepstakes, and/or contests, may be provided to you in conjunction with a third party. During the registration process for any such sweepstakes, contests, surveys, and other promotions or service(s) related to such games, you may be notified that such third party wishes to access some of your Personal Information.  
In such a situation, you will be given an opportunity to decline to share that information with that third party before any such information is shared. If you decline to share such information with the relevant third party, you may not be able to participate in such sweepstakes, contests, surveys, and other promotions or service(s) for that game.  
As described in the registration process, a third party’s use of the shared Personal Information will be governed by any privacy policy that company may have in place and our use of such information shall, of course, be governed by the terms of this Privacy Policy.

#### Online Communications, Games

When you play any of the games offered and/or served by NCsoft, or use any of the communication features on the Sites, your IP address (the Internet protocol address from which you access any of the above) may be stored in our records.  
When any game is updated or “patched,” our patch routine may check your computer to see that you have the most recent version of game-specific files; when you communicate within any game or any other communication feature within any of our Sites (e.g. live chat, instant message services, and the like), even “privately” to another person, you do so with the understanding that those communications go through our servers, can be monitored by us, you have no expectation of privacy in any of those communications and, accordingly, you expressly consent to monitoring of communications (including technical support and customer service communications) that you send and receive.  
When you log into one of our online games, your system specifications—such as OS, RAM, video card, monitor, system configuration, etc.—may be reviewed/recorded by us for the purposes of analyzing and optimizing your game experience and in order to provide you with customer service.  


### (2) Who Collects the Personal Information

  
NCsoft Europe is the company that collects Personal Information on our Site. Personal Information is then processed on behalf of NCsoft Europe by (and is therefore transferred to) ArenaNet and NCsoft Interactive. Our mailing address is 5th Floor, Mocatta House, Trafalgar Place, Brighton BN1 4DU, UK. Our customer service email address is [Privacy@Arena.Net](mailto:Privacy@Arena.Net).  


### (3) How the Personal Information Is Used

  
Personal Information which we collect for a particular purpose will only be saved and used for that purpose, unless you have agreed to allow us to use it for some other purpose, as described in this Privacy Policy. In relation to our use of Communication Data please see above for a more detailed overview.  
For example, if you make an online purchase from our online store, and unless you have given us permission to do otherwise, we will only collect and save the Personal Information you provided to us, including your billing and delivery information, in order to:

  1. Complete the sale>
  2. Comply with tax and other applicable statutes>
  3. Maintain accurate business and financial records (in accordance with accepted standards)>
  4. Assist with customer service and returns>



When you have provided Personal Information to us for a particular purpose, we may disclose your information to other companies that we have engaged to assist us in fulfilling your request. This may include, but is not limited to, fulfillment houses, billing services, transaction managers, credit verification services, and other third-party service providers.  
We may also disclose any of your Personal Information to law enforcement or other appropriate third parties in connection with criminal investigations, investigation of fraud, infringement of intellectual property rights, or other suspected illegal activities, or as otherwise may be required by applicable law, or, as we deem necessary in our sole discretion, in order to protect the legitimate legal and business interests of NCsoft.  
We may use the information we collect from you for the purpose of providing you with technical support, customer service, and account maintenance. We use the information we collect to learn what you like, tailor your experience accordingly, and to improve web sites and our other products. We send e-mail to our members who want to receive e-mail from us.  
However, if you don’t want to receive e-mail from us, you can “opt out” of receiving it at the time you register as a member on our Sites or each time we request information from you. If you change your mind and wish to stop receiving e-mails from us, you may also choose to opt out by following the steps described in each such e-mail.  
Except as described in this Privacy Policy, we will not give any of your Personal Information to any third party without your express approval, and the only Personal Information we will ask you if you want us to share with third parties is your name, your mailing address, and your e-mail address.  
If you don’t want us to share your name, mailing address, and e-mail address, you can tell us that by clicking on “No” in the box at the time you register as a member on the Site or each time we request information from you or at other points. We sometimes share general, demographic, or aggregated (not personal) information with third parties about our user base, but that information does not include any Personal Information.  
You will be deemed to have consented to the disclosure to, and use by, a subsequent owner or operator of the Sites, of any Personal Information contained in the NCsoft database for such Site(s), if NCsoft or one of its companies assigns all of its rights and obligations regarding the use of your Personal Information at the time of a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, sale of all or substantially all of NCsoft ‘s game(s) or other assets to a subsequent owner or operator, or similar event.  
Please do not use your real name or the real name of another person when selecting a user name. Please note that your user name will be available to the Internet’s general public while you participate in some services, like forums, chat rooms, or message boards, so you should exercise discretion when using these services. Personal Information disclosed by you within our chat areas, instant message service, message boards, or during game play can be collected by other users of such services and may result in unsolicited messages.  
We are not responsible for protecting such information that you may disclose to third parties through our services (e.g. sending your address to another user through the chat service). To the extent that you create a public profile that may be available to others on our Sites and services, you solely are responsible for its content and accuracy at all times. To edit, change, or delete such information, follow the instructions on the Site.  


### (4) Privacy Protections for Children

  
In order to protect the privacy interests of younger Internet users, we do not allow children under the age of 18 to use our services without the consent of their parents. NCsoft complies with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act and all other applicable laws and regulations concerning children and the Internet.

#### Children under the age of 13

Because our Sites are not directed to children under the age of 13, NCsoft does not provide memberships to persons under age 13. If you are under the age of 13, you may not create an account on the Site, you may not sign up for any subscription service or buy anything through our online store, and you are not eligible to enter any of our sweepstakes or promotions.  
Except as may be required by law, NCsoft will not knowingly collect, maintain, or disclose any Personal Information from children under the age of 13.

#### Children between the ages of 13 and 18

Don’t post your real name on a web site, forum, or message board, and never tell anyone online anything private about yourself or your family, including your phone number and/or address. Use screen names and not real names at all times.  
If you win a sweepstakes that has a prize, your parent or guardian will have to mail or fax us a signed note at the address or fax number listed in the rules for the specific contest that says it was OK for you to enter, and tells us they will accept the prize for you.  
Some areas of the Site may have special rules for children under the age of 18. When you are in those areas, you must follow those rules.

#### Information for Parents/Guardians

If you are a parent or guardian who has discovered that your child has submitted his or her Personal Information without your permission or consent, NCsoft will take reasonable steps to remove that information from the NCsoft database at your request.  
To request removal of your child’s information, please send us an e-mail (to the address below) and be sure to include in your message the same user name, password, and email address that your child submitted. If your child has used your credit card on our Sites without your permission, contact us immediately at [Privacy@Arena.Net](mailto:Privacy@Arena.Net)  


### (5) The Choices Available to Users Regarding Collection, Use, and Distribution of Personal Information

  
Please note that if you provide any information on your own or directly to parties who provide service to our Site or any other sites you encounter on the Internet (even if these sites are branded with our branding), different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the Personal Information you disclose to them. We encourage you to investigate and ask questions before disclosing information to third parties.  


### (6) How users can correct any inaccuracies in their Personal Information

  
To review and update your Personal Information stored with NCsoft, please access your applicable account.  
If you change your mind and do not want to receive e-mails from us and/or have us share your name and e-mail address (or other Personal Information) with third parties, you may send an e-mail to us at [Privacy@Arena.Net](mailto:Privacy@Arena.Net)  
If you choose to have your Personal Information removed from our active databases, we will do so within a reasonable time after receipt of your request and we will take reasonable steps to ensure that your Personal Information is not used (except as may be required by law) by NCsoft after your notification to us.  


### (7) The Security Procedures We Use to Protect the Loss, Misuse, or Alteration of Your Personal Information Under Our Control

  
NCsoft takes precautions to protect our users’ information. When users submit sensitive information via our Site, that information is protected both online and off-line.  
We have established and maintain reasonable security procedures to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of your Personal Information. We use encryption, Secure Socket Layers, and other technical measures (such as off-site backup, security testing, and password protection), and we implement off-line efforts to further protect this information, including limiting employee access to Personal Information and updating our employees regarding our security practices and privacy policies. Please recognize, however, that “perfect security” does not exist on the Internet.  
If you have any questions about the security at our website or facilities, you can send an email to [privacy@arena.net](mailto:privacy@arena.net).  


### (8) Information for people in the European Union

  
By consenting to this Privacy Policy, you confirm that your command and knowledge of English (or in some cases, French, German, or Spanish) is sufficient to understand the terms and conditions set forth herein.  
We will not collect any Personal Information from you unless you provide it voluntarily by providing us with your freely given specific and informed consent. By agreeing to this Privacy Policy, you agree that we may transfer your Personal Information to NCsoft group companies outside the European Economic Area (to the United States of America and/or Korea) in connection with the purposes stated in this Privacy Policy.  


### (9) Notices of changes to the Privacy Policy

  
NCsoft reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time by notifying registered users via e-mail of the existence of a new Privacy Policy and/or posting the new Privacy Policy on the NCsoft Sites. All changes to the Privacy Policy will be effective when posted, and your continued use of any NCsoft Site, product or service after the posting will constitute your acceptance of, and agreement to be bound by, those changes.
