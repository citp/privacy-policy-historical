### Your Information

We do not directly collect or store personal information about you during your visit.

We do, however, use third-party advertising companies to help pay for the running costs of the site. These companies may employ a degree of user tracking, as detailed below.

### Advertising and Cookies

Thousands of websites, including this one, use third parties to provide their advertising. The providers used on this site are Google Adsense and Criteo.

Wherever such adverts are displayed, advertisers may attempt to place cookies (small data files) on users' computers to help target and tailor its advertising. It is likely you have already visited many websites that feature such adverts, and that cookies have already been placed on your device. If this is the first site featuring adverts that you have visited, new cookies may be created on your device as a result of your visit.

By using cookies and user tracking, advertisers are able to offer adverts that are more relevant and more interesting to individual users. However, you are able to control what you share with advertisers and we encourage you to:

  * Make use of the 'AdChoices' icon displayed in the corner of every advert, to review or change your privacy settings.
  * Find out about cookies and how you can control them by visiting: [www.aboutcookies.org](http://www.aboutcookies.org/).
