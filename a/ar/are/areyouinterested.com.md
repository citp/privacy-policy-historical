AreYouInterested?® Privacy Policy

### AreYouInterested?® Privacy Policy

SNAP Interactive, Inc. (“AreYouInterested?®”, “we” “us”) has developed this Privacy Policy which details important information regarding the use and disclosure of user information collected on the AreYouInterested?® and SNAP Interactive Sites found at [www.snap-interactive.com](http://www.snap-interactive.com/) (“Site”), [www.areyouinterested.com](http://www.areyouinterested.com/) and other AreYouInterested?® properties including, but not limited to, our Facebook application and our mobile application (The Site and other AreYouInterested?® properties are collectively referred to herein as “AreYouInterested?® Applications”). AreYouInterested?® provides this Privacy Policy to help you make an informed decision about whether to use or continue using the services accessed through its AreYouInterested?® Applications (“Services”).

This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to the Terms of Use found at <http://snap-interactive.com/tos> (“Terms”). Each time that you access or use AreYouInterested?® Applications, you signify that you agree to be bound by the Terms and this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the Terms of this Privacy Policy, you must discontinue accessing the Services available through the AreYouInterested Applications.

**I. INFORMATION WE COLLECT**

**Contacting Us.** When you provide us with information in connection with a particular activity or otherwise sign up for our Services or provide your contact information, including an email address or telephone number in connection with that activity, product or service, you agree that this action constitutes a purchase or inquiry establishing a business relationship with us. You expressly consent to our communicating future information with you about our Services using the information you provided to us. You also attest that you have the legal authority over any telephone number you provide to us and can provide us with the authorization to contact you. This means we may contact you, in person or by recorded message, by e-mail, telephone and/or mobile telephone number (including use of automated dialing equipment), text (SMS) message, or any other means of communication that your wireless or other telecommunications device may be capable of receiving.  
****

**Information Provided by You and Imported from Facebook.** We will collect personal information from you when you sign up for our Service, interact with AreYouInterested?® Applications, update your profile, interact with other users, and use various features of our AreYouInterested?® Applications. By clicking “Allow” on the Facebook permission authorization we will automatically import your Facebook user ID and first name into your AreYouInterested?® profile. Once in your AreYouInterested?® profile that information may be used across any AreYouInterested?® Applications. When signing up for our Service we will also use the information regarding your date of birth provided to Facebook for eligibility purposes but do not display that information to other users. Other than your Facebook ID and name, we will only incorporate the information you request to be imported from your Facebook profile (collectively, “Permitted Facebook Profile Content”) into your AreYouInterested?® profile.  
****

**Geolocation.** We maintain information you provide about your location in order to assist you in finding other users within your geographic location and will maintain information about your location to facilitate your search. In addition, when you have the geolocation software running on your mobile phone, computer or other device, we may collect that information as controlled by your privacy settings. AreYouInterested?® never shows the exact latitude & longitude or exact location of our users on our AreYouInterested?® Applications but we do update and store your location each time you visit the AreYouInterested?® Applications, maintaining only the location of your last location in order to show more relevant search results on “Browse Screen” and “Online Now” chat room. Members can update the search filter distance from “Browse Filter” to expand their location for other viewers. On your AreYouInterested?® Profile approximate distance in miles are disclosed from where you log in based upon the geolocation from your mobile device. On our Site we show approximate location of our iPhone “Online Now” users.

**Registration Information**. We will collect personal information from you when you register, update your profile, interact with other users, and use various features of our AreYouInterested?® Applications.  By signing up, you give us permission to store and display user information you have provided in order to provide the best possible experience on the AreYouInterested?® Applications.

**Billing Information.** We collect and store billing and certain credit card information.  This information will only be shared with third parties who perform tasks required to complete the purchase transaction.

**Surveys and Promotions**. From time-to-time we may request information from you and other users via surveys or contests or sweepstakes.  Participation in these surveys, contests or sweepstakes is completely voluntary so you and other users have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and address), and demographic information (such as zip code). Contact information may be used to notify the winners and award prizes and file winners information as required by law. Survey information will be used for the purpose(s) of the survey, including the monitoring or improvement of the use and satisfaction of AreYouInterested?® Applications.

**User Generated Content.** Please remember that any information you disclose while participating on the public e-mail services, chat areas and/or other message, communication or other interactive forums accessed through the AreYouInterested?® Applications.  Please remember that any information you disclose while participating on the public e-mail services, chat areas and/or other message, communication or other interactive forums accessed through the AreYouInterested?® Applications which are designed to enable you to communicate with others or to post content on the Sites (“Communication Services”), becomes public information, becomes the property of, and is subject to redistribution by, AreYouInterested?®.  You should exercise caution and discretion when deciding to disclose your personal information in a submission or posting. There is no expectation of privacy when playing, posting, or otherwise participating on the Communication Services.  If you post content, such as messages, photos and videos, please be aware that any personally identifiable information contained in such content is accessible to registered users or visitors to that AreYouInterested?® Application or Communication Service and we have no control over how those users may use your personally identifiable information.  We have the right, but not the obligation, to monitor any activity and content associated with the Communication Services.  We reserve the right to take action in connection with any content we deem to be inappropriate.  Please review our Terms of Use for more information regarding your appropriate use of these areas.

**Information Collected Through Technology.** In addition to any personal information or other information that you choose to submit to us, we and our third-party service providers may use a variety of technologies that automatically (or passively) collect certain information whenever you visit or interact with the AreYouInterested?®  Applications (“Usage Information”).  This may include the browser that you are using, the URL that referred you to the AreYouInterested?®  Applications, all of the areas within the AreYouInterested?®  Applications that you visit, and the time of day, among other information.  We may use this Usage Information for a variety of purposes, including to enhance or otherwise improve the AreYouInterested?®  Applications.  In addition, we collect your IP address or other unique identifier (“Device Identifier”) for your computer or other device used to access the AreYouInterested?®  Applications (any, a “Device”).  A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to the device used to access the AreYouInterested?®  Applications, and our computers identify your device by its Device Identifier.  Usage Information may be non-identifying or may be associated with you.  Whenever we associate Usage Information or a Device Identifier with your personal information, we will treat it as personal information.

A few of the tracking technologies that may be used to collect Usage Information include, without limitation, the following:

**_Cookies._** A cookie is a data file placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Site.  We use cookies to collect information for record keeping purposes, to make it easier to navigate the Site.  Cookies are stored on users’ hard drives.  We use both “session ID cookies” and “persistent cookies.”  Session ID cookies are used to store information while a user is logged into the Site and expire when the user closes his/her browser.  Persistent cookies are used to make tasks like logging into the Site easier for returning users by remembering a user’s login information.  Persistent cookies stay on a user’s hard drive from one session to the next.  Flash cookies, known as  local shared objects, are data files placed on a Device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your Device to personalize your visit.  Our third-party service providers also may use Flash cookies to collect and store information.  Flash cookies are different from standard browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored. Cookies may be used for many purposes, including, without limitation, remembering you and your preferences and tracking your visits to our web pages.  You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a persistent or session cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off such cookies through your browser settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies.  However, cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies. To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies, please click [www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html).  If you choose to disable cookies on your Device, some features of the Site may not function properly.

**_Web Beacons._** **** Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as “1×1 GIFs” or “clear GIFs”) may be included in our web pages and messages.  Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a web page or e-mail can act as a web beacon.  Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to our Sites, to monitor how users navigate the Sites, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed. ****

**_Embedded Scripts_** **.** An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the AreYouInterested?®  Applications, such as the links you click on.  The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Sites, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter. ****

**_HTML5._** **** We use HTML5 in some of our applications, including in our mobile website for the iphone or ipad.  HTML5 has browser web storage that does not rely on traditional browser cookies.  Like Flash cookies, HTML5 cookies are not stored in a browser “cookies” file and, like Flash cookies, can be used to track users across websites.  To our knowledge there is currently no known way for a user of a mobile device to remove HTML5 tracking and storage. ****

**_Web Logs._** Like most standard website servers, we log IP addresses (a unique number assigned to every computer on the Internet) and device identification in order to improve security, analyze trends and administer the AreYouInterested?®  Applications.  We may track your movement within the AreYouInterested?®  Applications, the pages from which you were referred, access times and browser types.  This information may include the browser you are using, the Internet address from which you linked to our AreYouInterested?®  Applications, the operating system of your computer, the unique IP address of the computer or device identification from the mobile device that you used to access our AreYouInterested?®  Applications and usage and browsing habits.  We use this information in the aggregate to gauge the effectiveness, usage, and popularity of our AreYouInterested?®  Applications, track information for statistical purposes, help diagnose and troubleshoot server malfunctions, analyze trends, track user movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information.  We may also use individual information we collect through web logs to send you targeted offers and other communications.

**Information You Provide About a Third Party.** If you send someone else a communication from the AreYouInterested?®  Applications, such as sending an invitation to a friend, the information you provide (names, e-mail addresses, etc.) is used to facilitate the communication and is not used for any other marketing purpose unless we obtain consent from that person or we explicitly say otherwise.  If that person becomes a member, his/her information will be treated in the same manner as all other members.  Please be aware that when you use any send-to-a-friend functionality on the AreYouInterested?®  Applications, your e-mail address may be included in the communication sent to your friend.

**Information We Collect From Third Parties.** We acquire information from other trusted sources to update or supplement the information you provided or we collected automatically, such as information to validate or update your address or other demographic and lifestyle information.  We use this information to help us maintain the accuracy of the information we collect, to target our communications so that we can inform you of products, services and offers that may be of interest, and for internal business analysis or other business purposes.

**II. THIRD PARTY ANALYTICS TECHNOLOGIES AND ADVERTISING**

**Third Party Analytic Tools.** We use third parties’ analytic tools to better understand who is using the AreYouInterested?®  Applications, how people are using the AreYouInterested?®  Applications and how to improve the effectiveness of the AreYouInterested?®  Applications and its content, and to help those parties serve more targeted advertising to you across the Internet, on third party websites, mobile applications, and sometimes on AreYouInterested?® Applications.  Those third party companies may use cookies, pixel tags or other technologies to collect and store anonymous information such as time of visit, pages visited, time spent on each page of the AreYouInterested?® Applications, Device Identifiers, type of operating system used and other web sites you may have visited.  They might combine information they collect from your interaction with AreYouInterested?® Applications with personal information they collect from other sources.  You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third parties to see your options for opting out of their use of such devices.  If you would like more information regarding which third party companies we use who may be serving cookies or other tracking tools on our AreYouInterested?®  Applications for this purpose or want to know more about your choices about not having anonymous information collected or used by these companies, please review the list at the end of this Privacy Policy.

**Our Ads on Third Party Sites**.  We may use information collected using third party cookies and Web beacons on AreYouInterested?® Applications and in our e-mails to deliver advertising about our Services displayed to you on third party websites.  We also may use cookies to collect information to know when you return to our AreYouInterested?® Applications after visiting those third party websites.  We use this information and other information about you, to try to understand your interests and show you relevant advertising about our Services which you might be interested in.  This Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, ad servers or ad networks we use to display our ads on other websites.  Some of the ad servers and ad networks we use to display our ads may be members of the Network Advertising Initiative which offers a single location to opt-out of ad targeting from member companies.  If you would like more information about advertisers’ use of tracking technologies and about your option not to accept these cookies you can go to [www.networkadvertising.org](http://www.networkadvertising.org/).  If you would like to learn more about how interest-based information is collected to serve advertising on the internet you can go to [www.aboutads.info](http://www.aboutads.info/).
