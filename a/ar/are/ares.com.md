About ARES.COM and Your Privacy 

What We Track 

Ares.com's web site does not issue tracking cookies; we track only the number of people who visits each of our pages through **[Google Analytics](http://analytics.google.com/)** , which probably does issue tracking cookies -- but they don't share individual information with us. 

We also save our web server logs, which include the IP addresses through which we are visited (that may be your Internet Service Provider's IP address, or your company's, for example). However, we **only** use these logs for internal purposes, and we do not share those logs with any outside companies 1. 

This means that your privacy is safe from us;   and that's our policy. 

The Ares Product 

To use the Ares product, which you can download from our [**Home Page**](https://web.archive.org/web/20091231134253id_/http%3A//ares.com/index.html), you will have to register it. The information you provide during registration is collected by the company that maintains and supports Ares, a [**separate company**](http://ares.com/ares_devel). They don't share this registration information with us. Their privacy policy can be found [**on their web site**](http://ares.com/ares_priv). 

Third-Party Links 

Several pages on our web site contain third-party advertising; whenever you click on an ad on our web site, you leave our site. We have no control over what happens on that web site, including how they treat your privacy. 

[Google Ads](http://adsense.google.com/)

Recently (April 8, 2009) Google started a new program where they try to serve ads that are more relevant to the people who see them. To do this they now use something they call "[ **DoubleClick DART cookie**](http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/faq.aspx)" (click the link for more information). This is [**what they say**](https://www.google.com/adsense/support/bin/answer.py?answer=100557) about it:   
 

  * Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on our site. 
  * Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to our users based on their visit to our sites and other sites on the Internet. 
  * Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the [**Google ad and content network privacy policy**](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html). 



  
Another way of saying this, is: 

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information ( ** _not_** including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, click [**here**](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html). 

Please understand that this functionality is outside our control, and nothing we do ourselves affects your privacy in any way. If you feel these policies are inappropriate, you should contact Google directly. 

When You Contact Us 

Whenever you contact us (by email or by filling out a form on our website), the contents of your email or the information you place in the form are considered a confidential communication, and will be treated as such. Anything you write to us will be kept private, will only be seen by those who need to, and won't be shared any more than is necessary to properly handle your communication 2. 

This applies also to emails that have been sent to us by accident, whehter by entering the wrong address in the email or by contacting us in place of [**some other company whose name contains "Ares"**](https://web.archive.org/web/20091231134253id_/http%3A//ares.com/OtherARESes.html). 

1, 2 If we are presented with a valid Court order that requires us to disclose any information we have, we expect to comply.
