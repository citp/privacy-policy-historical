# Arturia - Privacy policy

_Last revised: September 25, 2019_

At Arturia, we care about your privacy. For this reason, we collect and use personal data only as it might be needed to help us deliver our services to you. We also need information about you when you use our softwares and our licensing software, Arturia Software Center ("ASC").

Personal data is defined by the General Data Protection Regulation (EU Regulation 2016/679 modifying the Act n°78-17 of 6 January 1978 on information technology, data files and civil liberties) (the “GDPR”) as ‘any information relating to an identifiable person who can be directly or indirectly identified in particular by reference to an identifier’. Personal data is, in simpler terms, any information about you that enables you to be identified. Personal data covers obvious information such as your name and contact details, but it also covers less obvious information such as identification numbers, electronic location data, and other online identifiers.

Our Privacy Policy is intended to describe to you how and what data we collect, and how and why we use your personal data. It also describes options we provide for you to access, update or otherwise take control of your personal data that we process.

## 1\. Information About Arturia

Arturia, société par actions simplifiée having its registered located 26, avenue Jean Kuntzmann 38330 Montbonnot Saint Martin, registrered at the Grenoble RCS under n° 423 302 421 [VAT number: FR56423302421.]

This inbox is actively monitored and managed so that we can deliver an experience that you can confidently trust.

Likewise, we’ve also created a [Privacy Center](https://www.arturia.com/support/privacycenter) to provide answers to your most common questions, quick links to access your MyArturia settings, instructions on how to exercise certain rights that might be available to you, and the list of third parties and partners we may share some of your personal data.

Your acceptance of this Privacy Policy is deemed to occur upon your first use of our Site. You will also be required to read and accept this Privacy Policy when signing up for an account or purchasing any of our products or services. If you do not accept and agree with this Privacy Policy, you must stop using Site immediately.

## 2\. What Personal Data do we collect?

We collect information so that we can provide the best possible experience when you use our services. Much of the mandatory personal data, usually indicated with an asterisk (the symbol *) is collected directly from you when you:

  * Purchase any of our services (ex: billing information, including first and last name, address, phone number in case of physical purchases)
  * Create an account (first and last name, email address, country)
  * Register a product (serial number and unlock code of the product)
  * Request assistance from our support team (first and last name, email address, phone number)
  * Complete contact forms or request newsletters or other information from us (first and last name, email address)
  * Participate in contests and surveys, apply for a job, or otherwise participate in activities we promote that might require information about you.



When participating in any of these activities, other optional information may be asked of you. Any data input not followed by an asterisk is optional. If you do not wish to provide us with this information, you are free to leave the field blank. We also collect additional information when delivering our services to you to ensure necessary and optimal performance. These methods of collection may not be as obvious to you, so we wanted to highlight and explain what these might be, as they vary from time to time, and how they work. These methods are detailed below:

**Account related information** is collected in association with your use of our services, such as purchases, data linked to registration, transfer, activation and deactivation, be it online or offline of our products through the means of the Arturia Software Center. This usage data can be shared with other Arturia services, such as information requests, customer service requests, and notes or details explaining what you asked for and how we responded.

**Data from the Arturia Software Center (ASC)** is collected in order to permit the use of our software. This mandatory data includes the used device name, its OS, CPU and RAM information, IP address and a custom unique identifier. The Arturia Software Center lets you optionally share usage information of our services. If you choose to accept this, it may send us the usage frequency of the Arturia licensed software titles activated on the machine, the version of the software titles and the Digital Audio Workstation ("DAW") in which you use it. This information lets us tailor our services to match our customers needs, so that you receive the best experience possible.

## 3\. How we utilize Personal Data

Under the GDPR, we must always have a lawful basis for using personal data. This may be because the data is necessary for our performance of a contract with you, because you have consented to our use of your personal data, or because it is in our legitimate business interests to use it. We strongly believe in both minimizing the data we collect.

Arturia may use your personal data for the following purposes:

Delivering, improving, updating and enhancing the Services we provide to you.

We may use your personal data for the following purposes:

  * Providing and managing your account.
  * Supplying our products and services and provide customer relationship service.
  * Payment of your orders. Personalize, improve and optimize the operation and performance of our services (again, including our websites) and how we interact with your targeted emails.
  * Diagnose problems with, and identify any security risks, errors, or required enhancements to the services we provide.
  * Detect and prevent fraud and abuse of our services and systems.
  * Collect aggregate statistics about use of the services. This information is not linked with any one personal account, but could be considered “personal data”, so we treat it accordingly.
  * Understand and analyze how you use our services and what products and services are most relevant to you, if you allow us to do so within the Arturia Software Center.



### Sharing with trusted third parties

We may share your personal data with trusted third party service providers as necessary for them to perform services on our behalf and/or when you have permitted such use (where applicable), such as:

  * Processing payments
  * Physically shipping services to you
  * Serving advertisements
  * Conducting contests or surveys
  * Performing analysis of our services and customer demographics
  * Communicating with you, such as by way email or survey delivery
  * Customer relationship management.



We only share the minimal personal data necessary for any third party to provide the services as requested or as needed on our behalf. These third parties and any subcontractors are subject to strict data processing terms and conditions and are - without your consent - prohibited from utilizing, sharing or retaining your personal data for any purpose other than as they have been specifically contracted for.

### Communicating with you

We may contact you directly regarding products or services you have purchased from us, where it may be necessary to deliver transactional or service related communications. We may also contact you through a third party service provider with offers for additional services we think you’ll find valuable if you give us consent, or where allowed based upon legitimate interests. You don’t need to provide consent as a condition to purchase our goods or services. These contacts are currently limited to emails.

You may also update your subscription preferences with respect to receiving communications from us and/or our partners by signing into your [MyArturia account](https://www.arturia.com/myarturia), and hitting the “Edit” button in the “My Login Info” section under the “My Account” heading.

### Transfer of personal data abroad

Currently, all our servers that may store personal data are located in France. Some of our services providers may need some of this personal data in order to ensure their service, and they may store personal data outside of France, or outside of the European Economic Area (the “EEA” consists of all EU member states, plus Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein). In these cases, your personal data is handled according to the Privacy Shield Framework, or in accordance with standard contractual clauses for the transfer of personal data to processors established in third countries as edicted by the European Commission signed between Arturia and the service provider. To learn more about the Privacy Shield Framework, visit the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield List.

For your peace of mind, you may wish to learn how companies we share data with utilize your information, and comply with the GDPR. The list of companies we partner with can be found in our [Privacy Center](https://www.arturia.com/support/privacycenter).

Arturia is responsible for the processing of personal data it receives and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. Arturia complies with the General Data Protection Regulation for all onward transfers of personal data from the EU, including onward transfer liability provisions.

If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed to your satisfaction, please contact us.

### Compliance with legal, regulatory and law enforcement requests

We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (such as subpoena requests), to protect our property and rights, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we consider to be illegal or unethical.

To the extent we are legally permitted to do so, we will take reasonable steps to notify you in the event that we are required to provide your personal information to third parties as part of legal process.

### Targeted advertisements

Targeted ads or interest-based offers may be presented to you based on your activities on our webpages, and other websites, and based on the products you currently own. These offers will display as varying product banners presented to you while browsing. We also partner with third parties to manage our advertising on our webpages and other websites.

If you want to know what personal data we may have on you, please contact [privacy-inquiries@arturia.com](mailto:privacy-inquiries@arturia.com) for details of that personal data and for a copy of it (where any such personal data is held). This is known as a “subject access request”.

All subject access requests should be made in writing and sent to the above email. There is not normally any charge for a subject access request. If your request is ‘manifestly unfounded or excessive’ (for example, if you make repetitive requests) a fee may be charged to cover our administrative costs in responding.

We will respond to your subject access request within one month of receiving it. Normally, we aim to provide a complete response, including a copy of your personal data within that time. In some cases, however, particularly if your request is more complex, more time may be required up to a maximum of three months from the date we receive your request. You will be kept fully informed of our progress. If you make a request to delete your personal data and that data is necessary for the products or services you have purchased, the request will be honored only to the extent it is no longer necessary for any services purchased or required for our legitimate business purposes or legal or contractual record keeping requirements.

If you are unable for any reason to access your [MyArturia accounth](http://www.arturia.com/myarturia), you may send an email at [privacy-inquiries@arturia.com](mailto:privacy-inquiries@arturia.com).

We retain personal data only for as long as necessary to provide the services you have requested and thereafter for a variety of legitimate legal or business purposes.
