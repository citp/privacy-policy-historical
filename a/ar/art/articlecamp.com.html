<p class="articletitle" align="justify"><b>Article Camp Privacy Policy</b></p>
<p align="justify">ArticleCamp.com strives to offer its visitors the many
advantages of Internet technology and to provide an interactive and personalized
experience. We may use Personally Identifiable Information (your name, e-mail
address, street address, telephone number) subject to the terms of this privacy
policy. We will never sell, barter, or rent your email address to any
unauthorized third party. Period.</p>
<p align="justify"><b>How we gather information from users</b></p>
<p align="justify">How we collect and store information depends on the page you
are visiting, the activities in which you elect to participate and the services
provided. For example, you may be asked to provide information when you register
for access to certain portions of our site or request certain features, such as
newsletters or when you make a purchase. You may provide information when you
participate in sweepstakes and contests, message boards and chat rooms, and
other interactive areas of our site. <br>
<br>
Like most Web sites, ArticleCamp.com also collects information automatically and
through the use of electronic tools that may be transparent to our visitors. For
example, we may log the name of your Internet Service Provider or use cookie
technology to recognize you and hold information from your visit. Among other
things, the cookie may store your user name and password, sparing you from
having to re-enter that information each time you visit, or may control the
number of times you encounter a particular advertisement while visiting our
site. As we adopt additional technology, we may also gather information through
other means. In certain cases, you can choose not to provide us with
information, for example by setting your browser to refuse to accept cookies,
but if you do you may be unable to access certain portions of the site or may be
asked to re-enter your user name and password, and we may not be able to
customize the site's features according to your preferences.</p>
<p align="justify"><b>What we do with the information we collect</b></p>
<p align="justify">Like other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance
your visit and deliver more individualized content and advertising. We respect
your privacy and do not share your information with anyone.</p>
<p align="justify">Aggregated Information (information that does not personally
identify you) may be used in many ways. For example, we may combine information
about your usage patterns with similar information obtained from other users to
help enhance our site and services (e.g., to learn which pages are visited most
or what features are most attractive). Aggregated Information may occasionally
be shared with our advertisers and business partners. Again, this information
does not include any Personally Identifiable Information about you or allow
anyone to identify you individually.</p>
<p align="justify">We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on
www.ArticleCamp.com to communicate with you about your registration and
customization preferences; our Terms of Service and privacy policy; services and
products offered by www.ArticleCamp.com and other topics we think you might find
of interest.</p>
<p align="justify">Personally Identifiable Information collected by
ArticleCamp.com may also be used for other purposes, including but not limited
to site administration, troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce transactions,
administration of sweepstakes and contests, and other communications with you.
Certain third parties who provide technical support for the operation of our
site (our Web hosting service for example) may access such information. We will
use your information only as permitted by law. In addition, from time to time as
we continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner with
other companies or businesses. In such transactions, user information may be
among the transferred assets. We may also disclose your information in response
to a court order, at other times when we believe we are reasonably required to
do so by law, in connection with the collection of amounts you may owe to us,
and/or to law enforcement authorities whenever we deem it appropriate or
necessary. Please note we may not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in
such cases.</p>
<p align="justify"><b>Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements</b></p>
<p align="justify">ArticleCamp.com expects its partners, advertisers and
affiliates to respect the privacy of our users. Be aware, however, that third
parties, including our partners, advertisers, affiliates and other content
providers accessible through our site, may have their own privacy and data
collection policies and practices. For example, during your visit to our site
you may link to, or view as part of a frame on a www.ArticleCamp.com page,
certain content that is actually created or hosted by a third party. Also,
through ArticleCamp.com you may be introduced to, or be able to access,
information, Web sites, features, contests or sweepstakes offered by other
parties. ArticleCamp.com is not responsible for the actions or policies of such
third parties. You should check the applicable privacy policies of those third
parties when providing information on a feature or page operated by a third
party.</p>
<p align="justify">While on our site, our advertisers, promotional partners or
other third parties may use cookies or other technology to attempt to identify
some of your preferences or retrieve information about you. For example, some of
our advertising is served by third parties and may include cookies that enable
the advertiser to determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement
before. Other features available on our site may offer services operated by
third parties and may use cookies or other technology to gather information.
ArticleCamp.com does not control the use of this technology by third parties or
the resulting information, and is not responsible for any actions or policies of
such third parties.</p>
<p align="justify">You should also be aware that if you voluntarily disclose
Personally Identifiable Information on message boards or in chat areas, that
information can be viewed publicly and can be collected and used by third
parties without our knowledge and may result in unsolicited messages from other
individuals or third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of
ArticleCamp.com and this policy. </p>
<p align="justify"><b>Children</b></p>
<p align="justify">ArticleCamp.com does not knowingly collect or solicit
Personally Identifiable Information from or about children under 13 except as
permitted by law. If we discover we have received any information from a child
under 13 in violation of this policy, we will delete that information
immediately. If you believe ArticleCamp.com has any information from or about
anyone under 13, please contact us at the address listed below.</p>
<p align="justify"><b>Contacting Us</b></p>
<p align="justify">We can be reached by <a href="mailto:webmaster@articlecamp.com"> emailing us.</a><a></a></p><a>
<p align="justify"><b>Changes to this Policy</b></p>
<p align="justify">ArticleCamp.com reserves the right to change this policy at
any time. Please check this page periodically for changes. Your continued use of
our site following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept
those changes. Information collected prior to the time any change is posted will
be used according to the rules and laws that applied at the time the information
was collected.</p>
<p align="justify">This statement and the policies outlined herein are not
intended to and do not create any contractual or other legal rights in or on
behalf of any party.</p>
