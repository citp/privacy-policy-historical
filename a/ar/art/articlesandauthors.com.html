<p align="center" class="articletitle">Privacy Policy</p>

We have created this   privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm and continuing commitment to   the privacy of personal information provided by those visiting and interacting   with this web site. We hold the privacy of your personal information in the   highest regard. The following discloses our information gathering and   dissemination practices for this website. <br>
<br>

<strong>We recognize the   importance of protecting your privacy</strong> and our policy is designed to   assist you in understanding how we collect, use and safeguard the personal   information you provide to us and to assist you in making informed decisions   when using our site. This policy will be continuously assessed against new   technologies, business practices and our customers'   needs.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>What Information Do We   Collect?</strong><strong><br>
    </strong>When you visit this web site you may   provide us with two types of information: personal information you knowingly   choose to disclose that is collected on an individual basis and Web site use   information collected on an aggregate basis as you and others browse our Web   site. <br>
    <br>
<strong>1. Personal Information You Choose   to Provide </strong><br>
<br>

<blockquote>
  <strong>Registration  Information</strong><br>
    When you register for any of our   products, services or newsletters you will provide us information about   yourself. <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Email   Information</strong><br>
    If you choose to correspond with   us through email, we may retain the content of your email messages together with   your email address and our responses. We provide the same protections for these   electronic communications that we employ in the maintenance of information   received by mail and telephone. <br>
</blockquote>
<strong>2. Web Site Use Information<br>
</strong>
<blockquote>
  Similar to other commercial Web sites, our Web site   utilizes a standard technology called "cookies" (see explanation below, "What   Are Cookies?") and web server log files to collect information about how our Web   site is used. Information gathered through cookies and Web server logs may   include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at our Web   site, and the Web sites visited just before and just after our Web site.<br>
<br>


</blockquote>
<p><strong>How Do   We Use the Information That You Provide to Us? <br>
  </strong>Broadly speaking, we use personal   information for purposes of administering our business activities, providing the   products and services you requested, to process your payment, to monitor the use of the service,   our marketing and   promotional efforts and   improve our content and   service offerings, and customize our site's content, layout,   services and for other   lawful purposes. These   uses improve our site and better tailor it to meet your needs. <br>
<br>
Furthermore, such   information may be shared with others on an aggregate basis. Personally identifiable information or business information will not be shared with parties   except as required by law. <br>
<br>
Occasionally, we may also   use the information we collect to notify you about important changes to our   Website, new services, and special offers we think you will find valuable. You   may notify us at any time if you do not wish to receive these offers by emailing   us at 'no-offers [at] articlesandauthors.com'. <br>
    <br>
  <strong>What Are   Cookies?</strong><br>
  A   cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an anonymous unique   identifier. When you visit a Web site, that site's computer asks your computer   for permission to store this file in a part of your hard drive specifically   designated for cookies. Each Web site can send its own cookie to your browser if   your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser   only permits a Web site to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not   the cookies sent to you by other sites. Browsers are usually set to accept   cookies. However, if you would prefer not to receive cookies, you may alter the   configuration of your browser to refuse cookies. If you choose to have your   browser refuse cookies, it is possible that some areas of our site will not   function as effectively when viewed by the users. <strong>A cookie cannot retrieve any other   data from your hard drive or pass on computer viruses. <br>
    <br>
    </strong><strong>How   Do We Use Information We Collect from Cookies?</strong><br>
  As you visit and browse our Web   site, the site uses cookies to differentiate you from other users. In some   cases, we also use cookies to prevent you from having to log in more than is   necessary for security. Cookies, in conjunction with our Web server's log files,   allow us to calculate the aggregate number of people visiting our Web site and   which parts of the site are most popular. This helps us gather feedback to   constantly improve our Web site and better serve our clients. Cookies do not   allow us to gather any personal information about you and we do not   intentionally store any personal information that your browser provided to us in   your cookies. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>IP Addresses</strong><br>
  IP addresses are used by your   computer every time you are connected to the Internet. Your IP address is a   number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer. IP   addresses are automatically collected by our web server as part of demographic   and profile data known as traffic data so that data (such as the Web pages you   request) can be sent to you. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Sharing and Selling   Information</strong><br>
  We <strong>do not</strong> share, sell,   lend or lease any of the information that uniquely identify a subscriber (such   as email addresses or personal details) with anyone except to the extent it is   necessary to process transactions or provide services that you have   requested.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>What About Legally Compelled   Disclosure of Information?<br>
  </strong>We may disclose information when   legally compelled to do so, in other words, when we, in good faith, believe that   the law requires it or for the protection of our legal rights. We may also disclose account   information when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is   necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be   violating our Terms of Service or to protect the safety of our users and the   Public. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>What About Other Web Sites Linked to   Our Web Site?</strong><br>
  We are not responsible for the   practices employed by Web sites linked to or from our Web site or the   information or content contained therein. Often links to other Web sites are   provided solely as pointers to information on topics that may be useful to the   users of our Web site. <br>
  <br>
  Please remember that when you use a   link to go from our Website to another web site, our Privacy Policy is no longer   in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other web site, including web   sites, which have a link on our Website, is subject to that Web site's own rules   and policies. Please read over those rules and policies before proceeding. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Your   Consent</strong><br>
  By   using our Web site you consent to our collection and use of your personal   information as described in this Privacy Policy. We reserve the right to amend   this privacy policy at any time with or without notice. <br>
  <br>
  <em><strong>Our Commitment   To Data Security:</strong></em><br>
  Please note that your information   will be stored and processed on our computers in the United States. The laws on   holding personal data in the United States may be less stringent than the laws   of your Country of residence or citizenship. To prevent unauthorized access,   maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put   in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to   safeguard and secure the information we collect online. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>A Special Note About Children <br>
  </strong>Children are   not eligible to use our services unsupervised and we ask that   children (under the age   of 14) do not submit any personal information to us. If you are a minor, you can   use this service only in conjunction with permission and guidance from your   parents or guardians. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Acquisition or Changes in   Ownership</strong><br>
  In the event that the web site (or a   substantial portion of its assets) is acquired, your information would be   considered part of those assets, and may be part of those assets that are   transferred. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Policy   Modifications<br>
  </strong>We   may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If/when changes are made to   this privacy policy, we will email users who have given us permission to do so.   We will post any changes here, so be sure to check back periodically. However,   please be assured that if the Privacy Policy changes in the future, we will not   use the personal information you have submitted to us under this Privacy Policy   in a manner that is materially inconsistent with this Privacy Policy, without   your prior consent. <br>
