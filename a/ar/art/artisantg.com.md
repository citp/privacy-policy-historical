Artisan Technology Group respects your privacy. This Online Privacy Statement is made available to you in order to make you aware of how Artisan Technology Group collects and uses individual identifying information of visitors to our website. 

"Individual identifying information" is information that enables us to identify you, including your e-mail address, name, title and address.

Cookies are small text files that our web sites ask to place on your computer's hard drive. If your browser is set to accept cookies, then your browser adds the text in a small file. We do not use cookies to read any other information on your computer's hard drive. We use cookie technology to authenticate your access to various areas of our web site, tailor its content to your preferences and to help us analyze web traffic in general.

Artisan Technology Group is committed to taking reasonable steps to protect the individual identifying information that you provide to us. When placing orders, communications between you and Artisan Technology Group's website are secured using SSL, a de facto standard for Internet security. SSL is an open protocol for secure data communications across computer networks. Artisan Technology Group uses SSL to secure its on-line catalog so we may provide an environment in which electronic commerce can be conducted and data protected. SSL is application protocol independent and provides encryption, which creates a secured channel to prevent others from tapping into the network; authentication, which uses certificates and digital signatures to verify the identity of parties in information exchanges and transactions; and message integrity, which ensures that messages cannot be altered en route. 

The accuracy of your individual identifying information is important to Artisan Technology Group. Please email us at [support@artisantg.com](mailto:support@artisantg.com) to make any corrections. We are working on ways to make it easier for you to review and correct the information that Artisan Technology Group maintains about you. 

We reserve the right to change this policy at any time. While we do not intend to make changes to this policy very often, it is always a good idea to double check our most current policy statement when you visit us to be sure that you have read and agree with what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we disclose it. For more information on using Artisan Technology Group's web site, see the Terms of Use.
