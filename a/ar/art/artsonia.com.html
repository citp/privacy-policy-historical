<p class="textNormal">
	At Artsonia, we are committed to protecting every User's privacy. We use the information we collect to process orders and to provide a more personalized service. Artsonia's Privacy Policy, set forth below, is designed to use the information we collect about visitors with the utmost care and responsibility.  All capitalized terms that are not defined in the Privacy Policy below shall have the meanings given in the <a href="terms.asp">Terms and Conditions of Use</a>.
</p>

<div style="margin:20px 0px;height:1px;border-top:1px #999 dashed;overflow:hidden;">&nbsp;</div>

<p class="textNormal"><b>1. Information Provided By All Users of the Website</b></p>
<p class="textNormal">
	The information Users provide to Artsonia through Artsonia.com or through certain mobile applications created by Artsonia (collectively referred to as the "Website") is used to process orders, to provide enhanced and more personalized service, and to properly index and display artwork, lesson plans, and other materials. The data in Artsonia's databases is protected against unauthorized access through state-of-the-art security procedures and software.
</p>
<p class="textNormal">
	The information Users provide to Artsonia is solely for Artsonia's internal business use. We do not sell this information to anyone.
</p>
<p class="textNormal">
	Personally identifiable information that Users provide upon registration as a Fan Club Member of an Artist may be revealed to the Artist's Parent but not to any third parties. The first name (that is, whatever name a member types into the "first name" field in the fan club enrollment) and relationship to the Artist may be posted alongside artwork to enable Artists and Parents to see all who have joined the fan club and seen the artwork.
</p>
<p class="textNormal">
	Artsonia may disclose personal information if we believe, in good faith, that such disclosure is necessary to comply with the law, to enforce or apply the terms of Artsonia's user agreements (including without limitation the Terms and Conditions of Use) or to protect the property, rights or safety of Artsonia, its Users or others.
</p>

<p class="textNormal"><b>2. Information Provided By Teachers</b></p>
<p class="textNormal">
	Any Teacher (as defined in the Terms and Conditions of Use) who wishes to display their students' artwork or their lesson plans on Artsonia is required to register as a member. The information provided during the registration process is used to communicate with the Teacher as well as to create a school gallery on Artsonia, which will list the Teacher's name and the name of the school. Teachers should be aware that, because personal information about themselves (i.e., their name and school) is posted on the Website and is publicly accessible to all users of the Website, that information could be collected, used, and disclosed by others. Artsonia is not responsible for the collection, use, or disclosure of such information. Artsonia does not publicly post Teachers' email addresses on the Website, and does not sell or share that list with third parties except where Teachers have explicitly authorized Artsonia to share their email addresses with our marketing partners. 
</p>
<p class="textNormal">
	The following conditions also apply to Teachers that choose to upload class artwork:
</p>
<ul class="textNormal">
	<li>To organize artwork, Teachers input first and (optionally) last names of students in a secured Teacher roster. The first and last names are entered into separate fields, and unique screen names are then generated for each student, based on the entry in the first name field.</li>
	<li>It is the Teacher's responsibility to ensure that only the first names are added in the first name field. Artsonia is not responsible if a Teacher types last names or any other personally identifiable information about a child into the first name field.</li>
	<li>The information typed into the last name field is not posted publicly on the Website. It is used as a means to organize the roster for the Teacher's benefit only, and can only be accessed within the secure Teacher section.</li>
</ul>

<p class="textNormal"><b>3. Information Provided By Parents</b></p>
<p class="textNormal">
	Parents who are interested in displaying their child's artwork on Artsonia are required to register as members. The information provided during the registration process is used to communicate with the Parent as well as to create an Artist gallery on Artsonia. Parents should be aware that, because the information the Parent types in the first name field textbox when registering is posted on the Website and is publicly accessible to all users of the Website, that information could be collected, used, and disclosed by others. Artsonia is not responsible for the collection, use, or disclosure of such information. Artsonia does not publicly post Parent last names, email addresses or physical addresses on the Website), and does not sell that information to or share that information with third parties except where Parents have explicitly authorized Artsonia to share such information with our marketing partners.
</p>
<ul class="textNormal">
	<li>To create an Artist gallery, Parents type the first and last name of their child into the appropriate textboxes. The first and last names are entered into separate fields, and a unique screen name is then generated for the child Artist, based on the text typed into the first name field.</li>
	<li>It is the Parent's responsibility to ensure that only the first name is typed into the first name field. Artsonia is not responsible if a Parent types a last name or any other personally identifiable information about their child into the first name field.</li>
	<li>The information in the last name field is not posted publicly on the Website.</li>
	<li>In addition, as part of the Parent account creation process, Artsonia records the IP address used to register and agree to Artsonia Terms &amp; Conditions of Use.</li>
</ul>

<p class="textNormal"><b>4. Information Provided by Kids (Children Under 18)</b></p>
<p class="textNormal">
	Artsonia is committed to complying with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998. Our information collection practices are described below. Artsonia urges kids to check with their Parents before entering any information on any Website, and we urge Parents to discuss with their kids the potential danger of revealing personal information to anyone they don't know.
</p>
<p class="textNormal">
	Artsonia's policy is not to collect any more information from kids than is necessary to enable the chosen services, features and functionalities. Leaving a comment for an Artist and joining an Artist's fan club are the only two activities that require Artsonia to collect information from any child under 18. 
</p>
<ul class="textNormal">
	<li>We DO NOT publicly post children's email addresses (which are given to us when children sign up for a Fan Club).</li>
	<li>We DO NOT collect personally identifiable offline contact information from kids.</li>
	<li>We DO NOT distribute to third parties any personally identifiable information collected from kids.</li>
</ul>
<p class="textNormal">
	<b>Artwork Submission:</b>  Kids under 18 years of age are allowed to submit artwork for publication via the Parent who has logged in to their Parents login area or via the Classroom Mode feature. Therefore, it is the Parent's responsibility to review and approve all artwork submissions entered via the Parents login area, and to abide by the provisions set forth in the Terms and Conditions with respect to such submissions.  Likewise, it is the Teacher's responsibility to review and approve all artwork submissions entered via the Classroom Mode feature, and to abide by the provisions set forth in the Terms and Conditions with respect to such submissions.
</p>
<p class="textNormal">
	<b>Fan Club Membership:</b> Fan Club members receive email alerts when an Artist for which they are a Fan Club member publishes new artwork, adds or updates an Artist statement or receives a Comment, and the first name of the Fan Club member is publicly listed in the Artist's gallery. Kids under 13 years of age are allowed to join another Artist's Fan Club. When joining a Fan Club, Artsonia asks for the child's first name, their relationship to the Artist (i.e. friend, cousin, brother, sister), their email address and their Parent's email address. Upon joining the Fan Club, the Parent is sent an email announcing their child's Fan Club membership and is given a simple opt-out unsubscribe option. If the Parent unsubscribes, then their child's Fan Club registration is terminated. 
</p>
<p class="textNormal">
	<b>Comments:</b> Kids under 13 years of age are allowed to leave a Comment for an Artist. However, if the person who submits a Comment is under 13 years old, we require that a Parent's email address be provided. When posting the Comment on the Website, Artsonia sends an email alert to the email address of the commenting child's Parent that includes the Comment itself and directions to delete it should the Parent desire to do so. In addition, the Comment is not posted until the Parent of the Artist who is receiving the Comment officially approves it. Artsonia sends an email to the Artist's Parent alerting them of a new Comment, and the Comment is not posted publicly until that Parent views and approves the Comment for posting. In other words, when a child under 13 leaves a Comment for another child, the Parent of the commenter is alerted via email with an option to delete the Comment, AND the Parent of the Artist that received the Comment is alerted via email to approve and post the Comment.  Therefore, it is the responsibility of the Parent of the Artist that received the Comment to review and approve such Comments, and to abide by the provisions set forth in the Terms and Conditions with respect to such Comments.
</p>
<p class="textNormal">
	<b>Artist Statements:</b> Kids under 13 years of age are allowed to leave an Artist statement about their artwork. However, they can only do so via the Parent who has logged in to their Parents login area or via the Classroom Mode feature (as defined in the Terms and Conditions). Therefore, it is the Parent's responsibility to review and approve all Artist Statement submissions entered via the Parents login area, and to abide by the provisions set forth in the Terms and Conditions with respect to such submissions. Likewise, it is the Teacher's responsibility to review and approve all Artist statement submissions entered via the Classroom Mode feature, and to abide by the provisions set forth in the Terms and Conditions with respect to such submissions.
</p>

<p class="textNormal"><b>5. Personally Identifiable Information About Artists</b></p>
<p class="textNormal">
	It is Artsonia's policy to protect the identity of the Artists showcasing their artwork on Artsonia. Artists will be identified only by their screen name (which often but not necessarily consists of the Artist's first name and a numerical suffix). Artsonia does not knowingly post the full name, mailing address or email address of Artists on its Website.
</p>
<p class="textNormal">
	As noted above and further specified in the Terms and Conditions, we require that Teachers and Parents only type the first name of the Artist into the first name field when submitting artwork. We also recommend that Teachers and Parents remove, erase or cover any appearance of the Artist's last name on the artwork and/or digital images of artwork itself before submitting it to the Website. Artsonia is not responsible for any damages resulting directly or indirectly from the negligence of the submitter of the artwork, including if the submitter erroneously type the last name of the Artist into the first name textbox, or if the Artist has listed his or her full name as part of the artwork image and that artwork is submitted to Artsonia.
</p>

<p class="textNormal"><b>6. Information Posted Publicly on Artsonia</b></p>
<p class="textNormal">
	Users should be aware that any personal information (including the names of persons or schools) that is posted on Artsonia by Users is accessible to other Users of the Website and could be collected, used, and disclosed by others. For example, if a User includes his or her full name or the name of a school in a Comment for an Artist, then once that Comment is approved, that information would be accessible to all Users of the Website. Artsonia is not responsible for the collection, use, or disclosure of information provided in Comments approved for posting. We recommend that all personally identifiable information be removed from all content submitted or approved for submission by Parents or Teachers for posting to the Website. We also recommend that Parents and Teachers not submit or approve for submission any artwork or other material that contains photographs or images (especially the faces) of children under 18 years old, including the Artist themselves.
</p>

<p class="textNormal"><b>7. Cookies</b></p>
<p class="textNormal">
	Cookies are small text files that Artsonia writes to a User's computer to make it easier for the User to navigate within the Website. Artsonia cookies do not contain any personally identifiable information such as passwords. Visitors to the Website have the option of disabling cookies via browser preferences.

<p class="textNormal"><b>8. Aggregate Statistics</b></p>
<p class="textNormal">
	Artsonia may report aggregate statistics about visitors, traffic patterns, electronic postcard usage and related site information to partners, sponsors, advertisers, subsidiaries, affiliates and other third parties, but these statistics do not include any personally identifiable information.
</p>

<p class="textNormal"><b>9. Choice/Opt-Out</b></p>
<p class="textNormal">
	Artsonia provides Users with the opportunity to opt-out of receiving any future communications from Artsonia and its partners at any time.
