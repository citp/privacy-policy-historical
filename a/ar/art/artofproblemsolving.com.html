AOPS INCORPORATED PRIVACY POLICY
</p>

<p style="font-weight:bold">
	Please <a href="#coppa">click here</a> for our information practices with 
	regards to children under 13 (also listed at the end of this document).
</p>

<p>
	We take the privacy of our participants very seriously; therefore, we only
	collect the information necessary to provide our services efficiently.
</p>


<h2>
	Users using our online community or other online resources 
	requiring membership
</h2>

<p>
To post information in a forum, to use some of our online educational 
tools, or to attend online classes, you must become a member of the Art 
of Problem Solving Community. To become a member, the only personal
information we require is your email address and a username that you select. 
The username that you select is used as an onscreen name to identify you;
it is strongly recommended that it not be your real name, but a pseudonym.
You will also select a password, which is needed to log on. We do ask about
your general geographic location, your occupation, and interests, but none
of this information is required for membership in the Community.
</p>
<p>
Your email address is used by us to send messages to you. We do so to
confirm your username and password if you should forget your username
or password. We also use your email address to assist in administering
our web site and to help enforce our conduct rules (for example,
people who post offensive messages in the forum can be banned). Should
you enroll in an Art of Problem Solving online class, your email
address will be used for communication purposes for that class. We
will not send solicitation emails collected as part of the Art of
Problem Solving Community unless the user elects to join our mailing
lists. Your email address will not be shared with or sold to any third
party without your explicit consent to the effect. We take reasonable
steps to protect your email address, username, password, and other
information from anyone who is not authorized to have such
information. We cannot be held responsible for an unauthorized person
illegally obtaining that information.
</p>
<p>
Our site has forums (message boards), private messaging, and real-time
discussion available to its members. Please remember that any
information that is disclosed in these areas is potentially available
to other members and in some cases to the general public. You should
not disclose any personal information, such as your real name,
address, telephone number, email address, etc. Your username is the
only identity that you need to have, and that is how people should
know you on our site.
</p>
<p>
We may disclose data collected from Community members to a third party
for educational research purposes. Such data will never contain any
personally identifiable information, and will not be traceable to any
individual user.
</p>

<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>
	A "cookie" is a small piece of data placed on your computer by us.
	Within your web browser, cookies placed by our website can only be
	accessed by our website; other websites you visit can not access these
	cookies. We use cookies to maintain session and preference information
	to improve the use of the website. We do not use cookies for marketing
	or advertising purposes. You may set your web browser to decline our
	cookies, however this will render large portions of our website
	unusable.
</p>
<p>
	We also allow cookies to be placed on your computer by a third party
	for the purpose of website analytics. This allows a third party to
	collect data about your use of our website; however, no personally
	identifiable information is collected. We don't share the data that
	this third party collects with anyone besides this third party, and
	the third party is required (under its contract with us) to not share
	the data it collects with anyone other than us (except as may be
	required by law). We use the data that is collected in the following
	ways:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
		to report, in aggregate, how our visitors find and use
		our website;
	</li>
	<li>
	    to understand overall visitor behavior; and
	</li>
	<li>
	    to inform how we update and improve our website.
	</li>
</ul>



<h2>Teachers using our Schola teachers' tools</h2>
<p>
	Teachers using our Schola teacher tools on our website must first be
	members of the Art of Problem Solving community. We collect certain
	additional information from teachers wishing to use the Schola teacher
	tools. We collect: your name, your school's name and address, a
	contact phone number and email address, and your school's website URL.
	We use this information to verify that you are a teacher at a
	legitimate educational institution or homeschool, and to contact you
	regarding the Schola tools. We may request from you other proof of
	school affiliation, as necessary, to determine your eligibility to use
	our teacher tools. We will not share this information with any third
	party (except as may be required by law) and will not use this
	information for marketing or any other purposes. Teachers may enroll
	students in their classes using the Schola teachers tools. In the case
	that such a student is under the age of 13, teachers agree that they,
	or their school, are acting as the student's parents' agent in
	providing consent for the online collection of students' personal
	information within the school context. (Please see
	<a target="_blank" href="http://business.ftc.gov/documents/Complying-with-COPPA-Frequently-Asked-Questions#Schools">
	http://business.ftc.gov/documents/Complying-with-COPPA-Frequently-Asked-Questions#Schools</a>
	for more details about this provision.)
</p>

<h2>
	Students enrolling in a Schola class within his or her
	school, established by a registered teacher using our Schola
	teachers' tools
</h2>
<p>
	Students who enroll in a Schola class set up by a registered teacher
	do not need to be members of the Art of Problem Solving community. We
	will collect your name, and you will also have to choose a unique
	username and password, which are both needed to log on. (If you are
	already a member of the Art of Problem Solving community, we will use
	your already-existing username and password, but you may have to
	additionally provide your real name.) Your real name and username,
	along with other data that we have collected including (but not
	necessarily limited to) any data collected during your use of our
	Alcumus online educational system, will be shared with the teacher in
	whose class you are enrolling. We take reasonable steps to protect
	your name, username, password, and other information from anyone who
	is not authorized to have such information. We cannot be held
	responsible for an unauthorized person illegally obtaining that
	information. We will not use this information for any other purpose,
	and will not share this information with any other third party (except
	as may be required by law).
</p>

<h2>Customers purchasing a product or service</h2>

<p>
	We collect certain information from a customer who is purchasing a
	product and/or service using our online ordering system. Such
	information may include: your name, your shipping address, your
	billing address, your credit card information, your email address, and
	your phone number. This information is used to process your purchase
	and to contact you if there is an issue with your purchase. We will
	share this information with our credit card payment processor.
	Additionally, your name, shipping address, email address, and/or phone
	number may be shared with the United States Postal Service or other
	private carrier, for the purpose of delivering any purchased goods to
	your shipping address. We will store all of this information on our
	secure server, except for your credit card information, which is only
	retained until your payment has been processed and is not stored
	thereafter; however, this information may be retained by our credit
	card processor for the purpose of processing additional transactions,
	refunds, and/or chargebacks. We have taken reasonable steps to protect
	your personal information from anyone who is not authorized to have
	such information; however, we cannot be held responsible for an
	unauthorized person illegally obtaining your personal information. We
	will not use this information for any purpose other than to process
	your purchase, and will not share this information with any other
	third party, except as described above or as may be required by law.
	We may use your email address for marketing purposes, but only if you
	give your permission to do so during the purchasing process, and such
	permission may be withdrawn at any time by contacting us (via the
	methods listed under "Contact Information" below).

<h1>Information Practices With Regards to Children Under Age 13</h1>

<p>
	The federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) requires
	that we inform you of our practices with regards to our collection, use,
	or disclosure of personal information from children under age 13, and to
	obtain parental consent prior to collecting, using, or disclosing any
	such information.
</p>

<h2>1. Information we collect from children under age 13</h2>

<p>
"Child" refers to any person under the age of 13. We may collect from children:
</p>

<p>
	(a) An email address that may be used by us to communicate directly with the
	child. This email address is never made available to any other user of
	the site, nor to any third party.
</p>

<p>
	(b) A username used to uniquely identify each child. This username may be
	disclosed on our website, for example in our message boards, online 
	classroom, or any other part of the site on which the child may
	participate. Other members of the website may use the child's
	username to directly contact the child (for example, by private
	message or in online classroom discussions).
</p>

<p>
	(c) We may ask the child to provide his or her real name.
	The child's name will only be used for internal purposes, or will be
	disclosed only to third parties to whom the child has given specific
	authorization, for example a teacher at the child's school who has
	requested access from the child to view the child's online school 
	reports. Such third parties must request permission from us before
	they request this information from the child, and we make a
	reasonable effort to determine if the third party's request is 
	legitimate before granting such permission. The child's real name
	will never be made publicly available on our website by us.
</p>

<p>
	(d) Other non-identifying data may be collected in the course of a child's
	participation on the website; for example, online homework submissions,
	live classroom discussions, etc. These data may be combined or associated
	with the child's username, and may be publicly available on the site.
</p>

<p>
	(e) Children using our site may have the opportunity to post personal 
	information about themselves (for example, in a message board post or on
	a blog or in our online classroom). Such information may be publicly
	displayed on the website alongside the child's username. Although we
	strongly discourage such divulgence of personal information, we cannot
	prevent it.
</p>

<h2>2. Parental rights and responsibilities</h2>
<ol class="part2" type="a">
	<li>
		We do not collect personal information from a child, except as
        noted below, until we have received verifiable parental consent
        in accordance with COPPA.  The exceptions are:
		<ol>
			<li>
				An email address is collected from a child at the time of 
				registration, solely to contact the child's parent in order to
				obtain the necessary parental consent; and
			</li>
			<li>
				A username is selected by the child; however, this username
				cannot be used to contact the child, nor be used for the
				purposes listed in sections (c) and (d) of item #1 above,
				unless and until we receive verifiable parental consent.
			</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>
		At any time, a parent can review or ask us to delete a child's
		personal information, or can refuse to permit its further collection
		or use, by contacting us by any of the means listed in item #3 below.
	</li>
</ol>

<h2>3. Contact information</h2>

<p>
	Questions or comments about this policy, or requests pursuant 
	to item #2(b) above, may be sent to:
