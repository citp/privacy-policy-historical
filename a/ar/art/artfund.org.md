# Privacy and cookies - Art Fund

## 1\. Introduction and communication

We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. We will only contact you regarding projects you may be interested in; moreover, we do not sell or share your details with other parties who may send you unsolicited emails or letters/communications. Art Fund will use your contact details to send you communications from time to time about inspiration for your next art visit; National Art Pass members will also receive information on how to make the most of the National Art Pass. We also contact you in order to promote the exhibition programmes of the organisations we work with and how you can make a difference by helping us with major appeals to support museums and galleries across the UK. For example, we use the address provided by those who have a National Art Pass to send them copies of our magazine Art Quarterly, and we use the email address, with your consent, for our fortnightly e-newsletter 'Art in your inbox', which contains ideas for great days out, must-see exhibitions and the latest Art Fund news.

If you prefer not to receive certain types of letters or emails from us, we will respect your wishes.

We may, only on very specific occasions and always with your permission to do so, share your details with museums and galleries or relevant partners, for example if a person has donated towards a specific appeal to buy an important work of art for a museum, we will ask at the time of the donation if they will be happy for the museum to get in touch. We also work with a number of trusted suppliers to deliver our goods and services. Please see Section 7. Who we share your personal information with for more information.

Our website uses cookies, as almost all websites do. Cookies are tiny ’text files’ of letters and numbers that are downloaded in your computer/smartphone while you’re surfing a website.

Art Fund uses cookies to make our website run more efficiently, to help remember and store your preferences as you travel through our site, and to help us understand who is visiting our website and how they interact with it.

## 4.1. Using publicly available information for fundraising activities

At Art Fund we want to not only meet, but deepen our connection with, individuals and organisations who share our passion for the incredible work taking place in museums and galleries across the UK. We are committed to nurturing collaborative relationships with donors, influencers, prospective donors and others so that together we can do more than ever before for museums and galleries.

To enable us to find and connect with people with a passion for art and the interest and ability to support us in new and exciting ways, we may also use the information you provide to us in combination with publicly available information.

  * This can include information about your property value, trusteeships and level and frequency of gifts to Art Fund or others.

This could include a history of your relationship with us, a professional or personal biography and other information found from the above sources.
  * We may identify you as someone we would love to get to know through the publicly available data sources listed above. When we do this we endeavour to contact you within a suitable timeframe in order to introduce ourselves and find out if you are interested in getting involved with Art Fund, giving you an early opportunity to opt out. We may use third party suppliers to undertake these activities on our behalf but these suppliers will not retain your data. All third party suppliers are carefully chosen and we sign data-sharing agreements with them to ensure the safety of your personal information.



The purpose of processing your information in these ways is to help us to determine whether and in what ways you might be interested in getting involved with Art Fund including assessing how likely it is that you would be interested in donating to us and the level of donation that you may be able to give, as well as to ensure we contact you responsibly in a sensitive way. This enables us to fulfil our legitimate interest of knowing our donors and maximising the impact of our charitable resources, while being mindful of your interests and privacy rights.

We will also only store and use this information for as long as it is relevant for its specified purpose. We will always give you a chance to decline further engagement with our organisation.

## 4.2. Information provided for the purposes of administering grants/ training

  
If you/your organisation contact us regarding or to apply for a grant, we will collect personal data about you and other people connected to the grant application. In some instances our grant holders and evaluators also send us information about individuals who benefit from projects funded by our grants.

If you provide us with personal data of people who benefit from your project’s work it is your responsibility to inform those individuals and if they have any questions about our use of their personal data, you must refer them to this notice.

####  More about information provided for the purposes of administering grants/training ____

We may use your contact details to keep you informed about Art Fund’s work, (including by email, where an email address has been supplied), unless you have indicated that you would prefer not to receive information that is not connected to your application or grant.

Provenance information or vendor information regarding the purchase of works of art will be kept in perpetuity for due diligence. The name of the vendor may be published by us, unless the vendor indicates that they wish to remain anonymous. It is the grant applicant’s responsibility to ensure that individuals are happy for their data to be shared with us.

If you have provided advice to Art Fund to support our grant-making, we may contact you in the future to request your advice or expertise. The advice provided will comprise a formal record associated with the grant and will be archived in perpetuity where an acquisition of a work of art has taken place with our support. Your name may be published in recognition of your support if you are happy for us to do so.

## 6\. How we protect your information and how long we keep it for

We follow appropriate security procedures in the storage and disclosure of personal data so as to guard against loss, damage and unauthorised access by third parties. We also require those parties to whom we transfer personal data to comply with the same. We adopt robust technological solutions to ensure your personal data is protected from unauthorised access. For example we use encryption for logging in to your online account and for all financial information you provide to us.

We will only hold your personal information for as long as is reasonably necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice and to fulfil our legal obligations. The retention periods will vary depending on the purpose, for example if you make a card payment we will only hold your card details while the payment is being processed.

For further information on how long we keep your personal information, please read our [Personal Data Retention Policy](https://www.artfund.org/assets/art-fund-personal-data-retention-policy_2.pdf).

####  More about how we protect your information ____

We view our responsibility to safeguard your data with the utmost seriousness, and we take appropriate steps to protect you. Nevertheless cybercrime and data theft are increasingly prevalent and as such the Internet is not (and mobile devices are not) a 100% secure medium. We cannot therefore guarantee the security of information disclosed to us and want to make you aware of some particular risks when using internet and mobile devices.

Some links on our website may take you to third party sites, over which we have no control. When linking to another website we encourage you to read the privacy policy stated on that website.

Phishing is a cybercrime in which an individual is targeted and contacted by email, telephone or text message by someone posing as a legitimate institution to lure individuals into providing sensitive data. If you have concerns about any communication that might seem to be a genuine Art Fund communication, please review our helpful explanation on phishing before reacting.

Art Fund does not transfer your data to countries outside the European Economic Area. In the unlikely event that this needs to happen in the future, we will make you aware and put the required safeguards in place to ensure the security of your data.

## 7\. Who we share your personal information with

We use a number of trusted data processors in order to deliver our goods and services. This includes Supporter Services who can assist you with enquiries six days a week, and our mailing house who may, for example, send you your Art Quarterly magazine, and our professional advisers.

In some instances we will share your data with your consent, for example you may ask us to share your information with a museum whose Art Happens project you have supported. In other instances, such as when you have applied for funding, we may share your details with specialist advisors with whom we work to ensure that we spend our charitable resources responsibly.

All third parties we work with are very carefully selected and are bound by data-sharing agreements to ensure that they treat your data with the same care and respect as Art Fund.

####  More about who we share your personal information with ____

  * your personal data may be shared with our employees, volunteers and/or third party organisations that we appoint to assist Art Fund. We will only share the personal information necessary for the purposes in question and we shall endeavour to ensure that any such recipients of your personal data use appropriate security measures to protect your personal data
  * where appropriate measures have been taken to minimise the extent of the personal data in question, this data may be provided to third parties to process lawfully: 
    * in relation to any fundraising campaigns, competitions and promotions that we run jointly with a third party
    * in circumstances in which we are required or authorised by regulatory or governmental authorities requesting disclosure of your personal data, for example in the case of court orders



From time to time, we may allow a third party to sponsor a promotion, offer, competition [or] page of the website [or one of our mobile applications (or a part of one)].

This Privacy Notice was last updated on 9 May 2018. In the event that we update the Privacy Notice, we will notify you and post the changes under the Privacy Notice and/or Privacy and Cookies section of our [website](http://www.artfund.org/).
