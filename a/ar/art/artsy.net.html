<p><strong>Legal Purposes.</strong> We may access, preserve, and disclose your Personal Information and/or other information if we believe that such access, preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (i) comply with any law, regulation, legal process or governmental request (such as search warrants, subpoenas or court orders), which may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside the United States; (ii) enforce our Terms of Use or our other policies or agreements with Users, or investigate potential violations; (iii) detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; (iv) protect or enforce the rights or property of Artsy, you, or any other person or entity; or (v) prevent physical harm to any person, including situations involving possible violence or self-harm. </p>

<h2 id="statutory-requests">Statutory Requests</h2>
<p>Some jurisdictions have laws that give people the right to access or correct their Personal Information which a company has about them. We will honor any statutory right you may have to access or correct your Personal Information that we have in our records, and you can email such requests to <a href="mailto:privacy@artsy.net">privacy@artsy.net</a>. Once we receive your request, we will let you know if an administrative fee will apply to fulfill your request, as permitted by applicable law. However, please note that even if you have a legal right to request access to information or to correct information, as permitted by applicable law, we may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, would require disproportionate technical effort (for example, developing a new system or materially changing an existing practice), would jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical to fulfill (for example, requests to access information located on backup systems). </p>

<h1 id="cookie-policy">Cookie Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Cookies, Web Beacons, and Similar Technologies.</strong> We may use cookies, web beacons and similar technologies, such as tracking URLs, to collect information about how you or others access or engage with our Services, Content, emails, and ads displayed on or off our Services, and to operate, develop, improve, and customize our Services, Content, and marketing, including ads displayed on or off our Services. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but your browser may have settings that enable you to decline or delete cookies on your device. Please note that if you decline cookies, you may not be able to sign in, customize, or use some of the interactive features of our Services, as some of our Services require cookies to operate.</p>
<p><strong>What these Technologies Are.</strong> “Cookies” are small data files placed on your computer or other device which record information. For example, a cookie could enable our Services to recognize your browser, while another cookie could store your account preferences and other information to help make our Services more customized. We may use two kinds of cookies, “session cookies” and “persistent cookies.” Session cookies normally expire when you close your browser, while persistent cookies remain on your device until they expire or are deleted. “Web beacons” (also known as “pixel tags” or “clear GIFS”) are pieces of code or pixels embedded in a web page or email to track engagement with and responses to emails, web pages or ads, or to access or communicate with cookies. “Tracking URLs” are special URLs that can be used to track engagement with and responses to emails or web pages.</p>
<p><strong>Third-Party Analytics, Service, and Ad Providers.</strong>  We may use third-party analytics and services providers who help us to better understand how our Services and Content are accessed and used, including for web analytics, audience measurement, personalization and segmentation, and relationship management purposes. In turn, this information helps us to develop and improve our Services and Content. Our third-party analytics and service providers include but are not limited to Google Analytics. These providers may use cookies, web beacons and similar technologies to collect information about how Users access or engage with our Services, Content, emails, and ads on or off our Services. For more information about how Google may collect and process information in connection with Google Analytics, click <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/">here</a>.</p>
<p>We may also use third-party advertising providers, including ad networks or exchanges, to help display ads on our Services or on other websites, including customized ads based on past online activity. These third parties may use cookies, web beacons and similar technologies to help provide their services to us, and to collect information about your and others’ online activity across different websites. These providers may also collect your IP address, device identifier, or identifier for advertising (IDFA). The third-party advertising providers we use include but are not limited to Google Analytics, and we use its Remarketing and Demographics and Interest Reporting features, which enables Google Analytics to collect data about traffic on our Services through <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/types/">Google advertising cookies</a> and anonymous identifiers. We and third-party providers, including Google Analytics, may use first-party cookies (i.e. cookies set by the website you are visiting) and third-party cookies (i.e. cookies set by a third-party website other than the website you are visiting) to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on past visits to our Services. We do not control the practices of any third-party providers, and this Cookie Policy (and our Privacy Policy in general) does not cover the use of cookies, web beacons or similar technologies by any third parties. </p>
<p><strong>Opting-Out.</strong> Third-party providers may offer you a way to opt-out of receiving cookies from them by visiting their own websites or the websites of industry groups such as the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/">Network Advertising Initiative</a> and the <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">Digital Advertising Alliance</a>. For example, you may opt-out of receiving ad-related cookies from Google through its <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/">Ad Settings</a>. If you opt-out of receiving cookies from one of these providers, it may place a cookie on your device to remember your preference. Accordingly, if you delete cookies, install a new browser, or start using a new device, you may need to repeat the opt-out process. To opt out of receiving any marketing materials, please email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@artsy.net">privacy@artsy.net</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Changes to this Cookie Policy.</strong> As this Cookie Policy is part of our Privacy Policy, we may update it at any time as described in our Privacy Policy. Please review this Cookie Policy regularly to be informed of any updates.</p>
