### Information We Collect by Automated Means

**Cookies**

A cookie is a piece of information that a web server may place on your computer when you visit a website. While cookies can be used to identify a user’s computer, they do not contain information that can be used to identify a user by name. artnet and its partners use cookies and similar technologies on certain pages to help analyze webpage flow, customize services, content, and advertising, as well as measure promotional effectiveness. artnet may use cookies, for example, to keep track of your preferences and profile information. Cookies are also used to collect general usage and volume statistical information. Cookies may be permanent or temporary (also called session cookies).

Here are some notes about cookies:

  * You may disable cookies if your browser permits—the exact procedure will vary from browser to browser, but on most browsers the help section will tell you how to prevent your browser from automatically accepting cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether
  * artnet offers certain features that are available only through the use of cookies, therefore if you disable cookies, you may not be able to enjoy the full functionality of our Services
  * artnet also uses cookies in My Account to help identify you and maintain your signed-in status



**Analytics and Advertising**

artnet uses Google Analytics and other analytics companies to provide a web analytics service to our Sites. The information generated by your use of the Sites (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by analytics companies on servers in the United States. artnet will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the Sites, compiling reports on website activity for website operators, and providing other services relating to Site activity and internet usage.

artnet partners with third-party advertising companies which use cookies or similar technologies to collect and use your browsing information (e.g., persistent IDs, browser type, time and date, page visits, and other information) during your visit to our Sites to provide advertisements about goods or services likely to be of greater interest to you (i.e., interest-based advertising). They may also use persistent identifiers to track your internet usage over time and across other websites in their networks beyond our Sites. artnet does not provide these companies with personal data such as your name, address, telephone number, or email address. If you wish to opt out of interest-based advertising, click [here](http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/) (or if located in the European Union, click [here](http://youronlinechoices.eu/)). Please note, you will continue to receive generic ads.

artnet also uses Google Analytics Demographics Reports and Remarketing to advertise online. Third-party vendors, including Google, may show artnet ads on sites across the internet. artnet and third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies and third-party cookies together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on past visits to the artnet Sites. You may opt out of these cookies by visiting Google’s Advertising and Privacy page [here](https://web.archive.org/policies/technologies/ads).

**Log Files**

artnet uses your IP address to help diagnose server problems, and to administer our website. artnet uses your IP addresses to analyze trends and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.

Every time you access an artnet Site, some data is temporarily stored and processed in a log file, such as your IP addresses, the browser types, the operating systems, the recalled page, or the date and time of the recall. This data is only evaluated for statistical purposes, such as to help us diagnose problems with our servers, to administer our sites, or to improve our Services.

**HTML5**

We use Local Shared Objects, such as HTML5, to store content information and preferences. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our Sites or to display advertising based upon your web browsing activity also use HTML5 to collect and store information. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5.

**Do Not Track**

Your browser or device may include “Do Not Track” functionality. artnet’s information collection and disclosure practices, and the choices that we provide to customers, will continue to operate as described in this Privacy Policy, whether or not a “Do Not Track” signal is received.

**For more information on how to control or limit cookies and similar technologies, please see[www.allaboutcookies.org/cookies](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/cookies).**

### HOW WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION

artnet shares your personal data with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy. artnet does not sell, rent, or lease your personal data to third parties, and artnet does not transfer your personal data to third parties for their direct marketing purposes.

### PRIVACY SHIELD AND INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS

Because artnet and its servers are located in the United States, we necessarily transfer any data that we collect to the United States for processing and storage. In order to provide appropriate safeguards regarding such transfers from the EU and Switzerland to the United States, we have certified our compliance with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework (each a “ **Privacy Shield Framework** ”). We are committed to subjecting all personal data received from the EU and Switzerland to the applicable Principles of the Privacy Shield Frameworks, and we comply with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of personal data from the EU and Switzerland, including the onward transfer liability provisions. To learn more about the Privacy Shield Frameworks, and to view our certification, visit the US Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield List at [www.privacyshield.gov](http://www.privacyshield.gov/).

The US Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction over artnet’s compliance with the Privacy Shield Frameworks. In certain situations, we may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including in order to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

If you have an unresolved concern regarding any personal data that is subject to the Privacy Shield Frameworks that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our US-based third-party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at [feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request](http://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request). Under certain conditions, more fully described on the Privacy Shield website, [www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=How-to-Submit-a-Complaint](http://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=How-to-Submit-a-Complaint), you may invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.

In addition to transfers to artnet in the United States subject to the Privacy Shield Frameworks, your personal data may also be transferred outside of your country among our affiliates or with third parties for the business purposes described in this Privacy Policy. As required by applicable law, we utilize appropriate safeguards, such as standard contractual clauses or privacy certification mechanisms, approved by applicable data protection authorities—or we may obtain your prior consent—when we transfer personal data across international borders. For more information about our appropriate safeguards, contact us.

### HOW WE STORE AND SECURE YOUR INFORMATION

artnet retains your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you Services. If you wish to cancel your account or request that artnet no longer use your personal data, contact us. artnet will retain and use your personal data as necessary to comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

All information you provide is stored on a secure server, and artnet follows generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal data we process both during transmission and once received. However, no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Absolute security of your information cannot be guaranteed, and any transmission of data is at your own risk. If you have any questions about security on the artnet websites, contact us.
