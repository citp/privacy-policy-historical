<p><br>ArticleTrunk.com - Website Privacy Policy
</p><p><br>Last Revised: April 12, 2011
</p><p><br>
</p><p>ArticleTrunk and its affiliates (collectively, Company or we) respect the privacy of the users of this Site (User or you) </p><p>and are committed to protect the information of its Users. We believe that you have a right to know our practices regarding the </p><p>information we may collect, use and disclose when you visit our website at the address [http://www.ArticleTrunk.com] (the Site or ArticleTrunnk). </p><p>The guidelines contained herein apply to your visit or use of the Site.
<br>
</p><p>1. Acceptance of the Policy
 <br>
</p><p>PLEASE READ CAREFULLY: BY ACCESSING AND/OR USING THE SITE, YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS SET FORTH IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY, </p><p>INCLUDING TO THE COLLECTION AND PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION (AS DEFINED BELOW). IF YOU DISAGREE TO ANY TERM PROVIDED </p><p>HEREIN, YOU MAY NOT USE THE SITE.
<br>
</p><p>2. Which information we may collect on our Users?
 <br>
</p><p>We collect two types of data and information:
<br>
</p><p>a. The first type of information is collected regardless of whether the User has registered the Site or is visiting the Site </p><p>anonymously, and consists of non-identifiable and anonymous information (â€œNon-personal Informationâ€). 
</p><p>To put it simply, we have no idea what is the identity of the User from which we have collected the Non-personal Information. </p><p>Non-personal Information which is being gathered consists of technical information and behavioral information, as detailed below:
<br>
</p><p>Technical information:
<br>
</p><p>Type of operation system (e.g. Windows, Linux, etc.)
</p><p>Type of Browser (e.g. Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, etc.)
</p><p>Screen resolution (e.g. 800x600, 1024x768, etc.)
</p><p>Browser and keyboard language (e.g. English)
</p><p>IP Address.
</p><p>The domain name and host from which you access the Internet and the Internet address of the site from which you direct-linked to the Site.
</p><p>The date and time you access the Site and pages you visit.
</p><p>Any Similar technical information.
</p><p>Behavioral information:
<br>
</p><p>The clicks, mouse movements and similar information with regard to the User's session (e.g. the fact that User has chosen to click </p><p>on a certain link or access a certain webpage). Please be advised that such information shall be deleted within approximately </p><p>thirty (30) days after your visit to the Site.
<br>
</p><p>b. The other type of information is individually identifiable information ("Personal Information"). To put it simply, this </p><p>information may identify an individual or is of a private and/or sensitive nature. Personal Information which is being gathered </p><p>consists of any personal details provided voluntarily by the User (e.g. User's name, email address, author bio etc.) mainly by </p><p>registration to the Site. We also treat any email you may send to us as Personal Information.
<br>
</p><p>For the sake of clarification, any Non-personal Information combined with Personal Information shall be regarded as Personal </p><p>information.
<br>
</p><p>We will not collect any Personal Information from you without your approval. Among other things, we will not collect any chat or </p><p>other correspondence between a User and any third-party.
<br>
3. How do we collect information on our Users?
 <br>
</p><p>There are two main methods we use:
<br>
</p><p>a. We collect information while you access, browse, view or otherwise use the Site. In other words, when you access the Site we </p><p>are aware of your usage of the Site, and may gather, collect and record the information relating to such usage. For example, when </p><p>you connect to the Site, your computer tells us your IP address.
<br>
</p><p>b. We collect information which you provide us voluntarily. For example, when you wish to register to the Site, we may ask you to </p><p>provide certain Personal Information which shall be kept on our servers. Each time you will be interested in providing information </p><p>voluntarily we may ask you to consent to the collection and public display of such information.
<br>
</p><p>4. What are the purposes of collecting the information?
 <br>
</p><p>Non-personal Information is collected in order to:
<br>
</p><p>enhance the User's experience on the Site (e.g. by determining the screen resolutions).
</p><p>learn about the preferences of Users and general trends on our Site (e.g. understand which software is more popular than others).
</p><p>better understand the priorities and interests of our potential customers and partners in order to better suit their needs and </p><p>increase the efficiency of our sales and marketing processes.
</p><p>administer the Site, help diagnose problems with our server, to gather broad demographic information.
</p><p>Personal Information is collected in order to:
<br>
</p><p>personalize your experience on the Site.
</p><p>provide you with certain information and services available only to registered Users.
</p><p>allow us to contact you with proposals and tailored information regarding events, offers, etc.
</p><p>identify you when conducting customer service operations (such as license purchase and generation, providing product feedback, </p><p>etc.).
</p><p>other User Generated Content, voluntarily supplied by the User for the purpose of public use and display (e.g. public User Bio).
</p><p>5. Sharing Personal Information with third parties
 <br>
</p><p>We will share Personal Information only in the following cases: (a) to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process, </p><p>subpoena or governmental request; (b) to enforce these Privacy Policy or the Terms of Use, including investigation of potential </p><p>violations thereof; (c) to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; (d) to respond to claims </p><p>that any content published on the Site violates any right of a third-party; (e) to respond to claims that unauthorized information </p><p>(e.g. e-mail address, name, etc.) of a third-party has been posted on the Site by us without your consent; (f) to protect the </p><p>rights, property, or personal safety of the Company, its Users or the general public; (g) when Company is undergoing any change in </p><p>control, including by means of merger, acquisition or purchase of all or substantially all of the assets of Company; (h) pursuant </p><p>to your approval, in order to supply certain services you have requested from Company; (i) to let our partners and affiliates </p><p>serve you with commercials; or (j) with respect to articles, opinions, any other documentation supplied by you for the purpose of </p><p>public use, in order to provide the services.
<br>
</p><p>6. Deletion of Personal Information
<br>
</p><p>If for any reason you wish to delete your Personal Information, you should send an email via our Contact Us page, and we will make </p><p>reasonable efforts to delete any such information pursuant to any applicable privacy laws.
<br>
</p><p>7. Cookies &amp; Local Storage
 <br>
</p><p>When you visit the Site, Company may use industry-wide technologies such as "Cookies" (or similar technologies), which stores </p><p>certain information on your computer ("Local Storage") and which will allow us to enable automatic sign-in to the Site, and make </p><p>your browsing much more convenient and effortless. For example, and for your convenience, a Cookie can "autofill" information on </p><p>forms on the Site, precluding the need for you to fill out the same information on our registration forms each time you want to </p><p>access information that requires registration. However, cookies by themselves cannot be used to discover the identity of the user; </p><p>It is easy to prohibit the Local Storage. Most browsers will allow you to erase cookies from your computer's hard drive, block </p><p>acceptance of cookies, or receive a warning before a Cookie is stored.
<br>
</p><p>We also use certain third-party cookies. These are a different kind of cookies, which are stored on your computer by a third party </p><p>site, rather than by the Company. This kind of cookie is updated each time you visit our Site, and also when you visit other </p><p>website that uses similar cookies. Third-party cookies usually store only a Non-personal Information, such as the web pages you </p><p>have visited, the duration of your browsing, etc.
<br>
</p><p>Specifically, Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on the Site. Google's use of the DART cookie enables it </p><p>to serve ads to users based on their visit to our Site and other sites on the Internet. You may opt out of the use of the DART </p><p>cookie by visiting the Google Ad And Content Network Privacy Policy.
<br>
</p><p>8. Security 
<br>
</p><p>We take a great care in maintaining the security of the Site and your information and in preventing unauthorized access to it </p><p>through industry standard technologies and internal procedures. However, we do not guarantee that unauthorized access will never </p><p>occur.
<br>
</p><p>Users who have registered to the Site agree to keep their password in strict confidence and not disclose such password to any </p><p>third party.
<br>
</p><p>9. Third Party Sites 
<br>
</p><p>While using the Site you may encounter links to third party websites. Please be advised that such third party websites are </p><p>independent sites, and we assume no responsibility or liability whatsoever with regard to privacy matters or any other legal </p><p>matter with respect to such sites. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policies and the terms of use or service of such </p><p>websites.
<br>
</p><p>10. Changes to the Privacy Policy

Company reserves the right </p><p>to change this policy at any time, so please re-visit this page frequently. In case of any material change, we will post a clear </p><p>notice on the Site.
