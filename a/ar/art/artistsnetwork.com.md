Privacy Policy Statement

This is the web site of Artists Network, a product of [F+W Publications](http://www.fwpublications.com/). 

**Summary**

At F+W, our goal is to offer products and services that will allow our customers to lead fuller, richer lives. The same holds for how we communicate with you and how we handle your personal data. It's important to us that you understand what information we collect, how we protect it, and how we use it — and to provide clear instructions if you choose to request changes in how we communicate with you. 

**General contact information**

Our postal address is:  
F+W Publications  
4700 E. Galbraith Rd.  
Cincinnati, OH, 45236 

**How our websites work**

For each visitor to our Web site, our Web server automatically recognizes your IP address. The address allows our server to deliver the information you request from us, such as a form for posting to a discussion board. We also collect visitors' IP addresses in their domain-name form, allowing us to understand for instance how many customers access our site through various service providers. We collect this information on an individual basis and in aggregate, or combined, form. 

We also collect both user-specific and aggregate information on what pages consumers access or visit. We use the information to improve the content of our Web pages, to customize the content and layout of our pages, and to notify consumers about updates to our site. We share this information with trusted partners. We or our partners may use this information to contact visitors for marketing purposes; however, you are always in control of these communications. 

If at any time you provide us with your email address to place an order or access a service, we collect that information. Areas we may collect your email address include but are not limited to discussion boards; chat areas; product or service transactions; emails you send us; and interactive forms. Finally, we keep any information volunteered by the consumer, such as survey information and/or site registrations. 

If you do not want to receive e-mail from us in the future, please let us know by using the response device that can be found at the end of every email we deliver. 

**Postal information**

If you supply us with your postal address online, you may receive periodic mailings from us and carefully selected partners with information on new products and services. If you do not wish to receive such mailings, please let us know by sending your request to List Manager, c/o F+W Publications, 4700 E. Galbraith Rd., Cincinnati OH 45236.

**Cookies**

We use cookies to store visitors' preferences, record session information such as items that consumers add to their shopping cart, record user-specific information on what pages users access or visit, alert visitors to new areas that we think might be of interest to them when they return to our site, record past activity at a site in order to provide better service when visitors return to our site, ensure that visitors are not repeatedly sent the same banner ads, and to customize Web page content based on visitors' browser type or other information that the visitor sends. 

**Ad Severs**

To bring you offers that are of interest to you, we have relationships with other companies that we allow to place ads on our Web pages. As a result of your visit to our site, ad server companies may collect information such as your domain type, your IP address and clickstream information. For further information, consult the privacy policies of:

Upon request we provide site visitors with access to transaction information (e.g., dates on which customers made purchases, amounts and types of purchases) that we maintain about them, and contact information (e.g., name, address, phone number) that we maintain about them. 

Consumers can access this information by sending your request to List Manager, c/o F+W Publications, 4700 E. Galbraith Rd., Cincinnati OH 45236. Please provide us your name and address.

We have appropriate security measures in place in our physical facilities to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information that we have collected from you at our site and we use industry-standard Secure Sockets Layer protection for transactions made on our site. 

**Changes to this policy**

From time to time, we may use customer information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our privacy notice. If our information practices change at some time in the future, we will post the policy changes to our Web site to notify you of these changes and provide you with the ability to opt out of these new uses. If you are concerned about how your information is used, you should check back at our Web site periodically.
