# Art of Problem Solving

AOPS INCORPORATED PRIVACY POLICY 

Please [click here](https://web.archive.org/company/privacy.php#coppa) for our information practices with regards to children under 13 (also listed at the end of this document). 

We take the privacy of our participants very seriously; therefore, we only collect the information necessary to provide our services efficiently. 

##  Users using our online community or other online resources requiring membership 

To post information in a forum, to use some of our online educational tools, or to attend online classes, you must become a member of the Art of Problem Solving Community. To become a member, the only personal information we require is your email address and a username that you select. The username that you select is used as an onscreen name to identify you; it is strongly recommended that it not be your real name, but a pseudonym. You will also select a password, which is needed to log on. We do ask about your general geographic location, your occupation, and interests, but none of this information is required for membership in the Community. 

Your email address is used by us to send messages to you. We do so to confirm your username and password if you should forget your username or password. We also use your email address to assist in administering our web site and to help enforce our conduct rules (for example, people who post offensive messages in the forum can be banned). Should you enroll in an Art of Problem Solving online class, your email address will be used for communication purposes for that class. We will not send solicitation emails collected as part of the Art of Problem Solving Community unless the user elects to join our mailing lists. Your email address will not be shared with or sold to any third party without your explicit consent to the effect. We take reasonable steps to protect your email address, username, password, and other information from anyone who is not authorized to have such information. We cannot be held responsible for an unauthorized person illegally obtaining that information. 

Our site has forums (message boards), private messaging, and real-time discussion available to its members. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas is potentially available to other members and in some cases to the general public. You should not disclose any personal information, such as your real name, address, telephone number, email address, etc. Your username is the only identity that you need to have, and that is how people should know you on our site. 

We may disclose data collected from Community members to a third party for educational research purposes. Such data will never contain any personally identifiable information, and will not be traceable to any individual user.

## Teachers using our Teacher Tools

Teachers using our Teacher Tools on our website must first be members of the Art of Problem Solving community. We collect certain additional information from teachers wishing to use the Teacher Tools. We collect: your name, your school's name and address, a contact phone number and email address, and your school's website URL. We use this information to verify that you are a teacher at a legitimate educational institution or homeschool, and to contact you regarding the Teacher Tools. We may request from you other proof of school affiliation, as necessary, to determine your eligibility to use our teacher tools. We will not share this information with any third party (except as may be required by law) and will not use this information for marketing or any other purposes. Teachers may enroll students in their classes using the Teacher Tools. In the case that such a student is under the age of 13, teachers agree that they, or their school, are acting as the students' parents' agent in providing consent for the online collection of students' personal information within the school context. (Please see [ this website from the Federal Trade Commission](http://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/complying-coppa-frequently-asked-questions#Schools) for more details about this provision.) 

##  Students enrolling in a class within his or her school, established by a registered teacher using our Teacher Tools 

Students who enroll in a class set up by a registered teacher using our Teacher Tools do not need to be members of the Art of Problem Solving community. We will collect your name, and you will also have to choose a unique username and password, which are both needed to log on. (If you are already a member of the Art of Problem Solving community, we will use your already-existing username and password, but you may have to additionally provide your real name.) Your real name and username, along with other data that we have collected including (but not necessarily limited to) any data collected during your use of our Alcumus online educational system, will be shared with the teacher in whose class you are enrolling. We take reasonable steps to protect your name, username, password, and other information from anyone who is not authorized to have such information. We cannot be held responsible for an unauthorized person illegally obtaining that information. We will not use this information for any other purpose, and will not share this information with any other third party (except as may be required by law). 

## Customers purchasing a product or service

We collect certain information from a customer who is purchasing a product and/or service using our online ordering system. Such information may include: your name, your shipping address, your billing address, your credit card information, your email address, and your phone number. This information is used to process your purchase and to contact you if there is an issue with your purchase. We will share this information with our credit card payment processor. Additionally, your name, shipping address, email address, and/or phone number may be shared with the United States Postal Service or other private carrier, for the purpose of delivering any purchased goods to your shipping address. We will store all of this information on our secure server, except for your credit card information, which is only retained until your payment has been processed and is not stored thereafter; however, this information may be retained by our credit card processor for the purpose of processing additional transactions, refunds, and/or chargebacks. We have taken reasonable steps to protect your personal information from anyone who is not authorized to have such information; however, we cannot be held responsible for an unauthorized person illegally obtaining your personal information. We will not use this information for any purpose other than to process your purchase, and will not share this information with any other third party, except as described above or as may be required by law. We may use your email address for marketing purposes, but only if you give your permission to do so during the purchasing process, and such permission may be withdrawn at any time by contacting us (via the methods listed under "Contact Information" below).

## Disclaimer of other sites' practices

Our site contains links to other sites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of other such sites. 

## Effective date and notice of future changes

This Privacy Policy is effective October 22, 2013. This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time as necessary. 

The federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) requires that we inform you of our practices with regards to our collection, use, or disclosure of personal information from children under age 13, and to obtain parental consent prior to collecting, using, or disclosing any such information. 

## 1\. Information we collect from children under age 13

"Child" refers to any person under the age of 13. We may collect from children: 

(a) An email address that may be used by us to communicate directly with the child. This email address is never made available to any other user of the site, nor to any third party. 

(b) A username used to uniquely identify each child. This username may be disclosed on our website, for example in our message boards, online classroom, or any other part of the site on which the child may participate. Other members of the website may use the child's username to directly contact the child (for example, by private message or in online classroom discussions). 

(c) We may ask the child to provide his or her real name. The child's name will only be used for internal purposes, or will be disclosed only to third parties to whom the child has given specific authorization, for example a teacher at the child's school who has requested access from the child to view the child's online school reports. Such third parties must request permission from us before they request this information from the child, and we make a reasonable effort to determine if the third party's request is legitimate before granting such permission. The child's real name will never be made publicly available on our website by us. 

(d) Other non-identifying data may be collected in the course of a child's participation on the website; for example, online homework submissions, live classroom discussions, etc. These data may be combined or associated with the child's username, and may be publicly available on the site. 

(e) Children using our site may have the opportunity to post personal information about themselves (for example, in a message board post or on a blog or in our online classroom). Such information may be publicly displayed on the website alongside the child's username. Although we strongly discourage such divulgence of personal information, we cannot prevent it. 

## 2\. Parental rights and responsibilities

  1. We do not collect personal information from a child, except as noted below, until we have received verifiable parental consent in accordance with COPPA. The exceptions are: 
    1. An email address is collected from a child at the time of registration, solely to contact the child's parent in order to obtain the necessary parental consent; and 
    2. A username is selected by the child; however, this username cannot be used to contact the child, nor be used for the purposes listed in sections (c) and (d) of item #1 above, unless and until we receive verifiable parental consent. 
  2. At any time, a parent can review or ask us to delete a child's personal information, or can refuse to permit its further collection or use, by contacting us by any of the means listed in item #3 below.
