### 8\. Online Tracking - Cookies and other technologies

8.1 A cookie is a text file containing small amounts of information that a website can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your computer as a tag that distinguishes your computer but does not name you. Some of our Properties use cookies to better serve you when you return to the Property. You can set your browser to notify you before you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it. You can also set your browser to turn off cookies; however, if you do this, some of the features of our Properties may not work properly. You can also reject certain cookies served through Properties by opting out on the website of the third party placing the cookie, which you can identify through your browser.

8.2 We may use or allow third parties to use tracking technologies (e.g., cookies, beacons, tracking pixels) to collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information about your browsing activities so that online advertisers can serve you advertising that better reflects your interests (“Interest-Based Ads”). For more information on Interest-Based Ads or to stop use of tracking technologies for these purposes, go to [www.aboutads.info](http://www.aboutads.info/) or [www.networkadvertising.org](http://www.networkadvertising.org/).

8.3 We may also use local shared objects, sometimes known as Flash cookies, to store your preferences or display content based upon what you view on our site to personalize your visit. Our advertisers and third-party service providers also may use Flash cookies to collect and store information. Flash cookies are different from browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored. Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies. To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies, please [click here](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html). If you disable Flash cookies, you will not have access to many features that make your guest experience more efficient and some of our services will not function properly.   
 

8.4 Finally, Web beacons are small pieces of data that are embedded in images on the pages of sites. Web beacons may involve the transmission of Information directly to us, to another party on our behalf, or to another party in accordance with its privacy policy. We may use Web beacons to bring together Information we collect about you.   
 

8.5 We may use third party tools to make the advertising we show you on our Properties and/or our partner websites more relevant and interesting to you. For this purpose, we use cookies, flash cookies, web beacons or similar technologies to collect information about your browsing behaviour, and deliver interest-based ads to you.   
 

8.6 Certain browsers may offer you the option of providing notice to websites that you do not wish for your online activities to be tracked for preference based advertising purposes (“DNT Notice”). For a variety of reasons, we do not take any action based on browser based DNT Notices. Rather, if you do not wish to participate in preference based advertising activities, you should follow the simple opt-out processes identified above.
