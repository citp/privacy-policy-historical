  * Information collected through cookies, pixel tags and other technologies
  * Demographic information and other information provided by you
  * Aggregated information

We use this information to ensure that the Services function properly.

Through your use of the App: When you download and use the App, we and our service providers may track and collect App usage data, such as the date and time the App on your device accesses our servers and what information and files have been downloaded to the App based on your device number.

Using cookies: Cookies are pieces of information stored directly on the computer that you are using. Cookies allow us to collect information such as browser type, time spent on the Services, pages visited, language preferences, and other anonymous traffic data. We and our service providers use the information for security purposes, to facilitate navigation, display information more effectively, and to personalize your experience while using the Services, as well as for online tracking purposes. We can recognize your computer to assist your use of the Services. We also gather statistical information about the usage of the Services in order to continually improve design and functionality, understand how the Services are used, and to assist us with resolving questions regarding the Services. We and our service providers may also use cookies to select which marketing emails are most likely to appeal to you based on your use of the Services, and may use cookies or other files to track your use of other websites. We do not respond to browser do-not-track signals at this time.

If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to automatically decline cookies, or be given the choice of declining or accepting the transfer to your computer of a particular cookie (or cookies) from a particular site. You may also wish to refer to http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html. However, if you do not accept these cookies, you may experience some inconvenience in your use of the Services. For example, we may not be able to recognize your computer and you may need to log in every time you visit the applicable Services.

Google Analytics and Other Google Services: We use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”).  This analytical tool uses cookies and similar technologies to help analyze how users use the Site.  You can learn about Google’s practices by going to www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/. Google offers the ability to opt out from tracking through Google Analytics cookies; for more information, visit http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.

An IP Address may be identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever a user accesses the Services, along with the time of the visit and the page(s) that were visited. Collecting IP Addresses is standard practice and is done automatically by many websites, applications and other services. We use IP Addresses for purposes such as calculating usage levels of the Services, helping diagnose server problems, and administering the Services.

From you: We may collect demographic details (such as state of residence, gender, and age), as well as information you provide to us concerning your preferred means of communication and important dates (such as birthdays, wedding dates, and anniversary dates).

By aggregating information: Aggregated Personal Information does not personally identify you or any other user of the Services. (For example, we may aggregate Personal Information to calculate the percentage of our users who have a particular telephone area code.)

How We May Use and Disclose Other Information

Please note that we may use and disclose Other Information for any purpose, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law.
