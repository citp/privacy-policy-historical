**Articles Freeway Privacy Policy**

**Our Commitment to Your Privacy**

**Articles Freeway does not sell email addresses or use email addresses or other personal information for any purpose other than to be displayed in the Resource Box as completed by the article author when the article is submitted, or to respond to any enquiries initiated on the Articles Freeway website.**

**The Information We Collect**

When you visit the Articles Freeway web site, just as when you visit most other web sites, certain anonymous information about your visit is automatically logged, which may include information about the type of browser you use, the server name and IP address through which you access the Internet (such as “google.com” or “yahoo.com”), the date and time you access the site, the pages you access while at the Just Articles web site, and the Internet address of the web site, if any, from which you linked directly to the Articles Freeway web site. This information is not personally identifiable.

**How We Use Information**

We use the information you provide about yourself when submitting an information request. We do not share this information with outside parties. We use return e-mail addresses to answer the e-mail we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties. We use the anonymous browsing information collected automatically by our servers primarily to help us administer and improve our web site. We may also use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our web site. Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.
