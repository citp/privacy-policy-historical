The Art UK website at [www.artuk.org](https://artuk.org/) ( **the  Website**) is operated by the Public Catalogue Foundation. The Public Catalogue Foundation is the data controller of personal data collected from you by this Website and related means, or otherwise provided by you to us.

The Public Catalogue Foundation ( **We, us, our** ) are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. The Data Protection Act 1998, the General Data Protection Regulation, and other applicable national data privacy laws (together, **Data Privacy Laws** ) place obligations on us in relation to the personal data that we collect and hold. This Privacy Policy (together with our [Website Terms of Use](https://artuk.org/footer/terms-of-use)) sets out how we comply with Data Privacy Laws, including detailing the basis on which any personal data we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be processed by us.

By visiting www.artuk.org (the  **Website** ) or otherwise providing us with your personal data you are doing so on the basis of the general practices described in this Privacy Policy.

Where we require your consent to process your personal data in accordance with these practices, we will seek this consent at the point at which you provide us with this data. Where we wish to process your personal data for a purpose other than that for which the personal data were collected, we will notify you of that intention and obtain any further necessary consents.

**1\. Information we may collect from you**

Where we receive personal data in this way, we will process it in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy and the terms of any consent that you provided.

**2\. Cookies**

The Website uses cookies to distinguish you from other users of the Website. This helps us to provide you with a good experience when you browse the Website and also allows us to improve the Website. For detailed information on the cookies we use and the purposes for which we use them see our [Cookies Policy](http://artuk.org/footer/use-of-cookies-14).

(b) to contact you (including by email, post or telephone) in relation to the products and services that you have signed up for;

(c) to contact you (including by email, post or telephone), about other products and services that we offer that are similar to those that you have already purchased, signed up for or enquired about, provided that you have opted in to receive these communications;

(l) to make suggestions and recommendations to you and other users of the Website about products or services that may interest you or them. We will only contact you about these products or services where you have opted in to receive these communications.

3.2 We will process your personal data on the basis of your consent, if requested, and/or our legitimate interests (which include (i) the performance of our obligations under any contracts entered into between you and us; (ii) the administration, improvement and promotion of our projects and our Website; (iii) management of relationships with our supporters; and (iv) for compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations). Where possible we will seek to use aggregate data in order to achieve these aims.

3.3 Where our processing is based on your consent, and not any other legal basis, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. This withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of processing prior to the withdrawal. If you inform us that you no longer wish to receive email or other communications from us, we will stop sending you these communications.

**4\. Disclosure of your information**

4.1 In order to provide our products and services, we may share your personal information with any member of our group, which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries, as defined in section 1159 of the UK Companies Act 2006.

4.2 Where we have your opt-in consent to do so, we may share your information with selected third parties who we work with in order to run and promote our projects, including but not limited to, the BBC, and participating collection administrations.

4.3 We may also disclose your personal information to third parties:

(a) if the Public Catalogue Foundation or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party (who will be a UK charity and a not-for-profit organisation), in which case personal data will be one of the transferred assets and the new owner may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy notice;

(b) if required to do so by Law or in we believe in good faith that we are required to do so by any order of the Courts or other competent body or agency;

(c) in order to enforce or apply our [Website Terms of Use](http://artuk.org/footer/terms-of-use) and other agreements; or

(d) in order to protect or defend our rights or property or to protect the personal safety of our employees or the public at large.

We shall only use processors that will commit to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures in order to ensure that their processing activities meet the requirements of Data Privacy Laws and ensure the protection of your data protection rights. Prior to allowing these service providers to access your personal data, we will enter into a formal agreement with them to ensure that they handle and process the information in accordance with applicable law.

4.4 We will not share your information with parties outside of the European Economic Area (the **EEA** ) unless we are legally permitted or required to do so. You should be aware that certain non-EEA countries do not require the same standards of protection of personal data as are legally required in the EEA. If we send your data to these countries, we will ensure that there are appropriate and suitable safeguards to protect your personal data. This will involve at least one of the following:

(a) we will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission;

(b) where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe; and

(c) where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US.

If you require further information on these mechanisms, please contact us at [info@artuk.org](mailto:info@artuk.org).

****5\. Data security****

5.1 All information you provide to us is stored within the EEA on secure servers provided by a third party vendor. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of the information transmitted to our Website and any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we will limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to access your data. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.

5.2 Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of the Website, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.

5.3 The Website may, from time to time, contain links to and from the websites of our partner networks, advertisers and affiliates. If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies. It is your responsibility to check those policies before you submit any personal data to these websites.
