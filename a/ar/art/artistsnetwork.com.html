<p>SUMMARY<br> This web site is owned by F+W Media, Inc. (“F+W”). At F+W, our goal is to offer products and services that will allow our customers to lead fuller, richer lives. The same holds for how we communicate with you and how we handle your personal data. It’s important to us that you understand what information we collect, how we protect it, and how we use it — and to provide clear instructions if you choose to request changes in how we communicate with you.</p>
<p>GENERAL CONTACT INFORMATION<br> Our postal address is:<br> F+W Media, Inc.<br> 10151 Carver Road Suite #200<br> Blue Ash, OH 45242<br> 513.531.2690</p>
<p>To ensure that your communications are properly routed, we ask that you identify the F+W products or services (web site, magazine, book club, etc.) relevant to your inquiry when contacting us. If you would like to receive a response, please be sure to include sufficient information to enable us to contact you (such as an email or postal address).</p>
<p>INFORMATION WE COLLECT<br> Information about your computer hardware and software<br> For each visitor to our web site, our web server automatically recognizes your IP address. The address allows our server to deliver the information you request from us, such as an article or a form for posting to a discussion board. We also collect visitors’ IP addresses in their domain-name form, allowing us to understand for instance how many visitors access our site through various service providers. We collect this information on an individual basis and in aggregate, or combined, form.</p>
<p>We also collect both user-specific and aggregate information on what pages visitors access or visit. We use the information to improve the content of our web pages and to customize the content and layout of our pages.</p>
<p>We use cookies to store visitors’ preferences, record session information such as items that consumers add to their shopping cart, record user-specific information on what pages users access or visit, alert visitors to new areas that we think might be of interest to them when they return to our site, record past activity at a site in order to provide better service when visitors return to our site, ensure that visitors are not repeatedly sent the same banner ads, and to customize Web page content based on visitors’ browser type or other information that the visitor sends. We use both session cookies and persistent cookies.</p>
<p>Email address, postal address, telephone number</p>
<p>If at any time you provide us with your email address to place an order or access a service, we collect that information. Areas in which we may collect your email address include but are not limited to discussion boards; chat areas; product or service transactions; emails you send us; and interactive forms. If you provide us with your email address, you may receive periodic promotional emails from us and carefully selected partners with information regarding special offers or new products or services. You may also receive informational emails from us related to any user accounts you have set up with us, as well as administrative notices regarding the operation of the web site.<br> If you supply us with your postal address online, you may receive periodic mailings from us and carefully selected partners with information on new products and services.</p>
<p>Visitors who supply us with their telephone numbers online may receive telephone contact from us with information regarding new products and services or upcoming events. We do not rent telephone contact information to third parties.</p>
