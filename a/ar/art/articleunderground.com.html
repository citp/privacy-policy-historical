        <p align="left" class="style1">Updated 6-15-2010</p>
        <p align="left" class="style1">My name is Mike Liebner of ArticleUnderground.com
          which is owned and operated by my company Creative Power of Studio City, California.
          This is our Privacy Policy.</p>
        <p align="left" class="style1">Your privacy and security are very important
            to us. We appreciate the subscribers, members and visitors who visit
            this web site and understand the value of protecting your rights.
          We want you to be able to enjoy our information and services with complete
            confidence that your privacy and safety will be our highest concern.</p>
        <p align="left" class="style1">There are 3 classes of individuals whom
          services and information is provided to which will be outlined in this
          document.</p>
        <p align="left" class="style1">1) Members - Members buy a product or
          service and pay a fee for access to information. We do not directly
          collect your financial information, but rather
          employ the use of a 3rd party collection service such as PayPal whom
          is liable through their terms and services which you have agreed to
          if you have made a purchase. Your name and email address and any other
          information you may provide to us is strictly for use in house
          and is not shared with any company or individuals. This information
          is secure and protected so you can become a member in confidence that
          you will be safe from public disclosure. This information is stored
          in a secure database, and is only available to individuals with proper
          clearance. Members can cancel future payments by visiting the vendor
          that collected their subscription fee - ie PayPal and/or other service.
          3rd party regulations may apply. </p>
        <p align="left" class="style1">2) Subscribers - Subscribers opt-in and
          verify that they desire to have access to information provided on this
          web site and through emails and other communications. We employ the
          use of a 3rd party Autoresponder service Aweber whom is responsible
          for collecting and protecting your information. Your name and email
          address and any other information you may provide to us is strictly
          for use in house and is not shared with any company or individuals.
          This information is secure and protected so you can become a subscriber
          in confidence that you will be safe from public disclosure. This information
          is stored in a secure database, and is only available to individuals
          with proper clearance. Subscribers can opt-out of receiving future
          communications from us when you set up your account or by updating
          your account information.</p>
        <p align="left" class="style1">3) Visitor - Visitors are not required
          to provide any information nor is any collected from you or your computer. </p>
