<p class="articletitle">ArticleAddict.com Privacy Policy</p>

<p>ArticleAddict.com strives to offer its visitors the many advantages of Internet technology and to

provide an interactive and personalized experience. We may use Personally Identifiable Information

(your name, e-mail address, street address, telephone number) subject to the terms of this privacy

policy. We will never sell, barter, or rent your email address to any unauthorized third party.</p>

<strong>How we gather information from users</strong>

<p>How we collect and store information depends on the page you are visiting, the activities in

which you elect to participate and the services provided. For example, you may be asked to provide

information when you register for access to certain portions of our web site or request certain

features, such as newsletters. Like most Web sites, ArticleAddict.com also collects information

automatically and through the use of electronic tools that may be transparent to our visitors. For

example, we may log the name of your Internet Service Provider or use cookie technology to recognize

you and hold information from your visit. Among other things, the cookie may store your user name

and password, sparing you from having to re-enter that information each time you visit, or may

control the number of times you encounter a particular advertisement while visiting our site. As we

adopt additional technology, we may also gather information through other means. In certain cases,

you can choose not to provide us with information, for example by setting your browser to refuse to

accept cookies, but if you do so you may be unable to access certain portions of the site or may be

asked to re-enter your user name and password, and we may not be able to customize the site's

features according to your preferences.</p>

<strong>What we do with the information we collect</strong>

<p>Like other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance your visit and deliver more

individualized content and advertising. We respect your privacy and do not share or sell your

information with anyone.</p>

<p>Aggregated Information (information that does not personally identify you) may be used in many

ways. For example, we may combine information about your usage patterns with similar information

obtained from other users to help enhance our site and services (e.g., to learn which pages are

visited most or what features are most attractive). Aggregated Information may occasionally be

shared with our advertisers and business partners. Again, this information does not include any

Personally Identifiable Information about you or allow anyone to identify you individually.</p>

<p>We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on www.ArticleAddict.com to communicate

with you about your registration and customization preferences; our Terms of Service and privacy

policy; services and products offered by www.ArticleAddict.com and other topics we think you might

find of interest.</p>

<p>Personally Identifiable Information collected by ArticleAddict.com may also be used for other

purposes, including but not limited to site administration, troubleshooting, processing of

e-commerce transactions, administration of sweepstakes and contests, and other communications with

you. Certain third parties who provide technical support for the operation of our site (our Web

hosting service for example) may access such information. We will use your information only as

permitted by law. In addition, from time to time as we continue to develop our business, we may

sell, buy, merge or partner with other companies or businesses. In such transactions, user

information may be among the transferred assets. We may also disclose your information in response

to a court order, at other times when we believe we are reasonably required to do so by law, in

connection with the collection of amounts you may owe to us, and/or to law enforcement authorities

whenever we deem it appropriate or necessary. Please note we may not provide you with notice prior

to disclosure in such cases.</p>

<strong>Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements</strong>

<p>ArticleAddict.com expects all its partners, advertisers and affiliates to respect the privacy of

our users. Be aware, however, that third parties, including our partners, advertisers, affiliates

and other content providers accessible through our site, may have their own privacy and data

collection policies and practices. For example, during your visit to our site you may link to, or

view as part of a frame on a www.ArticleAddict.com page, certain content that is actually created or

hosted by a third party. Also, through ArticleAddict.com you may be introduced to, or be able to

access, information, Web sites, features, contests or sweepstakes offered by other parties.

ArticleAddict.com is not responsible for the actions or policies of such third parties. You should

check the applicable privacy policies of those third parties when providing information on a feature

or page operated by a third party.</p>

<p>While on our site, our advertisers, promotional partners or other third parties may use cookies

or other technology to attempt to identify some of your preferences or retrieve information about

you. For example, some of our advertising is served by third parties and may include cookies that

enable the advertiser to determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before. Other

features available on our site may offer services operated by third parties and may use cookies or

other technology to gather information. ArticleAddict.com does not control the use of this

technology by third parties or the resulting information, and is not responsible for any actions or

policies of such third parties.</p>

<p>You should also be aware that if you voluntarily disclose Personally Identifiable Information on

message boards or in chat areas, that information can be viewed publicly and can be collected and

used by third parties without our knowledge and may result in unsolicited messages from other

individuals or third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of ArticleAddict.com and this

policy.</p>

<strong>Children</strong>

<p>ArticleAddict.com does not knowingly collect or solicit Personally Identifiable Information from

or about children under 13 except as permitted by law. If we discover we have received any

information from a child under 13 in violation of this policy, we will delete that information

immediately. If you believe ArticleAddict.com has any information from or about anyone under 13,

please contact us.</p>

<strong>Contacting Us</strong>

<p>We can be reached by email.</p>

<strong>Changes to this Policy</strong>

<p>ArticleAddict.com reserves the right to change this policy at any time. Please check this page

periodically for changes. Your continued use of our site following the posting of changes to these

terms will mean you accept those changes. Information collected prior to the time any change is

posted will be used according to the rules and laws that applied at the time the information was

collected.</p>

<p>This statement and the policies outlined herein are not intended to and do not create any

contractual or other legal rights in or on behalf of any party.</p>
