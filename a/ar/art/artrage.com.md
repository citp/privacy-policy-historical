# Privacy - ArtRage

### Our ethics, policies & principles

## Ambient Design Privacy Policy

 _We consider the privacy of our visitors to be extremely important._

## Who we are

Ambient Design is a New Zealand based software development company specializing in creative tools for artists. Our flagship product is ArtRage, a simple and stylish digital painting product that presents a high technology paint simulation in an easy to use interface that lets anyone play with paint, available across a range of platforms.

## ArtRage Software

### ArtRage Desktop Editions

Versions of ArtRage that come with a Serial Number do not use DRM (Digital Rights Management), or run any kind of background services. Once you have installed one of these products, you do not need an internet connection at all, except for an optional update check that will alert you to updates if you choose. This update check does not run without prompting you for permission each time it is scheduled.

Versions of ArtRage bought from an external store that do not come with a Serial Number may use licensing services provided by the store from which the product was purchased. In these cases, Ambient Design does not gather any data and you can refer to the Privacy Policy of the store for further information.

The only additional software that may be installed with these products is a Thumbnail Viewer on Windows that allows the operating system to preview ArtRage files. This viewer does not collect or transmit any data. These versions of ArtRage do not include ads.

### ArtRage Mobile Editions

The Mobile editions of ArtRage (including ArtRage for iOS, ArtRage for Android, and some older products purchased from external stores) do not include adware or any other background services. Ambient Design does not collect any personal data or require an active internet connection to use these products. Licensing and updates are handled by the store from which the product was purchased and you can refer to the Privacy Policy for that store for further information.
