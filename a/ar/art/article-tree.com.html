<font face="Verdana" size="2"></font>
<p><font size="2">article-tree</font><font size="2" face="Verdana">.com continually makes a concerted effort to offer its visitors the latest in Internet technologies, and to provide a highly interactive and more user friendly experience. </font></p>

<font face="Verdana" size="2">
</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">

We may use Personally Identifiable Information (your name, e-mail address) subject to the terms of the following privacy policy.  www.article-tree.com will never sell, barter, rent or give any of your contact information to any unauthorized third party. Period.</font></p>

<font face="Verdana" size="2"><p>

<b>How we gather information from users</b><br>

How we collect and store information depends on the page you are visiting, the activities in which you elect to participate and the services provided. For example, you may be asked to provide information when you register for access to certain portions of our site or request certain features, such as newsletters.</p>

</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">You may provide information when you participate in sweepstakes and contests, message boards and chat rooms, and other interactive areas of our site. Like most web sites, article-tree.com also collects information automatically and through the use of electronic tools that may be transparent to our visitors.

</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"></font></p><blockquote><font face="Verdana" size="2">

<font color="red">For example</font>, we may log the name of your Internet Service Provider or use cookie technology (Via your IP Address.), to recognize you and hold information from your visit.

</font></blockquote><font face="Verdana" size="2">

Among other things, the cookie may store your user name and password, sparing you from having to re-enter that information each time you visit, or may control the number of times you encounter a particular advertisement while visiting our site. <p></p>

<p>As we adopt additional technology, we may also gather information through other means. In certain cases, you can choose not to provide us with information.

</p><blockquote>

<font color="red">For example</font> by setting your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but if you do you may be unable to access certain portions of the site or may be asked to re-enter your user name and password, and we may not be able to customize the site's features according to your preferences.

</blockquote>

<p>

<b>What we do with the information we collect</b><br>
Like other web publishers, we collect information to enhance your visit and deliver more individualized content and advertising. We respect your privacy and we do not share your information with anyone. </p>

<p>

Aggregated Information (information that does not personally identify you) may be used in many ways.

</p><blockquote>

<font color="red">For example</font>, we may combine information about your usage patterns with similar information obtained from other users to help enhance our site and services (e.g., to learn which pages are visited most or what features are most attractive).

</blockquote>

Aggregated Information may occasionally be shared with our advertisers and business partners. Again, this information does not include any Personally Identifiable Information about you or allow anyone to
identify you individually.<p></p>

</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">

We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on article-tree.com to communicate with you about your registration and customization preferences; our Terms of Service and privacy policy; services and products offered by article-tree.com and other topics we think
you might find of interest.</font></p>

<font face="Verdana" size="2"></font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">

Personally Identifiable Information collected by article-tree.com may also be used for other purposes, including but not limited to site administration, troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce transactions, administration of sweepstakes and contests, and other communications with you. Certain third parties who provide technical support for the operation of our site (our Web hosting service for example) may access such information.</font></p>

<font face="Verdana" size="2"><p>

We will use your information only as permitted by law. In addition, from time to time as we continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner with other companies or businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets. We may also disclose your information in response to a court order, at other times when we believe we are reasonably required to do so by law, in connection with the collection of amounts you may owe to us, and/or to law enforcement authorities whenever we deem it appropriate or necessary. Please note we may not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in such cases.</p>
