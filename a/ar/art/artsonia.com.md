**_ARTSONIA'S PRIVACY POLICY:_**

At Artsonia, we are committed to protecting your privacy. We use the information we collect about you to process orders and to provide a more personalized service. Our privacy policy, described below, is designed to use the information we collect about our visitors with utmost care and responsibility. 

1\. **The information you provide to us**

The information you provide to us through the website is used to process orders and to provide enhanced and more personalized service.  The data in our databases is protected against unauthorized access through state-of-the-art security procedures and software. 

The information you provide to us is for internal business use only by Artsonia and its partners, subsidiaries and affiliates. We do not sell this information to unaffiliated third parties. However, in connection with an assignment, sale, joint venture or other transfer or disposition of some or all of the assets of Artsonia, we may accordingly assign, sell, license or transfer any information, including personally identifying information, to third parties. 

Artsonia may disclose personal information if we believe, in good faith, that such disclosure is necessary to comply with the law, enforce or apply the terms of our user agreements or to protect the property, rights or safety of Artsonia, our users or others.

**Information collected from children:** Artsonia encourages parents and guardians to monitor and participate in their children’s online activities. We do not collect any personally identifying information from users under 18 years of age. Teachers are responsible for obtaining parental permission before they set up a screen-name for students (which is often, but not necessarily, the first name and a numerical suffix). No personally identifying information should be submitted to this site by users under 13 years of age and users under 13 years of age are not allowed to register for newsletters, clubs or activities without the permission of parents and/or teachers. In addition, users under 18 years of age may not make purchases or participate in contests, except those specifically directed to children.

2\. **The information you post publicly on the Artsonia website**

You should be aware that any personal information - such as your name or school - that you post on the Artsonia website publicly is accessible to other users of the website and could be collected and disclosed by others. Artsonia cannot take responsibility for such collection or disclosure. 

3\. **Identifying information about students**

It is our policy to protect the identity of the students showcasing their work on Artsonia. These students will be identified only by their screen name (which is often, but not necessarily, the student's first name and a numerical suffix). Artsonia does not post the full name, mailing address or email address of students on its website, except with permission. There is no way for the visitors of the website to directly and privately contact the students based on their screen name. 

4\. **Arts-eCards (Electronic Greeting Cards)**

When you send an electronic greeting card through our website, we send an email to the recipient on your behalf.
