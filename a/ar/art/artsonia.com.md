# Artsonia Teachers - Privacy Policy

#### Privacy Policy

At Artsonia, we are committed to protecting every User's privacy. We use the information we collect to process orders and to provide a more personalized service. Artsonia's privacy policy, described below, is designed to use the information we collect about visitors with utmost care and responsibility. 

* * *

**1\. Information Provided By All Users of the Website**

The information Users provide to Artsonia through the website is used to process orders, to provide enhanced and more personalized service, and to properly index and display artwork. The data in Artsonia's databases is protected against unauthorized access through state-of-the-art security procedures and software. 

The information Users provide to Artsonia is for internal business use only by Artsonia. We do not sell this information to anyone. 

Personally identifying information that Users provide upon registration as a member of an artist's fan club may be revealed to the artist's parents but not to any other third parties. The first name and relationship to the artist may be posted alongside the artwork to enable artists and parents to see who all have joined the fan club and have seen the artwork. 

Artsonia may disclose personal information if we believe, in good faith, that such disclosure is necessary to comply with the law, enforce or apply the terms of Artsonia's user agreements or to protect the property, rights or safety of Artsonia, the users or others. 

**2\. Information Provided By Teachers**

Teachers who wish to display their students' artwork on Artsonia are required to register as members. The information provided during the registration process is used to communicate with the Teacher as well as to create a school gallery on Artsonia, which will list the Teacher name and the name of the school. Teachers should be aware that the personal information about themselves - the name and school - is posted on the website and publicly accessible to all users of the website and could be collected and disclosed by others. Artsonia cannot take responsibility for such collection or disclosure. Artsonia does, however keep all Teachers emails completely private (emails are never posted on the website) and does not sell this list to anyone. 

To organize artwork, teachers input first and last names of students in a secured teacher roster. The first and last names are entered in separate fields, and unique screennames are then generated for each student, based on the entry in the first name field. It is the Teacher's responsibility to ensure that only the first names are added in the first name field. Artsonia cannot be held responsible for Teachers entering last names or any other identifying information in the first name field. The information in the last name field is never posted publicly on Artsonia, and both the first and last names will never be divulged to any third party. Artsonia does not sell or barter any identifying information about students to any third parties. 

**3\. Information Provided by Kids (Children Under 18)**

Kids who wish to display their artwork on Artsonia are required to register with Artsonia. Artsonia's policy is not to collect any more information from kids than is absolutely necessary. During the registration process we ask for the following information: the kid's first and last names (these enable Artsonia to generate a unique screenname for each kid), grade and country of residence (these enable Artsonia to index the artwork under grade-based and country-based galleries), a title for the artwork (which is displayed with the artwork) and a parent's email address. Artsonia sends the parent an email notifying that their son/daughter has registered with Artsonia with the intention of displaying his/her artwork on the Artsonia website. If parental consent is not received within two weeks, all information about the kid is deleted from Artsonia's records and the kid's registration is cancelled. Further, every time a kid uploads any piece of artwork to Artsonia, the parent is informed by email. If parental consent is not received within two weeks, that artwork and its title are removed from Artsonia's databases. In no event will Artsonia display an artwork uploaded by a kid without first receiving consent from one of his/her parents. 

  * We DO NOT collect online contact information from kids without parental notification, which will include an opportunity to suspend participation in the activity. 
  * We DO NOT collect personally identifiable offline contact information from kids. 
  * We DO NOT distribute to third parties any personally identifiable information collected from kids. 
  * We DO NOT publicly post identifiable information collected from kids without first obtaining parental consent. 
  * We DO NOT require a kid to provide Artsonia with more information than is reasonably necessary to participate as a condition of participation. 



Kids under 13 years of age are not allowed to register for Artsonia fan clubs and kids under 18 are not allowed to purchase any products from Artsonia. 

If a Parent of a kid under 18 wants Artsonia to remove their kid's artwork that has already been published on the website (either by the kid with the parent's permission or by the kid's school), the Parent can request that the artwork and all information about the kid be removed from Artsonia's records. Parent need to compose and mail a signed letter to the address noted below indicating the kid's screenname and the artid(s) of the artwork(s) that the Parent wants removed.

**4\. Identifying Information About Artists**

It is Artsonia's policy to protect the identity of the artists showcasing their work on Artsonia. These artists will be identified only by their screenname (which is often, but not necessarily, the artist's first name and a numerical suffix). Artsonia does not post the full name, mailing address or email address of artists on its website. There is no way for the visitors of the website to directly and privately contact the artists based on a screenname. 

However, if the artist has signed his/her full name as part of the artwork image, or if the submitter erroneously entered the last name of the artist in the first name textbox field, Artsonia cannot take responsibility for any damages incurred due to the negligence of the submitter of the artwork. We strongly encourage teachers and parents to submit artwork and/or digital images of artwork where the artist's last name (if it exists in the artwork) has been removed, erased or covered. We strongly encourage teachers and parents to verify that only the first name is entered in the first name field when submitting artwork. 

**5\. Information Posted Publicly on Artsonia**

Users should be aware that any personal information - such as name or school - that is posted on Artsonia is accessible to other users of the website and could be collected and disclosed by others. (For example, if a User leaves a comment for an artist). Artsonia cannot take responsibility for such collection or disclosure. We strongly discourage users from using personally identifying information in comments that they leave for artists. Specifically we encourage parents who approve the comments to erase all email addresses and last names. 

**6\. eCards (Electronic Greeting Cards)**

When a User sends an electronic greeting card through Artsonia, an email is sent to the recipient on the User's behalf. Artsonia's policy is to respect the privacy and confidentiality of the content of the electronic greeting cards sent.
