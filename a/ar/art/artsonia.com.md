**ARTSONIA'S PRIVACY POLICY:**

At Artsonia, we are committed to protecting your privacy. We use the information we collect about you to process orders and to provide a more personalized service. Our privacy policy, described below, is designed to use the information we collect about our visitors with utmost care and responsibility.

> **1\. Information provided by all users of the website**
> 
> The information you provide to us through the website is used to process orders, to provide enhanced and more personalized service, and to properly index and display your artwork. The data in our databases is protected against unauthorized access through state-of-the-art security procedures and software.
> 
> The information you provide to us is for internal business use only by Artsonia and its partners, subsidiaries, sponsors and affiliates. We do not sell this information to unaffiliated third parties. However, in connection with an assignment, sale, joint venture or other disposition of assets of Artsonia, we may accordingly assign, sell, license or transfer any information, including personally identifying information.
> 
> Personally identifying information that you provide when you register as a member of a kid's fanclub may be revealed to the kid's parents but not to any other third parties. Your first name and relationship to the child may be posted alongside the kid's artwork to enable kids and parents to see who all have joined the kid's fanclub and have seen the kid's art.
> 
> Artsonia may disclose personal information if we believe, in good faith, that such disclosure is necessary to comply with the law, enforce or apply the terms of our user agreements or to protect the property, rights or safety of Artsonia, our users or others.
> 
> **2\. Information provided by teachers**
> 
> Teachers who wish to display their students' artwork on Artsonia are required to register as members. The information that you provide during the registration process is used to communicate with you as well as to create a school gallery on Artsonia, which will list your name and the name of your school. You should be aware that the personal information about you - your name and school - that is posted on the website is publicly accessible to all users of the website and could be collected and disclosed by others. Artsonia cannot take responsibility for such collection or disclosure.
> 
> When you wish to submit your students' artwork to Artsonia, you will be asked for each student's first and last names. We ask for this information in order to generate a unique "screenname" for each of your kids (which is usually the student's first name and a number) and to help you keep track of who is associated with each screenname. It is your responsibility to ensure that only the first names are added in the first name field. Artsonia cannot be held responsible for entering last names or any other identifying information in the first name field. The information in the last name field is never posted publicly on our website.
> 
> **3\. Information provided by kids (children under 18)**
> 
> Kids who wish to display their artwork on Artsonia are required to register with Artsonia. Artsonia's policy is not to collect any more information from kids than is absolutely necessary. During the registration process we ask for the following information: the kid's first and last names (these enable us to generate a unique screenname for each kid), grade and country of residence (these enable us to index the artwork under grade-based and country-based galleries), a title for the artwork (which is displayed with the artwork) and a parent's email address. Artsonia sends the parent an email notifying that their son/daughter has registered with Artsonia with the intention of displaying his/her artwork on the Artsonia website. If parental consent is not received within two weeks, all information about the kid is deleted from our records and the kid's registration is cancelled. Further, every time a kid uploads any piece of artwork to Artsonia, the parent is informed by email. If parental consent is not received within two weeks, that artwork and its title are removed from our databases. In no event will Artsonia display an artwork uploaded by a kid without first receiving consent from one of his/her parents.
> 
>   * We DO NOT collect online contact information from kids without parental notification, which will include an opportunity to suspend participation in the activity.
>   * We DO NOT collect personally identifiable offline contact information from kids.
>   * We DO NOT distribute to third parties any personally identifiable information collected from kids.
>   * We DO NOT publicly post identifiable information collected from kids without first obtaining parental consent.
>   * We DO NOT require a kid to provide us with more information than is reasonably necessary to participate as a condition of participation.
> 

> 
> Kids under 13 years of age are not allowed to register for our newsletter or the fan clubs and kids under 18 are not allowed to purchase any products from Artsonia.
> 
> If you are a parent of a child under 18 and you want us to remove your child's artwork that has already been published on our website (either by your child with your permission or by your child's school), you can request that the artwork and all information about the child be removed from our records. Please write a signed letter to the address noted below indicating your child's screenname and the artid(s) of the artwork(s) that you want removed.

> **4\. Identifying information about kids**
> 
> It is our policy to protect the identity of the kids showcasing their work on Artsonia. These kids will be identified only by their screenname (which is often, but not necessarily, the kid's first name and a numerical suffix). Artsonia does not post the full name, mailing address or email address of kids on its website, except with permission. There is no way for the visitors of the website to directly and privately contact the kids based on their screenname.
> 
> However, if the kid has signed his/her full name as part of the artwork image, or if the submitter erroneously entered the last name of the artist in the first name field, Artsonia cannot take responsibility for removing the kid's last name. We strongly encourage teachers and parents to submit artwork and/or digital images of artwork where the kid's last name (if it exists in the artwork) has been removed, erased or covered. We strongly encourage teachers and parents to verify that only the first name is entered in the first name field when submitting artwork.
> 
> **5\. The information you post publicly on the Artsonia website**
> 
> You should be aware that any personal information - such as your name or school - that you post on the Artsonia website publicly is accessible to other users of the website and could be collected and disclosed by others. Artsonia cannot take responsibility for such collection or disclosure. We strongly discourage our users from using personally identifying information in comments that they leave for artists.

> **6\. Arts-eCards (Electronic Greeting Cards)**

We do not sell, barter or exchange email addresses that you give us when sending an electronic greeting card.
