**Arth Salutions’s Use of Cookies and NPII**  
Arth Salutions’s technology utilizes cookies in the delivery of advertisements to our Advertiser’s Prospects on our Partner’s websites across the internet. This form of marketing is called Retargeting; and it enhances the web surfing experience by showing advertisements to the Prospect that are of interest to them. When a Prospect visits one of Arth Salutions’s Advertiser’s websites, a Arth Salution pixel on that site sets a Arth Salution cookie on the hard drive of the Prospect. When that Prospect visits one of Arth Salutions’s Partners’ websites; our Partner’s website will identify the cookie on hard drive of the Prospect and recognize that they previously visited our Advertiser’s website. The Prospect will then be shown an advertisement from that Advertiser. In this instance, Arth Salutions will know that the Prospect first visited our Advertiser’s website, and then our Partner’s website. We will know the Prospect viewed the Ad on our Partner’s website, and whether or not the Prospect clicked on that Ad. This type information is what Arth Salution uses in reporting; and in no way can be used to identify who that Prospect is, or any other online activities of the Prospect outside of Arth Salutions’s Advertisers and Partner’s websites. 

The NPII data collected by Arth Salutions in the above outlined process of Retargeting will be kept by Arth Salutions indefinitely; and maintained and archived in our secured servers. This information is used strictly for reporting purposes and is not tied to personal information.
