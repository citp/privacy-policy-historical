**What information do we collect?**  
This Website collects information that falls into one of two categories - personally identifiable information and aggregated information. Personally identifiable information is information that can be used to identify you. Aggregated information is information that is not associated with a specific user, such as the number of people who visit the Website from various states.

We collect personally identifiable information (such as name, email, residence address, and credit card information) whenever you voluntarily submit it to the Website. Examples of this type information include when you make a purchase, answer our polls, enter sweepstakes or contests, fill out the registration page, send us feedback or post in our chat rooms or message boards. If you register, we might also ask you about your music preferences or other information to customize the site for you. You always have the option of choosing not to reveal this personally identifiable information to us, although certain services may be unavailable if you do not. In the event of a complaint, we may also receive and collect personally identifiable information about you from other parties in our Website or from other users or third parties who may communicate information to us about you in relation to that complaint.

In addition, we collect and store statistics and other information about the online activities of our visitors on an aggregated (collective) basis. For example, we track the number of people who view each page, the order in which pages are viewed, and other information to learn which features are the most popular and to refine our design and marketing efforts.

**How do we use the personal information we collect?**  
Both aggregated and personally identifiable information is used to operate and enhance our site and enhance your on-site experience by displaying content and marketing messages that we believe will be of interest to you.

Except as described below or otherwise indicated, we do not sell your personally identifiable information to third parties. On some pages where we ask for your personally identifiable information, we may tell you that the data we are collecting on that page will be shared with third parties. Information gathered from such pages may be shared with or sold to third-parties.

We also may share or sell your personally identifiable information with third parties who provide services to our Website or are affiliated with our Website in order to enhance the functionality available to you as part of the Website, and to provide you with new products and services. 

We use the personal information we collect to communicate about or deliver a purchase, to notify you if you've won a prize, or to be able to personalize a part of the site with the services and information you choose. If you chose to subscribe to our newsletter or have not opted out of getting email from us or from other companies about events, products and services, we use your personal information to select and deliver messages to you.

Aggregated information is used to sell and deliver advertising. We disclose aggregated information about our site to third parties, including informing our advertisers whether their advertisement was effective.

Some online activities necessarily lead to disclosure of your personally identifiable information to third parties, such as when you include your name and email address in an email to a third party or when you order merchandise in the Superstore. Importantly, information you provide as part of your Member Profile is not confidential, and is accessible by the public. Similarly, any information you provide in chat rooms, message boards, or other public forums is not confidential. For such activities, a separate warning may not be provided. Your choice to disclose personally identifiable information in these cases is voluntary.

In addition, you agree that ARTISTdirect.com may assign, sell, license, or otherwise transfer to a third party, your name, address, e-mail address, member name and any other personal information in connection with an assignment, sale, joint venture, or other transfer or disposition of a portion or all of the assets or stock of ARTISTdirect.com or its affiliated entities.
