This Privacy Policy may be modified from time to time; the date of the most recent revision will appear on this page, so check back often. Continued access of Articles Factory by you will constitute your acceptance of any changes or revisions to the Privacy Policy. It is the goal of Articles Factory to bring you information that is tailored to your individual needs and, at the same time, protect your privacy. The following is a summary of the various ways we treat the information you provide us while using our site.

**The Type Of Information Articles Factory Collects**

Articles Factory generally collects personally identifying information with your specific knowledge and consent. For instance, when you enter a sweepstakes or contest, complete a survey, make a purchase, subscribe to our newspapers, or register for any portion of our services, you are asked to provide information, such as your e-mail address, name or phone number. Optional information such as your age or gender may also be requested. 

**How Articles Factory Uses Information Provided By You**

Articles Factory uses this information to provide you with the service you have requested. For example, if you subscribe to any of our newspapers, we may use your e-mail address to send you a confirmation notice and your mailing address to send you your newspaper. Similarly, if you enter an online sweepstakes, we will use this information to notify you if you are a winner. We may also use the information to communicate with you about new features, products or services, or to improve the services that we offer by tailoring them to your needs.
