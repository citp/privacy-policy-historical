To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested.

On some pages you can make requests, and register to receive our **[Art Inspiration Newsletter](https://web.archive.org/web/20171213150145id_/http%3A//www.artquotes.net/subscribe.htm)**.

We use the information you provide about yourself when subscribing to our **[Art Inspiration Newsletter](https://web.archive.org/web/20171213150145id_/http%3A//www.artquotes.net/subscribe.htm)** or requesting information only to fulfill your request. We do not share this information with outside parties. 

We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties. 

You can register with our website if you would like to receive our **[Art Inspiration Newsletter](https://web.archive.org/web/20171213150145id_/http%3A//www.artquotes.net/subscribe.htm)** as well as updates on our new products and services.

If you wish to subscribe to our newsletter, we will use your name and email address to send the newsletter to you. Out of respect for your privacy, we provide you a way to unsubscribe.

We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals. 

We use third-party advertising companies like Google Adsense to serve ads when you visit ArtQuotes.net. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.

Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.

We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.

**Links to Other Sites**

This Web site contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by ArtQuotes.net. Please be aware that we, ArtQuotes.net, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. 

  
We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. 

  
This privacy statement applies only to information collected by this Web site.

  
**Our Commitment To Children's Privacy:**

Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.

We use this procedure to better safeguard your information.
