			<font color="#c3300">artnet</font> has created this <b>privacy statement</b> in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses the information gathering and dissemination practices for our Web site.<br><br>
If you have questions about <font color="#c3300">artnet</font>'s privacy policy or if you feel that we are not abiding to the terms of this privacy policy, you should contact Customer Support via <a href="#" onclick="window.open('/misc/formMailer.aspx?email=D98007E45173526C0763BE5FEB53A38DFA948A43A50CE355','formMailer','location=no,scrollbars=yes,menubar=no,toolbars=no,resizable=yes')">email</a>
<br><br>
<b>Information Collection and Use</b><br>
<font color="#c3300">artnet</font> collects information from users at several different points on its site and it is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We do not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. The <font color="#c3300">artnet</font> site contains links to other sites. <font color="#c3300">artnet</font> is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of Web sites that link to or from <font color="#c3300">artnet</font>.<br><br>
<b>Registration and Order Forms</b><br>
In order to use some of our services, users must become a registered user (a.k.a. "Member") by first completing the Member Services registration form. This registration form requires users to supply their contact information (e.g., name and address) and financial information (e.g., credit card number). In addition, Bookstore customers have the option to fill out an order form in the Bookstore section of the site to purchase items from the Bookstore without registering through Member Services.<br><br>
We use this customer contact information to send information to our registered users about the services for which they have subscribed. We use the financial information collected to verify the user's identity and to bill the user for products and services. It is optional for users to provide demographic information (such as income level and art interest), but we encourage users to provide this information so that we can provide a more personalized experience on our web site.<br><br>  
<b>Cookies</b><br>
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. <font color="#c3300">artnet</font> uses cookies in the Member Services area of our site to save users' passwords so that they don't have to re-enter it each time they visit the Member Services area of the site. Cookies on our site are in no way linked to any personally identifiable information. Some of our business partners use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers) and we have no access to or control over these cookies.<br><br>
<font color="#cc3300">artnet</font> uses pixels, or transparent GIF files, to help manage online advertising. These GIF files are provided by our ad management partner, DoubleClick. These files enable DoubleClick to recognize a unique cookie on your Web browser, which in turn enables us to learn which advertisements bring users to our website. The cookie was placed by us, or by another advertiser who works with DoubleClick. With both cookies and Spotlight technology, the information that we collect and share is anonymous and not personally identifiable. It does not contain your name, address, telephone number, or email address. For more information about DoubleClick, including information about how to opt out of these technologies, go to <a href="http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/index.aspx">http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/index.aspx</a>. Should person-related or person-relatable data be collected, for example by means of pixels or transparent GIF files, <font color="#cc3300">artnet</font> assures that in the collection, processing and use of such data, all privacy laws will be adhered to.<br><br>
<b>Log Files</b><br>
We use your IP (Internet Provider) address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. Your We use IP addresses to analyze trends and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.<br><br>
<b>Data Sharing</b><br>
We do not give out, sell or rent registered user address, credit or debit card information except where needed to deliver a product or service that a registered user has ordered or to comply with valid legal process or in special cases. We may occasionally share aggregated user demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify an individual person.<br><br>
We use an outside shipping company to ship orders, and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.<br><br>
<b>Links To Other Web Sites</b><br>
This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that <font color="#c3300">artnet</font> is not responsible for the privacy practices of sites which link to or from <font color="#c3300">artnet</font>. We encourage our users to read the privacy statements of every web site they visit that collects personally identifiable information.<br><br>
<b>Surveys &amp; Contests</b><br>
From time-to-time <font color="#c3300">artnet</font> will request information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is voluntary.  Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code and age). This contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used to make improvements to our Web site. This information may also be shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis (no individual demographic information will be supplied to advertisers).<br><br>
<b>Security</b><br>
<font color="#c3300">artnet</font> has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. <font color="#c3300">artnet</font> takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card numbers), that information is encrypted and is protected with SSL encryption software.<br><br>
While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also take precautions to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only authorized employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information.<br><br>
<b>Correspondence With Users</b><br>
We send all registered users an email confirming their password, username and service selection each time they change their service selection or create/update their profiles. We also send site and service announcement updates that contain important information about the services on our Web site. In addition, our Customer Support Department may, as the individual situation warrants, communicate with users via telephone or email to provide them with services they have requested or to follow-up on issues relating to their account.<br><br>
We do not sell, rent or otherwise provide our registered users email addresses to third parties. However we occasionally send postcards to our registered users informing them of our new products, services, or special auctions. Users who do not wish to receive this correspondence should send an <a href="#" onclick="window.open('/misc/formMailer.aspx?email=D98007E45173526C0763BE5FEB53A38DFA948A43A50CE355','formMailer','location=no,scrollbars=yes,menubar=no,toolbars=no,resizable=yes')">email</a> specifying their request along with their username, name, and address.<br><br>
<b>Correcting/Updating Personal Information:</b><br>
Registered users can update their address or credit/debit card information at any time by logging into the <a href="/services/MyAccount">Member Services</a> area of the site (using their Username and Password) and then clicking on the "Update Personal Information" link. In addition, <font color="#c3300">artnet</font> Customer Support is available Monday-Friday (9-5pm) to assist registered users with updating their contact information. Customer Support can be reached via telephone: [+1] (212) 497-9700 or <a href="#" onclick="window.open('/misc/formMailer.aspx?email=D98007E45173526C0763BE5FEB53A38DFA948A43A50CE355','formMailer','location=no,scrollbars=yes,menubar=no,toolbars=no,resizable=yes')">email</a>.
<br><br>
<b>Public Forums/Email Communication</b><br>
This site makes chat rooms, message boards, free email and news groups available to its users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and users should exercise caution when disclosing personal information. <font color="#c3300">artnet</font> does not monitor the online communication (including emails) which take place on our site except to comply with valid legal process, to protect the rights or property of <font color="#c3300">artnet</font>, or for emergencies.<br><br>
<b>Note To Parents</b><br>
At <font color="#c3300">artnet</font> we are aware that many children may want to visit us on the internet. Although we welcome browsing, we encourage children to receive permission from their parents before submitting any personal information over the internet. <font color="#c3300">artnet</font> believes parents should be responsible for supervising the online activities of their children and taking into account various tools that allow them to provide their children with a controlled, child-friendly internet. These tools are designed to preclude children from releasing personal information online without the permission of their parents.<br><br>
<b>Notification of Changes to This Privacy Policy</b><br>
Our privacy policy is posted in the "About Us" section of our site. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will update our privacy policy and notify our registered users via email.<br><br>
<b>Contacting Us</b><br>
If you have any questions about <font color="#c3300">artnet</font>'s privacy statement or the practices of this site, please contact Customer Support via <a href="#" onclick="window.open('/misc/formMailer.aspx?email=D98007E45173526C0763BE5FEB53A38DFA948A43A50CE355','formMailer','location=no,scrollbars=yes,menubar=no,toolbars=no,resizable=yes')">email</a>.<br><br>
