A reference to “ **Arm”** , “ **we** ,” “ **us** ” or the “ **Company** ” is a reference to Arm Ltd of 110 Fulbourn Road, Cambridge CB1 9NJ, UK.

Scope

Arm is the controller of your Personal Data as described in this Privacy Statement. 

For the avoidance of doubt, this Privacy Statement does not apply to the extent we process Personal Data in the role of a processor on behalf of our customers, including where we offer to our customers various cloud products and services.

The Personal Data that we collect directly from you includes the following:

  * If you express an interest in obtaining additional information about our services, use our "Contact Us" or similar features, register to use our websites, sign up for an event, contest, or download certain content, we will require that you provide to us your contact information, such as your name, job title, company name, address, phone number, email address or username and password;

  * If you use and interact with our services, we automatically collect information about your device and your usage of our services, through log files and other technologies, some of which may qualify as Personal Data (please see the "Device and Usage Data” section below for more information); and
  * If you visit our offices, you will be required to register as a visitor and to provide your name, email address, phone number, company name and time and date of arrival. 



If you provide us with any Personal Data relating to other individuals, you must explain to those individuals that their Personal Data will be used in accordance with this Privacy Statement. If you believe that your Personal Data has been provided to us improperly, or if you otherwise wish to exercise your rights relating to your Personal Data, please contact us by using the information set out in the “Contact Us” section below. 

2\. From Other Sources

We also collect information about you from other sources and combine this information with Personal Data provided by you. This helps us to update, expand and analyze our records, identify new customers and create more tailored advertising to provide services that may be of interest to you. In particular, we collect Personal Data from third party providers of business contact information, including professional contact details, employment-related information (such as job titles) and device / location-related information (such as IP addresses) for purposes of targeted advertising, delivering relevant email content, event promotion and profiling.

We obtain information through partners, vendors, suppliers and other third parties. These enterprises largely fall into the following categories: partners, hosts or vendors at events or trade shows, research partners and enterprises that deploy the Arm technology or third-party offerings that include Arm technology. We might also obtain information through a partner as part of our business operations. This kind of data is used for work such as improving algorithms and data models, product testing and improvement, enhancing existing products and developing new capabilities and features.

Device and Usage Data

We use common information-gathering tools, such as cookies, web beacons and similar technologies, to automatically collect information that may contain Personal Data from your computer or mobile device as you navigate our websites, our services or interact with emails we have sent to you. 

We gather certain information automatically in connection with the use of our website by individual users. This information may include IP address (or proxy server), device and application identification numbers, location, browser type, Internet service provider and/or mobile carrier, the pages and files viewed, searches, operating system and system configuration information and date/time stamps associated with your usage.

In addition, we gather certain information automatically as part of your use of the cloud products and services. This information may include the information described in the preceding paragraph.

This device and usage data is primarily used for the purposes of identifying the uniqueness of each user logging on (as opposed to specific individuals), apart from where it is strictly required to identify an individual (e.g., by means of an obvious identifier, such as a name) for security purposes or as required as part of our provision of the services to our customers (where we act as a processor). In any event, device and usage data will constitute your Personal Data.
