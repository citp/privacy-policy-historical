# The Armchair Empire - Privacy Statement

The Armchair Empire understands and respects the privacy of its visitors.  As such we have provided the following information regarding our privacy policies.

Visitors to The Armchair Empire are not subject to involuntary information disclosure of any nature, other than those intrinsic to the operation of the site and the World Wide Web in general. Certain operations and features on The Armchair Empire may require the use of cookies and/or the propagation of session information. These cookies and sessions facilitate the visitor's experience at The Armchair Empire, but do not represent any other security or privacy concern outside of isolated, per visit session identification and/or recurring sessions for the purpose of storing and maintaining user submitted site preferences.

The Armchair Empire does not collect private information from its users without their knowledge. Generally, users who come to The Armchair Empire are not required to disclose personal or private information. However, some special services such as forums and user content may require registration in order to allow full access to features. Further, The Armchair Empire encourages users to provide cursory private and/or personal information to build the community aspect of the site, and to obtain basic group demographics data for statistical analysis. The Armchair Empire does NOT sell, lease or rent to third parties, any private information linkable to a particular user and gathered through the registration process, without express consent from its users as indicated through information forms that users voluntarily fill out.

From time to time, The Armchair Empire will offer incentives to users in the form of contests, prizes, and giveaways, and request that users fill out surveys or questionnaires to qualify for participation in these special promotions. Unless explicitly indicated, information from these surveys, and questionnaires are used in group demographics studies and for better audience targeting - no direct relationship between demographic data and individual users is ever available to third parties.

The Armchair Empire will take reasonable precautionary measures to protect and safeguard all information gathered from its users. The Armchair Empire does not, however, take any responsibility for any breach of security, accidental disclosure, theft, or tampering of its users' information.

**Privacy for Children - As per COPA**

Although The Armchair Empire is generally targeted to an adult audience, we welcome the visitation and participation of young users, with their parents' consent. It is strongly recommended that users under the age of 13 refrain from disclosing any personal and/or private information either through the user registration system, or through participation in questionnaires and surveys, and instead opt to remain anonymous in their participation of site activities.

Please note that as of April 21st, 2000, the Child Online Protection Act of 1998 prohibits The Armchair Empire from the collection of private information from users under the age of 13 without parental consent. Users under the age of 13 must provide a signed letter from their parents to indicate that they are aware of their child's activities on The Armchair Empire and consent to these activities. This letter must be mailed to  The Armchair Empire using the contact information below, before they can participate in activities requesting the disclosure of private information.

Parents of our younger users may at any time, revoke their consent, and may request to review and edit the private information disclosed by sending a written request to The Armchair Empire via mail.

Though The Armchair Empire will take reasonable measures to ensure that users under the age of 13 do not disclose their private information without first obtaining parental consent, the site cannot guarantee the protection of young users who choose not to disclose their age and who do not follow the requirements set forth by COPA.
