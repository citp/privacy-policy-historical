                  <p><strong>NOTICE: Information We Collect and How We Use It</strong><br>Armstrong collects two types of information about you when you visit our site: personal information (including, by way of
                     example only, your name, address, telephone number and e-mail address) and non-personal, aggregate information (such as information
                     regarding the pages on our site that you have visited and your IP address).
                  </p>
                  <p><strong>1. Personally-Identifiable Information - What We Collect</strong></p>
                  <p>The only personally-identifying information we collect and store about you is the information that you choose to provide to
                     us.
                  </p>
                  <p><strong>Your Personal Portfolio</strong></p>
                  <p>The Armstrong portfolio is an easy way to keep track of the Armstrong products you like. Visitors can establish a portfolio
                     by submitting their name (required), physical and e-mail addresses and telephone number (optional), and by choosing a password
                     (required). To access the portfolio, visitors will be required to enter their username (a combination of their first and last
                     names) and password.
                  </p>
                  <p><strong>Electronic Mail</strong></p>
                  <p>We will also gather your personally-identifiable information when you send us an e-mail. We will use this information to respond
                     to your e-mail. We may also use the information to send you notifications about our service.
                  </p>
                  <p><strong>Sweepstakes and Contests</strong></p>
                  <p>From time to time, we may request information from you in connection with sweepstakes and contests we offer on our Web site.
                     Participation in these sweepstakes or contests is completely voluntary; you have a choice whether or not to disclose this
                     information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information
                     (such as zip code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes.
                  </p>
                  <p>Armstrong may co-sponsor sweepstakes and contests with other companies, in which case the user’s individual contact and demographic
                     information is likely to be shared with these companies. We will request that these companies maintain the privacy of the
                     registrants’ information.
                  </p>
                  <p>Nevertheless, please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our
                     users to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that they visit. This privacy statement applies solely to
                     information collected when you visit our Web site.
                  </p>
                  <p><strong>Business Partners / Professional Visitors</strong></p>
                  <p>Business partners and professional visitors requesting access to specialized content areas of this Web site may be required
                     to provide identifying information. In addition, business partners and professional visitors may be required to submit their
                     Federal Express or UPS account numbers when placing an order on this Web site.
                  </p>
                  <p><strong>2. Sharing Your Information</strong></p>
                  <p>We may share your personally-identifiable information with companies within the Armstrong family of companies.</p>
                  <p>We use outside shipping companies to ship all commercial orders, as well as all overnight shipments for consumer orders. If
                     you order from us, we will share your personally-identifiable information with these companies to fulfill your order. We will
                     also share our commercial customers’ Federal Express and UPS account numbers with these companies in order to fulfill commercial
                     orders.
                  </p>
                  <p>An outside company responds to consumer and commercial requests for additional information about our products. We will share
                     your personally-identifiable information with any such company in order to respond to your request.
                  </p>
                  <p><strong>3. Non Personally-Identifiable Information: What We Collect</strong></p>
                  <p>We collect and use non-personally identifiable information about you in the following ways:</p>
                  <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
                  <p>At certain points in your visit to the Armstrong site, our server may send a "cookie" file to your computer. Your Web browser
                     may prompt you to accept this file unless you have set your browser preferences to accept all cookies automatically. Cookies
                     are employed primarily as a service to our customers, to extend the relevance and responsiveness of the Armstrong site. We
                     may link cookie information with any personally-identifiable information you provide us.
                  </p>
                  <p><strong>Other Non-Personally-Identifiable Information</strong></p>
                  <p>The Armstrong Web site may collect non-personally identifiable information during your visit, such as type of browser, operating
                     system, domain name, or IP address. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're
                     surfing the Web. Web servers -- the big computers that "serve" up Web pages -- automatically identify your computer by its
                     IP address. When you visit pages on Armstrong's Web site our servers log your IP address. We do not link IP addresses to any
                     personally identifiable information. This means that your session will be logged, but you remain anonymous to us. IP address
                     information is used only to improve the service of the Armstrong site, and is then discarded at the end of each session on
                     our site.
                  </p>
                  <p>Armstrong also collects information through "referrers" and various environmental variables. A "referrer" is information the
                     Web browser passes along to Armstrong’s Web server that references the URL from which you came. "Environmental variables"
                     include, among other things, the domain from which you access the Internet, the time you accessed our Web site, type of Web
                     browser and operating system or platform used, the Internet address of the Web site you left to visit Armstrong, the names
                     of the pages you visit while at our Web site, and the Internet address of the Web site you then visit. We collect all of this
                     information to allow us to detect broad demographic trends, to provide information tailored to your interests and to enhance
                     your experience on Armstrong’s Web site. Armstrong may store "referrer" information for a limited period of time prior to
                     deleting this information.
                  </p>
                  <p>At times, the Armstrong website may use what are commonly referred to as "pixel tags," "web beacons," or "clear GIFs," including
                     other similar methods (collectively, "Pixel Tags") to collect aggregated information about website usage. Pixel Tags allow
                     Armstrong to measure the amount of users who have visited specific pages on our site and help determine the effectiveness
                     of advertising campaigns. The information collected from Pixel Tags contains no personally identifiable information and is
                     used for statistical analysis only.
                  </p>
                  <p>In certain situations, the use of Pixel Tags may be controlled by unaffiliated entities in order to manage programs or promotions.
                     Armstrong cannot be responsible for third-party uses of Pixel Tags, however, when we are able; we employ our best efforts
                     to assure that these unaffiliated entities do not collect personally identifiable information.
                  </p>
                  <p><strong>Profiling</strong></p>
                  <p>To help us improve our Web site and to ensure that we make every effort to provide you with information and offers that are
                     of interest to you, we may merge your personally-identifiable information with click-stream data and other data we have (including
                     cookies and offline data). We will provide notice of this, as well as an opportunity to opt-out of it, at the time and place
                     of information collection and before data is entered on our system.
                  </p>
                  <p>We may also develop a non-identifiable profile on you based on the pages within our site that you visit.</p>

                  <p>This Web site may contain links to other sites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such

                     statement applies solely to information collected when you visit our Web site.
                  </p>
                  <p><strong>Notification of Changes</strong></p>
                  <p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Homepage so you will always be aware of what
                     information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it. We will use information in accordance
                     with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
                  </p>
