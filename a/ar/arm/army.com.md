# Army.com - Privacy Policy

Activv recognizes the importance of maintaining your privacy. We value your privacy and appreciate your trust in us. 

**Information Collected:**

All data is processed and stored in Huntsville, Alabama, USA. 

The information that we collect from you helps us to continually personalize and improve upon your Activv shopping experience. You have the option not to provide certain information, however, withholding information may prevent you from being able to view content or make purchases. 

This section of our privacy policy applies to all information collected by or submitted to Activv. 

When you visit our site, we collect some data about you including your IP address. Your IP address is used for Activv internal use only and helps us diagnose problems with our server and administer our web site. We also automatically track certain information about your activities on our web site. We use this information to do internal research on your interests and to help us better understand and serve you. This information may include click stream data and what browser you are using. 

**Use of Information:**

To carry out certain business functions, such as order fulfillment or e-mail delivery, we sometimes hire other companies to perform these functions on our behalf. These companies have access to the information needed to perform their functions, but are required to keep it secure and confidential and not use it for any other purpose than completing their contractual requirements to Activv. 

Any billing information you submit is used in billing for the specific transaction in which the information was submitted unless otherwise disclosed. Billing information is stored for a time on our secure servers to allow the processing of refunds or to respond to customer inquiries. 

When you sign up for an account or volunteer information to Activv, we require your name and an alternate e-mail address. Your e-mail address allows us to contact you with confirmation of your account opening, order confirmations and updates and with your permission, for internal marketing purposes. When placing an order or setting up an account, Activv may also request your shipping address, telephone number, or other demographic information. This information may be combined with other personally identifiable information (such as demographic information and past purchase history) available from our records and other sources. This information will be used to make our future marketing efforts more efficient. With your permission, it may also be used by our marketing partners to bring you offers of interest. 

Activv may use aggregate, non-personally identifying information for purposes that we deem necessary. For instance, we will use this non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our web site and to share with advertisers for marketing and promotional purposes. However, in these instances we do not disclose anything that could be used to identify you. We do not use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described herein without providing you an opportunity to opt-out of such operations. 

It is possible that in the future Activv or its assets may be acquired by another company. It is also possible that Activv may partner with or purchase another company to continue to do business as a combined entity. In the event that this occurs, it is possible that our customer information may be transferred to the new business entity as one of Activv’s assets. 

While extremely rare, it is our policy to cooperate with law enforcement or other official investigations if we receive an official request for information pertaining to an on-going investigation. 

You may request deletion of your Activv account by contacting Customer Service at customerservice@activv.com. Please note that some information may possibly remain in our archived records after your account has been deleted. 

You may also request to be removed from our mailing lists by writing to: 

Activv, LLC   
228 Holmes Avenue  
Suite 221  
Huntsville, Alabama 35801  
USA
