# Privacy Statement

The British Army website does not store or capture personal information, the only exception  Recruiting Group whose pages are covered by a separate Privacy Statement found at the bottom of their pages, but merely logs the user’s IP address which is automatically recognised by the web server. Our log files do not contain any personal information or information about which other sites you have visited.  
We do not use cookies for collecting user information from the site and we will not collect any information about you except that required for system administration of the web server.   
Other websites linked from this site do not necessarily follow the same policies and therefore we cannot be responsible for the content of these external sites.

### Glossary

  * **_Cookie_**



Message given to a browser program by a web server. The message is then stored by the browser in a text file. Each time the browser requests a page from the server, this message is sent back. A cookie's main objective is to identify users and personalise their visit by customising web pages for them for example by welcoming them by name next time they visit the same site. A site using cookies will usually invite you to provide personal information such as your name, e-mail address and interests. In our case, however, we do not use cookies at all.

  * **_IP address_**



Every machine connecting to the Internet has a four-number address (e.g. 146.9.80.88) which may or may not stay constant between sessions online. Many web users connect indirectly to the Internet via an intermediary (proxy) server

  * **_Log files_**



Every time our web site is accessed an entry is made in the web server's log file. This tells us broadly where an access is coming from, when it was made, which file was requested and whether the request was successful or not. It usually does **not** allow us to identify individual users. The data is used to assess usage levels and spot technical problems (such as broken pages or web server errors).

  * **_Web server_**

The machine which on which the MOD website is physically located, which delivers (serves up) web pages to your computer.
