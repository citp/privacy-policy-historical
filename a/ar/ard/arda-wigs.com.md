# Return & Privacy Policies – Arda Wigs USA

## **Return Policy For Wigs And Wig Related Items**

Wigs and wig accessories can be returned for store credit if the customer has **not** **worn, tried on, or styled** any of the products purchased. Please contact us via e-mail (orders@arda-wigs.com) within five business days of receiving the item(s). If the customer has altered or worn any wigs or accessories purchased, does not inform us of their return request within five days, or does not have the appropriate packaging in its original condition, the eligibility for return is voided. In order to assure our customers quality, we inspect every return purchase upon receiving them at our offices before approving the item for return. We will not grant any store credit if the item is returned without its bag, netting, or filling (tissue). We will not grant any store credit if the item is damaged or has been worn. To be eligible for store credit, **the item must be in its original condition, including the packaging (tissue, netting, plastic bag)**. Please be honest with your returns. If you’ve put it on your head, do not send it back. Believe it or not, we can tell. :)

Full refunds will only be given in the event of a defective product. If a mistake was made on the part of our shipping department (i.e. you order one item, and we send you the incorrect item), we will happily ship you the correct item immediately. We will also send you a return label free of charge so you can ship us back the mistake item.

## **Return Policy For Makeup Items**

ALL SALES OF MAKEUP AND MAKEUP RELATED ITEMS ARE FINAL. **NO RETURNS OR EXCHANGES**. If you receive an item you believe is defective please contact us at orders@arda-wigs.com. Please be sure to include detailed information of your order. This includes first and last name, order number, and a detailed message regarding the items you believe to be defective. An Arda team member will respond to you within 3 business days.

**Please add  orders@arda-wigs.com to your contacts or whitelist in your email account so that your spam filter doesn’t put our response in your Junk folder.**
