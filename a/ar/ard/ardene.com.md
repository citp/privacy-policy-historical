We may contract with third-party service providers to assist us in operating our Site, conducting our business, better understanding our Site visitors or otherwise provide services to Site visitors, including performing such functions as fulfilling orders, delivering packages, processing credit card payments or providing customer service. These third-party service providers are not permitted to use the Personal Information except for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.

When we use third-party service providers, contractual provisions and other safeguards are used to ensure compliance by such third-party service providers with this Privacy Policy and all applicable privacy laws. Contractual provisions and other safeguards are also used to ensure that, where your Personal Information is transferred, processed or stored outside Canada, it is given protection similar to the protection set forth in this Privacy Policy.

Ardene protects Personal Information by implementing a variety of security safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of the information, including through the use of the following measures: physical security measures, such as appropriate disposal of Personal Information; electronic security measures, such as password protection and firewalls; and organizational processes such as limiting access to Personal Information to a selected group of persons on a “need to know” basis. ** **

No transmission of data over the internet is guaranteed to be completely secure. It may be possible for third parties to intercept or access transmissions or private communications unlawfully.
