b) Information Collected from Children: The Lottery does not specifically request information from children and any person younger than the age 21 is not permitted to use the Website under the Website’s [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/web/20180511061052id_/http%3A//www.arizonalottery.com/en/~/link.aspx?_id=DF58EE47FD7E4DF4A810DEC600CE5546&_z=z). However, the Lottery would comply with the Children's Online Privacy Policy Protection Act of 1998 ("COPPA"), requiring parental consent before we knowingly collected any personal information from an individual younger than the age of 13.

However, if personal information exists on the Website and is requested by a third party, it may be protected under applicable law from release or disclosure.
