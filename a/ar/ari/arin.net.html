			<p><strong>Effective Date: 18 March  2003</strong>            </p>
			<p>The American Registry for Internet Numbers places
        a high value on the privacy of our members and other visitors to our
        site. Because we value your privacy so highly we have developed this
        Privacy Statement to inform you about our privacy practices for the entire
      ARIN website.</p>
      <h2>What
            Information Do We Collect?</h2>
      <blockquote>
        <h3>Personal
        Information</h3>
        <p>ARIN
            does not collect any personal information from you unless you personally,
            explicitly, and intentionally provide it to us.</p>
        <p>As
            is standard practice for most websites, certain visitor characteristics
            are reflected in our web server logs (e.g. operating system, browser
            version, and Internet Protocol (IP) address). We make no attempt
            to link them with the individual visitors to the site.</p>
        <p>On
            its website, ARIN requires some visitors to provide certain personally
            identifiable information for purposes such as becoming a member,
            renewing membership, handling template requests, participating in
            discussion groups,
            submitting inquiries and comments, or registering for conferences.
            This information may include name, postal address, e-mail address,
            and other
            pertinent data.</p>
        <p>Questions
            about this privacy statement should be directed to <a href="mailto:webmaster@arin.net?Subject=Privacy%20Statement">webmaster@arin.net</a>.
            Please
            specify "Privacy Statement" in the subject line of your
          e-mail. You will receive a response within three business days of your
          inquiry.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <h2>What
            We Do With That Information</h2>
      <blockquote>
        <p>With
            regard to non-personally identifiable information, we may periodically
            analyze our website logs to assess aggregate usage trends in order
            to better serve the needs of visitors to the site. Under some circumstances
            this information may be used for purposes of systems administration
            or
            server troubleshooting and security. The website logs are archived
            in their entirety and kept purely as an internal reference.</p>
        <p>We
            do not sell, rent, or share any personally identifiable information
            voluntarily supplied by visitors or our membership mailing list.</p>
        <p>Membership information is collected and maintained solely in order to
            provide our members with access to specific benefits accorded to them
            through membership in ARIN. Any further e-mail addresses, phone numbers,
            or other contact information submitted by visitors voluntarily in the
            course of inquiries and comments are used only for purposes of taking
            action in relation to the nature of the inquiry or comment.</p>
        <p>In
            addition, ARIN's WHOIS program provides information on IP addresses,
            Autonomous System numbers (ASNs), and related objects including name
            servers and Points of Contact (POC). The Point of Contact information
            is stripped when ARIN provides organizations a bulk copy of the WHOIS
            output, and ARIN requires the requester of Bulk WHOIS data to affirm
            that they will only use the data for Internet operational or technical
            research purposes.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <h2>Use
            of Cookies</h2>
      <blockquote>
        <p>"Cookies" are
              pieces of information that a browser can record after visiting
            a website. We currently do not use cookies on our site, but may do
            so in the future.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <h2>Membership
            Database</h2>
      <blockquote>
        <p>ARIN
            members may receive periodic e-mail or postal mailings from us with
            information about ARIN, upcoming events, or issues related to ARIN
            and RIR policy. In addition, our website lists our member organization's
            names and a link to their websites (if the URL is provided by the
            member).</p>
      </blockquote>
      <h2>Security</h2>
      <blockquote>
        <p>While
            no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100
            percent secure, we take measures designed to protect the security
            of data transmitted to us upon receipt. Our databases, including
            the
            member database and system administration logs, are restricted only
            to authorized users. Online transactions of a sensitive nature, e.g.
            credit card numbers, are protected by secure browser connections.</p>
        <p>Our site supports use of secure socket layer (SSL) encryption technology
            to encrypt your personally identifiable information prior to transmission
            over the Internet. Users whose browsers do not support SSL encryption
            are encouraged to contact us by phone or in writing.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <h2>Links</h2>
      <blockquote>
        <p>This
            website contains links to other sites. Please be aware that ARIN
            cannot be responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.
            We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to
            read
            the privacy statements of those sites that collect personally identifiable
            information. This privacy statement pertains only to this website.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <h2>Discussion
            Groups</h2>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Please
            note that this privacy statement does not apply to any posting by
            you in any of the ARIN discussion groups, discussion threads, or
            interactive
            areas of this website. Your participation in those discussion areas
            and anything you post in those areas may be attributed to you and
            displayed, republished, and otherwise disseminated by ARIN, in accordance
            with the
            Acceptable Use Policy you agree to abide by in order to participate
            in those areas.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <h2>Compliance
            and Questions</h2>
      <blockquote>
        <p>If
                you have any questions regarding our privacy policy or you feel that
                this site
              is not following
              its stated information policy, please contact
            the ARIN Member Services Department by e-mail to <a href="mailto:info@arin.net?Subject=Member%20Privacy">info@arin.net</a>.

            the accuracy of personally identifiable information associated with your
            ARIN membership, or wish to correct what we have collected from you.
            Contact information for where to send changes regarding your information
            in the ARIN WHOIS database can also be found on the "<a href="about_us/contact_us.html">Contact

      <h2>Consent
            and Changes to This Privacy Statement</h2>
      <blockquote>

              to the above provisions, by using our site, you consent to the collection
              and use of information by us in accordance with this privacy
