We collect Personal Information that you provide voluntarily to us.  Some examples of Personal Information that we may collect include your name, date of birth, postal address, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number, gender, gaming activity, and purchase and reservation information. If you visit MGM Resorts, Personal Information may include your image in a live video feed that can be viewed on the MGM Web Sites.  Some Personal Information is considered "Confidential Personal Information".  Confidential Personal Information is your name in combination with one or more of the following: credit or debit card number, financial account number, driver’s license number, state identification card number, Social Security number, passport number, and naturalization number.

In addition to Personal Information that you provide voluntarily to us, we may obtain Personal Information from third parties including, but not limited to, business partners, family members, friends, and entities that direct you to or are located at MGM Web Sites or MGM Resorts.  In situations where your Personal Information is collected by third parties under contract with us for fulfillment and other purposes, we require such third parties to exercise reasonable care to protect your Personal Information and restrict the use of your Personal Information to the purposes for which it was provided.

#### B. Non-Personal Information

"Non-Personal Information" is information about you or your activities through which you cannot be personally identified.  When you use the Internet, your web browser or software may transmit certain information to the servers that host the web sites you visit.  Such information may include, for example, the unique number assigned to your server or Internet connection, your geographic location, and your interactions with the MGM Web Sites, including what pages you look at and what information you download. When you visit the MGM Web Sites, our servers and servers operated by third-party advertising companies collect Non-Personal Information.  In situations where it is possible to do so, Non-Personal Information may be linked to Personal Information.

#### C. Cookies and Information Collected by Advertising Companies

When you visit MGM Web Sites, we use “cookies” and similar technologies to help us recognize and serve you better.  Cookies are small files that contain information sent by a web site that is saved on your computer’s hard drive.  Cookies enable us to gather data such as web pages visited, links clicked, and material download. Cookies also are used to put a unique identifier on your computer.  This helps us to generate statistics regarding usage of MGM Web Sites, such as the percentage of repeat visitors.  In situations where it is possible to do so, this unique identifier may be linked to Personal Information.

There are different types of cookies including “browser” cookies (also known as html cookies) and Flash cookies (also known as Local Shared Objects).  You can configure your browser to reject browser cookies or to notify you when browser cookies are offered so that you can accept or reject such cookies.  However, if you reject browser cookies, you may not be able to conduct some transactions or use some services on MGM Web Sites.  However, blocking or deleting browser cookies may not block or delete other types of cookies including Flash cookies.  For information on blocking or deleting Flash cookies, click here.

Third-party advertising companies that work with us may also use cookies and similar technologies to collect Non-Personal information at the MGM Web Sites and other web sites for a variety of purposes including providing you with advertisements that are likely to be of interest to you.  This type of ad customization is sometimes referred to as “behavioral advertising.”  For more details about cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies that may be used by third-party advertising companies, click here.  If you would like more information about your choices concerning behavioral advertising, including how you may opt-out of some uses of information collected by members of the Network Advertising Initiative that may collect Non-Personal Information at the MGM Web Sites, click here.
