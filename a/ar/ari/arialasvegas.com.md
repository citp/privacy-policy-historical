California law requires certain businesses to respond to requests from California residents asking about the disclosure of Personal Information to third parties for third party marketing purposes. Alternately, such businesses may adopt a policy of not disclosing Personal Information to third parties for marketing purposes if a California resident has opted-out of such information sharing.

We have an opt-out policy in place. If you wish to opt-out of our sharing your Personal Information with third parties for marketing purposes, please follow the “How to Opt-Out” instructions in Section 4(B), above.

6\. SECURITY

Information maintained in electronic form that is collected by MGM Resorts International and any individual MGM Resort is stored on systems protected by industry standard security measures. These security measures are intended to protect these systems from unauthorized access. No security system is impenetrable and these systems could become accessible in the event of a security breach. We have controls in place that are designed to detect potential data breaches, contain and minimize the loss of data, and conduct forensic investigations of a breach.

Our staff is required to take reasonable measures to ensure that unauthorized persons cannot view or access your Personal Information. Employees who violate our privacy policies are subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.

We cannot enforce or control the security of the computers, electronic devices, or electronic communication method(s) you may use to send e-mails and submit information to us. You are responsible for the security of the computers, electronic devices, and electronic communication methods you use to communicate with us. We are not responsible for the disclosure or interception of information you send us before we receive it.

As a standard security practice, we take reasonable steps which are generally recognized in the industry to ensure that the communication methods used to support MGM Online Services do not permit connections or communication by methods that have known security weaknesses or vulnerabilities. As such, if you experience trouble using an MGM website, it may be an indication that you need to upgrade your software to a newer version that supports more secure communication methods.

In situations where your Personal Information is collected by third parties under contract with us for performance of their contractual duties and other purposes, we require such third parties to exercise reasonable care to protect that information and restrict the use of your Personal Information to the purposes for which it was provided.

7\. OTHER WEB SITES

We are not responsible for the information collection or privacy practices of other websites, including websites operated by our business partners or other third parties, including websites that might be co-branded with our name.

You should review and understand the privacy policies posted on any linked sites you visit before using those sites or providing any Personal Information through them.

8\. PERSONS UNDER AGES 13 AND 21

Certain of our areas and activities are intended for persons 21 or older. If you are under 21, you may not access or attempt to access any areas or participate in any activities that are restricted to persons 21 or older. We do not knowingly collect or allow the collection of Personal Information from persons under 13.

If you are the parent or guardian of a person under 13 and believe that the person has provided us with Personal Information, you may contact us at [privacy@mgmresorts.com](mailto:privacy@mgmresorts.com)and request that it be removed from our active marketing database.
