We’ve structured our Web site so that you can visit ARIIX on the Web without identifying yourself or revealing any personal information. Once you choose to provide us personally identifiable information (any information by which you can be identified), you can be assured that it will only be used to support your customer relationship with ARIIX or your business relationship as an ARIIX Representative (“Representative”).

1\. AWARENESS.  
ARIIX provides this Privacy & Data Protection Policy (this “Policy”) to provide transparency into our practices, ensure fairness and accountability in our data processing and help you exercise your data privacy rights.

We will collect the domain name from which you log on, aggregate information on what pages you access or visit, user-specific information on what pages you access or visit and information volunteered by you (such as survey information and/or site registrations). We do not collect your E-mail address unless you contact us by E-mail or volunteer your E-mail address and other personal information.

Cookies cannot harm your computer and they do not contain any personally identifiable information. One of the primary purposes of cookies is to store your preferences and other information on your computer to save you time by eliminating the need to repeatedly enter the same information and to display your personalized content on your later visits to websites. Cookies also help us to improve our site and to deliver a better and more personalized service. Among other things, they enable us:
