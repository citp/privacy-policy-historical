# Privacy Policy

Arise (“Arise,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) values the privacy of the individuals who use our technology, websites, and related services (collectively, the “Arise Platform”). This privacy policy will help you understand what information we collect and use at Arise, and the choices you have associated with that information.

**_Information We Collect_**

**A. What We Collect**

**Device Information**. Arise receives information from your devices, including IP address, location, web browser type, mobile operating system version, phone carrier and manufacturer, application installations, device identifiers, mobile advertising identifiers, push notification tokens, and, if you register with your social media account (such as Facebook, Google or LinkedIn), your applicable social media identifier.

**Biometric Data**. Arise may collect, store, use, and derive biometric data from your submitted pictures, driver's license, or government-issued ID. Arise will use this data to confirm your identity from time to time.

**Service Data (including Session and Usage data)**. To help us understand how you use the Arise Platform and to help us improve it, we automatically receive information about your interactions with the Arise Platform, like the pages or other content you view, your actions within the Arise Platform, and the dates and times of your visits. When you use the Arise platform, we receive information generated through such use, either entered by you or others who use the platform with you (for example, schedules, attendee info, etc.), or from the Arise Platform itself (for example, duration of session, use of webcams, connection information, servicing information, etc.).  We may also collect usage and log data, including diagnostic data to help us support the services.

**Call, Email and Text Information**. We work with third-party partners to facilitate calls, emails and text messages to you. We may receive information about these communications including the date and time of the call, email or SMS message, and whether the call was answered or the message was received or opened. We will share your information with such partners to facilitate these communications and to help us provide services on the Arise Platform.

**Third Party Analytics**. We use third party technologies, such as Facebook Analytics and Google Analytics, to help us to understand how you use the website and Arise Platform and ways that we can improve your experience. These technologies may track things such as how long you spend on the site and the pages that you visit so we can continue to produce engaging content and improve the Arise platform and your experience. We also use social media buttons and plugins that allow you to connect with your social network in various ways, including Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn.  These sites may set cookies through our site which may be used to enhance your profile on their site or contribute to the data they hold for various purposes outlined in their respective privacy policies.

**Tracking Technologies**. Arise and our partners use cookies and similar tracking technologies to track user traffic patterns and hold certain registration information. Tracking technologies also used are beacons, tags and scripts to collect and track information and to improve and analyze our service.

**Information from Cookies and Similar Technologies**. Arise is continuously improving the Arise Platform through the use of various third-party web analytics tools, which help us understand how visitors use our websites, desktop tools, and mobile applications, what they like and dislike, and where they may have problems. We collect information through the use of “cookies”, tracking pixels, and similar technologies to understand how you navigate through the Arise Platform and interact with Arise advertisements, to learn what content is popular, and to save your preferences. Cookies are small text files that web servers place on your device; they are designed to store basic information and to help websites and apps recognize your browser. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie disappears after you close your browser.
