  <p><strong>Personal Data Accuracy   and Completeness</strong>: Arrow endeavors to maintain Personal Data accurately   and relies on its customers, suppliers, and other third persons who give Arrow   Personal Data, to ensure that the Personal Data they provide to us is complete   and accurate, and to notify us of updates and changes to Personal Data as   required from time to time.&nbsp; </p>
  <p><strong>Updating Personal   Data:&nbsp; If you would like to modify or delete the Personal Data held on your   profile, please see <a href="http://www.arrownac.com/aws/pg_UserProfile">My   Profile</a> or contact the <a href="mailto:onlinesales@arrow.com">Online Service   Center</a>&nbsp; for further assistance.&nbsp; </strong></p>
  <p><strong>Opting Out Of Email   Communications With Arrow</strong></p>
  <p>You can choose not to receive   emails from Arrow at any time by simply sending an email, including your name   and email address, to <a href="mailto:never@arrow.com">never@arrow.com</a> and   we'll remove you from all mailings.</p>
  <p>Arrow will treat all Personal   Data in our possession as confidential, and maintain internal procedures and   controls designed to prevent unauthorized or unlawful processing of data and   against accidental loss or, destruction of, or damage to, Personal Data.</p>
  <p><strong>Security</strong>:   Personal Data in Arrow’s custody or control is protected by appropriate   technology, policies and procedures designed to prevent unauthorized use,   access, disclosure, modification, copying or destruction and to maintain the   integrity, availability and privacy of Personal Data.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Arrow will only process   Personal Data fairly and lawfully and will not use Personal Data in Arrow’s&nbsp;   possession for purposes that are incompatible with the purposes for which Arrow   receives the Personal Data.</p>

  <p><strong>Online Ordering:&nbsp; If   you place an order online, we need to know your name, email address, mailing   address, credit card number, and the credit card's expiration date. We may also   ask you for certain credit history and tax information.&nbsp; This allows us to   process and fulfill your orders and keep you up-to-date on the status of your   order. </strong></p>
  <p><strong>Literature Requests,   Samples, Software Downloads:&nbsp; When you request literature, a free sample offer,   or a free software download, we may ask for your name, address, and email   address so we can fulfill your request.

  <p>Contests, Surveys, &amp; Online   Polls:&nbsp; Arrow occasionally conducts surveys, polls or hold contests on Arrow   sites. While these activities are voluntary, it often requires us to request   information from you if you choose to participate.&nbsp; The poll results are   gathered and displayed to other site users to show your peers' viewpoints on   topical information. The contest information will be used to administer the   contest and notify the contest winners, unless otherwise stated at the time of   entry. </p>
  <p>Emails, Including Special   Offers &amp; Site Updates: If you are registered with an Arrow site, Arrow will   occasionally send you emails about various products and services that we feel   may be of interest to you and/or about site features and changes that we feel   you'll want to know about.

    <li>The transfers are permitted under applicable law. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Personal information   transferred to another country may be subject to all the laws of that country,   including laws related to national security and anti-terrorism, which may permit   law enforcement or regulatory agencies to obtain access to information held by   private businesses.</p>
  <p>Arrow will deal fairly with   each person whose Personal Data is in Arrow’s custody or control.</p>
  <p><strong>Access</strong>: Upon   reasonable written request, Arrow will inform any person what Personal Data   Arrow has about him or her, the purposes for which it is processed, the   recipients or categories of recipients and whether any automatic processing   takes place.&nbsp; Arrow will take steps to correct or delete any inaccuracies in   Personal Data pointed out to us, either directly or through making available   self-service mechanisms.&nbsp; Arrow will endeavor to notify recipients of your   Personal Data of such changes where required.&nbsp; However, Arrow may limit access,   corrections, or deletions as permitted or required by applicable laws or   regulations.&nbsp; Arrow may establish reasonable rules for providing access to   Personal Data, including procedures and fees for responding to Access   Requests.</p>
  <p><strong>Enforcement</strong>:   Persons who have questions or believe their Personal Data is not handled in   accordance with this Privacy Policy should contact the Company’s privacy   official at Arrow Worldwide Compliance Services <a href="mailto:compliance@arrow.com">compliance@arrow.com</a>&nbsp; who will review the   issue in an effort to resolve the issue quickly and amicably.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
