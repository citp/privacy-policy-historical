6\. Google Analytics  
This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics uses "cookies," which are text files placed on your computer that enable an analysis of your use of the website. The information generated by the cookie about your use of this website is generally transmitted to and stored on a Google server in the United States. In case of activation of IP anonymization on this website, Google will, however, truncate your IP address beforehand within Member States of the European Union or other parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transmitted to a Google server in the United States and truncated there. On behalf of the operator of this website, Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity and providing the website operator with other services relating to website and Internet use. The IP address transmitted by your browser within the scope of Google Analytics will not be associated with any other data held by Google.

You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings in your browser; however, please note that if you do so, you may not be able to use the full functionality of this website.

7\. Google AdWords (Remarketing / Conversion Tracking)  
Our website uses Google AdWords. Google AdWords is an online advertising program from Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA ("Google").

We use the remarketing feature within the Google AdWords service. With the remarketing feature, we can present users of our website on other websites within the Google Display Network (on Google itself, so-called "Google Ads", or other sites) advertising based on their interests. Therefore, the interaction of the users on our website is analyzed, e.g. in which offers the user was interested in, in order to be able to display the targeted advertisements to the users even after visiting our website on other sites. Google stores a cookie in the browsers of users who visit specific Google services or Google Display Network sites. This cookie is used to record visits by these users. This browser is used to uniquely identify a web browser on a specific computer and not to identify a person, and personal data will not be stored.

We also use conversion tracking as part of the Google AdWords service. When you click on a Google-served ad, a conversion tracking cookie is placed on your computer device. These cookies lose their validity after 30 days, contain no personal data and thus do not serve for personal identification. The information that is collected using the conversion cookie is used to create conversion statistics for AdWords customers who have opted for conversion tracking.

You can prevent cookies from being saved by setting your browser software accordingly; however, we would point out that in this case you may not be able to fully utilize all the functions of this website.
