We believe that all personal and financial information specific to you that you provide to the Credit Union through any channel constitutes personal information. Protecting your privacy, along with your financial assets, is at the core of our business.

We may also access information about you, such as credit reports, when considering a request from you for additional services or when exercising our rights under the law or any agreement with you. 

**Keeping Information Accurate**  
Keeping your account information accurate and up to date is very important. We have established procedures so that your financial information is accurate, current and complete.

Arrowhead Central Credit Union owns a number of companies; Arrowhead Trust Incorporated, Arrowhead Financial Group Inc. and Credit Union Insurance Services. All of these companies are dedicated to working together to provide the products and services that you want. All of these companies meet the same stringent requirements to protect your privacy as the Credit Union. 

We may also share information from your applications with external sources, such as check printing and data processing companies. These companies might, for example, assist us in offering you certain products and services or help us mail statements. These companies act on our behalf and are required to keep the information that we provide to them confidential.

All vendors and service providers sign confidentiality agreements with Arrowhead Central Credit Union that prohibit them from using member information for any purpose other than that for which they have been contracted.

Information may be exchanged with credit bureaus and similar organizations, provided when legally required or permitted, or in connection with a fraud investigation.

If we receive a subpoena or similar legal process demanding release of any information about you, we will generally attempt to notify you (unless we believe we are prohibited from doing so.)
