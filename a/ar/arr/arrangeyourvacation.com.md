Privacy Policy 

Privacy Policy 

[ ArrangeYourVacation.com](http://arrangeyourvacation.com/) is serious about protecting the privacy of our owners and our renting visitors. We use information collected about you only to process and bill orders and to make our Web site a more useful and valuable service. We respect the privacy of those who visit or become advertisers. Our privacy policy is stated below, but please be aware that should you follow a link on our Web site to another Web site, you are no longer covered by this policy. It is a good idea to understand the privacy policy of any Web site before sharing personal information with it.

Your Information: What, How, and Why?

Property Owners/Advertisers and Vacation Planning Visitors

In order to process a request you may have, we need to know contact information that could include all or some of the following: your full name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, and, in the case of an advertising listing, a method of payment. Vacation Rentals will use this information to contact you from time to time with critical customer updates and information, or to send you information about new services or opportunities. You will be able to "unsubscribe" and not receive marketing information, but we must always be able to e-mail you critical information about your account and our mutual business relationship.

Your information is not shared with third parties, except: 1) in the case of special promotions by ArrangeYourVacation, or one of its partners, about which you"ve requested to be notified; 2) where a third party performs services on behalf of ArrangeYourVacation and has agreed to keep such information confidential (such as the processing of your credit card payment or the conduct of an online survey for example); and 3) the aggregate use of the information of multiple ArrangeYourVacation advertisers and visitors where individual personal information is not disclosed. ArrangeYourVacation shares Web site usage information about advertisers and visitors with a third-party tracking company for the purpose of reporting statistics. ArrangeYourVacation also uses your information to market its services and to gain feedback on potential new services.

Newsletters

As an advertiser or visitor to [ArrangeYourVacation.com](http://arrangeyourvacation.com/), you will receive either or both of our Owner or Traveler newsletters. You may cancel your subscription to these newsletters at any time.

Surveys 

Surveys are another method by which we gather information about our visitors. From time to time, we request owner or newsletter subscribers" input in order to evaluate potential features and services. The decision to answer a survey is completely yours. We use information gathered from surveys to improve our service.

Inquiries

Site visitors may send inquiries to our property owners/advertisers via clickable links on ArrangeYourVacation listings. If you choose to send an inquiry through these links, your personal information, including your e-mail address and any other information you supply, will be visible to the owner of the property you inquired about so that they might reply to you. Do not share information in the e-mail that you are not prepared to allow them to have, including, but not limited to, credit card and bank account information. These inquiries are sent to both the individual owner/advertiser you selected and retained by ArrangeYourVacation. The resulting inquiry is available for review only by the owner/advertiser to whom they were initially addressed and to ArrangeYourVacations customer service employees, who may be asked by advertisers for their past inquiry information. While the content of these inquiries is not shared with any other party, [ArrangeYourVacation.com](http://arrangeyourvacation.com/) may, from time to time, use third party e-mail servers to send and track receipt of the inquiry e-mails, and analyze the pattern of inquiry usage via these third party tracking systems.
