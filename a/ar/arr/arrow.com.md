If this information is to be shared with anyone other than Arrow, it will be stated at the time that you enter your request.
> 
> **Contests, Surveys, & Online Polls**  
>  We occasionally conduct surveys, polls or hold contests at arrow.com. While these items are voluntary, it often requires us to request information from you if you choose to participate. The information that we gather from surveys will be used to improve the use and service of our site. The poll results are gathered and displayed to other site users to show your peers' viewpoints on topical information. The survey data collected and the poll data are NOT tied to any particular individual person so your responses will not identify who you are in any way. The contest information will be used to administer the contest and notify the contest winners, unless otherwise stated at the time of entry.

> **Emails, Including Special Offers & Site Updates**  
>  We may send you emails occasionally about various products and services that we feel may be of interest to you and/or about site features and changes that we feel you'll want to know about.

Any information disclosed would be in the form of aggregate data that does not describe or identify any individual user.

> As a practice, Arrow will not disclose any of your personal information to outside parties unless this is specifically described to you in writing, such as in the rules of sweepstakes or other promotions.

> **_How Do We Remember You?_**
> 
> A cookie is an important way to help us remember you and to offer you information targeted to meet your preferences. This is the most efficient way to make the navigation on our site quick and easy - and tailored to the specific needs of our distinct customer groups.
> 
> When you come to our site, we use a few cookies as identifiers so we can provide you with a more personalized site experience. Not only do these identifiers help us to remember items placed in your shopping cart between visits, but they also help us retrieve and save your passwords - passwords that only you have access to. As a result, this allows you to enter your password less frequently during a session. You'll only be asked to provide your password when requesting sensitive data such as credit card numbers, account information, etc., or if you are accessing our site from another computer.
> 
> Additionally, several session cookies may be required, but after your site session has ended, these cookies will be deleted.
> 
> Most Web browsers are automatically set to accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent that if you want. You may still use our site without cookies, but with very limited options, which is why we recommend leaving your cookies turned on. If you disable your cookies, you'll be missing out on the unique and personalized buying experience that we offer at arrow.com.
> 
> You may prefer to set your browser to accept all cookies or to alert you every time a cookie is offered, and then decide whether to accept one or not.

> [View instructions to check or change how you accept cookies.](https://web.archive.org/no_cookie_instruction)
> 
> **_How We Protect Your Security_**
> 
> We take every precaution to make sure that your online experience with Arrow is a safe one. We're committed to making sure that your data is secure. That's why whenever you place orders or access any sensitive data, such as your account information, we use a secure server which encrypts all information that you input before it is sent to us. This secure server software (known as Secure Sockets Layer or SSL) is the industry standard for secure commerce transactions and all of your personal information (including credit card number, name and address) is encrypted to guard against it being read by any third party. To further ensure that your data is kept safe, that's why we've added the extra layer of protection with usernames and passwords. We make sure that when you're placing an order using an open line of credit, that you're required to enter your password and username as an extra precaution.

> **_How Do I Opt Out Of Email Communications With Arrow?_**

> **_How Do I Update Or Change My Information?_**
