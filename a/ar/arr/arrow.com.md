# Arrow: Privacy Policy

## Online Privacy Policy

#### Your Privacy Is Important To Us

Arrow Electronics, Inc., including its subsidiaries and affiliates worldwide, understands your concerns regarding privacy and is committed to protecting it. Arrow conforms to the highest ethical standards on the Internet. Any information that you give us about yourself or that we collect is always held with the utmost caution and security, and that information will only be used in the ways described below. 

Please read our privacy policy to fully understand how we collect data, how we use that data, and how you can correct any inaccuracies in your information. 

#### How Do We Use The Information That We Collect?

We use the information that we collect about you for the following:

  * To quickly and accurately process your orders, 
  * To provide a pleasant Web experience to meet your electronic component needs, and 
  * To help us to improve our site and your online ordering experience. 



#### What Information Do We Collect?

We collect information from our site users at different points on our Web site. 

##### Registration

If you decide to register with an Arrow site, we'll ask for your name, company, country, email, and job type. 

We use the information that you provide to us during registration to enhance your experience. This may include presenting promotional offers online or via email tailored to your previous purchases. We do this to try and make your experience with us more productive and efficient.

##### Online Ordering

If you place an order online, we need to know your name, email address, mailing address, credit card number, and the credit card's expiration date. This allows us to process and fulfill your orders and keep you up-to-date on the status of your order. 

**Literature Requests, Samples, Software Downloads**

When you request literature, a free sample offer, or a free software download, we may ask for your name, address, and email address so we can fulfill your request. In some cases, the collection of additional information may be required as part of the offer. If this information is to be shared with anyone other than Arrow, it will be stated at the time that you enter your request. 

**Contests, Surveys, & Online Polls**

We occasionally conduct surveys, polls or hold contests on Arrow sites. While these items are voluntary, it often requires us to request information from you if you choose to participate. The information that we gather from surveys will be used to improve the use and service of our site. The poll results are gathered and displayed to other site users to show your peers' viewpoints on topical information. The survey data collected and the poll data are NOT tied to any particular individual person so your responses will not identify who you are in any way. The contest information will be used to administer the contest and notify the contest winners, unless otherwise stated at the time of entry. 

**Emails, Including Special Offers & Site Updates**

If you are registered with an Arrow site, we will occasionally send you emails about various products and services that we feel may be of interest to you and/or about site features and changes that we feel you'll want to know about. You can choose not to receive email from us at any time (see opt out of emails below) and only Arrow (or agents working on behalf of Arrow and under confidentiality agreements) will send you these direct mailings. 

**Web Statistics**

We also monitor site traffic and usage patterns to better determine what we think you'd be interested in viewing. This also helps us to improve our Web site. We utilize a service for tracking called WebTrends On Demand. You should refer to the WebTrends On Demand Privacy Policy to learn how they collect and use information. You can find WebTrends On Demand Privacy Policy here:[http://ondemand.webtrends.com/privacypolicy.asp](https://ondemand.webtrends.com/privacypolicy.asp).

**Do We Share Your Data With Anyone?**

We will not share your information in ways not described in this policy statement, and we will not provide any other organization with your personal information. 

Arrow reserves the right to disclose to third parties information about registered usage of the Arrow Web site and any related services, including information gathered during your use of the site. Any information disclosed would be in the form of aggregate data that does not describe or identify any individual user. 

As a practice, Arrow will not disclose any of your personal information to outside parties unless this is specifically described to you in writing, such as in the rules of sweepstakes or other promotions.

Please note that Arrow's Web sites contain links to other sites as a service to our visitors. The registration information you provide will not be passed on to these sites when you link from Arrow. Arrow is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites; the privacy policy in this document is relevant for Arrow Web sites only. 

#### How We Protect Your Security

We take precautions to make sure that your online experience with Arrow is a safe one. We're committed to making sure that your data is secure. That's why whenever you place orders or access any sensitive data, such as your account information, we use a secure server which encrypts all information that you input before it is sent to us. This secure server software (known as Secure Sockets Layer or SSL) is the industry standard for secure commerce transactions and all of your personal information (including credit card number, name and address) is encrypted to guard against it being read by any third party. To further ensure that your data is kept safe, we've added the extra layer of protection with usernames and passwords. We make sure that when you're retrieving your personal information and/or placing an order, that you're required to enter your password and username as an extra precaution. 

#### How Do I Opt Out Of Email Communications With Arrow?

You can choose not to receive emails from us at any time by simply sending an email, including your name and email address, to [never@arrow.com](mailto:never@arrow.com) and we'll remove you from all mailings.

#### How Do I Update Or Change My Information?

If you would like to modify or delete your arrow.com profile, please see [My Profile](http://www.arrownac.com/aws/pg_UserProfile) or contact the [Online Service Center](mailto:onlinesales@arrow.com) for further assistance.
