</ul> 

<h2>The Way We Use Information:</h2>

We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties. 
We use non-identifying and aggregate information to track web traffic and better design our website.

<h2>Our Commitment To Data Security:</h2>

<h2>Our Commitment To Children's Privacy:</h2>  
<p>Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13. Furthermore there is nothing on our website that could be construed as obscene, inappropriate, or otherwise damaging to web users of any age.</p> 

<h2>Use of Cookies:</h2>  
<p>The Dealership may use a browser feature known as a "cookie" when clients access secure applications and dealer portals. Cookies are small files placed on your hard drive that assist us in providing you with a customized browsing experience. The Dealership uses cookies to provide you with the convenience of not having to reenter information, such as user IDs and passwords, multiple times during your visits to our Web sites. The "Help" section of the toolbar on most browsers will inform you on how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you upon the receipt of a new cookie, or how to disable the use of cookies completely. As our Web sites have been designed to take advantage of the use of cookies, should you configure your browser to decline their use, certain features of our Web sites may not function correctly and you may be required to renter any user IDs and passwords more frequently.</p> 


<h2>Public Forums and Blogs:</h2>  
<p>The Dealership may make blogs, forums, message boards, and/or news groups available to its users at various times. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information in these areas.</p> 

<h2>Credit Applications:</h2>  
<p>Arlington Toyota takes the secure handling of credit applications very seriously. The information provided is heavily secured by appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures. Arlington Toyota is in compliance with new federal laws mandating the secure handling of credit-related data that went into effect July 2010. 
Arlington Toyota guarantees the security of this data upon delivery to our client dealerships (â��Dealershipâ��). Upon delivery, responsibility for the security of data rests solely on the Dealership. 
Arlington Toyota Credit Applications are encrypted via SSL. The Privacy Policy is available through an obvious link on the Credit Application Submission Page.</p> 

<h2>Third Party Privacy Policies:</h2>  

<p>All links from Dealership sites to third-party vendors have had every reasonable effort made to ensure their legitimacy, relevancy, and functionality. These sites are subject to their respective Privacy Policy (Policies) and are not the responsibility of Arlington Toyota.</p>

<h2>Your Right to Opt Out:</h2>  
<p>If you prefer that we not disclose nonpublic personal information about you to nonaffiliated third parties, you may elect to opt-out of these disclosures (other than disclosures permitted by law). If you wish to exercise your opt-out option, you may do so by mailing in the attached form at the bottom of this notice.</p>

<h2>Information Security:</h2>  
<p>We restrict access to nonpublic personal information about you to those individuals who need to know that information to provide products or services to you. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to guard your nonpublic personal information.</p> 
	
<h2>Changes to the Policy:</h2>
