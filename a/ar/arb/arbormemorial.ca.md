**Our collection, use and disclosure of personal information**

In most cases, we will collect personal information directly from you when you purchase or interact with us about a product or service that we offer or provide (for example, when you email us or contact us through our website). Occasionally, we may collect personal information from a third party based on your consent or as otherwise permitted by law.

  * Informing you about our products and services, and the products and services of our affiliates and partners, except where you have opted out or unsubscribed from receiving such information;
  * Arranging or administering an annuity or insurance contract for you (e.g. with Assurant Life of Canada or National Assistance, Inc.);
  * Internal business purposes, such as responding to your questions and inquiries, and administering and improving our customer service, website and other services;
  * Establishing, managing or terminating your employment relationship (including certain agency or contracting relationships) with Arbor or as an applicant for employment with Arbor; and
