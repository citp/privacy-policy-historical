2.      _Collection and Use of Information._

We may collect Personally Identifiable Information about you (for example, your name, address, telephone number, credit card information, etc.) in order to communicate with you or provide you with products or services that you have requested. “ **Personally Identifiable Information** ” refers to information that you provide to Us through the Internet or otherwise that can be used to uniquely identify you.

Arbonne products are sold through our network of Independent Consultants except that online shopping is fulfilled and sold directly by Arbonne in connection with an Arbonne Independent Consultant. When you register your account online with Arbonne, you will receive an Arbonne identification number (Arbonne ID). Arbonne Independent Consultants, as well as Preferred Clients and Clients who wish to access account information online will also receive a PIN. Please keep your Arbonne ID and PIN secret. You are entirely responsible for any activity under your Arbonne ID. You must promptly notify Arbonne of any actual or attempted unauthorized use of your Arbonne ID.

From time to time, we may establish a business relationship with other businesses that we believe to be trustworthy and who have confirmed that their privacy practices are consistent with ours. We call these businesses our “Approved Partners.” We may also send you e-mail promotions and other information that may be of interest to you from Arbonne or from its Approved Partners.

**We will not sell, transfer or share any Personally Identifiable Information about you to any third parties outside of Arbonne and Arbonne Approved Partners who agree to honor these privacy safeguards, except under circumstances as may be required by law or to protect legal rights. Arbonne Approved Partners may include third party service providers and their independent contractors or affiliates providing products and services as authorized by Arbonne.**

We may collect, use and disclose information that is not Personally Identifiable Information (for example, We may keep track of, use or disclose aggregate statistics regarding the number of visitors to our Websites and other information that does not uniquely identify you). Typically, this data is gathered through the use of automated “cookies,” “Web beacons,” and other similar technologies.

Cookies is a small text file placed on your computer to identify your computer and Internet browser. Web beacons are a file placed on a website that monitors usage. The use of cookies and Web beacons is an industry standard and you will find most major websites use cookies and/or Web beacons. By showing how and when visitors use our Websites on an aggregate basis, cookies and/or Web beacons help Us better determine which areas of our Websites are popular or useful, and which areas are not. Many improvements and updates to our Websites are based on such data as total number of visitors and pages viewed. In addition, We may also solicit your feedback in online surveys that are optional.

We employ some vendors to perform functions on our behalf. Examples may include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, e-mail administrative functions, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. These vendors are under a strict contractual obligation to use confidential data only for those purposes for which they are hired.

We may share Personally Identifiable Information and other data with businesses controlling, controlled by, or under common control with Arbonne. If Arbonne is merged, acquired, or sold, or in the event of a transfer of some or all of our assets or equity, we may disclose or transfer Personally Identifiable Information and other data in connection with such transaction. You will have the opportunity to opt out of any such transfer if, in our discretion, the new entity plans to handle your information in a way that differs materially from this Privacy Policy.
