In such circumstances, we do not link aggregate user data with personally identifiable information.

**8\. Security  
**Aruba.com employs physical, administrative and technical safeguards to help protect the confidentiality and integrity of information collected by this Site and to reduce the risk of loss, misuse, unauthorized access disclosure or modification of such information. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Site, you can send email us at [registration@aruba.com](mailto:registration@aruba.com).  
If you choose to contact Aruba.com through the Site, you should be aware that any information transmitted electronically might not be secure. Aruba.com assumes no liability for the loss of any information that you transmit to us electronically. In communicating with you, we may send e-mail as unencrypted plain text because we are aware that most persons cannot readily process encrypted e-mail. This is done for your convenience, but with the security concern that, if misrouted or intercepted, it could be read more easily than encrypted e-mail.

If we make material changes to this Policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page. If any proposed change is unacceptable to you, you may request that we remove your personally identifiable information from our records, using the Profile page.
