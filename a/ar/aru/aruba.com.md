This Site collects two kinds of information regarding Users: (1) information that personally identifies you (such as your name, e-mail address, and mailing address); and (2) information that does not personally identify you (such as the number of users who log on to this Site on a daily basis). As a general policy, no personally identifiable information is automatically collected from your visit to this Site. However, in certain circumstances, such as when you register for the Site, you may be asked to provide us with some specific information about yourself in order to use certain features on this Site or to take advantage of certain opportunities that we may offer through this Site.

Your user name will be visible on all postings that you make on the Site. During registration, you are required to provide contact information (such as name and email address), as well as demographic information. We use this information to contact you about the services on our Site in which your demographic and interest information may suggest that you would find interesting or useful.

We may hold contests on our Site from time to time. If you decide to participate, we may request certain personally identifiable information from you.

In order to provide certain services to you, we may on occasion supplement the personal information you submitted to us with information from third party sources. For example, we may use an external service to verify your address and other information, in order to confirm that your user profile is accurate. In addition, we may purchase marketing data from third parties and add it to our existing user database, to better target our advertising and to provide pertinent offers in which we think you would be interested. To enrich our user profiles of individual customers, we tie this information to the personally identifiable information they have provided to us.

**3\. Information Sharing and Disclosure**

**3.1 Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)**

We share aggregated demographic information about our user base with our partners and advertisers. Aggregated information is information about more than one individual, where the identity of the individual is not known, and cannot be inferred from the information. Sharing this information permits our advertisers to know whether our Site will permit the advertisers to target their goods and services to a specific demographic (for example, to know whether there are any unmarried, over-40 year old scuba divers in our user base). In such circumstances, however, we do not link aggregate user data with personally identifiable information of a specific User. You may elect not to have yur information shared as aforesaid through our opt-out mechanism located at: <http://www.adsrvr.org/>. 

**3.2 Personally identifiable information**

We may share your personally identifiable information in the following ways: 

Agents. We may use an outside shipping company to fulfill orders, and a credit card or other payment processing company to bill you for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any other purposes, and are contractually bound to implement appropriate security measures to protect such personally identifiable information and to use the personal information only to perform the services for which they are hired.

**4\. Legal Disclaimer**

We reserve the right to disclose personally identifiable information without your consent and without notice to you as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Site. The legal process may require us to disclose or allow access to personal information such as your account, billing, payment and postings. We may also use or disclose personally identifiable information about you without your consent (a) to protect our other customers, employees, or property, (b) in emergency situations, (c) to enforce our rights in court or elsewhere, or directly with you, for violations of service terms, conditions or policies and/or (d) as otherwise required by law, for example, as part of a regulatory proceeding.

**5\. Choice/Opt-out**

You will be able to opt out of receiving communications from the Site, except for the Welcome/Confirmation email that is sent when you register for the Site. If you do not opt-out from receiving communications about our Site, we will continue sending them to you. 

You may change your preferences for receiving communications from us at the Profile page. Further, we will provide you the opportunity to ‘opt-out’ of having your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes, when we ask for this information. 

**5.1 Retention and storage**

We will retain your personally identifiable information in databases in accordance with our document management and retention policy and applicable laws. This period may extend beyond the end of your relationship with us, but it will be only as long as it is necessary for us to have sufficient information to respond to any issues that may arise later. We may also need to retain certain information to prevent fraudulent activity; to protect ourselves against liability, permit us to pursue available remedies or limit any damages that we may sustain; or if we believe in good faith that a law, regulation, rule or guideline requires it.

This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the Site, to track users’ movements around the Site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.

A cookie contains a unique identification number that identifies the visitor's browser, but not necessarily the visitor. We use cookies on this Site.

**5.7 Monitoring**

Aruba.com may from time to time monitor and review any information transmitted or received through the Site, or through telephone or email communications, for quality assurance and other purposes.

**7\. Security**

Aruba.com employs appropriate physical, administrative and technical safeguards to help protect the confidentiality and integrity of information collected by this Site and to reduce the risk of loss, misuse, unauthorized access disclosure or modification of such information. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. Be advised, however, that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Site, you can send email us at [registration@aruba.com](mailto:%20registration@aruba.com).

Aruba.com assumes no liability for the loss of any information that you transmit to us electronically. In communicating with you, we may send e-mail as unencrypted plain text because we are aware that most persons cannot readily process encrypted e-mail. This is done for your convenience, but with the security concern that, if misrouted or intercepted, it could be read more easily than encrypted e-mail.
