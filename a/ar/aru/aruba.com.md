This Privacy Policy (“ **Policy** ”) provides information on the personal data processing by the Aruba Tourism Authority (“ **A.T.A.** ”) (hereinafter individually and collectively referred to as: “ **A.T.A.** ”) **.**

Customer Support: [support@aruba.com](mailto:support@aruba.com)

This Policy applies to all personal data processed by A.T.A. and/or on behalf of A.T.A., which identify or may identify a natural person (“ **Personal Data** ”). These persons involved are hereinafter collectively referred to as data subjects (“ **Data Subjects** ”, “ **you** ” or “ **user** ”). 

A.T.A. reserves the right to review and/or alter the Policy periodically, in order to comply with (local and/or European) legislation, and for any other purpose deemed reasonably necessary by A.T.A. If A.T.A. decides to modify the privacy policy, A.T.A. will notify the Data Subjects by e-mail or via the homepage of the Website.

Policy changes will apply to the information collected from the date A.T.A. post the revised Policy on the Website, as well as to existing information held by A.T.A. If any proposed change is unacceptable to you, you may request that A.T.A. removes your Personal Data from the records, using the privacy control tools set out in this privacy policy or by contacting the Data Protection Officer at: dpo@aruba.com.

For inquiries about this Policy, please contact the Data Protection Officer at: [dpo@aruba.com](mailto:dpo@aruba.com).  

This Policy sets out the elements necessary for A.T.A.’s compliance with applicable privacy legislation, principles and practice, including but not limited to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (“ **Applicable Laws** ”). 

The Policy is an external policy, and is directed towards Data Subjects whose Personal Data are being processed by A.T.A. for the purpose of producing and delivering products and services. Such data is being collected through the following sources: (online) Embarkation and Disembarkation (ED) card,  newsletter sign up, My Aruba preferences, trade and consumer shows, marketing e-mails, Aruba Forum online, Short cut to Happiness, 360 map, Social Media, surveys, sales calls, webinars, travel agents, campaigns, sweepstakes, conference, A.T.A.- sponsored events, FAM trips, Free Wifi Airport, Free Wifi Nodes and media. This Policy applies to the processing of Personal Data, in which A.T.A. acts as the data controller or as a data processor within the meaning of the Applicable Laws. A.T.A. acts as a data controller when A.T.A. determines the purpose for and the means for the processing of Personal Data of Data Subjects within the purposes of this policy. A.T.A. acts as a data processor when A.T.A. process Personal Data on behalf of another controller. This is the case when Personal Data is being processed via the (online) ED card, in which IASA is the controller. 

For business purposes, Data Subjects may be asked to provide their Personal Data. If this is the case, A.T.A. and its partners shall be required to keep such information confidential. 

Personal Data mentioned herein and defined by A.T.A. refers to information of all kinds related to each Data Subject -- their name, address, email address, mobile phone number, and so on -- that are transmitted to A.T.A. by Data Subjects.

The categories of Personal Data that A.T.A. processes are: 

  * name; 
  * last name;
  * data of birth; 
  * address;
  * flight number; 
  * place and duration of stay on Aruba;
  * main purposes of visit; 
  * e-mail address; 
  * telephone number;
  * country;

  * responses from surveys;

A.T.A. also processes non-identifiable information. Non-identifiable information is information that (i) is aggregated where the information of a population is represented instead of single individuals, (ii) where the identity of the individual is not known, (iii) where the identity of the individual cannot be inferred from the obtained information unless it is linked with Personal Data, and (iv) where this information cannot be combined with other available (non-identifiable) information in a way that a natural personal can be singled out (e.g. because of an unique combination of information). A.T.A. shares non-identifiable (demographic) information about A.T.A.’s user base with partners (local and international), A.T.A. external reps/offices and A.T.A.’s agencies Sharing this information permits partners, external reps/office and agencies to target A.T.A.’s services to a specific demographic (for example, any unmarried, over-40-year-old scuba divers who would like to visit Aruba for a diving vacation).

## 3.1. Children and our underage policy

A.T.A. does not (knowingly) collect Personal Data from anyone under the age of 18. Registration is available to individuals below the age of 18 only with prior consent from a parent or legal guardian. In the event a person under the age of 18 years submits a question to A.T.A. on the website and identifies his or her age, A.T.A. may use the person’s e-mail address for the sole purpose of responding to the person’s question on a one-time-only basis. However, A.T.A. will not knowingly use the person’s e-mail address to re-contact the person and A.T.A. will delete the information from the records after responding to the question. If A.T.A. becomes aware that Personal Data is unknowingly collected from a person under the age of 18, A.T.A. will make reasonable efforts to delete such information from the records. 

The purposes of the processing of Personal Data by A.T.A. are:

  * we may use aggragated non indentifiable data collected to develop tourism policy and tourism strategic development;
  * we may use non indentifiable aggragated data collected to contribute to the economic policy of Aruba, as tourism is an important economic pillar;

## 4.1. Legal grounds

A.T.A. is obligated to process the Personal Data in accordance with these purposes and in compliance with the Applicable Laws. The data processed by A.T.A. is necessary for operating activities, for which the Data Subject has given its explicit consent, or for the purposes of a legitimate interest pursued by A.T.A. (see **Annex 1** ). The Data Subject has the right to withdraw a given consent at any time. The legitimate interests for which A.T.A. processes Personal Data are: national tourism policy, direct marketing, improving customer experience, offering newsletters, customer support, conducting research, promotional and cross-selling activities and identification. The IP addresses of Data Subjects recorded in the system may be used, in order to explore the cause of or solution to any problem arising in its servers, or to administer the Website. 

## 4.2. Retention period

A.T.A. will not use and store Personal Data longer than necessary to fulfil the abovementioned purposes, and shall remove the collected Personal Data after the necessary period to achieve the purposes described in this Policy has passed, or to comply with contractual obligations or as permitted or required by the Applicable Laws. In **Annex 1** you find the retention periods for Personal Data that A.T.A. processes and in **Annex 3** you find the retention periods for the cookies used by A.T.A.   

The Personal Data may only be processed to the extent necessary for the described purposes. Personal Data may in principle not be processed for other purposes other than that for which the Personal Data were collected. If there is a necessity or need to process Personal Data for other purposes, it shall be investigated by A.T.A. whether the purpose of the intended data processing is compatible with the original purpose. A.T.A. shall provide the Data Subject prior to that further processing with information on that other purpose.

A.T.A. handles Personal Data carefully and confidentially, and uses all suitable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your Personal Data.

A.T.A. follows generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to A.T.A., both during transmission and once A.T.A. receives it. Be advised, however, that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while A.T.A. strives to use all commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Data as much as possible, A.T.A. cannot guarantee its absolute security. 

If you choose to contact A.T.A. through Aruba.com, Arubaconventionbureau.com, Media.aruba.com, Arubainsight.com or the Aruba.com forum (collectively: “ **the Website** ”), you should be aware that any information transmitted electronically might not be secure. Apart from the legal obligations under the Applicable Laws, A.T.A. assumes no liability for the loss of any information that you transmit to A.T.A. electronically. In communicating with you, A.T.A. may send e-mail in an unencrypted form because A.T.A. is aware that most persons cannot readily process encrypted e-mail. This is done for your convenience, but with the security concern that, if misrouted or intercepted, it could be read more easily than encrypted e-mail.

Personal Data is being accessed or transferred by A.T.A. and other third parties such as service providers, agencies (hired by the A.T.A.), business partners, A.T.A. representatives, eCRM & Data base agency, website developer/ management agency, customer support agencies, social media, data analytics, companies that personalize the Website, digital registration tools (Customer support registration tool), Website analytics agency, companies that make customer service accessible via social media. These third parties are listed in **Annex 4** of this Policy. 

A.T.A. further discloses Personal Data in case such disclosure is mandatory under Applicable Laws or is reasonably judged to be essential in order to protect and safeguard the rights, property and safety of other parties, A.T.A. itself, and/or A.T.A.'s affiliates. In certain circumstances, it is possible that Personal Data may be subject to disclosure pursuant to judicial or other government subpoenas, warrants, or orders.

ATA may transfer Personal Data to a third country or international organisations outside of the European union/European Economic Area (“ **EU/EEA** ”), which shall take place only in compliance with the Applicable Laws, and where appropriate safeguards are in place that ensure the level of protection of Data Subjects as required by the Applicable Laws (e.g. transfers on the basis of an adequacy decision or standard EU Model clauses). 

With respect to storage, A.T.A. uses various applications for obtaining and storing certain data. To guarantee your privacy, these applications are subject to strict regulations. Most data and the Website is stored within the European Union. In respect of data that is forwarded to non-EU countries, A.T.A. only uses companies that provide sufficient protection in line with European legislation (e.g. a ‘Privacy Shield’ certification or signing the EU Model Clauses). For the purposes of forwarding data to other countries and parties, A.T.A. enters into Data Processing Agreements with EU Model Clauses attached. If you wish to see such a contract, feel free to contact: [dpo@aruba.com](mailto:dpo@aruba.com?subject=Aruba.com%2520-%2520DPA%2520/%2520SSC%2520Information%2520Request).

Data Subjects have the right of information, access, rectification, addition and erasure of Personal Data, and the right to object against or restrict the processing of Personal Data (or withdraw an earlier given consent), as well as the right to data portability. The procedure of A.T.A. that enable Data Subjects to exercise these rights, is described below.

Data Subjects may file a request for access with A.T.A., and A.T.A. shall respond as soon as possible, and in any event within one (1) month, about:

  1. whether A.T.A. holds any Personal Data relating to the respective Data Subject; and, 
  2. if so, information is provided on the purposes of the processing, the categories, the recipients (if applicable) the envisaged period for which the Personal Data will be stored, or the criteria used, the existence of the right to request rectification, erasure, restriction or to object to such processing, the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, the existence of automated decision-making, where the data is transferred to a third country, the appropriate safeguards and the source(s) of the Personal Data.



After a Data Subject has accessed the Personal Data, he/she may request A.T.A. to restrict, amend, add, erase and/or transport the Personal Data. A.T.A. informs the Data Subject within one (1) month after receiving the request whether the request shall be complied with (in time), and if not, accompanied with the reasons for the delay or rejection. Data Subjects can also change certain information on the Website from the online Aruba profile at any time. 

Information provided shall be free of charge. Data Subjects can exercise these rights at reasonable intervals. Data Subjects can exercise their rights by contacting the Data Protection Officer in writing (see address above) or per e-mail at: [dpo@aruba.com.](mailto:dpo@aruba.com.)
