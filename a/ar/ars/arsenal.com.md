We will never share your Information with our Partners for them to send marketing messages directly to you, however we may share this Information with them so that they can tell us how to market to you on their behalf in the most appropriate way and with the most relevant information.  In all cases, we will take care to ensure that these organisations only process your Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy, your preferences and the law.

If you no longer wish the Information you provide to us to be shared with our Partners in the manner described in this Privacy Policy, or you wish to update your marketing choices in other ways, please follow the procedure set out in Section 9.

As indicated in Section 2, we may also combine your Information with other information that we obtain from our dealings with you or which we receive from other organisations.

**6.  Use of your Information outside the European Union**

Some of the organisations (including, without limitation, our associated companies and Partners) to which we may disclose your Information are situated outside of the European Union. In order to provide you with the products and services you require, we may need to transfer your Information to these countries some of which do not have laws that protect privacy rights as extensively as in the United Kingdom. If we do transfer your Information to other territories, we will endeavour to ensure that your Information is properly protected.

We realise and understand that many children will visit the Websites, use the Apps, or interact with Arsenal via another route, but encourage all persons under 13 to consult with their parents or legal guardian before submitting any content or information to Arsenal. Parents or legal guardians should, in particular, supervise children when online and recommend that parental control tools be put in place. Although anyone known to be under the age of 13 may participate in competitions and promotions, notification of a win or prize will be sent directly to the parent or legal guardian identified in the initial registration process. Any publication of a competition winner’s personal details for visitors known to be under 18 will require parental or legal guardian consent during registration.
