For more information on the cookies and similar technologies that we use and their purpose, please see our Cookies Policy.

If you would like further details in respect of the information we collect and hold about you, please contact our Data Protection Officer whose details are set out below.  

When you engage in certain activities on the Websites or engage with ABL or Arsenal through another route, for example, by registering on the Websites or as an Arsenal member, purchasing goods and services or entering competitions, we may ask you to provide certain information about yourself by filling out and submitting a form. It is completely up to you whether you engage in these activities.  If you choose to engage in these activities, however, we may require you to provide us with Information.  In some instances, you may also be asked to provide a credit or debit card number. We may supplement the Information that you provide with other information that we obtain from our dealings with you or which we receive from other organisations, for example, our commercial partners.

**3.  Consent**

By using the Websites, or by engaging with ABL or Arsenal via another route, you indicate your consent to us collecting and using your Information (that you provide to us when interacting with ABL or Arsenal) in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy, unless you expressly state that such consent is not given. When you submit Information to us you understand and agree that we and our associated companies (as defined in bold below) may record, transfer, store, and process your Information in any of the countries in which we and our subsidiaries or affiliates maintain offices, including without limitation, the United Kingdom.  See also Use of your Information outside the European Union (Section 6 below).

If you do not agree to these terms, please do not use the Websites or the Apps, register or purchase goods and services on the Websites, enter competitions, or provide your Information to ABL or Arsenal via any other route.

**4.  Security **

We take the security of your Information seriously.

We have a committed security policy.  We implement a number of security measures to ensure the safety of any Information in our possession or control. The Information is contained on a secure server, which is accessible only by a limited number of employees who have limited access rights to such information.

When you submit your credit card details, we use industry standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology to guard your Information. In addition, we have security procedures in place to protect our customer database from loss and misuse, and only allow access to it when absolutely necessary, and then under strict guidelines as to what use may be made of the Information contained within it.

**5.  How Will We Use Your Information?**

We collect your Information to record and support your participation in the activities you select. 

We may use Information:

  * as part of our effort to keep you informed via mail, email, phone or fax about special offers, and other products and services we offer;
  * for record keeping purposes;
  * to improve the quality of our service;
  * for market research;
  * to measure and improve activity on the Websites and Apps;
  * in connection with targeting/advertising activities; and
  * to understand your preferences so that we can improve the products or services we offer.



We may share and pass your Personal Information (including details of your purchasing preferences) with or to our holding companies, subsidiaries or associated companies in which we have an interest including, without limitation, any of our joint venture organisations (together, our “ **associated companies** ”).

When you submit Personal Information to Arsenal Jobs ([www.arsenal.team.careers](http://www.arsenal.team.careers/)), this will be used solely in connection with your registration to the site or your application for a particular role and will not be shared with third parties other than those engaged by us in connection with the recruitment process, such as recruitment consultants or agencies.

We may also pass your Information to other carefully selected partner organisations (“ **partners** ”) with whom we have a business relationship, such as:

  * our sponsors;
  * financial services partners; and
  * other organisations whose services we need to use to process and deliver your orders, for credit control and debt collection, to maintain our systems or to comply with legal obligations or a court order.



Each of our associated companies and these partners may keep you informed of services, products, events and special offers made available by that organisation. If you express an interest in an offer from one of Arsenal’s associated companies or partners, that associated company or partner may let us know. In all cases, we will take care to ensure that these organisations only process your Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy, your preferences and the law.

For a list of our associated companies or partners, please contact our Data Protection Officer whose contact details are listed below.

If you do not wish the Information you provide to us to be shared with other associated companies or such partners, please indicate this preference when you provide the Information to us.  Alternatively please contact our Data Protection Officer.

We may also create an individual profile for you so that we can inform you of services, products, events or special offers that may be of interest to you.  In the event of the sale of the business or the integration of the business with another party, we may disclose your details to advisers or prospective purchasers’ advisers.

We may also disclose your Personal Information to third parties if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, to enforce or apply our terms and conditions and other agreements, or to protect our rights or property or those of our customers or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

Your Information is password-protected to prevent unauthorised access to it. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone.

**6.  Use of your Information outside the European Union**

Some of the organisations (including, without limitation, our associated companies and partners) to which we may disclose your Information are situated outside of the European Union. In order to provide you with the products and services you require, we may need to transfer your Information to these countries some of which do not have laws that protect privacy rights as extensively as in the United Kingdom. If we do transfer your Information to other territories, we will endeavour to ensure that your Information is properly protected.

**7.  Policy for Children**

We realise and understand that many children will visit the Websites, use the Apps, or interact with ABL or Arsenal via another route, but encourage all persons under 13 to consult with their parents or legal guardian before submitting any content or information to ABL or Arsenal. Parents or legal guardians should, in particular, supervise children when online and recommend that parental control tools be put in place. Although anyone known to be under the age of 13 may participate in competitions and promotions, notification of a win or prize will be sent directly to the parent or legal guardian identified in the initial registration process. Any publication of a competition winner’s personal details for visitors known to be under 18 will require parental or legal guardian consent during registration.

**8.  Changes to this Privacy Policy**

We aim to meet high standards and our policies and procedures are, therefore, constantly under review. From time to time we may change our security and privacy policies. Accordingly we recommend that you check this page periodically, or request a copy of the current Privacy Policy from our Data Protection Officer, in order to keep up to date.

**9.  Updating and Correcting Information**

You may correct the Information we hold about you by changing your profile preferences online or by contacting the Data Protection Officer (see contact details below). Please include your name, address, and/or email address when you contact us. We would encourage you to update your Personal Information promptly if it changes.

**10.  Your Rights to Access Your Information**

You have the right to see details of the Information that we hold about you.  We may charge a small fee towards the cost of administering any request you make. The current fee is £10.00.

You may ask us to make any necessary changes to your Personal Information to ensure it is accurate and up-to-date.
