\------

**Personal data transfers outside of the EEA**  
The EEA includes all EU countries, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.  Some of the third parties that we share personal data with may need to transfer personal data outside of the EEA, for example to the United States of America.  Click here to see a list of the third parties we share personal data with.

Where your personal data is transferred to a country outside of the EEA and that country is not subject to an EU adequacy decision, we will ensure your data is protected by appropriate safeguards (for example, EU approved standard contractual clauses, a Privacy Shield certification, or a supplier’s Binding Corporate Rules).  A copy of the relevant safeguard can be provided for your review on request – click here to see how to contact us.

\------

**How long Arsenal retains personal data**  
We retain personal data about your membership for as long as your account remains active, and for a limited period of time afterwards (in case you decide to reactivate your membership or have queries about it).

We retain personal data relating to your purchases for several years from the date of the relevant transaction.  This is to understand your purchasing preferences and to meet our legal and contractual obligations.  If your purchase has enduring relevance (such as a Celebration Corner plaque) then we’ll keep relevant information for as long as we remain responsible to you for that purchase. 

Where you have asked us not to send you direct marketing, we keep a record of that fact to ensure we respect your request in future. 

We keep a record of call centre recordings for 27 months and CCTV security footage for 30 days, unless we need to hold this data for longer to resolve an issue or to meet a legal requirement.   

We also retain information with the potential to give rise to legal disputes for 7 years.  
 

\------

**Your rights to withdraw consent and to object (including to direct marketing)**  
Wherever we rely on your consent to process personal data, you always have a **right to withdraw** that consent.  Click here to see the situations where we rely on your consent.

You also have the **right to object** to any use of your personal data for direct marketing purposes, as well as to processing that we undertake based on our legitimate interests (including profiling).  Click here to see the situations where we process data for our legitimate interests.

  * for **access** to information about your personal data or for a copy of your personal data
  * to **correct** or **delete** your personal data
  * to **restrict** (i.e. stop any active) processing of your personal data
  * to provide you with certain personal data in a **structured, machine readable format** and to transmit that data to another organisation



These **rights may not always apply** , for example if fulfilling your request would reveal personal data about another person, or if you ask us to delete information which we are required by law to keep or have a compelling legitimate interest in keeping.  If this is the case then we’ll let you know when we respond to your request.
