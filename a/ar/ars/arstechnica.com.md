# Privacy Policy : Page 1

Wednesday, October 01, 2003

Ars Technica has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for the Ars Technica website, and the Ars Technica OpenForum.

We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is used to gather broad demographic information. Your IP address is not used to determine your actual identity for the purposes of advertising. We use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests and to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our site, but you can choose not to have your encrypted password stored in your cookie. 

Our OpenForum's registration form requires users to give us contact information (like their name and email address). Contact information is used to contact visitors when necessary. Users may opt-out of being able to receiving future bulk mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. However, registration for Ars Technica properties does require a valid e-mail at all times.

This site contains links to other sites. Ars Technica is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites.

Our registration process does ask visitors for demographic information, but it is not required. We reserve the right to use demographic and profile data to tailor our visitor's experience at our site, showing them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences. This information may be shared with advertisers only on an aggregate basis.

In the event that we run contests on our site, we may ask visitors for contact information (like their email address). The customer's contact information is used to contact the visitor when necessary. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below.

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our web site.  These companies may use information (not including your name, address email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.  No advertiser has any way to identify you, and why many use cookies to track ads that you've seen, this practice is merely to prevent users from being inundated with the same ads over and over (should an advertiser chose that).

Ars Technica has not directly engaged in advertising with any other third-parties at this time, however our third-party advertising agencies may and often do outsource portions of their advertising to parties not covered in this statement. It should be noted that at no time is even aggregate information provided directly from Ars Technica to such outsourced advertising agencies.

## Public Forums

This site makes forums and message boards available to its users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in the public areas of these services becomes available to the public and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information. Ars Technica is not responsible for information you have made publicly available.

## Security

This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Additionally, we provide a mechanism by which users can "misrepresent" their e-mail address in their profiles to protect themselves from spambots.

## Choice/Opt-Out

Our site provides users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from us and our partners at the point where we request information about the visitor.

This site gives users the following options for removing their information from our database to not receive future communications or to no longer receive our service. You can do this by editing your own profile.
