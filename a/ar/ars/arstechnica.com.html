<p>
The following Privacy Policy
summarizes the various ways that CondéNet, a division of Advance Magazine
Publishers Inc. ("Service Provider," "we" or "our") treats the information you
provide while using <strong>www.arstechnica.com</strong>
("Website").&nbsp; It is our goal to bring you
information that is tailored to your individual needs and, at the same time,
protect your privacy.
</p>
<p>
Please read this Privacy Policy
carefully. You can access the Privacy Policy any time at <strong>http://arstechnica.com/site/privacy.ars</strong>. <strong>Your use of and/or registration on any aspect of the Website will
constitute your agreement to this Privacy Policy.</strong>&nbsp; If you cannot agree with the terms and
conditions of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Website.&nbsp; This Privacy Policy does not cover
information collected elsewhere, including without limitation offline and on
sites linked to from the Website.
</p>
<p>
In addition to reviewing this
Privacy Policy, please read our <a href="http://arstechnica.com/site/useragreement.ars">User
Agreement</a>. Your use <a name="OLE_LINK2" title="OLE_LINK2"></a>of the Website constitutes
agreement to its terms and conditions as well. 
</p>
<p>
This Privacy Policy may be
modified from time to time; the date of the most recent revisions will appear
on this page, so check back often. Continued access of the Website by you will
constitute your acceptance of any changes or revisions to the Privacy Policy. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE TYPE OF INFORMATION
THE WEBSITE COLLECTS</strong> 
</p>
<p>
The Website generally collects <a name="OLE_LINK12" title="OLE_LINK12"></a>personally identifying information with your specific
knowledge and consent. For instance, when you enter a sweepstakes or contest,
complete a survey, make a purchase, subscribe to our publication(s), or
register for any portion of our services, you are asked to provide information
such as your e-mail address, name or phone number. Optional information such as
your age or gender may also be requested. 
</p>
<p>
Our servers may also
automatically collect information about your computer when you visit the
Website, including without limitation the type of browser software you use, the
operating system you are running, the website that referred you, and your
Internet Protocol ("IP") address.&nbsp;
Your IP address is usually associated with the place from which you
enter the Internet, like your Internet Service Provider, your company or your
university.
</p>
<p>
<strong>II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HOW THE WEBSITE USES
INFORMATION PROVIDED BY YOU</strong> 
</p>
<p>
Service Provider uses personally
identifying information you supply through the Website to provide you with the
service you have requested. For example, if you subscribe to any of our publications,
we may use your e-mail address to send you a confirmation notice and your
mailing address to send you the publication. Similarly, if you enter an online
sweepstakes, we will use this information to notify you if you are a winner. We
may also use the information to communicate with you about new features,
products or services, and/or to improve the services that we offer by tailoring
them to your needs. 
</p>
<p>
Unless otherwise specified on
the Website, Service Provider may sell or share <a name="OLE_LINK3" title="OLE_LINK3"></a>personally
identifying information with our affiliates and with carefully selected
companies who we think can offer you services and products of interest to you.
If you do not wish to have your personally identifying information shared,
write to us at <a name="OLE_LINK1" title="OLE_LINK1"></a>the street address set forth at the end of
this document. If you do not wish to receive future commercial communications
from us by e-mail, simply follow the unsubscribe instructions contained within
the e-mail. If you've registered on any part of the Website, please use the
mechanism on the Website that allows you to change or update your member
preferences or information, if available, to keep all such date accurate and
up-to-date.&nbsp; Otherwise, contact our
Privacy Policy Coordinator as described below with your changes. 
</p>
<p>
We also allow access to our database by third parties that provide us
with services, such as technical maintenance or forums and job search software,
but only for the purpose of and to the extent necessary to provide those
services. And if you choose to purchase items through features on the Website,
we may forward your information to third parties for services such as credit
card processing and order fulfillment. There are also times when you provide
information about yourself to us in areas of the site that may be managed or
participated in by third parties, such as auction services or shopping areas.
In such cases, the information may be used by us and by such third party(ies),
each pursuant to its own policies. We may also provide your information to our
advertisers, so that they can serve ads to you that meet your needs or match
your interests. While Service Provider will seek to require such third parties
to follow appropriate privacy policies and will not authorize them to use this
information except for the express purpose for which it is provided, Service
Provider does not bear any responsibility for any actions or policies of third
parties. We may also provide access to our database in order to cooperate with
official investigations or legal proceedings, including, for example, in
response to subpoenas, search warrants, court orders, or other legal process. 
</p>
<p>
In addition, we reserve the
right to use the information we collect about your computer, which may at times
be able to identify you, for any lawful business purpose, including without
limitation to help diagnose problems with our servers, to gather broad
demographic information, and to otherwise administer our Website.
</p>
<p>
While your personally
identifying information is protected as outlined above, we reserve the right to
use, transfer, sell, and share aggregated, anonymous data about our users as a
group <a name="OLE_LINK4" title="OLE_LINK4"></a>for any business purpose, such as analyzing usage
trends and seeking compatible advertisers and partners. 
</p>
<p>
In addition, as our business
changes, we may buy or sell various assets.&nbsp;
In the event all or a portion of the assets owned or controlled by
Service Provider, its parent or any subsidiary or affiliated entity are sold,
assigned, transferred or acquired by another company, the information from and/or
about our Website users may be among the transferred assets.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
<strong>III.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; COOKIES</strong> 
</p>
<p>
You may have read about
"cookies," nuggets of information that are placed by a Website in a
storage place on your own computer. We may use cookies to control the display
of ads, to track usage patterns on the site, to deliver editorial content, and
to record registration and personalization information. For example, if you
register on any part of the Website and are given the option to save your user
name and password on your computer, we can provide this convenience to you by
placing a cookie on your computer.&nbsp; Our
cookies may contain personally identifiable information and such cookies may be
shared with our affiliates and other companies. 
</p>
<p>
Some of our advertisers
occasionally serve you cookies as well. We do not have control over cookies
placed by advertisers. 
</p>
<p>
We may also use advertising service vendors to help present
advertisements on the Website.&nbsp; These vendors may use cookies, web
beacons, or similar technologies to serve you advertisements tailored to
interests you have shown by browsing on this and other sites you have visited,
to determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before and to
avoid sending you duplicate advertisements. In doing so, these vendors may
collect non-personal data such as your browser type, your operating system, Web
pages visited, time of visits, content viewed, ads viewed, and other
clickstream data. The use of cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies by
these advertising service vendors is subject to their own privacy policies, not
ours, and Service Provider disclaims all liability in connection therewith. &nbsp;If you do not want the benefits of these
advertising cookies, you may be able to opt-out by visiting <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp">http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp</a>.
</p>
<p>
If you don't want any cookies,
your Web browser likely includes an option that allows you to not accept them.
However, if you set your browser to refuse cookies, some portions of the Website may not function properly. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>IV.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; INFORMATION SECURITY AND NOTIFICATION</strong>
</p>
<p>
Because no data transmission
over the Internet is completely secure, and no system of physical or electronic
security is impenetrable, Service Provider can not guarantee the security of
the information you send to us or the security of our servers or databases, and
by using the Website you agree to assume all risk in connection with the
information sent to us or collected by us when you use the Website.&nbsp; In the unlikely event that we believe that
the security of your information in our possession or control may have been
compromised, we may seek to notify you. If notification is appropriate, we may
notify you by e-mail (provided we have your e-mail address).

<strong>V.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; KIDS AND PARENTS</strong> 
</p>
<p>
<a name="kidsandparents" title="kidsandparents"></a>This Website is not intended
for use by children, especially those under age 13. No one under age 13 is
allowed to provide any personal information or use our public discussion areas,
forums and chats. Minors between the ages of 13 and 17 must get the permission
of their parent(s) or legal guardian(s) before making purchases, including
subscriptions, on this site. 
</p>
<p>
<a name="kidsandparents" title="kidsandparents"></a>If your children disclose
information about themselves in publicly accessible areas of the Website, they
may get unsolicited messages from other parties. Accordingly, you should tell
them not to do so. 
</p>
<p>
<a name="kidsandparents" title="kidsandparents"></a>If you're worried about your
children's activities or their privacy on our site, we encourage you to contact
our Privacy Policy Coordinator as described below.
