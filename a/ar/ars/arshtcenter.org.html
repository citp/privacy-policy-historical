<h3 align="left" id="sitemap"> The Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts of Miami-Dade County's  Website Privacy Policy</h3>

<p>Under Florida law, e-mail addresses are public records. If you do not want your e-mail address released in response to a public records request, do not send electronic mail to this entity. Instead, contact this office by phone or in writing.</p> 

<p>The Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts of Miami-Dade County ("The Arsht Center"), is subject to and complies with the Florida Public Records Act. Therefore, your information acquired via our website may be subject to disclosure. In the event that you choose to share personal information, such as by subscribing to an e-newsletter, sending a message, or filling out an electronic form with personal information, the information will be saved for a designated period of time in order to comply with the state of Florida's archiving policies. However, information will not be disclosed to third parties or other government agencies, except as stated below, unless required by state or federal law. Please note that Florida's public records law requires that all information received in connection with public business be made available to anyone upon request, unless the information is subject to a specific statutory exemption.</p>

<p>At The Adrienne Arsht Center,  we respect your right to privacy. We understand that users of The Arsht Center's website need to be in control of their personal information. "Personal information" includes, but is not limited to, name, address, telephone number, e-mail address and credit card information. The Arsht Center adopted this Website Privacy Policy to inform users of how the arshtcenter.org Internet site collects, stores, and uses personal information that is submitted via the website.</p>

<strong>1. Information Collection and Use</strong><br><br>

<strong>A. Anonymity and Credit Cards</strong><br><br>
<p>You may purchase tickets and remain anonymous if you choose to pay by cash in person at our Box Office. Even if you purchase tickets with a credit card, your credit card information will not be disclosed to or shared with another entity.</p>

<strong>B. General Information</strong><br><br>
<p>You may visit and browse our website as often as you like without logging in and no personal information about your visit will be collected. If you visit our website simply to browse, we may collect general information about the way in which you use our website, including, but not limited to, the time and duration of visit, type of web browser used, the operating system/ platform you are using, your IP address, the websites from which you linked to us, and other generic information. We also may note whether and how you use the website by recording site traffic patterns and click streams. We do not associate this general information that we collect with any personal information and we do not otherwise monitor this information on an individual basis. Instead, we aggregate this usage information and use it only to identify the levels and areas of interest in The Arsht Center and to improve and refine our website and services. We may perform (or have third parties perform), analyses of visitors' behavior, and may share aggregated, anonymous data with sponsors and advertisers.</p>

<strong>C. Personal Information</strong><br><br>
<p>The Arsht Center collects personal information when you submit personal information to The Arsht Center, make a purchase or a contribution, request information on our products and services, participate in a promotion or an online survey, contact The Arsht Center with a question or suggestion, apply for employment with The Arsht Center, and when you attend certain special events where heightened security is necessary. Depending on the nature of your interaction with The Arsht Center, we may ask you for information such as your name, phone number, physical address, company related information, email address, credit card information, including expiration date and billing address, and product preferences. Once you register with The Arsht Center and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us.<br><br>

Your personal information may be used by us (or third parties engaged by us) to: (1) customize the advertising and the content that you see, (2) fulfill your requests for products and services, (3) contact you, (4) conduct research, (5) communicate information pertaining to an event at The Arsht Center (for example; time changes of a performance, traffic advisories), (6) send order confirmations, (7) update membership information, (8) respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal process, (9) establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims and (10) other communications from The Arsht Center.<br><br>
In addition, The Arsht Center may provide your name and address or phone number to third parties whose products and/or services we believe may be of interest to you (although we do not share any other information about you, the selection criteria may result in the third party being able to identify your relationship with The Arsht Center in a broad manner, i.e., that you are a subscriber or donor, or may have attended a particular production). You can request at anytime that we do not share your name and address or phone numbers with such third parties, by calling the Box Office at 305.949.6722. The Arsht Center does not monitor or control, nor is it responsible for, the privacy policies of third parties.</p>

<strong>D. Shared Information</strong><br><br>
<p>Mailing address information is never sold, rented or freely given to any outside entity.  Mailing address information may be traded with other non-profit arts companies for a one-time usage through a third-party mail house.  This is common industry practice.  However, to request your account to be marked as "do not trade", please contact the Box Office at 305-949-6722.<br><br>Email addresses are never sold, rented or freely given to any outside entity.<br><br>The Arsht Center will share information with various entities, including but not limited to, community and cultural organizations (for example chambers of commerce), as well as third parties and renters, which may produce or present certain performances at The Arsht Center for which you have purchased a ticket. Examples of these third parties include, but are not limited to, our Resident Companies (Concert Association of Florida, Florida Grand Opera, Miami City Ballet and New World Symphony), as well as third party rentals (The Cleveland Orchestra, Live Nation and other promoters). When you make a purchase to a performance presented or produced by one of these third party organizations, The Arsht Center will provide them with the information regarding your purchase. This information may include, but shall not be limited to, your name, address, telephone number and email address, as well as details of your purchase, which may include, but shall not be limited to, the date you purchased your tickets, any offer you responded to, the locations of your seats, and the dollar amount of your transaction.<br><br>Any emails sent to you by The Arsht Center offer you the option to be removed from the emailing list. You may request to be removed from our mailing or phone list at anytime. Also, you can edit personal information in your account with us, specifically your name, address, phone number, interest preferences and contact preferences through our website or by contacting us at the phone number or mailing address listed at the end of this document.<br><br>Financial information:   The Arsht Center will protect any personal financial information that you share with us. If you make a purchase online, we will use your credit card number only to process your payment and will not use it for marketing or demographic purposes. For reasons of security, credit card information is not stored on our Web Server.  We will retain order information for our records, but this information is never shared with third parties.</p>

<strong>2. Personal Information of Minors</strong><br><br>
<p>We do not solicit personal information from minors. Sites specifically geared toward children will not request any personal or contact information.</p>

<strong>3. Technology</strong><br><br>
<p>We may use "cookie" technology. A cookie is a small amount of data sent by our website and stored on your computer's hard drive that our site can read and which helps us keep track of how you use our website. Many web browsers automatically accept cookies by default, but contain an option for you to turn off the cookie acceptance if you prefer. If you turn off acceptance, there may be some features of our website that will not be available to you and some web pages may not display properly. We do not allow unrelated third parties to set cookies via The Arsht Center's website.</p>

<strong>4. Links</strong><br><br>
<p>Our website may include links to other websites. We do not control the privacy policies of the destination sites. Once you leave our servers (you can check where you are by checking the URL in the location bar on your browser), use of any information you provide is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the site that you are visiting. That policy may differ from ours. If you can't find the privacy policy of any of these sites via a link from the site's homepage, you should contact the manager of that site for more information. The Arsht Center is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of websites other than The Arsht Center's website.</p>

<strong>5. Security and Disclaimer</strong><br><br>
<p>Although we use security that we believe to be appropriate to protect your personal information, we do not guarantee that our security precautions will protect against, and we expressly disclaim any liability for, any loss, misuse, or alteration of your personal information.</p>

<strong>6. Changes to this Privacy Policy</strong><br><br>
<p>The Arsht Center may update this policy at any time. Changes to this policy will be reflected on The Arsht Center's website.</p>
