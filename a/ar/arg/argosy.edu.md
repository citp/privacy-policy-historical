We want you to understand what kinds of information we gather from you, how this information is used and protected, and how you can control its use. This statement discloses the privacy practices of the Argosy University web site. By using the Argosy University web site, the user agrees, without limitation or qualification, to be bound by this Privacy Policy.

This policy applies to the online collection of information at this web site only. 

### **Who may use this Web site**

The Argosy University Web site is not intended or designed to attract users under the age of 13. We do not collect personally identifiable data from any person we know to be under the age of 13, and instruct users under 13 not to send us any information for collection on the Argosy University Web site.  
The Argosy University Web site is designed for users from the United States. Users from other countries are advised not to disclose personal information to the Argosy University unless they consent to having their information used as set forth in this Web site’s Privacy Policy rather than under the law of user’s home country. When you disclose personal information to Argosy University through the Argosy University Web site, you transmit data to a server located in Pennsylvania, and are subject to United States and Pennsylvania law. You should not send any personal information to the Argosy University web site unless you agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy and by United States and Pennsylvania law.

### **Information collected** ****

In general, you can visit this Web site without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself. Our Web site tracking software collects the domain names but not the email addresses of visitors. Domain name information that we collect is not used to personally identify you, but is used to measure the number of visits, average time spent on the site and the pages viewed. We use this information to measure the use of the site and improve the content delivered on the site.  
When you make a request for further information from Argosy University, you are asked to provide certain contact information that is collected and used for the purpose of responding to your request. The information collected from you may include your name, address, telephone number or email address.  
We collect personal information you submit pursuant to the registration and purchasing processes of our Web site. If you e-mail us, you are voluntarily releasing information to us.     
In addition, we may have collected similar information from you in the past.  We use that historic information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. By using our web site you are consenting to our continued use of any such information.   
When you make a request for further information and provide Argosy University with your personal contact information, that information is collected and used for the purpose of responding to your specific requests. We do not share, sell or lease personal information about you except as set forth in this Web site.

### **How your information is used** ****

We utilize “cookies” on the Argosy University web site. “Cookies” are small files that we send to and store on your computer so that we may recognize your computer as a unique machine the next time you visit the Argosy University web site.  
Unless you specify that you would prefer not to hear from us, we may also use the information you provide to the Argosy University web site to contact you.    
We use the aggregate and specific information from users to develop statistics that are helpful to us in understanding how our Web site is used, and how we can continue to improve it. The personal information you send to us is typically used to respond to your inquiries, to process your requests, or to allow you to access specific information. We share your information with affiliated schools and with our parent company and with other affiliated businesses that are notified of our Privacy Policy. We DO NOT sell, rent or give your personal information to any non-affiliated third parties, except as described in this notice. We may also transfer your personal information to companies that perform services on our behalf or to companies that we believe may offer you related services or products that may be of interest to you. We notify businesses to which we transfer your personal information that the information was shared with us under this Privacy Policy.  If you tell us that you do not wish to have this information used for further contact, we will remove you from our distribution list.

  * You may always choose not to provide information, even though it may be needed to take advantage of the Argosy University web site features.

In the event that Argosy University and some of our assets are sold or transferred or used as security or to the extent we engage in business negotiations with our business partners, the information collected on our web sites, including the Argosy University web site, may be transferred or shared with third parties as part of that transaction or negotiation. Argosy University may also provide information or provide access to information to any of our affiliated businesses or to our business partners.  
Argosy University may use your contact information to reply to you and send information to you. Argosy University does not intend to reveal individually identifiable information to third parties except in the manner stated in the Privacy Policy. Argosy University will provide aggregated information received from you to third parties. Argosy University takes commercially reasonable precautions to prevent the aggregated information provided to third parties from including significant individually identifiable information.  
If Argosy University is requested by law enforcement officials or judicial authorities to provide information on individuals, Argosy University may, without your consent, provide such information. In matters involving claims of personal or public safety or in litigation where the data is pertinent, Argosy University may use or disclose your personal information without your consent or court process.  
We may use information you submit to investigate security breaches or otherwise cooperate with authorities pursuant to a legal matter. We may also remove personally identifiable information and use remaining data for historical, statistical or business planning purposes.   


**Will your information be secure?**  
Argosy University recognizes that you may be concerned about the security of your personal information and we are committed to employing reasonable technology in order to protect the security of our web site. Even with such technology, no web site is 100% secure. We will take reasonable measures that we believe are appropriate to protect your information from loss, misuse, alteration or destruction, and, where possible, will ask that any third parties to whom we may transfer your information take comparable steps to protect that security.  
If you use this site, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your access information and password and for restricting access to your computer. You also agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your password.  
We are the owner of data you supply to us.
