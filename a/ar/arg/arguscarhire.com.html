    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p>This legal notice is issued by Etrawler full owner of ArgusCarHire.com ("we", “us” or “our”). We are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy and appreciate the importance of responsible use of personal data collected on this website. We take great care with personal information, taking steps to keep it secure and ensure it is used only for our legitimate business purposes.</p>
        <p>This policy (together with our booking engine <a href="http://www.arguscarhire.com/terms-conditions.php">terms and conditions of use</a> and any other documents referred to on it) sets out the basis on which any personal data we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be processed by us.  Please read the following carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your personal data and how we will treat it. </p>
        <h3>INFORMATION WE MAY COLLECT FROM YOU</h3>
        <p>We may collect and process the following data about you:</p>
        <ul class="priv_list">
            <li>Information that you provide by filling in forms on our site www.arguscarhire.com (our site). This includes information provided at the time of registering to use our site, completing a vehicle rental booking form or query form, posting material or requesting further services. We may also ask you for information when you enter a competition or promotion sponsored by us, and when you report a problem with our site.</li>
            <li>If you contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence.</li>
            <li>We may also ask you to complete surveys that we use for research purposes, although you do not have to respond to them.</li>
            <li>Details of transactions you carry out through our site and of the fulfilment of your orders.</li>
            <li>Details of your visits to our site including, but not limited to, traffic data, location data, weblogs and other communication data, whether this is required for our own billing purposes or otherwise and the resources that you access. We may also collect, and our third party providers of advertisements and content may collect, information about where you are on the internet (e.g. the URL you came from, IP address, domain types like .ie and .com), your browser type, the country and telephone area code where your computer is located, the pages of our website that were viewed during your visit, the advertisements you clicked on, and any search terms that you entered on our website. This is statistical data about our users' browsing actions and patterns, and does not identify any individual.</li>
            <li>Bookings: When you make a booking of vehicle rental on our site, we need to use personal information about you and other passengers included in your booking. We request the following information depending on what specific service you require: name, e-mail address, home address, phone number, gender, date of birth, city and country of birth, driving license number, class of driving licence, passport number and type and country of issue on passport, flight number. Sensitive information such as health, medical, dietary, mobility and religious requirements may also be required. This personal information may be passed on to other suppliers of your travel arrangements in addition to public authorities (customs and immigration), security, and credit checking organisations and otherwise as permitted or required by law.</li>
            <li>Secure Transactions: All requests and credit card confirmations sent to us pass directly through our secure server to protect your information. . Any payment transactions will be encrypted using SSL technology. To check that your browser is using the secure server, ensure that a small padlock icon on the lower part of your browser window is visible. When it is in the “locked” position, it means that your transaction is secure. These security features are only activated for pages where you can view and submit your request or confirm your quote by providing your credit card number.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>WHERE WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL DATA</h3>
        <p>The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff may be engaged in, among other things,  the fulfilment of your vehicle rental booking, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.</p>
