<h1 id="arxiv-privacy-policy">arXiv Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>The following privacy notice describes what information we collect from you when you visit arXiv.org and how we use this information. Please read this privacy notice carefully so that you understand our privacy practices.</p>
<h2 id="effective-date-of-privacy-notice">Effective Date of Privacy Notice</h2>
<p>The privacy notice was last revised on 2019-02-08.</p>
<h2 id="what-information-we-gather-during-your-visit">What information we gather during your visit</h2>
<p><em>Information we gather for anonymous browsing:</em></p>
<p>We automatically collect certain information from you when you visit arXiv. This data is used to gather metrics on site usage including geographic location of visitors (IP address), pathways navigated through the website, what type of internet browser is used (user-agent). No attempt is made to deanonymize information we collect. </p>
<p><em>Information you may provide as registered user:</em></p>
<p>We may also collect other information as described in this notice or other specific Cornell University privacy notices. In order to take full advantage of some of our services, including article submission, we may request name, email, username, ORCID, past emails, affiliation, country, additional contact information and/or online identifiers. We may also request a record of affiliation and publication record be provided via email. When a user submits an article to arXiv we also collect author names, affiliation of co-authors (if provided), submitter IP address and submitter remote host.</p>
<p>Information associated with your user account can be viewed on your <a href="/user/">user dashboard</a>.</p>
<p><em>Information you may provide when submitting feedback or help request:</em></p>
<p>Users who email <a href="/help/contact">arXiv administrators</a> for technical help or moderation requests should include information relevant to the request.</p>
<p>Users who choose to fill out a feedback form on the website can do so anonymously or by providing personal information, such as name, email, and information about your operating environment.</p>
<p><em>Information provided by others:</em></p>
<p>Users who submit articles or other content to arXiv must ensure that they have the consent to share personal data contained within the content or the submission may be removed. </p>
<h2 id="how-we-use-your-information">How we use your information</h2>
<p>We use gathered information to track user trends and site usage with the goal of improving our visitors’ experience and optimizing our websites. We also use the information to administer this website and prevent abuse.</p>
<p><em>Customer support:</em></p>
<p>We use your information to resolve technical and moderation issues you encounter, to respond to your requests for assistance, to analyze crash information, and to repair and improve the services.</p>
<p><em>For safety and security:</em></p>
<p>We use information about you and your service use to verify accounts and activity, to monitor suspicious or fraudulent activity and to identify violations of service policies.</p>
<p><em>Daily mailings:</em></p>
<p>User-controlled subscriptions for announcements of daily papers include instructions to unsubscribe. More information at: <a href="https://arxiv.org/help/subscribe">https://arxiv.org/help/subscribe</a></p>
<p><em>Article Submission:</em></p>
<p>In the content submission and moderation process we link user accounts, authorship, and submitted content to track and process submissions. More information is at: <a href="https://arxiv.org/help/submit">https://arxiv.org/help/submit</a>; <a href="https://arxiv.org/help/registerhelp">https://arxiv.org/help/registerhelp</a>; <a href="https://arxiv.org/help/terms_of_submission">https://arxiv.org/help/terms_of_submission</a>; <a href="https://arxiv.org/help/moderation">https://arxiv.org/help/moderation</a> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Article metadata provided by submitter, including author list, author affiliation (if provided), submitter name is displayed with the article posting, email announcement of articles, and bulk metadata access via API. </p>
<p>The email address that was used to upload each submission is viewable by registered arXiv users to give users the ability to send feedback on papers to the submitter and to help users <a href="https://arxiv.org/help/endorsement#request">contact eligible arXiv endorsers</a> in order to make their own submissions.</p>
<p><em>Fundraising:</em> </p>
<p>Should you decide to donate to arXiv through the donate page you will be directed to the Cornell giving website and the information you provide will be used to process your donation. Please also see the <a href="https://giving.cornell.edu/privacy-policy/">Cornell giving privacy policy</a>.</p>
<p><em>Membership:</em></p>
<p>For users who visit arXiv from the IP range of an arXiv member institution, you will see the institution acknowledged on the arXiv.org website. arXiv member institutions also receive anonymous statistics on usage from within their IP range.</p>
<h2 id="with-whom-we-share-your-information">With whom we share your information</h2>
