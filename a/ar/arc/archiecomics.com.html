            ONLINE</font></b> </div>
          <p><b>Our Privacy Philosophy.</b></p>
          <p>We at Archie Comics Online are determined to ensure that our visitors, 
            customers and friends will have a fun experience while visiting this 
            Website, without sacrificing their peace of mind as to the protection 
            of their identity and other personal information. This policy statement 
            tells you how we collect information on you, how it's used, and the 
            steps we are taking to protect it from any unauthorized use.</p>
          <p><b>Children's Online Privacy.</b></p>
          <p>Because many visitors to this site are children, we take the utmost 
            care to make certain that our content is appropriate for kids of all 
            ages. We do not ask children to disclose more personal information 
            than is necessary for them to participate in a particular activity 
            (eg: normally just their e-mail address), and we take steps to prevent 
            children from posting contact information. Children should obtain 
            permission from a parent or guardian before contacting Archie Comics 
            Online in any regard, especially before entering any personal information 
            (which we expressly discourage) or requesting information. Archie 
            Comics Online does not permit children under the age of 13 to place 
            any orders at the Stuff Shop, or communicate with us through this 
            Website without the express written permission of their Parent or 
            Legal Guardian. If Archie Comics Online has any reason to believe 
            that a visitor under the age of 13 is posting information, or attempting 
            to purchase merchandise from our Stuff Shop, they will be asked to 
            have their Parent or Legal Guardian send an e-mail or fax to us to 
            confirm authorization.</p>
          <p>Archie does not solicit personally identifiable information from 
            children. The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA") 
            requires Websites that cater to children - or know that a visitor 
            to their site is a child under the age of 13 - to follow specific 
            Federal Trade Commission rules. In our attempt to fully comply with 
            these rules, we would like you to know that:</p>
          <p>** Personally identifiable offline contact information will not be 
            collected without prior parental consent.</p>
          <p>** Personal online contact information will not be solicited and 
            collected without prior parental consent or parental notification, 
            which will include an opportunity for the parent to prevent use of 
            the information and the child's participation in the activity. </p>
          <p>** Without prior parental consent, online information will only be 
            used to respond directly to the child's request for information and 
            will not be used for other purposes.</p>
          <p>** Archie Comics Online will not entice any child or adult, regardless 
            of their age, to divulge more personal information than is needed 
            to use the site or participate in any online activity by offering 
            any special game, prize, incentive or other similar activity.</p>
          <p>** In no case will any personally identifiable information be distributed 
            to third parties or otherwise posted, EXCEPT in the event of a Business 
            Transfer, Merger, or Buyout of Archie Comics Online (see below for 
            more details).</p>
          <p><b>Information Collection and Use.</b></p>
          <p>** Archie Comics Online uses the limited information it collects 
            from visitors, if any, for internal research, and may use this information 
            to customize the advertising and content seen on our pages. </p>
          <p><b>Information Sharing and Disclosure</b>.</p>
          <p>** Archie Comics Online will not contact children under 13 about 
            special offers or for marketing purposes without parental consent.<br>
            <br>
            **Archie Comics Online will not send personally identifiable information 
            about a child to other companies or people, UNLESS we are required 
            to respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal process - to the extent 
            permitted by law.</p>
          <p><b>Ability to Update or Delete Information. </b></p>
          <p>** Parents or Legal Guardians are welcome to send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:help@archiecomics.com">help@archiecomics.com</a> 
            to request deletion of any information we may have on their child.</p>
          <p>** Please note that information about a child may remain in back-up 
            storage for some period of time after a request for deletion of that 
            child's account. This may be the case even though no information about 
            that account remains in our active user databases.</p>
          <p><b>Archie Comics Online's Use of 'Cookies'.</b></p>
          <p>To enable many of the features available on our Website, we may assign 
            cookies to your Internet browser. This unique identification number 
            automatically identifies your browser (but not you) to our computers 
            whenever you interact with one of our Internet domain names. When 
            you visit our site, a cookie in effect says to our server computers 
            "Hello, I'm browser #6426, what do you do just for me?" 
            Only if you agree to provide information on yourself, which we normally 
            discourage, would we be able to know anything about you other than 
            the random number that our server computers assign to your browser 
            in the first place. Cookies assist you, by assisting us in creating 
            a record of your unique preferences. Archie Comics Online would only 
            use cookies to determine how many visitors we have and how often they 
            have visited particular pages on this site. We would not use cookies 
            to indirectly obtain a personal profile on individual visitors, as 
            some Website Operators choose to do through the assistance of profiling 
            software.</p>
          <p>Many people are confused about cookies, how they are used, and what 
            they can do. Cookies are very small text files written by an Internet 
            server to a customer's browser when information is exchanged. Cookies 
            only contain information that the server computer "knew" 
            in the first place and can only be read by the serving domain that 
            placed them. Cookies are an essential part of how the Internet works 
            today and allow servers to recognize your computer's browser when 
            you return. If you have ever gone to a web page that automatically 
            provides personalized content to you without requiring that you "log 
            in," this is accomplished through the use of cookies. Since cookies 
            are only text files, they cannot "run" on your computer 
            and have no ability to search your computer for other information 
            or transmit it to anyone. Cookies are implemented as part of the technology 
            implemented by your web browser. </p>
          <p><b>The Stuff Shop.</b></p>
          <p>Visitors who order merchandise or other materials from the Stuff 
            Shop will be required to provide their full name, billing and mailing 
            addresses, e-mail address, telephone number and a credit card number. 
            If the order is being shipped to a third party, we will also need 
            the recipient's name and mailing address. Before collecting information 
            in connection with a Stuff Shop order, we will verify the validity 
            of the purchaser's credit card. On a rare occasion, we might solicit 
            additional voluntary information regarding shoppers' personal shopping 
            preferences. Children under the age of 13 are prohibited from ordering 
            anything at all from our Stuff Shop without the express written permission 
            of their Parent or Legal Guardian.</p>
          <p><b>Business Transfer.</b> </p>
          <p>In the event that Archie Comic Online or substantially all of its 
            assets are acquired by a third party, customer information will be 
            one of the transferred assets. However, use of any information collected 
            on children under the age of 13, if among the transferred assets should 
            such a transaction take place, will only be used in accordance with 
            the policies set forth herein in compliance with COPPA.</p>
          <p><b>Questions or Comments.</b></p>
