**Service Provider Collection and Use**

Esri collects personally identifiable information, such as name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, user name and password only if our Clients enter/upload this information voluntarily onto ArcGIS Online.  Esri collects information from its Clients, but has no direct relationship with the Client's customers whose personally identifiable information Esri processes on ArcGIS Online.

The voluntary information Esri collects is used to complete transactions; sign up for a trial account; ensure appropriate legal use of Esri services; provide notification to Clients about updates to Esri's and our affiliates' software, data, and services; respond to customer service requests and help provide technical support to our Clients. Esri may also use personally identifiable information to send marketing materials, User Conference information, and newsletters to our Clients. 

**Choice**

Esri collects information from our Clients.If you are a customer of one of Esri's Clients, and would no longer like to be contacted by Esri or by one of our Clients that use our services, please contact the Client that you interact with directly. If you are a Client and would like to update your account please contact us at [info@esri.com](mailto:info@esri.com). 

**Access to Data Controlled by our Clients**

An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data should direct his or her query to Esri’s Client (the data controller). If the Client requests Esri to remove personally identifiable information from Esri computer systems, we  will respond to the Client's request within thirty (30) business days. 

**Data Retention**

Esri may retain personally identifiable information that Esri processes on behalf of our Clients for as long as needed to provide services to our Client. Esri may retain and use this personally identifiable information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

**Security**

The security of your personally identifiable information and our Clients’ information is important to Esri.  During the login process for ArcGIS Online when sensitive information (such as login credentials) is entered Esri encrypts the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personally identifiable information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.  ArcGIS Online allows Esri Clients to choose an option to encrypt other data which is entered or uploaded to the service but no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.  Therefore, Esri cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can contact [security@esri.com](mailto:security@esri.com).

_Business Transfer_

In the event Esri goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, our Client's or Client's customers personally identifiable information will likely be among the assets transferred.  Our Client's will be notified via email of any such change in ownership or control of the  personally identifiable information provided to Esri via ArcGIS Online.
