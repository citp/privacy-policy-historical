Print Privacy Policy

Arc’teryx Equipment a Division of Amer Sports Canada Inc. is a worldwide leader in the performance soft goods industry.

This Privacy Policy applies to Arc’teryx Equipment a Division of Amer Sports Canada Inc and its affiliates ("Arc'teryx", "we", "us", "our") and explains how we collect, use and disclose personal information. This policy describes the type of information we collect and use, how we will protect it, when we may disclose it, and how you can update your information.

This Privacy Policy does not apply to personal information about employees, partners or other staff, consultants, volunteers or other individuals assigned to Arc'teryx (collectively, "Arc'teryx Members"), or to any information which is not personal information as defined in or interpreted under applicable Canadian law.

## Clear User’s consent: 

**By using the relevant website / or by submitting personal data to Arc’teryx / or by clicking “I Agree”, depending on the website, service, or application you are using, you express your consent and agreement to the processing of your personal data in the manner provided in this Policy. If you do not agree with this policy, please do not use the website, or provide Arc’teryx with your personal data, or do not grant your consent otherwise.**

## Privacy in General

At Arc'teryx, we respect your privacy. Arc'teryx will never sell, trade, rent or loan your personal information to any other organization. "Personal information" is information about an identifiable individual as described in applicable privacy legislation.

At Arc'teryx, we take steps to ensure we meet the privacy principles and requirements for personal information under Canadian law. The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to inform our customers, visitors and other individuals we deal with ("you" or "your") about how we collect, use, and disclose personal information in our custody or control.

## Consent

We collect, use and disclose your personal information with your consent or as permitted or required by law. Your consent may be expressed, depending on the circumstances and the sensitivity of the personal information in question. In most cases, your consent to the collection, use and disclosure of personal information by Arc'teryx may be implied by the fact that you have contacted us or purchased our goods or services and voluntarily provided your personal information to us. If you provide personal information about another person to us, we assume you have the consent of that individual to enable us to collect, use or disclose their information and described in this policy.

If you choose to provide your personal information to Arc'teryx we assume that you consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information as outlined in this policy.

You may refuse consent to our collection, use and disclosure of your personal information subject to legal and contractual requirements as well as reasonable notice. If you do not consent, please do not provide us with your personal information. Where applicable, please exercise the opt-in or opt-out options offered to you on our website or in our dealings with you. You may also withdraw your consent to our further collection, use and disclosure of your personal information by contacting our Privacy Officer at [privacy@arcteryx.com](mailto:privacy@arcteryx.com) or at 1-866-458-2473 . Please note that if you withdraw your consent to our use of your personal information, we may no longer be able to provide you with certain of our services.

There are instances where Arc'teryx may collect, use or disclose your personal information without your consent. For example, we may use or disclose your personal information to comply with a subpoena or court order, under applicable law, or to collect a debt you owe to us.

## What Personal Information is Collected and How it is Used

Arc'teryx may ask you to provide your personal information (including your address, date of birth, telephone number, e-mail address or work affiliation), your credit card or other financial information, or information about your opinions or preferences with respect to participation in events, programs or services offered by Arc'teryx from time to time, We also collect personal information like your product preferences, store preferences, and other information when you complete our surveys, enter our contests, or otherwise complete Arc'teryx forms.

Authorized Arc'teryx Members, our agents and service providers may have access to your personal information. We use or disclose your personal information to, as applicable, provide you with products or services, register purchased products and otherwise manage our relationship with you, improve our website and marketing practices, and to administer our events, programs or other services. We may use your personal information to offer products or services to you, communicate with you regarding the products, services or information at your request, administer our customer databases, process and collect our accounts, send you surveys, catalogues, e-mails, or other notifications of Arc'teryx products, events and offers, invite you to Arc'teryx events, and as otherwise permitted or required by law or for purposes for which you otherwise provide your consent.

We may disclose the personal information we collect from you in certain circumstances, including:

  * where you have expressly or implicitly asked us to disclose your personal information to a third-party for a designated purpose (for example, to obtain credit or to attend an Arc'teryx sponsored event);
  * where we reasonably believe a third-party requesting your personal information is your agent;

Arc'teryx may transfer your personal information to service providers who administer or provide products, services or information on our behalf. We use reasonable measures to require the organizations with whom we share your personal information use your personal information only to perform the services we have hired them to provide.

Some of the service providers that process or handle personal information on our behalf are located outside of Canada. As a result, your personal information may be transferred, stored and/or processed outside of Canada in connection with the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. Contractual or other measures we may use to protect your personal information are subject to the legal requirements of the foreign jurisdictions where your personal information may be transferred, stored or processed.

If you would like to request access to or correction of your personal information in Arc'teryx' custody or control, please make your request in writing to our Privacy Officer at Arc'teryx, Suite 110, 2220 Dollarton Highway, North Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada V7H 1A8. We may need to verify your identity before searching for and providing you with your personal information. In some circumstances, we may not provide access to your personal information if, for example, it contains the personal information of other people, if it constitutes confidential commercial information, or if it otherwise is not properly the subject of an access request.

We predominantly use your personal information to provide you with timely products, services, and news of our events. It is important that your personal information be accurate and up-to-date. Please inform us of any changes to your personal information as soon as possible.

In some cases, especially if you wish us to delete or cease the processing of your personal data, this may also mean that we may not be able to continue to provide the services to you. We encourage you to use available profile management tools for the above purposes as such tools often provide you with direct access to your personal data and allow you to effectively manage it.

Please note that Arc’teryx may need to identify you and to ask for additional information in order to be able to fulfill your above request. Please also note that applicable law may contain restrictions and other provisions that relate to your above rights.

## Qué información personal se recoge y cómo se utiliza

Tomamos medidas razonables para exigir a las organizaciones con las que compartimos su información personal que utilicen dicha información únicamente para prestar los servicios para los que los hemos contratado.

Algunos de los proveedores que procesan o manejan información personal en nuestro nombre están ubicados fuera de Canadá. Como consecuencia, es posible que su información personal se transfiera, almacene y/o procese fuera de Canadá, en relación con los fines descritos en esta política de privacidad. Las medidas contractuales o de otra naturaleza que podemos utilizar para proteger su información personal están sujetas a los requisitos legales de las jurisdicciones extranjeras en las que su información personal sea transferida, almacenada o procesada.
