# Privacy Policy - Archaeology Magazine

Privacy Policy

  


ARCHAEOLOGY is a publication of the Archaeological Institute of America, a 133-year-old nonprofit organization. The magazine has been published continuously for more than 65 years.

ARCHAEOLOGY and the Archaeological Institute of America (AIA) are committed to providing a secure private environment in which its members and customers can communicate and carry out transactions online. This page summarizes our current information gathering and dissemination practices.

### Email Privacy

AIA use of email addresses  
Your email address will be used only within the AIA. AIA-generated email includes three types of communication: automatically generated email services to which individuals may subscribe and easily unsubscribe (e.g, newsletters, listservs, new title notifications); periodic notifications provided as a service to members (e.g., dues renewal information) and/or to others in the archaeological community (e.g., subscription access information); and correspondence with individuals.

We do not sell or rent email addresses to anyone outside the AIA.

Choosing to be removed from AIA emails

You may contact the AIA to opt-out of emails:

*By email: [webmaster@archaeological.org](mailto:webmaster@archaeological.org). Or, if you have subscribed to the e-Update, instructions to “unsubscribe” are at the bottom of each message you receive.

*By mail: Archaeological Institute of America, Attn: Publications and New Media, 656 Beacon Street, Boston, MA 02215-2006, USA.

*By telephone: 1-617-353-9361.

*By fax: 1-617-353-6550.

### Security

Data Encryption and Processing  
The AIA website uses SSL (Secure Sockets Layer, the industry-standard security protocol used to communicate with browsers). Data are strongly encrypted during transmission to ensure that personal and payment information are secure.

Once your information is received at the AIA, procedures are in place to protect it from loss, misuse, or alteration.

Demographic information about individuals (ascertained from communications, transactions, or surveys) is kept confidential and is used by the AIA only in compiling statistical information in the aggregate about and for the archaeological community.

### Use of Cookies

A cookie is a tiny amount of code that is stored by your browser on your computer’s hard drive. The AIA uses cookies for the purpose of maintaining user session identity while using specific services. In the future, cookies may also be used to keep track of your shopping cart.

The cookie function on your browser may be disabled or the contents erased. Consult your browser help for instructions. Certain functions of the AIA website may depend upon cookies being accepted by your browser.

### Use of IP Addresses

The AIA uses IP addresses for two purposes: to help diagnose problems with our server in order to best administer our website, and to verify access by a licensed subscriber (for publications that require license agreements, such as AIA publications).

### External Links

The AIA website provides links to other sites as a service to the archaeological community. The AIA is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites.

### Third Party Use

The AIA collects names, mailing addresses, job title, and areas of archaeological interest from members, customers, and meeting attendees. This information may be rented in the form of a mailing list to third parties (e.g., professional societies, commercial publishers) for one-time use. Promotional and informational materials are subject to approval by the AIA prior to rental of a mailing list. You may choose to not receive promotional mailings by contacting [membership@aia.bu.edu](mailto:membership@aia.bu.edu). Email addresses are never included in mailing lists. See Email Privacy above for more information.
