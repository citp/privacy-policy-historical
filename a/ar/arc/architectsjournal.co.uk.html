c.    during any transaction with us; and <br>
d.    any other data which you provide to Emap when you enquire about our activities, email, telephone or write to us or otherwise provide us with personal information. <br></li>
<li>Emap (or any of its sub-contractors) may also receive information about you from third parties, for example a friend who wants to tell you about one of our websites.</li>
</ol>
<h2>3.    Storage and retention of your information</h2>
<ol>
<li>Emap will keep your information on a secure server. The technology that Emap uses and the security policies which Emap has implemented are intended to safeguard your information from unauthorised access and improper use. </li>

<h2>4.    Use of Your Information</h2>
<ol>
<li>Emap may use your personal information (subject in each case to the requirements of the DPA) for the following purposes: <br>

e.    (where you post material that does or may constitute a criminal offence, breach the rights of a third party, give rise to a civil action or breach the Terms &amp; Conditions of the applicable website and as otherwise necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of Emap and its customers), to any relevant authority or third party requiring Emap to disclose the identity of or locate anyone posting such material on an Emap website; and <br>

<li>customise elements of the promotional layout and/or content of the pages of the website; </li>
<li>store your product selections to the shopping basket; </li>
<li>collect statistical information about how our visitors use the website(s) so that we can improve the website(s) and learn which parts are most popular to visitors; and </li>
<li>Gather information through our advertising partners, about the pages on the Emap website(s) that you visit, and also other information about other websites that you visit, so as to place you in an “interest segment”. This information is then used to serve interest-based advertisements which it is believed will be targeted to your interests. For more information about this type of interest based advertising, and about how to turn this feature off please visit www.youronlinechoices.co.uk or follow the link to the website of our advertising partners shown below.
