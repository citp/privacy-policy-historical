# Privacy Policy | Reference | ArcaMax Publishing

**Our Privacy Pledge to You,  
Our Customers, Users, and Subscribers**

Any information you give us is held with the highest professional care and security, and will not be used in ways to which you have not consented. You may occasionally receive quality special offers from our online partners, strictly without obligation of course, and only where you have opted in to do so. You may also occasionally receive quality special offers from our offline advertisers. At times we may work with agents and contractors who have access to personally identifiable information and are required to protect this information in a manner that is consistent with this privacy statement and are not authorized to use the information for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for us. Aside from this, we will not release your personal information or email address to any other party, unless required to by law or unless you receive ArcaMax Publishing content via a co-branded 'private-label' partnership. In that case, the private-label partner may also receive personal information about you and we encourage you to review that site's privacy policy as well.

If you use any of our mobile applications, we reserve the right to anonymously track and report your activity inside of the application with outside vendors as needed to provide the application service.

ArcaMax Publishing, Inc. is fully compliant with the 2004 Federal "CAN SPAM" act regulating email delivery. We will maintain the confidentially and integrity of our subscriber and customer data files as mandated by federal law. We reserve the right to modify this policy at anytime.

No personally identifiable information is placed into these cookies. The cookies may reflect de-identified demographic or other data linked to data you voluntarily have submitted to us, e.g., your email address, in hashed, non-human readable form.

Criteo: The purpose of Criteo’s service is to find visitors to Criteo’s advertising clients’ properties in order to send them personalized emails or serve personalized ads.

Please note that if you disable the display of personalized ads from Criteo and other advertising partners, you will continue to receive ads that are less relevant to your interests/browsing behavior.

Additionally, emails we send may contain a bit of code known as a "web beacon." This code allows us to understand the time and date of when a user has opened an email and when he/she has utilized a link within the email to visit a website. Our web beacons do not collect personally identifiable information. Users wishing to disable our web beacons should do so by turning images "off" in their email client (e.g., Outlook, Outlook Express). Please see your email client for more information.
