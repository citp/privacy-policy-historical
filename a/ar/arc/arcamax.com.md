Aside from this, we will not release your personal information or email address to any other party, unless required to by law or unless you receive ArcaMax Publishing content via a co-branded 'private-label' partnership. In that case, the private-label partner may also receive personal information about you and we encourage you to review that site's privacy policy as well. ArcaMax Publishing, Inc. is fully compliant with the 2004 Federal "CAN SPAM" act regulating email delivery.
