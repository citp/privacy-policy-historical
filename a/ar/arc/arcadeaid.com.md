42 ENTERTAINMENT PRIVACY POLICY

Introduction

42 Entertainment, LLC ("42 Entertainment") respects the privacy rights of our customers and is committed to protecting the information collected from you through our websites, social networking applications, software, and mobile applications ("Services"). To further this commitment, we have adopted a Privacy Policy that guides how we collect, use and disclose the information you provide to 42 Entertainment through our Services. 

This Privacy Policy describes:

  * The information we collect, how we do so and the purposes of our collection
  * How we use and with whom we share such information
  * How you can access and update such information
  * The choices you can make about how we collect, use and share your information
  * How we protect the information we store about you



By using our Services, you agree that your personal information will be handled as described in this Privacy Policy. Your agreement takes place when you "accept" or "allow" (or similar terms) one of our Services.

It is your responsibility to read and accept the terms of service and privacy policy for the Services and any third-party platform that allows access to our Services (e.g. social networking sites, mobile application stores). We are not responsible for the privacy practices of other entities, through which certain of our Services are offered or to which our Services may be connected. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by 42 Entertainment in connection with your use of our Services.

This Privacy Policy may be revised or updated at any time and we encourage you to check back often to ensure that you are familiar with the most recent version and the terms of our Privacy Policy.

Like many other companies, we also use "cookies" and other automated tools to obtain certain types of information when your web browser accesses our Services.

We may also allow advertisers to collect technical or aggregated information, which they may share with us, with tracking technologies like cookies and web beacons.

8) Security of Your Information

The security and confidentiality of your personal information is extremely important to us.

Although we strive to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data while it is being transmitted to our site and any transmission is at your own risk. In addition, we urge you to take steps to keep your personal information safe and to log out of your account after use.
