Throughout this Policy we refer to information that can identify you as a specific individual - such as your name, telephone number, email address, and social security number - as Personally Identifiable Information ("PII"). At ArcadeWeb, we take the privacy of our Members and the security of their PII very seriously. You have the right to know what PII we collect, how it is protected and used and the circumstances under which it may be disclosed, and this Policy is designed to provide you with that information.

ArcadeWeb also works with other companies to offer its content and services to users of their web sites ("Partner Site(s)"). Even if you link to ArcadeWeb from a Partner Site, you will need to register through ArcadeWeb to use the Site, and, therefore, this Policy applies to ArcadeWeb's collection of your PII from that registration process as well.

You will be notified by an email and/or prominent notice on our Site for 30 days of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.

We utilize an import contacts feature to help you keep in touch with your contacts and other Members of the site.

At your request, ArcadeWeb will search your email address book to help you manually import your contacts to the Site. To import your contacts from your email address book(s), you select to "Invite Friends" and then select the email provider(s) for your contacts (i.e., Facebook, Gmail, Yahoo and/or WindowsLive).

You can then include a personal message, add a new email manually or delete template emails. An invitation to join the Site will be sent with your message from ArcadeWeb ( ) to only those friends you select. 

**Non-Personally Identifiable Information**  
As with many websites, when you visit ArcadeWeb, ArcadeWeb automatically gathers certain non-personally identifiable information based on your computer information and stores it in log files. This type of technical and statistical information is used to customize your experience at ArcadeWeb, to help us improve the quality of ArcadeWeb and to make your visits to ArcadeWeb easy, convenient and fun. ArcadeWeb collects IP addresses to help diagnose problems with the Site server and for Site administration purposes. In addition to the general collection of non-personally identifiable information by the Site, the Software tracks HTML on the web pages Members visit in order to deliver ads in the form of textlink, floating, and transitional advertisements which appear embedded on the web pages visited when Members are online generally. An average of six or fewer ads per day will be shown based on the web content viewed. When you choose to install the Software, ArcadeWeb also collects non-identifying information regarding the affiliate who referred you, if any, and whether the Software's tray icon status is active or deactivated. This information is combined with a unique installation identifier and cannot be associated with a specific individual or any PII. ArcadeWeb uses this information only to troubleshoot technical issues and to generate anonymous Software usage and ad preference statistics. ArcadeWeb may disclose non-personally identifiable information collected in order to (1) comply with applicable laws, (2) respond to governmental inquiries, (3) comply with valid legal process, and/or (4) protect the rights or property of ArcadeWeb or its Members and users of the Site.

**Cookies**  
ArcadeWeb uses "cookies" and similar means to collect aggregate Internet traffic statistics and to enhance your experience at the Site. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies contain information that can later be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. ArcadeWeb uses cookies to recognize your preferences, temporarily store session information (such as your login to a download or support area), and to remember you when you register for our products and/or services. This helps save you time by eliminating the need to repeatedly enter the same information and to display your customized content and advertising on your later visits to the Site. It also allows you to move from page to page at the Site without having to sign in again on each page. ArcadeWeb does not link the information ArcadeWeb stores in cookies to any PII you submit while on the Site.

ArcadeWeb may also employ web beacons from third party partners in order to help compile aggregated statistics regarding the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns or other operations of the Site. ArcadeWeb will never allow web beacons on the Site to be used by us or third parties to collect or access your PII. 

**Security**  
The security and confidentiality of Member PII is extremely important to ArcadeWeb. We have implemented technical, administrative and physical security measures to protect PII from unauthorized access and improper use. We keep PII on servers that are protected by firewalls and located in physically secure facilities, accessible only to authorized ArcadeWeb employees. All PII including sensitive PII (such as credit card numbers) is encrypted using SSL, and we use additional proprietary software to further increase security. From time to time, we review our security procedures in order to consider appropriate new technology and methods. Please be aware though, that despite our reasonable efforts, no security measures are impenetrable and any connection or information transmitted to ArcadeWeb will be at your own risk.
