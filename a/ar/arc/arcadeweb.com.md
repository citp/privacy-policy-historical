### ARCADEWEB PRIVACY POLICY

ArcadeWeb LLC and its parent company Future Ads LLC (collectively, "ArcadeWeb") make this website (the "Site") available to registered members of the Site ("Member(s)"), subject to this privacy policy (the "Policy") and the [ArcadeWeb Terms of Use](http://www.arcadeweb.com/static/terms-of-use) (also referred to as the "End User License Agreement" or "EULA"). This Policy explains what information ArcadeWeb collects about Members on the Site and how ArcadeWeb uses and maintains the information. 

By becoming a Member of ArcadeWeb and using the Site, you signify your acceptance of this Policy. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS POLICY, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, YOU SHOULD NOT USE THIS SITE OR BECOME A MEMBER. IF YOU ARE A MEMBER AND DO NOT AGREE WITH THE TERMS OF THIS POLICY, YOU MUST IMMEDIATELY TERMINATE YOUR ACCOUNT (See the "Terminate Account" section below). 

Throughout this Policy we refer to information that can identify you as a specific individual - such as your name, telephone number, email address, and social security number - as Personally Identifiable Information ("PII"). At ArcadeWeb, we take the privacy of our Members and the security of their PII very seriously. You have the right to know what PII we collect, how it is protected and used and the circumstances under which it may be disclosed, and this Policy is designed to provide you with that information. 

This Policy applies only to information collected on the Site and not to information collected or obtained from any other sources.

ARCADEWEB OFFERS GAMES AVAILABLE ON THE INTERNET FREE OF CHARGE AT THE SITE IN EXCHANGE FOR YOUR AGREEMENT TO INSTALL ARCADEWEB SOFTWARE (THE "SOFTWARE") WHICH WILL DISPLAY ADVERTISEMENTS ON YOUR COMPUTER BASED ON THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT AS STATED IN THIS POLICY. YOU MAY ALSO BE OFFERED A SUBSCRIPTION OPTION SUCH THAT YOU DO NOT HAVE TO DOWNLOAD THE SOFTWARE OR VIEW OUR ADVERTISEMENTS. **HOWEVER, IF YOU DOWNLOAD THE SOFTWARE, NO PII IS COLLECTED THROUGH THE SOFTWARE, SO THE FIRST PART OF THIS POLICY RELATING TO THE COLLECTION AND USE OF PII APPLIES ONLY TO INFORMATION COLLECTED WHEN YOU REGISTER TO SET UP AN ACCOUNT AS A MEMBER, AND TO PARTICIPATE IN TOURNAMENTS AND TO COLLECT PRIZES.** THE REMAINDER OF THE POLICY IS APPLICABLE TO THE SOFTWARE AS WELL AS THE SITE. 

**Collection of Personally Identifiable Information**  


  * In order to use the Site, you must [register](http://www.arcadeweb.com/join.php) to set up a Member account, provide your email address and create a user name (an alias that will be your player name) and a password. You also need to provide a photo (or elect to use the default photo provided by the Site) and create a user profile. ArcadeWeb also works with other companies to offer its content and services to users of their web sites ("Partner Site(s)"). Even if you link to ArcadeWeb from a Partner Site, you will need to register through ArcadeWeb to use the Site, and, therefore, this Policy applies to ArcadeWeb's collection of your PII from that registration process as well.
  * In order to have prizes awarded to your ArcadeWeb account, you need to provide your first and last name, email address, contact phone number and mailing address so that you can be notified and make arrangements for delivery of your prize. You also are required, in order to collect a prize, to provide your age, date of birth, a photo and a photo id that matches your photo and address, so that ArcadeWeb can verify your identity and maintain the integrity of its operations. You are also requested, but not required, to provide additional demographic information, such as your geographic location, gender and ethnicity. 
  * If you are a United States taxpayer and your total winnings on ArcadeWeb in any given calendar year reach a total of $600 (or the then-current Internal Revenue Service limit), ArcadeWeb will request that you submit your social security number in order to send you a Form 1099, as currently required by Internal Revenue Service regulations. Failure to provide your social security number at that time will prevent you from participating in game tournaments.
  * If you choose to invite a friend to join ArcadeWeb through our "Tell A Friend" feature, we will ask you for your friend's email address so that you can send a personal message inviting him or her to visit the Site. Your friend's email address will only be used to send that one message and it will not be stored or otherwise used.
  * If you choose to register for any subscription services, you may be required to obtain and maintain a PayPal account and/or pay by credit card for the services and you will be required to provide PII to our third party billing service provider and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions imposed by such third party billing service provider, including its privacy policy, in addition to these Terms of Use. ArcadeWeb's billing service provider will be identified when you sign up for the applicable services. 



**Updating Personally Identifiable Information**  
You may review your PII at the "Manage Profile" and "Account Settings" pages. There you can modify and update PII that is no longer accurate. 

**Use and Disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information**  
ArcadeWeb reserves the right to use PII: (1) For the specific purpose for which such information was provided; (2) As disclosed at the time such information is provided; or (3) As disclosed in this Policy. For instance, when you notify us of a problem with the operation of the Site or submit a suggestion, complaint, question, request, or any other email correspondence, ArcadeWeb collects your email address so that you can receive a response. This information will only be used to notify you of receipt of your submission and of a resolution to the inquiry. 

By registering for an account, you agree that ArcadeWeb may display your player name and competition results. You also give us the right to use your name and likeness in any publicity regarding prizes that you win, regardless of the cash amount or value of the prize.

In the event ArcadeWeb goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your PII will likely be among the assets transferred. You will be notified by a prominent notice on our Site after any such change in ownership or control.

If you do not provide the PII required for ArcadeWeb to provide you with the services requested, you must not register as a Member, and if you are already a Member, you must immediately terminate your account, by following the instructions in the "Terminate Account" section below. 

ArcadeWeb reserves the right to disclose PII as required by law or when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights or against liability, to protect the security or integrity of the Site, to investigate and/or defend against third party claims and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Site.

**Non-Personally Identifiable Information**  
As with many websites, when you visit ArcadeWeb, ArcadeWeb automatically gathers certain non-personally identifiable information based on your computer information and stores it in log files. This type of technical and statistical information is used to customize your experience at ArcadeWeb, to help us improve the quality of ArcadeWeb and to make your visits to ArcadeWeb easy, convenient and fun. ArcadeWeb collects IP addresses to help diagnose problems with the Site server and for Site administration purposes. In addition to the general collection of non-personally identifiable information by the Site, the Software tracks HTML on the web pages Members visit in order to deliver ads in the form of textlink and floating advertisements which appear embedded on the web pages visited when Members are online generally. An average of four ads per day will be shown based on the web content viewed. When you choose to install the Software, ArcadeWeb also collects non-identifying information regarding the affiliate who referred you, if any, and whether the Software’s tray icon status is active or deactivated. This information is combined with a unique installation identifier and cannot be associated with a specific individual or any PII. ArcadeWeb uses this information only to troubleshoot technical issues and to generate anonymous Software usage and ad preference statistics. ArcadeWeb may disclose non-personally identifiable information collected in order to (1) comply with applicable laws, (2) respond to governmental inquiries, (3) comply with valid legal process, and/or (4) protect the rights or property of ArcadeWeb or its Members and users of the Site.

  


**Cookies**  
ArcadeWeb uses "cookies" and similar means to collect aggregate Internet traffic statistics and to enhance your experience at the Site. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies contain information that can later be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. ArcadeWeb uses cookies to recognize your preferences, temporarily store session information (such as your login to a download or support area), and to remember you when you register for our products and/or services. This helps save you time by eliminating the need to repeatedly enter the same information and to display your customized content and advertising on your later visits to the Site. It also allows you to move from page to page at the Site without having to sign in again on each page. If you do not want ArcadeWeb to deploy cookies in your browser, you can set your browser to reject cookies or to notify you when a website tries to put a cookie in your browser software. If you choose to decline cookies, however, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Site and it may affect your ability to use some of the products and/or services at the Site. 

**Web Beacons**  
The Site may contain electronic images known as "web beacons" which are also sometimes called single-pixel gifs. Web beacons may be used to assist in delivering cookies, allow us to count users who have visited the Site pages and to deliver services via the Site. We may also include web beacons in email messages or newsletters you agree to receive in order to determine whether such messages have been opened and acted upon. If any partner advertises on the Site, we may work with them to place web beacons on their website to allow ArcadeWeb to collect statistics on how often clicking on those advertisements on our website results in a purchase or other action on such partner's website. ArcadeWeb may also employ web beacons from third party partners in order to help compile aggregated statistics regarding the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns or other operations of the Site. ArcadeWeb will never allow web beacons on the Site to be used by third parties to collect or access your PII. 

**Security**  
The security and confidentiality of Member PII is extremely important to ArcadeWeb. We have implemented technical, administrative and physical security measures to protect PII from unauthorized access and improper use. We keep PII on servers that are protected by firewalls and located in physically secure facilities, accessible only to authorized ArcadeWeb employees. All PII is encrypted using SSL, and we use additional proprietary software to further increase security. From time to time, we review our security procedures in order to consider appropriate new technology and methods. Please be aware though, that despite our reasonable efforts, no security measures are impenetrable and any connection or information transmitted to ArcadeWeb will be at your own risk. 

**Opt-Out of ArcadeWeb Emails**  
When you register to become a Member on the Site, you will be provided with the opportunity to receive promotional offers via email from ArcadeWeb and its partners. Accordingly, when you register, please review these options carefully. Members may, at any time, choose not to receive promotional emails from ArcadeWeb by accessing the "Manage Profile" feature of "Your Account" on the Member home page, by following the "unsubscribe" instructions in any email, and/or by terminating their ArcadeWeb account (See the "Terminate Account" section below). 

**Third Party Cookies**  
In the course of serving ads to Members and to the Site, advertisers and/or ad servers may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. The use of cookies by such third party advertisers and/or ad servers is not subject to this Policy, but is subject to such third parties' respective privacy policies. 

**Links from the Site**  
ArcadeWeb provides links to the websites of many of ArcadeWeb's third party advertisers and Partner Sites. If you link to any of these third party web sites, this Policy will not apply to your use of, and activities on, those sites. We encourage you to read the legal notices posted on these sites, including their privacy policies. ArcadeWeb shall have no responsibility or liability for your visitation to, and the data collection and use practices of, these sites. All inquiries concerning the use of PII by a third party must be communicated to that third party, and not to ArcadeWeb. 

**International Law**  
Membership in the Site and participation in tournaments is available only to residents of the United States. Please note that should any law present in the nation where you conduct business be such that any product, service, or activity conducted by, on, or via our Site is banned, regulated, controlled or illegal then you are asked not to participate in any service, product or activity offered by, on or via the Site. 

**Note Concerning Users Under 18 Years of Age**  
The Site, ArcadeWeb emails and the content available in connection therewith, are neither intended for, nor directed to, persons under the age of 18. If ArcadeWeb learns that a person who registers on the Site is under the age of 18, ArcadeWeb will promptly terminate that individual's membership. 

**Children's Privacy**  
This Site is not open to children. Accordingly, we do not intend for any children to access or use the Site and we do not intend to collect PII from anyone we know to be under 13 years of age. 

**Terminate Account **  
Members of the Site who wish to terminate their account and/or who disagree with any provision of this Policy must immediately terminate their account with ArcadeWeb. Accounts may be terminated by emailing  , by going to [http://www.ArcadeWeb.com/deactivate.php](http://www.arcadeweb.com/deactivate.php), or by selecting the appropriate entry in your Control Panel using the "Add or Remove Programs" icon. ArcadeWeb also reserves the right, at any time, to terminate any Member who violates its policies and rules. 

**Changes to this Policy**  
ArcadeWeb may, from time to time, amend this Policy, in whole or part, in its sole discretion. Any changes to this Policy will be effective immediately upon the posting of the revised Policy on the Site. Changes will be reflected by the "Last Updated" reference below. Depending on the materiality of the change, ArcadeWeb may announce the change (1) on the home page of the Site, or (2) provide such notice via email to Members. By continuing to use the Site following any changes or by remaining a Member, you will be deemed to have agreed to such changes.
