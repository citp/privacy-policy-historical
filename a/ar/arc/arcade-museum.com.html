<h2>WebMagic Privacy Policy</h2>
<b>Updated: August 23, 2012</b><p>

<u><b>Introduction</b></u></p><p>  

WebMagic, Inc. ("WebMagic") respects your private information and utilizes the following practices ("Privacy Policy") 
in regards to the collection and use of any information we are provided about the users of the WebMagic web sites.  
Please review this Privacy Policy prior to using our websites, and in particular before posting any personal information to them 
since our Privacy Policy may be changed periodically without notice to you.  Additionally, our online Terms of Use describe the 
obligations and restrictions that you agree to in exchange for being allowed to use our services.  They are a legally binding contract 
between you and us.  This Privacy Policy applies to all the products, services, and websites offered by WebMagic  
and governs data collection and usage.   Specific products, services, and websites may have additional and over-riding written policies.  
Additionally, content made available for licensing will be subject to our license policy.  For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, unless otherwise 
noted, all references to WebMagic include all our products, services and websites (collectively, the services).  
By using the WebMagic services, you consent to the data practices described in this statement. </p><p>


By using our services and providing personal information to WebMagic, you are agreeing to allow us to collect and utilize this information as you use 
our web sites, and you are agreeing to allow us to disclose that information and details of any transactions with WebMagic's 
offices, subsidiaries, affiliates, and payment processors.  Due to the structure of the Internet, such data may pass 
through any country.</p><p>

<u><b>Collection of your Personal Data</b></u></p><p>

In order to provide services, WebMagic may require you to provide certain information to us, and WebMagic 
may collect other information automatically.  Common items may include, but are not limited to, your name, company name, address, email, 
phone number, credit card information (ie: on ecommerce sites), search preferences, and preferred password.  Ecommerce and message forum 
offerings in particular collect a variety of user data.</p><p>

Some pieces of data shall be provided optionally, and some are required as a condition for registration.  Required pieces of information vary 
depending upon the individual web site or service requested.   For the few services on our network that require payment, we 
request credit card or other payment account information which we may maintain on our servers.</p><p>

We may combine the information you 
submit under your account with information from our other services or third parties in order to provide you with a better 
experience and to improve the quality of our services. For certain services, we may give you the opportunity to opt out of 
combining such information.  We may gather additional personal or non-personal information in the future.</p><p>

Information about your computer hardware and software may be automatically collected by WebMagic.  
When you visit any of WebMagic's sites, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit 
a website.  This information can include: the name and address of the page you are visiting, your IP address, browser type, 
browser language, access times, referring website address, and one or more cookies that uniquely identify your browser.   
This information is used for the operation and security of the service, to maintain quality of the service, and to provide general 
statistics regarding use of our web sites.</p><p>

Please keep in mind that if you directly disclose personally identifiable information or personally sensitive 
data through WebMagic's public message offerings, such as via our public message boards, forums, blogs, or encyclopedia services, 
this information may be collected and accessed and used by others whom we have no control over. </p><p>

We store and process your information on computers located in the United States that are protected by physical as well as technological 
security devices.</p><p>



<u><b>Use of your Personal Data</b></u></p><p>
WebMagic collects, stores and uses your personal information to operate its website(s) and to deliver the services you have requested.</p><p>

WebMagic may also contact you via surveys to conduct research about your opinion of current services or of potential new services 
that may be offered.</p><p>

WebMagic may also use your personally identifiable information to inform you of other products or services available from WebMagic 
and its affiliates.</p><p>




WebMagic may keep track of the websites and pages our users visit within our network, in order to determine which 
WebMagic services are the most popular.  This data is used to deliver customized content and advertising within 
WebMagic to customers whose behavior indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area. </p><p>

Our Privacy Policy exists to protect all our visitors and our sites--not the rare individual with evil intent.  
If we, in our sole discretion, believe that any visitor(s) has or has had dishonorable intentions against us or other users on our network, 
we reserve the right to use any of your information in any way we see fit, in particular in ways to protect us, our other 
users, and society as a whole, and to inform and educate our other users.  This includes any users who we suspect are spamming us 
or our users, data mining our sites, attempting fraud against us or our users, harassment of us or our users, or any other activity 
which we deem to be anti-social.  In the past, we have felt the need to take this action against well less than 1/10 of 1% of our 
visitors.  When it does happen, it usually involves a visitor trying to bring harm to message forums or other users on message forums.</p><p>
 


<u><b>Additional Parties</b></u></p><p>

We do not share your contact information with unaffiliated third parties without your consent.</p><p>

Information you provide will be used within our company, and in cases by affiliated companies, to provide you with our services.</p><p>

WebMagic may from time to time contact you on behalf of external business partners about a particular offering that may be of 
interest to you.  In those cases, your unique personally identifiable information (such as e-mail address, name, mailing address, 
or phone number) is not transferred to the third party. </p><p>

WebMagic may share your data with trusted partners to help perform payment processing, security services, 
statistical analysis, email servicing, postal mail, customer support, surveys, direct marketing, or to arrange for deliveries.  Service providers 
will only be provided such information as is related to their roles in assisting WebMagic.  Except as authorized by you, 
all such third parties are 
prohibited from using your personally identifiable information except to provide these services to WebMagic, 
and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of such information. </p><p>

WebMagic's pages may include advertising operated and controlled by third parties, in particular 
Google and Yahoo.  Their own privacy policies likely apply to this sponsored content.</p><p>

Except as otherwise noted in this Privacy Policy or as you authorize, WebMagic does not disclose or release personally identifiable information 
to third parties; provided that, to the extent permitted by law, WebMagic may use or 
disclose personal information: (a) for compliance purposes, such as for customs control, security, and legal support; (b) in connection 
with legal requests from (i) governmental authorities or (ii) third parties pursuant to a subpoena or other legal process; (c) to perform 
payment or identity verfifications, debt reporting or collection, or to otherwise protect the rights or property of WebMagic, 
its officers, employees, customers, affiliates, or end users, or (d) if we sell or otherwise transfer substantially all of our assets 
related to any website that we own or operate or any product or service that we offer, in which event, we will require such third party 
to honor our current Privacy Policy, until the third party provides you with notice of changes to the Privacy Policy and permits you to 
exercise any rights you may have under applicable law to limit disclosures of information about you.</p><p>

Beyond the policies listed herein, WebMagic will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by 
law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process 
served on WebMagic or its sites; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of WebMagic; and (c) act under exigent circumstances 
to protect the personal safety of users of WebMagic, or the public.</p><p>


<u><b>Web Page Links</b></u></p><p>
We do not control, nor are we responsible for, the practices employed by sites linked to or from our 
web sites or the information or content contained therein.  Often links to other sites are provided solely as pointers to information 
on topics that may be useful to the users of our website.  
We do not endorse, approve, certify or control these sites and we do not guarantee the accuracy of the information presented on any third 
party site.  Our Privacy Policy is not applicable to third party sites.  WebMagic encourages you to review the privacy 
statements of websites that link to, or are linked from, WebMagic's sites so that you can understand how those 
websites collect, use and share your information.</p><p>



<u><b>Browser Cookies</b></u></p><p>

When you visit WebMagic sites, our servers may send one or more cookies - a small file that contains a string of characters - to 
your browser.  These cookies help to uniquely identify your browser and to improve the quality of our services.  Cookies cannot be 
used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer.   Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can typically only be read by 
a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time.  The purpose of a cookie is to tell the 
Web server that you have returned to a specific site or page.  
WebMagic uses cookies to allow you to log in and stay logged into our sites, to store user preferences, to track trends, to 
troubleshoot customer support issues, to provide customized content and search results, and to otherwise create and provide the 
highest quality of services we can.  On some of our sites, they are required for even basic functioning of the site to work.  
Additionally, for pages that contain advertising, our advertising partners (usually Yahoo or Google) may set their own browser 
cookies.  With the use of cookies, when you return to the same WebMagic website, the information you previously provided can often 
be retrieved, so you can easily use the WebMagic features that you customized.</p><p>

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies.  Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your 
browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer.  If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the 
interactive features of the WebMagic series or websites you visit.</p><p>

<u><b>Security of your Information</b></u></p><p>
WebMagic works to secure your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure in multiple ways.</p><p>

<u><b>Age Registrictions</b></u></p><p>
WebMagic's websites and the content therein are intended for use by persons age 14 and older.  WebMagic 
does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children 
under the age of thirteen.  Anyone under the age of 14 should <u>not</u> establish an account on our sites and should <u>not</u> 
provide any personal information to WebMagic.  
Additionally, there are restrictions 
for visitors between 14 and 17 years of age.  
Anyone under the age of 18 should <u>not</u> conduct any financial transation on or through our sites, nor shall advertise for, or 
responsd to advertising for, any financial transaction on 
our site, nor should provide any financial data such as credit card numbers.</p><p>

<u><b>User communications</b></u></p><p>
When you send email or other communications to WebMagic, we may retain those communications in order to 
process your inquiries, respond to your requests, track pending issues, and improve our services.  When you sign-up for an account, 
we will send you a 
validation email that contains a link that you will need to click on before you may use your free account.  
Additionally, if you join one of our message forums, you have the option (not the default) of receiving notices of updates to 
threads you have expressed interested, and/or notices of incoming private messages from other users.
If you no longer wish to receive these forum message, turn the option off on the same settings page in which you turned it on in 
the first place (access via the forum user control panel or clicking the opt-out link at the bottom of any subscription email).    
A few of our business to business web sites (such as www.efootage.com) may send out weekly (or less frequent) emails to members 
that have specifically requested them.  
Each email has a link at the bottom you can click if you no longer wish to receive these weekly newsletter.</p><p>

<u><b>Links</b></u></p><p>
WebMagic may present links in a format that enables us to keep track of whether these links have been followed.  
We use this information to improve the quality of our offerings, customized content, and advertising.</p><p>



<u><b>E-mail and Account Management</b></u></p><p>

All email sent from this system is as a result of a specific request.  If you signed up on one of 
our sites, you will be sent a confirmation e-mail.  If you do not click on the link in said email, your account will never be 
made active.  Once made active, you may receive e-mail from us based on the preferences you selected when you signed up.  To turn 
off any such email from one of our main sites, log in, select 'edit my account', and turn off your email settings.  Additionally, 
any 'update' email sent out may be turned off by either the account setting page, or by clicking on the 'remove' link from the 
bottom of each e-mail.   Lastly, by default, our message forums do not sent out email.  If you have asked the system to send you 
email (ie: updates to threads you have posted in), and you no longer to receive such updates, you should turn them off the same 
way you turned them on--via account settings in the user control panel.</p><p>

<u><b>Account Closures</b></u></p><p>
An account closure, initiated by either you or us, will not result in the deletion of all your data.  If you are utilzing one of our 
sites which allow users to post personal information publicly, such as in the form of a personal profile, please feel free to make 
specific requests regarding working to remove any such information.  We will review such requests on a case-by-case basis.  
Please do not ask us to delete messages in bulk that you posted to public message forum threads, as it is typically not possible to 
remove such messages without damaging the context of the message threads in which they appear.</p><p>

<u><b>Policy Changes</b></u></p><p>
We reserve the right to change the terms of this privacy policy at any time.  Furthermore, we expect to make periodic changes to it.  
When we do, the only notice of said changes will occur on the policy itself.   When we make changes, we will revise the "last updated" 
date at the top of the policy.  WebMagic encourages you to review this policy whenever you visit our website, or at least when you 
intend to specifically post personal data to it.</p><p>
