  * When I've done flash cards, they aren't in to it. This is more fun and colorful for them. I can tell they are wanting to learn their facts faster as a challenge.

  * Aligning the joy of gaming with practicing math transforms the experience and invites students to learn in an environment they are comfortable with.

  * Many of the students play video games all the time at home. This was a way to let them enjoy their playing time but to practice a skill at the same time.

  * The math games have improved the student's grades in timed tests and have boosted the student's confidence in their math abilities.
