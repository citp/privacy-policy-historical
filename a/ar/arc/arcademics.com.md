### Information we collect and how we use it

  * All information collected for use on the Arcademics site is kept confidential. No information is sold, traded, or distributed to other agencies or organizations.
  

  * Do not provide information that discloses your personal address or other pertinent information that may be used to harm you. First initial and last name will be accepted as well as modified names approved by the teacher.
  

  * If Arcademics learns or suspects any of your user information is inappropriate, Arcademics reserves the right to suspend access to or terminate the account, immediately and without notice, and to refuse any future use of the site.
  



  * When I've done flash cards, they aren't in to it. This is more fun and colorful for them. I can tell they are wanting to learn their facts faster as a challenge.

  * Aligning the joy of gaming with practicing math transforms the experience and invites students to learn in an environment they are comfortable with.

  * Many of the students play video games all the time at home. This was a way to let them enjoy their playing time but to practice a skill at the same time.

  * The math games have improved the student's grades in timed tests and have boosted the student's confidence in their math abilities.
