**2\. Who processes your personal data**

Edilportale.com SpA is the data controller of the personal data of the users registered through Edilportale.com. The company decides independently on the processing purposes and methods while respecting the law, including the security profile. For organisational and functional requirements alone, we have appointed some data processing chiefs and/or data processors of user data, for the purposes strictly related to and inherent to performing services linked or connected to www.archiproducts.com. These subjects were chosen because they have demonstrated experience, expertise and reliability to provide sufficient guarantees of complete compliance with the applicable rules on data processing, including the data security profile. The data processing chiefs process the personal data of users of our websites according to the instructions given by the Company. We periodically verify that the data processing chiefs have correctly fulfilled their tasks and that they continue to offer suitable guarantees of compliance with the provisions on the protection of personal data. The data processors are employees of the Company Edilportale.com SpA.
