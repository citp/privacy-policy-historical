We use this information to better understand how our website is being used so that we can improve its quality and make it more beneficial to our users.</p><p>Some portions of this website may request that you give us information about yourself, from which we are able to identify you, such as your name, email or other address. Some of the ways in which we may collect information from you are:</p><ul><li>Event registrations for webcasts, seminars, conferences, etc.</li><li>Product support registration</li><li>Education registration</li><li>Subscription to newsletters or other CA content-related notifications</li><li>Product purchases or trials</li><li>White paper or other downloads</li><li>Sweepstakes or contests</li></ul><p><strong>How do we use the information we gather?<br></strong>When we collect information about you, it is our intention to tell you why we are asking for the information and what we intend to do with it. You will have the option of not providing the information, in which case you may still be able to access other portions of this website, although you may not be able to access certain programs or services. In certain areas of our website, we may, where appropriate, enable you to "opt out" of certain uses of your information, or elect not to receive future communications or services.</p><p>The information we collect about you or your computer will be used to operate our website and to provide customer support, respond to your requests or process any transactions you have authorized. It may also be used to verify your identity, send you information or contact you in relation to a CA product or service that you are using or that we believe may be of interest to you.</p><p><strong>Will we share this information with third parties?<br></strong>In certain instances, we may make your information available to third parties with whom we have a relationship where that third party is providing services on our behalf. We will only provide those third parties with information that is necessary for them to perform the services and we take measures to protect your information.</p><p>We may also disclose the information to our business partners, for marketing and other purposes which we believe may be beneficial to you.</p><p>CA is a global company with customers and partners in over 140 countries worldwide.
