At ArkivMusic.com, we are committed to protecting every customer's privacy. The information we gather on our website is used to process orders and to provide our customers with an optimal shopping experience.

Such mailings are handled by ArkivMusic, and personal customer information is not revealed to our partners. If you do not wish to receive these types of mail offers, you may send an email to service@arkivmusic.com to be removed from our mailing list.
