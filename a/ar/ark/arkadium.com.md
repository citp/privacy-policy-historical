Privacy and Security

**Your privacy matters to us**

As individuals and as a company, Arkadium ("we" or "us") is as concerned about privacy protection on the Arkadium web site (the "Site") as you are. That's why we want you to know exactly how we collect, use, and safeguard your personal information. The statement that follows explains our privacy protection practices in detail. 

We welcome your feedback on our privacy protection practices. If you feel that this company is not abiding by its posted privacy policy, you should first contact Customer Care by emailing us at: 

[**CustomerCare@Arkadium.com**](mailto:CustomerCare@Arkadium.com)

Or by calling our toll-free number 1-800-934-2070

**The types of information we collect**

Arkadium collects the following types of information: 

1\. _Registration/contact information._ When you register to play Arkadium, we collect information, such as name, email address, billing address, telephone number, credit card number, date of birth, etc. We use this information to determine play eligibility and to contact you for prize verification purposes and to inform you about Site services in which you've expressed interest. 

2\. _Legal and policy compliance information._ Beyond the data we collect when you register, we also collect information needed to fulfill prizes and to track and verify compliance with Arkadium policies and federal, state, and local laws. For example: 

> In order to comply with state and federal laws, Arkadium must verify your age and state of residence. If a player is unwilling to verify his or her age or state of residence, he or she will not be permitted to play to win cash prizes. 

> In order to issue prizes of $600 and over, the law requires that Arkadium collect the winner's Social Security number, which is used for tax-reporting purposes. If a player is unwilling to provide this information, Arkadium will not be able to award that player his or her prize winnings. 

3\. _Your preferences, play frequency, and play purchases._ To be able to create a customized experience for every player, Arkadium also collects information about your game preferences, play frequency, and play purchases. We use cookie technology to collect this information and to track usage patterns on the Site. In addition, we track from which sites visitors come in order to refine our marketing strategies 

4\. _Surveys._ We conduct occasional on-site surveys to understand our audience more fully, to provide better service, to help us evaluate new features and games, and to collect more specific information. Your participation in these surveys is always optional. The data we collect from these surveys may include household income and demographic information (such as zip code and age). This information is used by our marketing department and occasionally shared, in an aggregated statistical form, with our partners and sponsors. We never disclose any item of personally identifiable survey information to any third party. 

5\. _Tell-A-Friend._ If you use our referral service to inform a friend about our Site, we ask you for that friend's name and email address. Arkadium will then automatically send the friend a one-time email, inviting him or her to visit the site. We store this information for the purpose of sending this one-time email and for ensuring that you receive credit for any referrals who register on our Site. The friend may write to us at [www.Arkadium.com](http://www.arkadium.com/) to request that we remove this information from our database. 

**How we use the information we gather and with whom it is shared**

The information you supply to us when you are registering and setting up your personal Arkadium account is used to provide our basic services, such as processing payments and awarding prizes, and to make subsequent visits to our site convenient and enjoyable. Because we store your personal information, we don't have to ask you to re-register each time you want to play our games which makes transaction processing easier and more efficient. Arkadium routinely sends all new players a welcoming email to verify their passwords and usernames. 

When you register, you may choose to either subscribe or "opt-out" of receiving email newsletters and other information from Arkadium and some of our partners. You may opt out of receiving this information by clicking the "unsubscribe" link in the emails. In order to ensure that both we and our customers are complying with applicable federal, state and local laws, as well as Arkadium' policies, and in order to provide to you the most personalized service, we may combine the information that you provide to us with information we receive from other data collection sources. 

Arkadium may, at times, share aggregate statistical information about our players with business partners, sponsors and other affiliates. For example, we may share our findings that the Arkadium audience is X percent female and Y percent male. This information is aggregated and will not personally identify our players. 

However, Arkadium may disclose personal information for the following business or legal reasons: 

  * _In special cases._ When we have reason to believe, for example, that disclosing this information may help to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who, intentionally or unintentionally, may be causing injury or interference with Arkadium' rights or property, other Arkadium players, or anyone else who might be harmed as a result.
  * _Law enforcement._ We will disclose your personal information if requested by any federal, state or local regulatory or law enforcement agency.
  * _Companies "Standing in the Shoes" of Arkadium._ Sometimes we hire companies to help us deliver our services- just like a shipping company that delivers a package. In those instances, we need to share your information with them. These companies are basically "standing in the shoes" of Arkadium and they are only allowed to use the information to deliver the service. For instance, Arkadium uses the services of a credit card processing company and other payment intermediaries to make it easy for players to pay for the games they play. When handling player payment information, the privacy protection policies of those intermediaries apply. Nevertheless, Arkadium requests that our payment intermediaries honor our privacy policy wherever applicable.
  * _In business transfers._ Arkadium may sell, convey, provide, and transfer personally identifiable information in conjunction with the sale of Arkadium or the Site, the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of Arkadium or the Site, or the corporate restructuring or sale of Arkadium or its parent company. Arkadium will provide you with the opportunity to "opt out" of having your personally identifiable information transferred in connection with such business transfer. 
  * _To Satisfy IRS Requirements._ Arkadium is required by law to provide information regarding the Player's winnings or rewards of $600 or more to the IRS. This information may include information such as a player's social security number, name and address. Except as provided in this section, Arkadium does not share social security numbers with any organization other than the IRS for tax-reporting purposes. 



**Sharing information with our partners**

Sometimes Arkadium partners with third parties to provide co-branded and branded online games. As part of our agreement with some of these partners, Arkadium shares certain information with these partners. Unless specifically disclosed to you in this privacy policy, in the rules of the games that you play, at the time you are registering, or if you "opt-in", registration information provided by new players who access our site from our partners' sites will not be shared with these partners. In order to make player visits to both sites easier and more enjoyable, we give players the opportunity to "opt in" to sharing their registration information with these partners and other third parties. 

**Collection and use of players' IP addresses**

An IP address is a number that's automatically assigned to your computer whenever you surf the Web. Web servers - the big computers that "serve up" Web pages - automatically identify your computer by its IP address. 

Arkadium collects IP addresses to analyze trends, administer our site, anonymously track players' movements on our site, and to gather broad demographic information for statistical purposes. When guests request pages from the Site, our servers log those guests' IP addresses. We do not link IP addresses to any personal information, so that while a player's session will be logged, the player remains anonymous - to us, and to anyone else. 

We use IP addresses in only a few types of situations. We may use these addresses to identify a player when it's necessary to enforce compliance with our policies or terms of service, or to protect our service, Site, customers or others. We may also use these addresses to capture time stamps so that we can determine peak and off-peak load times. These addresses may also be used to determine browser type for demographic information. Arkadium also may be required to disclose IP address information when required in legal proceedings or by law enforcement agencies. 

**How to modify information you've provided**

To protect your privacy and security, Arkadium verifies your identity before granting access or making changes to your personal information. If you have registered your profile on the Site, you must supply your user name and password to access that information. 

In order to keep the information secure, you will be able to edit profile information online only. This means that Arkadium Customer Care will not be able to change this information for you. To change the information, go to Edit My Profile. 

**How we use your transaction history**

For your protection and quality assurance purposes, every telephone call you make to Arkadium is recorded. In addition, once you're a registered player, your online game sessions, including transactions you conduct online, are archived. This archiving allows us to process and confirm your transaction and to provide you, upon request, with an account transaction history. Archiving also makes it more likely that we'll be able to recover your transactions if there's a system disruption or power outage. 

World-class Customer Care is important to us. That's why we retain all customer correspondence, written and electronic, for up to 90 days. All letters are filed, with mailing addresses and postmarks. Copies of all emails, including email address and our response, are retained as well. 

This retention policy supports our efforts to monitor and review communications, to ensure all questions, concerns, and suggestions are promptly and adequately addressed. It also helps to ensure players' adherence to Arkadium policies and procedures. After 90 days, relevant customer transactions are electronically stored and archived for up to one year. 

**Links to other sites**

The Site contains links to other sites, but Arkadium is not responsible for the content or the privacy protection practices of such sites. Please be aware that when you activate a link you leave our site and may be governed by an entirely different set of privacy protection policies. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of each and every web site you visit that collects personal information. 

**Policy on individuals under 18 years old**

The Site is intended for use by people 18 years of age and older. 

The Site is not intended for use by children. We will not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information submitted by visitors to the Site who are under the age of 13. For a full description of Arkadium' site participation policies, please read the eligibility section of our Terms and Conditions. 

**Security**

Arkadium uses industry standard efforts to protect our players' personal information. When you submit sensitive information via the Site, this information is protected both on- and offline. 

When you submit sensitive information - such as your credit card number and/or Social Security number - via our registration/order form, we want you to know that this information is encrypted and protected with SSL, the most widely used form of encryption in the industry. However, keep in mind that "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet. 

**Look for the Lock!**

Visit a secure page on our Site.. When you do, you'll notice that the lock icon appears at the bottom of your Netscape Navigator or Microsoft Internet Explorer browser display. This tells you that the page is locked, or closed; unlike the unlocked or open icon that appears when you're surfing. 

While we use SSL encryption software to protect sensitive information online, we also work to protect your personal information offline. All our employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Each quarter - as well as when new policies are implemented--our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy and their role in ensuring that players' sensitive information is protected. Even the servers used to store personal information are kept in a secure environment. 

**Your acceptance of this privacy policy**

By using the Site, you indicate your agreement with the terms and conditions of this privacy policy. If you do not agree with this privacy policy, then do not use the Site. We reserve the right to change the terms of this privacy policy. We will notify you of any material changes to this policy via email or by posting a prominent notice on the Site stating that the privacy policy has been updated. . We will give you an opportunity to "opt out" of having your information collected and used pursuant to this materially different privacy policy. Also, we encourage you to review this privacy policy on a regular basis. 

If you have any questions about Arkadium' site security policies and practices, please write to [security@Arkadium.com](mailto:security@Arkadium.com). 

_Site and service updates_

Arkadium routinely sends players site and service announcement updates. These service announcements, which cannot be unsubscribed, contain important information and updates about the services we provide. These should not be confused with individual customer communications concerning service requests or account issues, which should be resolved via email or telephone.
