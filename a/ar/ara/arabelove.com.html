																		<p>
																			<br>
																			<br>
																			THIS AGREEMENT WAS LAST UPDATED ON NOVEMBER 30, 2005.
																			<br>
																			<br>
																			arabElove.com
																			is firmly committed to privacy. The following discloses our information 
																			gathering and dissemination practices for this website, including the
																			arabElove.com
																			communities.
																			<br>
																			<br>
																			The protection of your privacy being very important, we have adopted the 
																			following practices to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal 
																			information. We will notify all registered users via email of any material 
																			change to this Privacy Statement, unless you have opted-out of receiving email 
																			from us. From time to time, changes to this Privacy Statement will also be 
																			communicated on this site.</p>
																		<p><b>What information do you gather automatically from visitors?</b>
																			<br>
																			<br>
																			We use your IP address (the series of numbers associated with your individual 
																			computer) to help us maintain our site and identify problems with our server. 
																			Your IP address does not disclose any personally revealing information about 
																			you.
																			<br>
																			<br>
																			We do use cookies to identify traffic that comes through advertising and to 
																			facilitate a more user friendly experience. Cookies are small pieces of 
																			information that a Website places on your computer's hard drive so we know 
																			it's you when you visit. This helps us to create a personalized experience for 
																			you when you visit our site. The use of cookies is a very common practice on 
																			the Internet. If you are uncomfortable with this, you can disable all cookies 
																			through your browser settings. Your enjoyment of our site won't be affected if 
																			you have set your browser to reject cookies.</p>
																		<p><b>What information will you ask me for?</b>
																			<br>
																			<br>
																			When you register to use any
																			arabElove.com
																			service you will be asked for some general identifying information which will 
																			enable us to provide you with this individualized service. We gather contact 
																			information (like your email address), demographic information (like your city 
																			of residence or age). We may share some of this information for our own 
																			research purposes with our professional advisors or consultants and third party 
																			partners, however the information shared will be limited to non-personally 
																			identifying demographic information shared under cover of a confidentiality 
																			agreement.
																			<br>
																			<br>
																			Once you have registered, you will be given the option of creating a 
																			pseudonymous profile (nickname and personal description) within our communities 
																			where your gender is applicable. You will be asked for some personal but 
																			non-identifying information to complete your profile (i.e. whether you have 
																			dependants, height, body type, race, religion, whether you smoke, etc). This 
																			information is not linked in any way to your personally identifiable 
																			information, for other members to see. Obviously, if you provide us with a 
																			photograph some of your information may become personally identifiable 
																			information.</p>
																		<p><b>How will this information be used and who has access to it?</b>
																			<br>
																			<br>
																			If you choose to have them sent to you, we may use your contact information to 
																			send you valuable updates and timely notices of promotions and mailbox status 
																			reports. Our site provides you with the opportunity to opt-in to receiving 
																			different types of communications from us at the point where we request 
																			registration information. You may modify this choice at any time by selecting 
																			"My Account" from the member home page. We reserve the right to use your 
																			contact information at any time to advise you of any updates that may 
																			materially affect your rights or status on our site.<br>
																			<br>
																			Your non-personally identifying demographic information is used to personalize 
																			your experience, allow other members to find you through a search, to compose 
																			your personal profile - which is associated with a pseudonymous identity you 
																			have created - and to deliver targeted advertising and promotional offers to 
																			you from external companies that are of the highest relevance to your 
																			demographic profile. Other than your
																			arabElove.com
																			mail box, your contact information is never available to other members or 
																			organizations.
																			<br>
																			<br>
																			The personally identifiable information we collect from you is used for 
																			internet review and to improve the content and functionality of our web server 
																			or customize the layout of our pages for each individual member. The specific 
																			information we collect is not shared with other organizations and we will never 
																			release your personally identifiable information to an external organization 
																			without your prior consent except for the purposes of validating credit 
																			information and collecting debts. We may disclose your personally identifiable 
																			information if we reasonably believe we are required to do so by operation of 
																			law, which may include, but is not limited to a judicial proceeding, court 
																			order, or legal process served on
																			arabElove.com
																			.<br>
																			<br>
																			Although
																			arabElove.com
																			makes use of up to date technology in order to protect your pictures from 
																			being copied or captured by unauthorized third parties, please keep in mind 
																			that we cannot ensure complete protection.
																		</p>
																		<p><b>How long do you keep the information I've given you?</b>
																			<br>
																			We keep the information you have given us for as long as you are a member on 
																			the site or for as long as we are required to do so by law, which ever is 
																			longer..</p>
																		<p><b>Can I change the information I have already given you?</b>
																			<br>
																			<br>
																			You can always verify or request the removal of the personally identifiable 
																			information we have collected and change your registration information by 
																			selecting "My Account" from the main menu on the site.
																			<br>
																			<br>
																		</p>
																		<p><b>Do you monitor online behavior?</b>
																			<br>
																			<br>
																			Our members communicate with each other through instant messages and onsite 
																			mail. While we do not, as a rule, moderate or monitor members' private 
																			exchanges, we reserve the right to do so if we suspect users of being under 18 
																			or of using our service for the purpose of solicitation or any other violation 
																			of our terms of use or Privacy Statement. Member submissions that appear on the 
																			public area of the site are moderated and, if necessary, we reserve the right 
																			to edit, delete, remove or not use any communication on a public area of the 
																			site.
																			<br>
																			<br>
																			Members may choose to participate in community polls. The results of these 
																			polls are tracked by gender only and do not reveal any personal identifiable 
																			information linked to the individual voters.</p>
																		<p><b>What security features do you have?</b>
																			<br>
																			<br>
																			We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal 
																			information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. 
																			No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, 
																			is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially 
																			acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its 
																			absolute security.
																		</p>
																		<p><b>Advertisers</b>
																			<br>
																			<br>
																			When you inquire about advertising opportunities on our site, you will be asked 
																			for contact information and information related to your advertising objectives. 
																			This information will be used to provide you with the business information you 
																			are seeking. Your information is only shared with internal staff and the 
																			external ad representation agencies that sell media space on the site, on our 
																			behalf.
																			arabElove.com
																			sites may contain links to other sites not affiliated with
																			arabElove.com
																			. Please note that these other sites may have privacy policies that differ from 
																			those of
																			arabElove.com
																			. We have no control over any personal information that you provide to these 
																			sites.<br>
																			<br>
																			We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf. These 
																			companies may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs 
																			or web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness. Any information that 
																			these third parties collect via cookies and action tags is completely 
																			anonymous.</p>
