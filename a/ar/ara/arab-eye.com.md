# Privacy Policy - Arab Eye, The Yahoo! Maktoob Research Community

Yahoo! Maktoob Research is strongly committed to its members’ privacy. We work to make sure that personally identifying information remains private. We will not sell, rent, trade or otherwise disclose our members’ personally identifying information to anyone outside of Yahoo! Maktoob, and its affiliated companies. We will never mislead our members about the nature of our research, nor misuse the data provided to us. We execute all our online research programs using approved scientific methods.

  **Identity will remain confidential**     
Our members’ identities and their answers will be treated as confidential, unless we have prior permission to disclose them. Occasionally, we may ask our members for permission to pass on data in a form that allows them to be personally identified, but in such cases this information will be used for research purposes only. We will not send any unsolicited emails or pass on our members’ email addresses to others for this purpose. 

  **Cooperation is voluntary**  
As with all forms of market and opinion research, cooperation is voluntary at all times. No personal information will be sought from our members without their prior knowledge and agreement. At any stage of the interview, or subsequently, they can request that a part of or their entire interview be destroyed or deleted. Whenever reasonable and practical, we will carry out such a request. 

  **Usage of cookies**  
We use cookies and other similar devices sparingly, for purposes such as quality control, validation and to prevent bothersome repeat surveying. 

  **Automatic processing**  
We automatically process information about our members’ browser types, operating systems, usernames and IP addresses in order to deliver an interview compatible with their software. 

  **Security**  
Our website has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse, theft and modification of the data that our members have provided to us. Only select employees in our organization have access to the information that has been provided by members. This data will be used for data analysis and quality control purposes only. 

  **Email Marketing**  
As a specialist in online marketing research, we at Yahoo! Maktoob Research know how important your privacy is and we are committed to making protection of your privacy a top priority. The personally identifying information given to us will be used to assist us in providing you with information about our company and services offered. Yahoo! Maktoob Research will never share your personally identifying information with any third party without your consent. 

  **Contact**   
If you have any comments, suggestions or queries regarding our privacy policy, then please contact us at [legal@maktoob-research.com](mailto:legal@maktoob-research.com).
