##  YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHT 

Residents of the State of California, under the California Civil Code, have the right to request from companies conducting business in California, a list of all third parties to which the company has disclosed Personal Information during the preceding year for direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, the law provides that if the company has a privacy policy that gives either an "Opt-outâ€ or "Opt-inâ€ choice for use of your Personal Information by third parties (such as advertisers or affiliated companies) for marketing purposes, the company may instead provide you with information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options. 

Akazoo qualifies for the alternative option: it has a comprehensive Privacy Policy and provides you with details on how you may either decline to permit ("Opt-out") or consent to ("Opt-in") the use of your Personal Information by third parties for direct marketing purposes. Therefore, we are not required to maintain or disclose a list of the third parties that received your Personal Information for marketing purposes during the preceding year. 

If you are a California resident and request information about how to exercise your third party disclosure choices, you must send a request to the following address with a preference on how our response to your request should be sent (email or postal mail). Send an email to the Privacy Administrator at Akazoo.com or you may contact us via postal mail at: 

Akazoo â€“ Internetq Inc. 4720 Center BLVD, Suite PH5 11th Street, Long Island City, NY 11109  
Attn: Your California Privacy Rights 

All requests sent via postal mail must be labeled "Your California Privacy Rightsâ€ on the envelope or post card and clearly stated on the actual request. For all requests, please include your name and home address. We will not accept requests via the telephone or by facsimile. We are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent properly, notices that are illegible or do not have complete information. 

To all users of the Website, if you have any questions about this Privacy Statement, please contact our Privacy Administrator at Akazoo.com or:

In some cases, when you as a user (even if you are not a Registered User or Subscriber), sign up for certain features or functions or submit your wireless or mobile device number to us or you elect to receive Content, send User Generated Content and/or Post, your actions in doing so may also include and be deemed to give us your consent for us to create a non-subscription account, send you and for you to receive such text-messages, email, e-newsletters and other communications from us. We will always disclose this to you if that is the case and you will be given the opportunity at that time and thereafter, to Opt-Out of receiving or continuing to receive these.

Marketing Services and Promotional Opportunities.

Optional information may be requested for specific offers, promotions or services and we may also collect an email address or other information. We caution that most wireless transmissions are not secure and there is a greater risk of an unknown third partyâ€™s interception of messages or a userâ€™s Personal Information when using a wireless or mobile device. In addition, while we make efforts to protect our Website from intrusion and unauthorized access, we cannot and do not guarantee that any of your Internet communications, Postings and/or activities on the World Wide Web, including our Website, are secure or are not subject to interception by third parties. 

You understand and hereby acknowledge and agree you will be charged by your wireless or mobile carrier for all messages sent to you or your designated wireless or mobile device(s) and you are responsible for the standard message or other rates and charges that may apply to you. Under no circumstances will we be responsible for any wireless email, text messaging or other charges incurred by you or any other person that has access to your User ID or your wireless or mobile device, device number or email address.

Use of Information. We will not use any Personal Information submitted to us in connection with our Service for any purpose but to provide the Services as you have requested, unless we provide advance notice to you of any other use. We will not share Personal Information we obtain solely in connection with our Service with any non-affiliated parties, unless you Opt-In. However, we will share information with our parent company, subsidiaries and affiliates, as well as our operational service providers that assist in delivering our Services to you. 

Cookies and Similar Technology. We use "cookie" technology to collect data regarding your visits to our Website and your use of our Services. This data is stored in aggregate form and is not used to identify any particular user or individual. We use cookies and similar tracking technologies in a variety of ways, including:

  * Saving your User ID, wireless or mobile device number or other information so you donâ€™t have to re-enter it each time you visit our Website or use our Services; 
  * Keeping count of your return visits to our Website, advertisersâ€™ or partnersâ€™ sites;
  * Accumulating and reporting aggregate, statistical information in connection with our Services and Content; and 
  * Determining which Services, Content, features and functions users like best. 



Although we may track the numbers of users to inform us on how best to update and enhance our Service, Personal Information is not extracted in this process. We use tracking information on an aggregated basis to help us operate, enhance, and improve our Services and display advertising and marketing information. You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie or image tag is being sent or you can choose to turn off all such mechanisms. This is done through your browser. If you turn cookies off, you may not have access to many features and functions of our Service that make your experience more efficient and enjoyable and some of our Services may not function properly. 

Our Services may contain advertisements, references and links to other services, web sites and organizations. We may also use third parties to display or serve advertising and to communicate to you. Often these third parties employ cookie and web bug technologies to measure advertising effectiveness. You should be aware that different rules apply to the collection, storage, maintenance, use and disclosure of your information by third parties in connection with their advertisements, promotions, and other web sites you encounter on the Internet. The use of such technology by these third parties is within their control and not ours and even if we have a relationship with a third party, we do not control their web sites, their technology or policies and practices regarding your information. This Privacy Policy does not cover any use of Personal Information that a third party, an advertiser or ad server may collect from you. We encourage you to investigate and ask questions directly of them in this regard. 

Postings. We respect the privacy of the contents of certain non-public Postings you provide or make, however, even with respect to private Postings (including, without limitation, User Generated Content), we do reserve the right to monitor, edit and disclose your use of our Services and/or any information pertaining to a Posting and any of the contents to a third party if we believe such action is required by law or is necessary to protect and defend our rights, to enforce our [**Terms of Use**](https://web.archive.org/site/documents/terms-of-use)or to protect our interests or the interests of our users, Registered Users, Subscribers, advertisers, suppliers, operational service providers or others. 

Disclosure to Third Parties. We do not sell, rent, lease or disclose your Personal Information to non-affiliated entities (i.e., entities that are not our parent or subsidiary or affiliated companies) or entities that are not our advertisers or operational service providers, except in the limited circumstances disclosed in this Privacy Policy. If we plan to disclose your Personal Information to any non-affiliated entities, we will ask you to Opt-in and allow it, in which case their use of your information is subject to their privacy policies. We may also offer co-branded services, features and functions, which are activities, events and promotions (for example, a contest) that we put together with another third party ("Co-Branded Partner"). We may share your Personal Information with our Co-Branded Partner and your voluntary use or participation in a co-branded promotion, activity, service, feature or function means you have given your affirmative consent to us and our Co-Branded Partner to collect, maintain, store and use your Personal Information. If you wish to Opt-out of a Co-Branded Partnerâ€™s future use of your Personal Information, you will need to contact the Co-Branded Partner directly. 

We also have the right to disclose your Personal Information to third parties for the purpose of administering and maintaining our Services and our operations. These third party specialists that provide support to our Services, Website and Content are our "operational service providersâ€ and we use them to efficiently provide the full range of Content, subscription plans, services, promotions, advertising, downloading, streaming and other features and functions we offer or make available to you. We request that our operational service providers also protect your privacy and not disclose your Personal Information to third party marketers that are not associated with our Services although we are not responsible for their failure to do so. Additionally, these operational service providers are not permitted to use your Personal Information for their own marketing or promotional purposes. 

We will make your Personal Information available to non-affiliated third parties in the following limited circumstances: 

  * When we are compelled to do so by a governmental agency, court or other entity (e.g., to respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal process); 
  * If we believe your actions violate any law, regulation, any term or condition of the Terms of Use, including, without limitation, this Privacy Policy, our Community Requirements or any Additional Terms or if you threaten the rights, property or safety of us, our parent, subsidiaries or affiliated companies, our Services, any of our operational service providers, suppliers, advertisers, customers, other users, registered users, Subscribers or any other party; 
  * If in our sole discretion, we believe such disclosure to be necessary or appropriate to investigate or resolve possible problems or inquiries to protect our business and assets, to defend our interests, or to comply with any legal and regulatory obligations; or 
  * In the event of a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, transfer of control, joint venture or other business combination involving us. 



Security and Protection of Personal Information. We maintain reasonable standards of security and confidentiality. However, for most Internet sites and wireless and mobile communications, it is possible third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications over an unsecured transmission. We conduct financial transactions via secured transmissions but may not always secure other parts of our Service in the same way. We also limit access to our Services by our own employees to individuals who are authorized for the proper handling of such information and any employee found violating our standards of security and confidentiality will be subject to our disciplinary processes. We request that our operational service providers follow the same policy although we are not responsible for their failure to do so. 

Review, Update or Delete Your Personal Information. Generally, you may review, update or delete any of your Personal Information collected by or through our Service, as well as your profile or any other user information you may have entered during the registration and/or subscription process or your participation in our Services or any prior updates you may have given us. You may also correct factual inaccuracies. However, Personal Information that is necessary to check eligibility, such as date of birth or age or wireless or mobile device numbers, may be modified with sufficient verification of the correct information, but cannot be deleted and if you delete or attempt to delete such information, it may result in the suspension of any and all rights you may have to use our Services, your status as a Registered User, Subscriber and/or other aspects of our Service or offers we make available to you. If you have registered for or subscribed to any Services or provided any information as part of an account or profile in connection with our Service, you may review, update or delete your Personal Information and you should go to our Website and follow the instructions there that will explain how you can edit, change, update and, with some exceptions noted, delete your Personal Information. 

If you do not understand or are not sure what Personal Information may be collected or used for particular purposes, you should contact our Privacy Administrator via email with a request at support@akazoo.com and be prepared to provide verification of your identity. 

Personal Information collected for certain offers and promotions are subject to corporate and regulatory recordkeeping requirements and will not be deleted upon the userâ€™s request. We will not allow direct access to any Personal Information by any person without the Registered Userâ€™s or Subscriberâ€™s User ID or, if applicable, appropriate identification. 

We reserve the right to deny, suspend, deactivate, terminate and/or cancel any registration, subscription, status as a Registered User, Subscriber, and/or the use of or access to any or all of our Services and any other services, content, activities, features or functions, if we believe there is a question about the identity of the person trying to use or access any portion of our Service, to use or access any information or to use a User ID. If the burden or expense of providing access to your Personal Information is disproportionate to the risks to your privacy or if the legitimate rights of others would be violated, we may decide not to provide you access to such information. In such cases, we will provide you with an explanation of why access cannot be provided and a contact for further inquiries.
