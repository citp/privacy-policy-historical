<h5>UPDATING PERSONAL INFORMATION</h5>

<p>Upon request, we will permit you to request or make changes or updates to your Personal Information for legitimate purposes.  We request identification prior to approving such requests.

We reserve the right to permit you to access your Personal Information in any account you establish with this site for purposes of making your own changes or updates, and in such case, instructions for making such changes or updates will be provided where necessary.</p>

<h5>EMAIL; OPT-OUT</h5>

This site is not considered a "secure communications medium" under the ECPA.</p>
