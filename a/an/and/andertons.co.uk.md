# Privacy Policy - Andertons Music Co.

**1\. What type of data do we collect?**

We collect personal information, such as your name, postal addresses, email address, phone number, purchase history and browsing behaviour. We store this information when you place an order with Andertons Music Co. or submit your data to us (using a web-form or a newsletter sign-up form).

**2\. Why do we collect your data?**

We use a customer engagement system that will allow us to communicate with our customers and users in a sophisticated manner. What this means for you is that we'll make better use of all the data we have about you to ensure that we only send you emails that are completely relevant to you. It also means we will be able to offer an advance 'personal shopper' style experience that uses a combination of data based on how you interact with the site (behavioural data) and PII (when you're logged in).

We've built the website in such a way that you can browse and enjoy most of the site without ever having to give us any information that could identify you as a specific person (in legal parlance that data is referred to as PII - and includes, but isn't limited to, email address, name etc).

However some of the more advanced features of the site (including buying things!) do require some PII. This includes providing us with adequate information to process payment and delivery of your orders or contact you following the completion of Contact Us, Price Match or Newsletter Sign Up forms.

**3\. How we use your data**

An example might be that if we can see you're spending a lot of time browsing a particular category we might email you with some helpful information such as a video or buyers guide relating to that category. Without this technology we would only have the option to hope people found buyers guides on their own, or send emails to everyone (that had chosen to receive our marketing emails) regardless of whether it would be of any relevance. This technology is provided by Emarsys.

**4\. Disclosure**

Because PII is particularly sensitive, we're also particularly careful about how it's used: we never, ever share or sell PII (or any data for that matter) to any other business. The only exceptions are third party partners named on this page. These are trusted partners that allow us to deliver a better shopping experience, and data is only shared with them to enable that.

**5\. Our trusted partners**

Our trusted partners each have their own privacy policies and terms and conditions. Andertons Music Co. has no control over these, and they may change over time.

**10\. General Data Protection Regulation (Added - 09/04/2018)**

In May 2018, a new EU regulation comes into force - The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Simply put, GDPR raises the standards by which data privacy is measured. Andertons Music Co. takes your privacy very seriously and as such makes every effort to abide by the new rulings of GDPR. We will never contact you for marketing purposes without your express permission. The terms of this privacy policy have also been rearranged to make them as clear and transparent as possible.

**11\. Location Services (Added - 01/06/2019)**

Our trusted partner DB-IP enables us to provide more relevant delivery information around the site based on your IP address. No connection is made between your IP Address and your PII. This service is solely used to provide a more tailored experience on the site.
