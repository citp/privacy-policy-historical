### Privacy Statement

This privacy policy applies only to the www.andotherbrands.com website (the "Site"). The site includes products (the "Goods") available for purchase from each Warehouse Fashions Limited ("Warehouse"), Oasis Fashions Limited ("Oasis") and Coast Fashions Limited ("Coast") together the "Sellers" and each a "Seller". The Sellers do not host or manage the Site. The Sellers have contracted with And Other Brands Limited ("AOB") to develop, host, and maintain the Site. 

From time-to-time, the Sellers may use AOB to provide you with communications about your order, or otherwise concerning information you might be interested in receiving, such as e-mails about loyalty rewards, sales, special items, and general marketing information about the products and services the Sellers provide.

If you make a purchase via the Site you may be, and most probably are, providing your information to AOB to process orders on behalf of the Sellers. Any information you provide may be fully shared between AOB and the relevant Seller of Goods. Wherever the terms "we," "our," or "us" are used in this privacy policy, we are referring to the practices of the relevant Sellers as the case may be and AOB concerning the processing and collection of your information through the Site. 

We are committed to taking reasonable steps toward protecting your privacy online and to managing your information responsibly. 

This privacy policy is intended to notify you of our online privacy practices, the type of information that may be collected and stored, how the information is used; with whom the information may be shared; what choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution of the information; what kind of security procedures are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under our control; and, who to contact with questions or concerns. 

This privacy policy does not apply to other websites to which we may link. We may post such links on the Site as a way of helping you locate related information and products easily. However, when linking to another website, you must review that website's privacy policy as other websites may not treat information collected online in the same manner as we do. 

By using the Site, or contacting call center operations, you consent to the collection and use of information by us in accordance with this privacy policy. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page.

### Why We Collect Information

We collect personal information because it helps us deliver products and services. For example, if you order a product, we need to have information such as your billing address, age, product choice, delivery information, and payment processing information. In addition, your personal information helps us communicate to you latest products, special offers, and information and events about which you might like to hear. 

We also collect your personal information to help us design and deliver Site operations, and to deliver targeted advertisements to you. We also may correlate your personal information obtained from you with information from other sources, which may help us to develop a more targeted user profile concerning you and/or your demographic information. For example, if you provide us with your personal information, we may cross-check that against information that might be otherwise available through other entities with whom we have business relationships in order to develop a more in-depth demographic profile of you. Similarly, we may process personal information to target specific items of interest to you. We know that everyone is busy, and nobody likes their email cluttered up with junk mail and as such we will only send you marketing messages if you choose to receive them from us. If you decide that you no longer want to receive our emails you can unsubscribe at any time by clicking and selecting 'Unsubscribe'.

### What Information We Collect

The following generally describes the type of information we may collect about you. Those who wish to communicate with us but do not wish to provide personally identifiable information online may contact us through the address or phone numbers provided on our website. However, you should note that if you contact us by phone, or if you contact us via postal mail, you may still be submitting personally identifiable information to us. For example, if you have a listed phone number without blocking, your phone number may appear to us when you call. Similarly, if you write to us and provide a name and return address, we will gather that information in order to communicate with you, and we may use the information in accordance with this privacy policy. 

### Shopping

When you shop on the Site, we will collect the information necessary to complete your order, such as your name, e-mail address, shipping address, payment information (including credit card number and/or debit card number) and billing address. You may also choose to provide us with your gender and birth date, as well as other information that you might submit. If you create an account, we will collect information about your purchases and payment methods, as well as the shipping addresses that you add to your address book, in order to make future shopping experiences faster and more convenient. We will use this information to process your transaction and dispatch your order.

### General Browsing

We do not automatically collect your home address, email address, telephone number, and product preferences unless you voluntarily input this information, such as during a registration or ordering process, or when you submit questions or comments, request information, or participate in online surveys, contests, promotions or other activities. Should you voluntarily provide us with personally identifiable information, you consent to our use of it in accordance with this policy. 

Even if you do not submit personal information through the Site, we gather navigational information about where visitors go on the Site and information about the technical efficiencies of the Site and services (i.e., time to connect to the website, time to download pages, etc.). This information allows us to see which areas of the Site are most visited and helps us better understand the user experience. This helps us improve quality by recognizing and delivering more of the features, areas, and services our visitors prefer. In this process of gathering information, we may collect personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information (for example, domain type, browser type and version, service provider and IP address, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and click-stream data). We may also create and use electronic records to compile statistics about how our visitors collectively interact with the Site.

### How We Collect Information

We collect information in three primary ways:

1\. You Give Us Information: We collect information from you when you purchase a service from us or when you interact with us about a product or service we offer or provide. For example, you provide us when you order a service or establish an account with us. 

2\. We Collect Information Automatically: We automatically collect certain types of information when you visit the Site or use products and services. For example, we automatically collect various types of technical information when you use the Site as otherwise described in this privacy policy. 

3\. We Collect Information from Other Sources: We may obtain information about you from outside sources. For example, we may obtain commercially available information about you from third parties, such as demographic information, or purchase e-mail lists from third parties for advertising and marketing purposes. We may also receive information from third-parties who provide third-party tracking services through web-beacons as otherwise discussed in this privacy policy. 

### Use of Cookies

Cookies are bits of electronic information that a website may transfer to a visitor's computer to identify specific information about the visitor's visits to a website. The Site uses a browser feature known as a cookie, which assigns a unique identification to your computer. Cookies are typically stored on your computer's hard drive and are used to help track clicks as you go through the pages within the Site. We may also use cookies to tell us whether you have previously visited the Site. We also use cookies which may be set by third-parties with whom we have entered into agreements which may enable us to obtain other information about you as may be available from those third-parties, such as demographic data about you. You can set your browser not to accept cookies or to notify you when you are sent a cookie, giving you the opportunity to decide whether or not to accept it. You may also use commonly available tools in your browser to remove cookies which may have been placed onto your computer. We will not use FLASH cookies, unless you are specifically notified that we intend to use them for a specific service, and you are given the opportunity to opt-out from receiving such cookies. FLASH cookies are cookies that are placed on your computer that are not removed through normal browser management tools, but the developer of the FLASH programming language currently has an on-line management tool to allow you to remove these FLASH cookies.

### Use of Web Beacons, Clear-GIFs, Pixel Tags and JavaScript

We also use "pixel tags" (also called "action pixels," "web beacons" or "clear gifs") and/or JavaScript plug-ins, placed on our website and in our emails to you. These web beacons and plug-ins are small graphic images (typically that you cannot see) or code on a website or in an email message which are used for such things as recording web pages and advertisements clicked-on by a user, or for tracking the performance of email marketing campaigns. These devices help us analyze our customers' online behavior and measure the effectiveness of the Site and advertising. We also work with third-party service providers that help us track, collect, and analyze this information. Third-party entities with whom we have agreements may place these devices on the website and/or in e-mails to use information obtained from them such as pages viewed, items purchased, e-mails opened and items upon which you may click in e-mails. These third-party providers may also place cookies onto your computer. Those third-party cookies may enable us to obtain aggregate demographic information and user statistics about you and your preferences from these third-party sources as well as our information we have about you 

### Widgets and Server Logs

A "widget" is generally an application that can be embedded in a web page. Widgets can provide real-time information to the page. Widgets are often provided by third-parties and we may provide widgets on the Site. Widgets may enable the third-parties that provide them to collect data about users visiting the Site. We may also obtain information shared with us through the providers of these widgets. 

A web "server log" is a record of activity created by a computer that delivers certain web pages to your browser. Certain activities that you perform on the Site may record information in server logs, such as if you enter a search term into a search box located on the Site. The server log may record the search term, or the link you clicked on to bring you to the Site. The server log may also record information about your browser, such as you IP address and the cookies set on your browser.
