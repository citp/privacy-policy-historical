**Andersen Corporation’s General Policy Regarding Privacy**

Andersen Corporation (hereinafter “Andersen”) respects your expectation of privacy as you visit its websites, blogs, social media sites and online presence and for email sent and received from Andersen (hereinafter collectively the “Website”). Andersen is particularly sensitive to privacy issues on the Internet and therefore Andersen provides this Privacy Policy so you know about its online information practices and understand how Andersen treats the information it receives from and about you during your visit to the Website. This Privacy Policy is incorporated in Andersen’s Website Terms and Conditions of Use.

**Personal and Non-Personal Information**

Personal Information means any information that may be used to identify an individual or business, including, but not limited to names, phone numbers, physical mailing addresses, email addresses, locations, credit information, credit card information, social security numbers, other contact information, or other information describing an individual.

Non-Personal or Aggregate Information means information that does not specifically identify an individual or business, but includes information from you, such as your browser type, the URL of the previous website you visited, your Internet service provider (ISP), operating system, and your Internet protocol (IP) Address. Non-Personal Information is not typically used to personally identify you.

**Collection of Personal and Non-Personal Information**

Andersen may collect Personal Information from you when you provide it to us. For example, if you send an email or submit information via a form on the Website, Andersen may collect your name, mailing address, telephone number, email address, or any other information you provide. Andersen may also collect Personal Information if you communicate with Andersen via means other than the Website, including blogs, social media sites, or other online and offline communications. Andersen may collect any information you provide in any such communication.

Andersen values your opinions and comments, and we may conduct online surveys or polls. Participation in these surveys and polls is always optional. The information is aggregated and used to make improvements to the Website and to develop useful content, features and promotions for Website visitors. The identity of survey or poll participants is anonymous unless the survey or poll either specifically request Personal Information or otherwise states Personal Information is collected.

Andersen may occasionally request or require that you provide your email address or other identifying information to access portions of the Website or to provide you with communications. Further, Andersen may collect your email address or other contact information in an offline format (for example, your response to a mailer or filling out an attendance form at a trade show). By providing Andersen with your email address or any other contact information (such as your mailing address, name, phone number, etc.) you understand and agree that Andersen may from time to time use the contact information to send you information about products, services, corporate information, promotions, etc. Further, Andersen may pass along all of the information you provide to an Andersen dealer, distributor, or service provider who may contact you for various reasons, including but not limited to fulfilling orders or providing you information or assistance that you have requested.

If you prefer not to receive this kind of information from Andersen, your request will be promptly honored. Please note, however, that any orders or requests for information made online, or other requests that necessitate a response, will receive confirmation emails related to the status of the orders or requests.

The Website sometimes includes notices of promotions Andersen is conducting, and Andersen may permit you to enter electronically in some cases. If that occurs, we will use the information you provide for the purpose of conducting the promotion. Andersen may retain that information for communicating with you for future promotions or for any other purpose unless we receive communication from you in writing to cease sending you communications.

Andersen, like other website operators, uses analytic and reporting technologies to record Non-Personal Information such as Internet domain and host names, IP addresses, browser software, operating system types, clickstream patterns, the dates and times that the Website was accessed and other information provided through the software used to access the Website. Andersen may from time to time contract with online partners to assist in the management or monitoring of the Website. Andersen may also contract with third parties to offer advertising or other content on the Website. Those third parties may use analytic and reporting technologies to serve advertisements and other information based on data obtained from you during your visit to the Website. Andersen may aggregate Non-Personal Information to measure how the Website is being used so we can improve its content.
