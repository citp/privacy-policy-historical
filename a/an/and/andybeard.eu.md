# Privacy Statement

Please don’t interact with this website if you are under 13 – I have no wish to have any of your personal data.

If you leave a comment your email address will be stored in my database on my server. Please refer to my comments policy about how I reserve the right to contact you if you leave a comment for a number of reasons, at my own discretion.

I use various forms of tracking, and some of these services don’t identify personal data, and others might to a greater or lesser extent. I will almost always know general details like what IP address you have, browser, screen resolution, where you came from, and what pages you read.

At certain times I may also know what actions you took on my site, such as which links were clicked, and with services like MyBlogLog, I may even be able to identify data down to individual people.

Subscriptions by RSS are effectively anonymous. For email subscriptions the service is provided by Feedburner, and isn’t anonymous, as I get to see email addresses.

I try to keep all data secure, and where possible I will delete it upon request.
