We may anonymize and aggregate data collected through the Anchor Services and use it for any purpose. Such information does not identify you individually.

#### Social Media:

When you elect to access and use the Social Media Services, you will be sharing your information (which will include personal information if you elect to share such information) with those Social Media Services. As with other Third Party Sites, the information that you share with the Social Media Services will be governed by the privacy policies and terms of service of the providers of such Social Media Services and not by the Anchor’s policies and procedures. You may also be able to modify your privacy settings with these Social Media Services to, for example, control what information the Social Media Services disclose to other entities, including Anchor. When you provide Anchor access to your Social Media Services account, we will collect relevant information necessary to enable the Anchor Services to access that Social Media Service, however you will provide your login information, like your password, directly to such Social Media Service (and not to Anchor).

#### Posts, Following, Lists and other Public Information:

The Anchor Services are primarily designed to help you share information with the world. Most of the information you provide us through the Anchor Services is information you are asking us to make public. Your public information includes the messages you post; the metadata provided with such posts, such as when you posted and the client application you used to post; the language, country, and time zone associated with your account; and the lists you create, people you follow, posts you mark as likes, and many other bits of information that result from your use of the Anchor Services. We may use this information to make inferences, like what topics you may be interested in, and to customize the content we show you, including ads. Our default is almost always to make the information you provide through the Anchor Services public for as long as you do not delete it. The Anchor Services broadly and instantly disseminate your public information to a wide range of users, customers, and services. For instance, your public user profile information and public posts are immediately delivered via SMS and our APIs to our partners and other third parties, including search engines, developers, and publishers that integrate Anchor Services content into their services, and institutions such as universities and public health agencies that analyze the information for trends and insights. When you share information or content via the Anchor Services, you should think carefully about what you are making public.

#### Location Information:

Anchor may receive information about your location. For example, you may choose to publish your location in your posts and in your Anchor profile. You may also tell us your location when you set your trend location on the Anchor Services. We may also determine location by using other data from your device, such as precise location information from GPS, information about wireless networks or cell towers near your mobile device, or your IP address. We may use and store information about your location to provide features of our Anchor Services, such as to improve and customize the Anchor Services, for example, with more relevant content like local trends, stories, ads, and suggestions for people to follow. Additional Information: You may provide us with profile information to make public on the Anchor Services, such as a short biography, your location, your website, or a picture. You may choose to upload your address book so that we can help you find users you know or help other users find you. We may later make suggestions to you and other users based on imported address book contacts. You can delete your imported address book contacts at any time.  If you email us, we may keep your message, email address and contact information to respond to your request. If you connect your account on our Anchor Services to your account on another service in order to cross-post between our Anchor Services and that service, the other service may send us your registration or profile information on that service and other information that you authorize. This information enables cross-posting, helps us improve the Anchor Services, and is deleted from our Anchor Services within a few weeks of your disconnecting from our Anchor Services your account on the other service.
