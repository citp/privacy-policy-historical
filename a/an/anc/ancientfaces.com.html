                            Communications: When you sign up for an account or use certain features, you are opting to receive 
                            messages from other users, businesses, and AncientFaces. You can manage some of your messaging 
                            preferences through your account settings, but note that you cannot opt out of receiving certain 
                            administrative, transactional, or legal messages from AncientFaces. For example, if you upload photos 
                            or create biographies through the Service, we may send you messages about your transaction using the 
                            contact information you provide. We may also track your actions in response to the messages you receive 
                            from us or through the Service, such as whether you deleted, opened, or forwarded such messages. If you 
                            exchange messages with others through the Service, we may store them in order to process and deliver 
                            them or allow you to manage them, and we may review and disclose them in connection with investigations 
                            related to use of the Service, as well as our efforts to improve the Service. We may not deliver messages 
                            that we believe are objectionable, such as spam messages or fraudulent solicitations. We may also store 
                            information that you provide through communications to us, including from phone calls, letters, emails and 
                            other electronic messages or in person.
