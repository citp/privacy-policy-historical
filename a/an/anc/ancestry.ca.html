recognizes the confidentiality of information that may be disclosed by members
or other visitors in registering or making purchases from our Website and we
are firmly committed to protecting your privacy. The following discloses our
information gathering and dissemination practices for this Website. </p>

<p class="body"><b>Overview:</b><br>
The personal, private information that is provided to MyFamily.com, Inc. by
individual members is not provided to unrelated third parties except in rare
cases involving possible violations of our use policies, legal statutes, or
other laws. We do collect some data, always with your knowledge and consent,
that is used to fulfill orders and otherwise enhance content to better meet the
needs of our users.</p>

<p class="body">Information submitted by you online (such as products you
purchase from MyFamily.com, Inc., your name, address, e-mail address) may be
shared with internet distribution companies with which MyFamily.com, Inc. has a
commercial relationship and through which you reached this site, for marketing
purposes. In such circumstances you will be considered their customer as well.
If you object to such use, you may opt-out by e-mail request. Under no
circumstances will MyFamily.com, Inc. share with any other party your password
or other personal information it may acquire about children, family, etc.</p>

<p class="body">Demographic information collected through on-site user surveys
may be used in aggregate statistical form to attract potential sponsors.</p>

<p class="body">Some of the specifics of our Privacy Policy are best described in
the answers to the following Frequently Asked Questions:</p>

<p class="body"><b>Does MyFamily ask for personal information?</b><br>
Yes. MyFamily asks for your name, e-mail address, and other
limited personal information when you sign up as a member and use features such
as e-mail, and make purchases at the MyFamily online store. Most of this
information may be entered at your discretion. We may ask for similar
information at other times, such as when you enter sweepstakes or other
promotions sponsored by MyFamily and/or our many partners.</p>

<p class="body">To facilitate payment and fulfillment for membership and
purchases at the MyFamily online store, MyFamily will request personal credit
card or debit card information. In order to take advantage of other value-added
family services that may be offered by MyFamily in the future, users may be
required to supply financial information.</p>

<p class="body"><b>How Does MyFamily use my personal information?</b><br>
Our goal is to provide you with the most personalized, relevant, user-friendly
Web experience possible. The primary use of all your personal information is to
efficiently provide you with relevant information or services.</p>

<p class="body">MyFamily will also use registration information to let you know
about new features or other offers of interest from MyFamily, or to address
customer service needs and requests. </p>

<p class="body">In distributing advertiser or sponsor messages, <b>the advertiser
never has access to individual account information. MyFamily does not sell,
rent or otherwise distribute the personal information you provide us to these
advertisers.</b> Advertisers simply provide an insertion order for the
advertising message and MyFamily then displays the ad to appropriate users
based on the criteria specified in the order.</p>

<p class="body"><br>
<b>Will MyFamily disclose any of my personal information to third parties?</b><br>
MyFamily will not disclose any of your personal information, except with your
knowledge and consent, or as described in this policy or as may be required by
law, or to protect the rights or property of MyFamily.</p>

<p class="MsoBodyText3"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Verdana;mso-ansi-language:EN-CA">We may disclose your
personal information to individuals or organizations</span><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:8.5pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black;mso-ansi-language:EN-CA"> who are our service providers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:
10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Verdana;mso-ansi-language:EN-CA">Where
MyFamily discloses personal information to organizations that perform services
on our behalf, we will require those service providers to use such information
solely for the purposes of providing services to you or MyFamily and <span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">to have appropriate safeguards for the protection
of that personal information. </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="body">Other circumstances where limited personal information may be
disclosed are specifically described when the data is collected, such as in the
User Agreement, or in the rules of sweepstakes or other promotions. So, in all
cases you control what, if any, information you disclose.</p>

<p class="body">MyFamily reserves the right to disclose aggregated user
statistics, such as "45% of our users are female" or "47% of our
users have attended college" in order to describe our services to
prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties. </p>

<p class="body">Under protection of confidentiality agreements, MyFamily may
match common user information, such as name, address and phone number with
third party data to avoid duplication of promotional mailings, to comply with
CAN SPAM and other laws and to prevent errors. </p>

<p class="body">Additionally, if you click away from MyFamily to visit the site
of any third party advertiser or sponsor, you may be asked for your credit card
or other personal information in order to purchase or use products and services
offered. These companies have their own privacy and data collection practices.
MyFamily has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies. You
should therefore review their privacy policies carefully if you have concerns
about how your information may be used.</p>

<p class="body"><b>Where does MyFamily keep my information?</b><br>
Currently,
the principal place in which MyFamily holds personal information is in the city
of Provo, Utah , Unites States
of America, and nearby municipalities where off-site hosting or storage
facilities may be located.</p>

<p class="body"><b>Will MyFamily use my information for direct mailings?</b><br>
MyFamily will send electronic mail to you, for the purpose of informing you of
changes or additions to MyFamily, or of any MyFamily related products and
services. If you do not want to receive such mailings, you may opt out at any
time by using the unsubscribe link listed in the e-mail or by making
appropriate selections in the MyAccount tab on the Site.</p>

<p class="body"><b>May I refuse to provide personal information to MyFamily or to
accept advertising?</b><br>
Visitors may access MyFamily’s free services by providing a first name, last
name, and e-mail address. To gain full access to the members-only areas, a
username, e-mail address and appropriate billing information are required.
Because the MyFamily site is partially advertiser supported, you may not
"turn off" the advertising that appears on MyFamily pages, but you
may opt to be excluded from any e-mail advertising.</p>

<p class="body"><b>How does MyFamily protect my information?</b><br>
MyFamily
endeavours to maintain appropriate physical, procedural and technical security
with respect to its offices and information storage facilities, so as to
prevent any loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, or modification of
personal information. This also applies to
our disposal or destruction of personal information.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Verdana;mso-bidi-font-family:Arial;mso-ansi-language:EN-CA">MyFamily
further protects personal information by restricting access to it to those of
our personnel who have a need to know that information in order that we may
provide our products or services.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="body"><b>May
I access and review my personal information held by MyFamily?</b><br>
MyFamily permits the
reasonable right of access and review of your personal information held by us
by allowing you to access account information via the MyAccount tab on the
site.</p>

<p class="body">MyFamily reserves the right
to decline to provide access to personal information where the information
requested:</p>

<p class="body"><b>Does MyFamily use "IP Addresses" and cookies?</b><br>
IP Addresses: We do use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our
server, and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is also used to gather
broad demographic information such as geographic distribution of our members.</p>

<p class="body"><b>MyFamily Cookies:</b><br>
Contrary to popular myth, cookies do not extract private or personal
information from your computer’s memory, but rather, record only information
you volunteer to us upon registering or visiting the site. Cookies are tiny
files placed onto the hard drive of your computer when you register at our Web
site that enable our server to recognize or "remember" who you are
each time you return. MyFamily may make limited use of cookies to deliver
content specific to your interests. For instance they may be used to retain
your personal preferences, hold session information for a "shopping
basket," or save your password so it doesn’t have to be re-entered each
time you login.</p>

<p class="body"><b>Advertiser Cookies:</b><br>
We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf. These
companies may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs
or web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="body"><b>What else should I know about privacy?</b><br>
The following encapsulates a few key issues mentioned in context above. </p>

<p class="body"><a name="Profiles"></a><a name="Contests"></a><b>Contests &amp;
Promotions</b><br>
MyFamily may occasionally run contests or other special promotions on our site
in which we ask members or visitors for contact information (like an e-mail
address) or demographic information (like a zip code, age, or income level). We
use this data to send you promotional material about our company or our
partners. Your contact information is also used to contact you when necessary
and may be shared with other companies for promotional purposes, but only with
your prior permission and under the terms and conditions specified when you
take part in the promotion. At any time, you may opt-out of receiving future
mailings of this kind, or simply decline to take part in the promotions.</p>
