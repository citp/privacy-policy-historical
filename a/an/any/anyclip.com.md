In the event you request us to delete your personal information, we, our affiliates or service providers may retain information for backup, archival, and/or audit purposes. The length of time personal data is retained, and criteria for determining that time, are dependent on the nature of the personal data and the purpose for which it was provided. The following factors typically influence retention periods:

  * How long is the personal information needed to provide our Services? This includes such things as maintaining and improving the performance of the Services, keeping our systems secure, and maintaining appropriate business and financial records.
  * Does the personal contain any sensitive information? If so, a shortened retention time is generally appropriate.

After it is no longer necessary for us to retain your personal information, we will dispose of it in a secure manner according to our data retention and deletion policies.

You can request information on the data that might possibly remain in our archived records after your account has been deleted.
