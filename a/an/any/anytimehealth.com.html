<p>Anytime Health is pleased to make its services provided at <a href="http://www.anytimehealth.com">http://www.anytimehealth.com</a> (the “Site”) available for your use. By using the Site or by signing up for an account you agree to be bound by the Privacy Policy set forth in this document as well as the Terms of Service posted at <a href="/site-links/terms-of-service">http://www.anytimehealth.com/site-links/terms-of-service</a>.</p>

<p>Use of this Site is strictly voluntary. If you do not agree to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Service, you must immediately log off the Site and may not use the Site.</p>

<p>Anytime Health respects the importance of the privacy of your personal information. Anytime Health provides this Privacy Policy so you know about Anytime Health’s online information practices and understand how Anytime Health treats the information Anytime Health receives about you from your use of the Site. By using, browsing and/or accessing the Site, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. Your visit to the Site and any dispute over privacy is subject to the Terms of Service, including limitations on damages and application of the law of the state of Minnesota.</p>

<h2>the information Anytime Health collects</h2>

<p>In general, you can browse the non-password protected portions of this Site without telling Anytime Health who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. Anytime Health, however, collects your IP address. Your IP address is a number that is used by computers connected to the Internet to identify your computer so that data (such as the Web pages you request) can be sent to you. Anytime Health uses your IP address to, among other things,: (1) help diagnose problems with Anytime Health’s server; administer the Site; measure the use of the Site; improve the content of the Site; (2) identify visitors' Internet providers, the type of web browsers used, the pages viewed, the web sites from which a visitor found this Site, the search terms and search engines used to find this Site; and (3) gather other web analytics information relating to visitors’ use and navigation of the Site. This information does not identify you personally. On occasion Anytime Health may aggregate this data with data on the pages visited by other users to track overall visitor traffic patterns and provide this aggregate information to vendors, potential advertisers, business partners, news agencies, or other parties to demonstrate the amount of interest in the Site and to help Anytime Health plan for technical infrastructure requirements.</p>

<p>In order to use the password-protected portions of the Site, or to purchase items from the Site, your browser must be set to accept Cookies. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that Anytime Health transfers to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable the Site to "recognize" you every time you visit and to "remember" any information you have saved, such as storage of items in your shopping cart between visits. Anytime Health does not use cookies to store any of your personal or financial information that you have on your computer.</p>

<p>Anytime Health recognizes that you have a choice to refuse cookies. However, should you decide not to accept cookies from the Site, you will limit the functionality Anytime Health can provide when you visit the Site. View your browser's help file for more information on cookies.</p>

<p>Anytime Health receives and may store information you enter on the Site or give to the Site in any other way. For example, Anytime Health collects information you provide when you place an order or register to create an account on the Site. The information may include, without limitation, your first and last name, mailing address, email address, telephone and facsimile numbers, credit card information, and other personal identifying information. If you choose to share any personal information with Anytime Health, you will see that the amount and type of personal information Anytime Health requests depends on how you use the Site. It is completely optional for you to engage in these activities. Depending upon the activity, some of the information Anytime Health asks you to provide is identified as mandatory and some is voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory information with respect to a particular activity, you will not be able to engage in that activity.</p>

<p>Anytime Health receives information from the ANYTIME FITNESS® club system regarding your visits to the clubs, and displays such information in the Site for your review. At some point, you may also be able to use the Site to store more detailed personal health or fitness data, and at that time you will then be able to view and amend your own personal data as you wish. The visit and personal data may be made available to your local club management and employees, as well as to personal trainers or other contracted service providers who you have engaged through this Site or your ANYTIME FITNESS® club to provide services to you. Each of those individuals are obligated to maintain the confidentiality of your personal data, and are permitted to access and use your personal data solely for the purpose of providing or enhancing services you use through this Site or the ANYTIME FITNESS® club system.</p>

<h2>the way Anytime Health uses personal information</h2>

<p>Anytime Health may use your personal information for particular activities, including, without limitation, processing your orders; credit card processing; collections; returns management; manufacturing; storage; shipping; delivery; fulfillment; customer service; marketing and research; providing product, promotional and other information to you; and to contact you regarding administrative notices. Anytime Health may share this information with Anytime Health’s affiliates, dealers or other business partners in connection with any of the foregoing activities. Anytime Health’s affiliates, dealers or other business partners may use this information for marketing and solicitation purposes. Anytime Health must release your credit card information to credit card authorization service providers and Anytime Health’s credit card-acquiring (merchant) bank to process your payment for products or services purchased on this Site and to facilitate returns or refunds. Except as described above, Anytime Health will not give or sell your personal information to any other company for its use in marketing or solicitation.</p>

<p>Anytime Health may disclose personal information in any of the following circumstances: (1) in response to a subpoena, search warrant, court order, or other legal process or request, or as may otherwise be required by applicable law or regulation; (2) to protect and defend Anytime Health’s rights or property or those of its affiliates, dealers, business partners, or others; or (3) as Anytime Health, in its sole discretion, believes is appropriate under exigent circumstances in response to a perceived threat to the personal safety, property, or rights of any other person or organization.</p>

<p>In addition, since Anytime Health’s database is a business asset, in the event Anytime Health is reorganized or is sold to or merged with another company, Anytime Health may sell, assign, or transfer your personal information to a purchaser of all or substantially all of Anytime Health’s business assets, or to an affiliate, as applicable.</p>

<p>Anytime Health will never request your password, user name, credit card information or other personal information through e-mail. This practice, called “phishing,” is a scam designed to steal your personal information. If you receive an e-mail that looks like it is from Anytime Health asking you for your personal information, do not respond.</p>

<h2>Anytime Health’s relationship to other sites that can be accessed through this site</h2>

<p>This site may contain links to other web sites. Additionally, other web sites may contain links to this Site. Anytime Health does not review or monitor the web sites linked to this Site and is not responsible for the contents or privacy policies related to any other web sites. If you visit one of these other web sites, you may want to review the privacy policy on that web site. Where this Site contains a link to another web site owned and/or operated by Anytime Health, such web site use may be subject to different and additional Terms of Service and privacy policy terms and conditions.</p>

<h2>access and correction of your personal information</h2>

<p>Anytime Health strives to maintain the accuracy and integrity of the personal information in its databases and to keep that information up-to-date. Anytime Health encourages you to promptly update your personal information if it changes.</p>

<p>You may request access to the personal information Anytime Health has about you. As a registered user with the Site, you can access your profile information at any time.

<p>All communications must be in the English language. Anytime Health will not accept requests for copies of your personal information over the telephone, and you must make your request either in writing or through Anytime Health’s password-protected account information portal on the Site.</p>

<p>Anytime Health will respond to reasonable requests within the time limits established by applicable law or within a reasonable time if no time limit is established by applicable law. For your protection, Anytime Health may ask you for additional information to verify your identity. In most cases, Anytime Health will provide the access you request and correct or delete any inaccurate personal information you discover. Anytime Health reserves the right, however, to limit or deny your request to the extent permitted by applicable law if: (1) the disclosure may be threat to the personal safety, property, or rights of any other person or organization; (2) the disclosure may lead to a violation of applicable laws or regulations; or (3) where you have failed to provide sufficient evidence to verify your identity.</p>

<h2>security of your personal information</h2>

<p>Anytime Health takes what it believes to be reasonable precautions and has implemented managerial and technical procedures to try to protect the security of data and information, including personal information. Anytime Health strives to maintain the reliability, accuracy, completeness, and current status of personal information and to protect the privacy and security of such. Anytime Health cannot guarantee against any loss, misuse, unauthorized disclosure, alteration or destruction of data or personal information. While Anytime Health strives to protect your personal information, Anytime Health cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to or from this Site, by email or otherwise, and you provide such information at your own risk. You acknowledge that: (1) there are security and privacy limitations in computer systems and on the Internet which are beyond Anytime Health’s control; (2) the security, integrity, and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and Anytime Health through the Site, including personal information, cannot be guaranteed; and (3) any such information and data, including personal information, may be viewed or tampered with by a third party while such information or data is being used, transmitted, processed, or stored.</p>

<h2>changes to privacy policy</h2>

<p>Anytime Health may amend this Privacy Policy without prior notice. If you are a registered user, Anytime Health will make reasonable attempts to send an email about the changes to your last known email address. Any use of this Site following the date on which changes to the Privacy Policy are published on this Site shall constitute your acceptance of all such changes. Changes to the Privacy Policy will be retroactive unless you notify Anytime Health that you do not agree to the amendments in the policy and terminate your account with the Site promptly. </p>
