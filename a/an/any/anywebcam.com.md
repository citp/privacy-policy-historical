We require our members to provide an email address (account email) of a type considered valid by us. We will not provide the account email address you provide to any third party except where required by law. Our use of the account email will be limited solely to AWC-generated password confirmations, reminders or other site-related information. 

You may optionally also wish to provide an email address that enables the "blind-email" feature of our site where you can anonymously share emails from other members. From time to time, we make these optional e-mail addresses available to other reputable organizations whose products or services we think you might find interesting.

Upon request we provide site visitors with access to unique identifier information (e.g., customer number or password) that we maintain about them, contact information (e.g., name, address, phone number) that we maintain about them, a description of information that we maintain about them.
