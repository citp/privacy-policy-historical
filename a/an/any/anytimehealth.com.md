IF YOU ARE SUBMITTING PERSONAL INFORMATION OF THIRD PARTIES TO US, YOU WARRANT AND REPRESENT YOU HAVE THEIR CONSENT TO PROVIDE THEIR PERSONAL INFORMATION TO US AND WILL HOLD US HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST CLAIMS BY SUCH INDIVIDUALS RELATING TO OUR PROCESSING AND USE OF SUCH PERSONAL INFORMATION WITHIN THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY. 

## 1\. Personal Information We Collect through the Site and Apps

In general, you can browse the non-password protected portions of our Sites without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself, except for our collection of "cookies" as described in Section 3.

We may collect personal information from you on our Site and Apps or through any other digital or personal communication with you.  Information collected by us is voluntarily provided by you and may be integrated with other information you have provided to our franchisees upon signing up for a membership at an Anytime Fitness® club.

If you are an Anytime Fitness® member, you may choose to integrate information from your membership account with the Site and our Apps, but you will have the opportunity to opt-in to that integration of information across different platforms.  Our Site and the Apps may also collect general information about your technology interface or preferences (such as the type of browser used or the files requested).  Some of the information described below is mandatory for the performance of certain services, and if not entered, you may not be able to utilize or participate in some of our online services or features.

The information we may collect through your use of the Site may include, but is not limited to:

  * Where the account registration feature is available, your contact information to create an Anytime Fitness® account, such as your first name, last name, phone number, and email address;
  * Where the account registration feature is available, your profile username and password to enter the password-protected portion of the Site;
  * Your transaction history relating to the use of our clubs, purchase of certain products or other information you wish to share with us and integrate with the Site;
  * If integration with your membership is available to you, membership-related information, such as your home address, Anytime Fitness® location, key FOB number, and membership number;

  * Various account information related to your Anytime Fitness® membership to allow you to update credit card, bank account, other payment information, or any other information regarding your profile;
  * If you are a prospective franchisee, we may collect detailed information such as your first name, last name, email address, phone number, address, and general financial information such as liquidity and assets, to evaluate your qualifications for an Anytime Fitness® franchise;
  * If we offer alternative sign ins, we may collect certain sign on information you have provided to third parties, such as Facebook or Twitter, when you sign on to use our Site or Apps through these third parties **;**
  * Computer data or files, often called "cookies," which may be sent by your web browser and stored on an individual computer to allow our server to "recognize" you through the navigation of the Site and for us to credit your account for various online transactions;
  * Computer data files, often called "web beacons" that are collected from emails or links on third-party sites that allow our server to evaluate the popularity of those links or the information contained in emails or on third-party sites; and
  * Your IP address to measure our website traffic and to help provide a more personalized experience.



To fully utilize the products and services available through our Apps, you may choose to download separate applications, MapMyFitness and MyFitnessPal, owned and operated by Under Armour, Inc., and may opt to have the information entered into those applications automatically integrate with the Anytime Fitness® App.  Information entered and retained on MapMyFitness and MyFitnessPal is governed by [Under Armour's Privacy Policy](https://account.underarmour.com/privacy). We may also integrate the Apps with other applications or platforms, such as a wearable device tracking application like FitBit® or HealthKit through the Apple® Watch, or additional applications that are useful to integrate your fitness goals and activity.  If you choose to integrate information collected by a separate application or entity, once integrated with the Apps, we will also have access to and the right to use the data provided to your Anytime Fitness® profile. Like MapMyFitness or MyFitnessPal, any of these third party applications will have their own privacy policies and terms regarding the collection, use and maintenance of data entered through that third party application.

The information we may collect through your use of the Apps may depend on the version of the Apps or the country you are in, but this information may include, but is not limited to:

  * Information to register for your App account, such as first name, last name, email address and other Anytime Fitness® membership information, as well as a username and password to access the App;
  * Your activity history regarding your use of the Apps, such your visits to clubs, participation in training activities, classes or utilization of other Anytime Fitness® products or services;

  * Information provided by you when you participate in a survey or communication to you regarding your use of the Apps, or utilizing Anytime Fitness® services;

  * If we offer alternative sign ins, we may collect certain sign on information you have provided to third parties, such as Facebook or Twitter, when you sign on to use our Apps through these third parties; and
  * Computer data or files, often called "cookies," which may be sent by your mobile device to allow our server to "recognize" you through the navigation of the Apps and for us to link your activity on the Apps with your membership.



### Information obtained from your Social Media Accounts

You may choose to log into your Anytime Fitness® account on the Site or through our Apps via certain social media networking services, such as Facebook and Twitter ("Social Media Accounts"). By integrating these Social Media Accounts into your account, we are able to offer you more personalized services, but may also collect certain personal information provided in your Social Media Accounts, such as your profile information, email address, profile picture and friend list.  If you do not want us to have access to this information, do not utilize the Social Media Account sign-in feature.

Our Site and Apps are not designed for children and we do not knowingly collect information from any person under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, please do not submit any personal information to us through the Site or any Apps. If we learn we have collected or received personal information from a child under 13, we will delete that information.

## 2\. How We Use and Share Your Personal Information

We will use your personal information to provide the services we offer on the Site and through our Apps, including:

  * Processing and updating your membership information, including personal information you provide, credit card information or other electronic payment processing;

  * Contacting you regarding services you have engaged in or with, including personal training or collection efforts;

We strive to offer you an integrated, comprehensive way to manage your lifestyle, fitness goals and activity.  In order to operate the Site and Apps as one seamless experience, however, we must share your personal information with our parent company, subsidiaries, and affiliates to provide you with the integrated services offered through the Site and Apps. We may also share such information with our franchisees, or other business partners with whom we collaborate or work with to provide specific services to you or if we think the products or services they offer would be of interest to you. We may provide user information to third-party service providers or vendors for purposes of, including without limitation, initiating direct marketing programs on our behalf, data tracking, maintenance or development of our Site or Apps, development of online products and services, customer service or new product development, or other contracted promotional opportunities provided to our users. We, as well as our franchisees, vendors, or other business partners may use this information for marketing and solicitation purposes.

Your fitness club visit data (for all Anytime Fitness® clubs that you visit), App data, and personal information may be made available to those clubs' franchisees, management and employees, or other contracted service providers whom you have engaged to provide services to you. Each of those parties is obligated to maintain the confidentiality of your personal information, and is permitted to access and use your personal information solely for the purpose of providing or enhancing services you use through the Anytime Fitness® club system or Apps. Additionally, you may choose to share personal information from the Site or Apps with personal trainers or other Anytime Fitness® members to assist you in evaluating your activities and goals.

While we try to be selective in working with third parties, we are not responsible for their use of your personal information. Where payments are involved, we must release your credit card information to credit card authorization service providers and associated banks to process your payment for purchases, returns or refunds.  We may transfer to our online service providers personal information you provide to us so that these parties may store and process your personal information.

We may share aggregate information with vendors, potential advertisers, business partners, or other third parties. Aggregate information does not include personally identifiable information.

Except as described in this section, we will not give or sell your personal information to any other party for its use in marketing or solicitation.

### Additional Disclosures

We may also disclose personal information in any of the following circumstances: (1) in response to a subpoena, search warrant, court order, or other legal process or request, or as may otherwise be required by applicable law or regulation; (2) to protect and defend our rights or property or those of its franchisees, suppliers, related entities, affiliates, business partners, or others; or (3) as we, in our sole discretion, believes is appropriate under exigent circumstances in response to a perceived threat to the personal safety, property, or rights of any other person or organization.

In addition, since member information on our Site and in our Apps is a business asset, in the event we are reorganized or sold to or merged with another company, we may sell, assign, or transfer your personal information to a purchaser of all or substantially all of our business assets, or to an affiliate, as applicable.

## 3\. Our Use of Your "Cookie" Information on the Site and Apps

A "cookie" is a small data file stored on your web browser or on your mobile device that allows us to recognize your computer or mobile device when you visit the Site or Apps by associating identification numbers with other user information you have provided us.  Some cookies will remain on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device for the duration of your browser or user session, while others will remain until deleted by you. You may also be able to configure your computer or mobile device to limit the collection of these "cookies," but that limitation may also limit our ability to provide all the services or functionality of the Site or Apps.  Some third party service providers may use "flash cookies," which are saved on your computer, but cannot be rejected, disabled, turned off, opted out of, or deleted in the same way as regular cookies. To learn how to manage your flash cookie settings, visit the Flash player settings page on Adobe's website.

  * Installing and monitoring elements of the Apps for security purposes;
  * Help diagnose problems with the Sites or Apps, administer and improve the Sites or Apps, and measure the use of the Sites or Apps;
  * Identify your internet provider, page views and other information regarding utilization of the Site;
  * Gather other web analytics information related to your and other users' use and navigation of the Sites and Apps;
  * Provide you with relevant content, including advertisements and other offers from third parties;
  * Aggregate cookie data across all users to track overall visitor traffic patterns and provide this aggregated information to vendors, potential advisors, business partners, new agencies, or other parties to identify interests or plan for technical infrastructure requirements;
  * Conduct advertising based on your use of the Site or Apps, as described below; and
  * Otherwise provide improvements and enhancements to the Site.



We may also use third-party vendors, such as Google Analytics, to advertise to our users online. These third-party vendors may display Anytime Fitness® product advertisements on other websites based on your internet usage. More specifically, these vendors use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytic cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on your past visits to the Site or another site affiliated with Anytime Fitness® products or services. Any information that these third parties collect via cookies is not linked to any personally identifiable information (name, address, email address, or phone number) we collect or you provide on the website.

## 4\. Our Relationship with the Websites
