### The Information Anytime Health Collects

In general, you can browse the non-password protected portions of this Site without telling Anytime Health who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. Anytime Health, however, collects your IP address. Your IP address is a number that is used by computers connected to the Internet to identify your computer so that data (such as the Web pages you request) can be sent to you. Anytime Health uses your IP address to, among other things,: (1) help diagnose problems with Anytime Health’s server; administer the Site; measure the use of the Site; improve the content of the Site; (2) identify visitors' Internet providers, the type of web browsers used, the pages viewed, the web sites from which a visitor found this Site, the search terms and search engines used to find this Site; and (3) gather other web analytics information relating to visitors’ use and navigation of the Site. This information does not identify you personally. On occasion Anytime Health may aggregate this data with data on the pages visited by other users to track overall visitor traffic patterns and provide this aggregate information to vendors, potential advertisers, business partners, news agencies, or other parties to demonstrate the amount of interest in the Site and to help Anytime Health plan for technical infrastructure requirements.

In order to use the password-protected portions of the Site, or to purchase items from the Site, your browser must be set to accept Cookies. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that Anytime Health transfers to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable the Site to "recognize" you every time you visit and to "remember" any information you have saved, such as storage of items in your shopping cart between visits. Anytime Health does not use cookies to store any of your personal or financial information that you have on your computer.

Anytime Health recognizes that you have a choice to refuse cookies. However, should you decide not to accept cookies from the Site, you will limit the functionality Anytime Health can provide when you visit the Site. View your browser's help file for more information on cookies.

Anytime Health receives and may store information you enter on the Site or give to the Site in any other way. For example, Anytime Health collects information you provide when you place an order or register to create an account on the Site. The information may include, without limitation, your first and last name, mailing address, email address, telephone and facsimile numbers, credit card information, and other personal identifying information. If you choose to share any personal information with Anytime Health, you will see that the amount and type of personal information Anytime Health requests depends on how you use the Site. It is completely optional for you to engage in these activities. Depending upon the activity, some of the information Anytime Health asks you to provide is identified as mandatory and some is voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory information with respect to a particular activity, you will not be able to engage in that activity.

Anytime Health receives information from the ANYTIME FITNESS® club system regarding your visits to the clubs, and displays such information in the Site for your review. At some point, you may also be able to use the Site to store more detailed personal health or fitness data, and at that time you will then be able to view and amend your own personal data as you wish. The visit and personal data may be made available to your local club management and employees, as well as to personal trainers or other contracted service providers who you have engaged through this Site or your ANYTIME FITNESS® club to provide services to you. Each of those individuals are obligated to maintain the confidentiality of your personal data, and are permitted to access and use your personal data solely for the purpose of providing or enhancing services you use through this Site or the ANYTIME FITNESS® club system.

### The Way Anytime Health Uses Personal Information

Anytime Health may use your personal information for particular activities, including, without limitation, processing your orders; credit card processing; collections; returns management; manufacturing; storage; shipping; delivery; fulfillment; customer service; marketing and research; providing product, promotional and other information to you; and to contact you regarding administrative notices. Anytime Health may share this information with Anytime Health’s affiliates, dealers or other business partners in connection with any of the foregoing activities. Anytime Health’s affiliates, dealers or other business partners may use this information for marketing and solicitation purposes. Anytime Health must release your credit card information to credit card authorization service providers and Anytime Health’s credit card-acquiring (merchant) bank to process your payment for products or services purchased on this Site and to facilitate returns or refunds. Except as described above, Anytime Health will not give or sell your personal information to any other company for its use in marketing or solicitation.

Anytime Health may disclose personal information in any of the following circumstances: (1) in response to a subpoena, search warrant, court order, or other legal process or request, or as may otherwise be required by applicable law or regulation; (2) to protect and defend Anytime Health’s rights or property or those of its affiliates, dealers, business partners, or others; or (3) as Anytime Health, in its sole discretion, believes is appropriate under exigent circumstances in response to a perceived threat to the personal safety, property, or rights of any other person or organization.

In addition, since Anytime Health’s database is a business asset, in the event Anytime Health is reorganized or is sold to or merged with another company, Anytime Health may sell, assign, or transfer your personal information to a purchaser of all or substantially all of Anytime Health’s business assets, or to an affiliate, as applicable.

Anytime Health will never request your password, user name, credit card information or other personal information through e-mail. This practice, called “phishing,” is a scam designed to steal your personal information. If you receive an e-mail that looks like it is from Anytime Health asking you for your personal information, do not respond.
