However, please note that we cannot guarantee that the information will not be exposed as a result of unauthorized penetration to our servers.

  1. To the extent necessary, with regulators, to comply with all applicable laws, regulations and rules, and requests of law enforcement, regulatory and other governmental agencies or if required to do so by court order; 
  2. If, in the future, we sell or transfer some or all of our business or assets to a third party, we will (to the minimum extent required) disclose information to a potential or actual third party purchaser of our business or assets. In the event that we are acquired by or merged with a third party entity, or in the event of bankruptcy or a comparable event, we reserve the right to transfer or assign Personal Data in connection with the foregoing events. 
  3. Where you have provided your consent to us sharing the Personal Data (e.g., where you provide us with marketing consents or opt-in to optional additional services or functionality); and 
  4. Where we receive requests for information from law enforcement or regulators, we carefully validate these requests before any Personal Data is disclosed. 



## Additional information regarding transfers of personal data

Access from Israel is covered by the Adequacy Decision issued by the European Commission about Israel, where it stated that Israel is a jurisdiction that provides adequate level of data protection.

Internal transfers: Your Personal Data may be transferred within the Any.do group. We implement sufficient measures to ensure that Personal Data receives an adequate and consistent level of protection wherever it is transferred to;

External transfers: Where we transfer your Personal Data outside of Any.do, for example to third parties mentioned in Section 1 above, we will do so in accordance with the applicable law while we will obtain contractual commitments from them to protect your Personal Data. To the extent that you are protected under the GDPR, we bring to your attention that some of these assurances are well recognized certification schemes like the EU - US Privacy Shield for the protection of Personal Data transferred from within the EU to the United States. In addition, we bring to your attention that Israel is a country declared as offering adequate level of data protection (see here: <https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/adequacy-protection-personal-data-non-eu-countries_en>). 

Where we receive requests for Personal Data from law enforcement or regulators, we carefully validate these requests before any Personal Data is disclosed.
