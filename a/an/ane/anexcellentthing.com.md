# Privacy | An Excellent Thing

Our privacy policy is simple…

We collect information provided by visitors to our site when they request specific information or ask to join our mailing list.  The information is used for the purposes associated with our website or the products and opportunities advertised where information request forms are provided.

We do not use information other than for the purposes of providing information to visitors for their specific requests that they initiate on our domain.

We do not sell, lease, loan or give away personal information to anyone.  Not a soul.

That’s it – and we will appreciate your feedback if you feel we can make our policy better.﻿
