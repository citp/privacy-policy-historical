### AngryApe Privacy Statement

Last updated 12th February 2004.

We take your privacy very seriously, and we are committed to maintaining the trust of our users. We gather certain types of information from our users, and this privacy statement will help you understand what types of information we collect, and how we use it.

### The information we collect

We automatically receive and record information from our servers and from your Web browser, including your IP address, the time of your visit to pages on this site, and information about pages you visited. Unless you have registered for one of our products or services, the information we gather through the use of tracking technologies cannot be matched with any personally identifiable information about you unless you have specifically given us personally identifiable information, in which case we use the information to enhance your services in the ways described below.

We collect personally identifiable information when you provide it to us, for example when you subscribe to newsletters, or register for certain services such as message boards.

### Cookies

Internet browsers allow a feature called ‘cookies’, which store a small amount of data on your computer about your visit to this site. We may use cookies to record user traffic statistics, membership details, and to enhance your visit to this site. In addition, third party advertisements and features may use cookies within this site. We do not track your activity on any other part of the web outside of this website. You may refuse this site to use cookies by adjusting the settings in your Web browser. You are still able to visit this site without allowing cookies, however certain features may become unavailable.

### Sharing information

We may disclose certain information to third parties, such as advertisers for marketing, promotional and other purposes. We do not disclose any information that could be used to identify you personally. In the event that personally identifiable material is requested from us by a law-enforcement agency or court of law then we will disclose such information.

### Your options

Users who do not wish to provide any information requested from registration processes do not need to register, however the specific content and features that use that registration information may not be available to you. Most of this site is still available without the use of registration. Users are able to remove themselves from mailing lists/newsletters at any time.

### Changes to this Privacy Statement

### More information

AngryApe cannot guarantee that any information you provide to us is completely safe, although we take reasonable care to prevent any problems. There may be occasions when technical problems beyond our control make information available to unauthorised persons.
