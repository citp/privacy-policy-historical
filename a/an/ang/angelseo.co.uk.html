 			<p><strong>Our privacy policy below explains how we  will collect and use the information you give us. We may vary this policy from  time to time and the current version will be that published on this site. The  word 'we' refers to Angel, unless otherwise indicated. </strong></p>
<h3>Collecting your  information</h3>
<p>From time to time, you will be asked to  submit personal information about yourself (e.g. name and email address etc) in  order to receive or use services on our website(s). This may happen, for  example, when you make a purchase from us, when you subscribe to a newsletter,  when you enter a competition or when you register for personalised.</p>
          <p> We will also need personal information in  order to supply our products and services to you, and sometimes to help us  identify you when you contact us. When we collect this information we will take  reasonable measures to ensure that it is transmitted to us securely. We will  only collect payment information over a secure connection.</p>
<p> If you communicate with us by email over the  Internet you should be aware that the nature of the Internet is such that  unencrypted communication may not be secure and may pass through several  different countries on route to us. Please do not email us with confidential or  sensitive information such as your credit card details. We cannot accept  responsibility for unauthorised access to your information that is outside our  control.</p>
<p> We may combine this information with other  information that we may hold about you if you are an existing customer, or have  made enquiries of us before.</p>
<p> We will act in accordance with current  legislation and we will maintain a link to our privacy policy, which includes  our Data Protection Notice, in a prominent place on our website.</p>
          <h3>Data Protection Notice</h3>
<p>Unlike many reputable (and many more not so  reputable) companies who trade on the Internet, we will <strong><u>NEVER</u></strong> share the information you  provide, together with other information, with any other company.</p>
          <p> We may use the information you provide for  administration, marketing, customer services and profiling your purchasing  preferences. However, we promise not to send you more than four marketing  communications per month, and we promise to give you the ability to stop  receiving marketing communications at any time.</p>
          <p> For information about the way we use cookies  and other web tracking devices please refer to the sections below in this  privacy policy.</p>
          <p> If you give us information about another  person, in doing so you confirm that they have given you permission to provide  it to us and for us to be able to process their personal data (including  sensitive personal data) and also that you have told them who we are and what  we will use their data for, as set out in this notice.</p>
          <p> You have the right to ask for a copy of your  information (for which we reserve the right to charge a small fee) and to  correct any inaccuracies.</p>
<p> For our joint protection and training  purposes, telephone calls may be recorded and/or monitored.</p>
          <h3>Informing you about  products and services</h3>
          <p>We offer search engine optimisation, online  marketing and other web services. By providing us with your contact details,  you will be indicating to us your consent to us contacting you by mail,  telephone, fax, email, and SMS/MMS to let you know about any goods, services or  promotions of our own which may be of interest to you unless you indicate an  objection to receiving such messages.</p>
<p> As stated in our Data Protection Notice, we  will never send you more than four marketing communications per month (in  practice, we rarely send out more than one marketing communication per month)  and we will always give you the opportunity of opting out of such marketing  communications.</p>
          <h3>Sensitive data</h3>
          <p>You may be asked on the telephone to give  your credit or debit card details for the purpose of paying for a service you  have requested from us. You will always have the option to transfer the funds  yourself into our secure bank account.</p>
<p> We never store customers' sensitive data -  for example, credit or debit card details.</p>
          <h4>How we collect information  about your visits to our websites</h4>
<p>When you visit our web pages, we may check  your IP address to determine your location. This helps us give you content  relevant to where you are located.</p>
          <p> We may put something called a `cookie' on  your computer. Thousands of reputable websites use cookies and you should not  be alarmed by this. They help us track how often you visit the website. They  also help us confirm your identity when you log into our website, and they help  us determine whether you are logged in or logged out.</p>
<p> Some of our websites use analytics software  which records non-personal statistical information about what you do on the  website. For example: the duration of time a page was viewed, common paths  taken through the site, data on screen settings and other general information.  None of this information is person-specific.</p>
          <h4>What will we do with your  personal information?</h4>
          <p>We will only use your information for the  purposes that you would reasonably anticipate or that we state when we collect  it and, where necessary, for which you have given us your consent. We will not  contact you, or pass your information to any other person or company, ever.</p>
<p> We are committed to treating your personal  data with due care and in accordance with the data protection principles. In  addition, you will see that our privacy policy is far more protective than many  major companies, who often reserve the right to pass your details to third  parties for marketing.</p>
          <h4>How to access your  personal information</h4>
<p>If you would like to see a copy of the  information that we hold for you, please email our team, and mark your email  for the attention of the legal department. We reserve the right to ask you to  provide certain information to help us confirm your identity.</p>
          <p> We reserve the right to charge a small fee  for the provision of this information, although we will probably not do so.</p>
<p> If you believe that any of the data we hold  about you is incorrect or being misused or want further information you may  contactus.</p>
          <h4>Users aged 16 years and  under</h4>
          <p>If you are 16 or under you must have  permission from a parent or guardian before you give us personal information.  If we find that we have received information from you without the appropriate  consent, we reserve the right to cancel all transactions and services and  remove all personal data that you have supplied. You will be able to re-submit  the information when you have the required permission.</p>
<h4>What is a cookie?</h4>
<p>Cookies are text files that identify your  computer (through what is known as an IP address) to our server. </p>
          <p> You generally have the opportunity to set  your computer to accept all cookies, to notify you when a cookie is issued, or  not to receive cookies at any time. You can do this through your Internet  browser. With most browsers, this facility can be reached via the `tools' (e.g.  Internet Explorer), or `edit', or 'task' (e.g. Netscape) menu. If you have any  problems finding this area, the `help' function within your browser will be  able to provide assistance.</p>
<p> If you refuse a cookie it may prevent the  proper operation of the site or even prevent your access to certain areas</p>
          <h4>Links to other websites</h4>
<p>Our website may contain links to other sites  outside the group. Angel is not responsible for the privacy and security of  these sites unless they belong to Angel. This privacy policy applies only to AngelSEO.co.uk.</p>
          <p> If you are unsure whether a website belongs  to Angel or not, just email us or give us a call.</p>
          <p> If you have any more questions about the way  we handle data, please call or email us.</p>
