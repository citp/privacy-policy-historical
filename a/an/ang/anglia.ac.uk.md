#### How we store your information

Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password that enables you to access certain parts of the Site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. You must not share passwords with anyone.

Although we maintain a number of safeguards, fraudulent email requests are occasionally delivered to staff and students. We will **never** ask for your username or password by email. Any message that does so should be treated as a potential breach of security, no matter how legitimate it may appear. 

If you are in any doubt, **do nothing** until you have spoken to a member of the IT Services Customer Support Team.

Unfortunately the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to the Site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access. 

All payment details which are entered through this payment gateway are encrypted when the student, or third party making payment, enters them. The site is secure using 128 bit encryption to offer secure communications by encrypting all data to and from the site.

The information, images and documents on the Anglia Ruskin website are copyright of Anglia Ruskin University unless otherwise stated. It is forbidden to reproduce any information without prior consent from Anglia Ruskin University.

#### Web statistics

We monitor website traffic to assist in the continuous improvement and development of the site, but do this only by monitoring IP addresses that are not linked in any way to any personal data, retaining the anonymity of our visitors.

#### Image Capture

Anglia Ruskin University produces a range of published materials and online information. We often take photographic/video images of subjects in order to enhance and illustrate our materials and make them more motivating and inspiring to our audiences.

For children under 16 years of age, full parental/guardian consent is required and Anglia Ruskin University has an Image Consent Form which should be completed. This is available from the University Records Manager, Jackie Barlow at [jackie.barlow@anglia.ac.uk](mailto:jackie.barlow@anglia.ac.uk). For children between 12 and 16 years of age, who have a sufficient understanding of the consent process and its implications for them, the child should be involved in completing the form and their consent should be sought. The child may also sign the form.

As it is mandatory for Anglia Ruskin University to obtain permission prior to each photographic/video session, it is necessary for each child to have a copy of this form signed by the parent/guardian prior to the relevant photographic/video session.

Anglia Ruskin University acknowledges its responsibilities in capturing images by photography or other means under the provisions of the following legislation;

**The Children and Young Persons Act 1963:** Anglia Ruskin University undertakes to seek a licence where necessary from the appropriate local authority for any performance activity in which children are taking part and which may be recorded with a view to being broadcast, published or shown to the public.

**The Protection of Children Act 1978:** Anglia Ruskin University recognises that it is a criminal offence to take, permit to be taken, distribute, have in one's possession or publish indecent photographs (including films and other imagery) of children.

**The Human Rights Act 1998:** Anglia Ruskin University recognises an individual's rights to privacy as protected by this Act.

**The Data Protection Act 1998:** Anglia Ruskin University undertakes to inform all those whose images may be recorded (or their parents/guardians if under 18 years of age) of the purposes for which the images may be used by Anglia Ruskin University.

In this context Anglia Ruskin University informs all persons taking part in university activities that they may be photographed, filmed, videoed or otherwise captured in image form. Where possible and practical to do so, Anglia Ruskin University seeks written consent to image capture. Where this is not possible for practical reasons, unless express objections are received, individuals attending an event at Anglia Ruskin University are deemed to have given their consent by attending or remaining at the event. Any queries or complaints should be raised with the event host in the first instance.

#### Changes to this Privacy Policy

Anglia Ruskin University may from time to time change this Privacy Policy or change, modify or withdraw access to this Site at any time with or without notice. However if this Privacy Policy is changed in a material, adverse way, Anglia Ruskin University will post a notice advising of such change at the beginning of this policy. We recommend that you revisit this Privacy Policy from time to time to learn of any such changes to this Privacy Policy.
