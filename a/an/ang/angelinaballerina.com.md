**USERS UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE**

HIT Entertainment Limited is fully committed to supporting and complying with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998. Children can surf our Web Sites, view content, and download materials without HIT Entertainment Limited collecting PII. Our Web Sites may provide children the opportunity to send electronic postcards to family or friends. To send electronic postcards, we may ask for a first name, but we do not require children under the age of 13 to submit PII about themselves in order to send an electronic postcard. However, we do ask them to submit the email address of the recipient of such electronic postcards. All information collected from electronic postcards is used only to send the requested electronic postcard and is deleted once the electronic postcard is sent. We may also collect an email address and name from a child for the sole purpose of responding directly to a specific online request from the child. As soon as the response is sent to the child, all information collected from such request will be deleted.

**WHEN PII AND NON-PII MAY BE REQUESTED**

Registration or input of PII may be requested for participation in activities such as registrations, sweepstakes, contests, marketing and promotional activities, surveys, email newsletters, e-commerce or sending questions/comments to us. We will not require anyone to disclose more PII than we deem reasonably necessary to participate in the activity, fulfill your request or achieve our legitimate business objectives. However, if PII is requested for participation in an activity, you cannot participate without disclosing such PII. 

Mailing List/Newsletter - A child can sign up to receive our newsletter. A parent must complete the Parental Consent Form and fax or post his/her consent to us, before this commences. The child's name and e-mail address is required for the monthly newsletter to be mailed. At any time, the parent/child can ask to unsubscribe their child from the newsletter. 

Competitions - To enter children are required to email us the answer to a question, we ask for their name and e-mail address. The "winner" is notified by e-mail within [4] weeks, requesting the postal address of their parent or guardian so that the prizes can be mailed. The e-mail or postal address is then deleted. If you win a competition we shall publish your name (but not your e-mail or postal address) on our site. The e-mail addresses of those not selected are immediately deleted after the winning name has been chosen. 

Quizzes - From time to time we may feature quizzes on our website for a child to compete in and we may publish the child's scores on our global quiz scoreboard together with your name and the country you live in.

For your convenience, the following is a list of those areas, the personal information we request and the reasons why:- 

From time to time, we may also ask you to provide us with Non-PII. We may use this information for internal purposes or for sharing with third parties for any lawful purpose, without your permission. No third party will know who you are because of the use of your Non-PII. 

We will not knowingly ask for, or accept, PII from persons under the age of 13. Before accepting PII from anyone, we ask a question designed to determine that person's age. If we determine that the person may be under the age of 13 we will not knowingly accept that person's PII at that activity or registration and that person will be restricted from participating in such web page activities at that time. If we have knowledge that a child under 13 has provided us with PII, we will delete such information from our records.

Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser. For additional information on finding and controlling your cookies, please see the provisions at the end of this Privacy Policy entitled "HOW TO FIND AND CONTROL YOUR COOKIES."

Web beacons are typically very small, 1 by 1 pixel size, banner like files, but their presence can be easily seen within Internet Explorer by clicking on "View" and then on "Source." Our Web beacons do not collect, gather, monitor or share any personal information about visitors to our Web Sites, they are just the technique we use to compile our anonymous, aggregated statistics about web site usage.

COMPUTER PROFILES

We also record number of visits, paths taken and time spent on Web Sites and pages. None of this information is personally identifiable and we only share this information in the aggregate, reflecting overall web site or Internet usage trends.

Web pages and/or micro web sites may be included within our Web Sites and may be co-branded with third party names, logos and/or properties and are operated and maintained by us.
