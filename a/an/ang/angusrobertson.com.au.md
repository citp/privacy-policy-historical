# Privacy policy | Angus & Robertson

**Background**  
Pearson Australia Group purchased Angus & Robertson Online which now operates as an online retail business. 

As a result of its purchase of Angus & Robertson, Pearson Australia Group collected and held the personal information of Angus & Robertson customers and visitors to what is now the Angus & Robertson website. This information includes the customer lists contained in databases. These databases contain details of loyalty program members, gift card recipients and individuals who have signed up to marketing mail-outs, Angus & Robertson's email program and other promotional advertisements from Angus & Robertson.

On 1 July 2013 Penguin and Random House officially united to create Penguin Random House, the world’s first truly global trade book publisher. As a result Penguin Australia Pty Ltd became a local subsidiary, and Angus & Robertson became a division of Penguin Australia Pty Ltd. Any personal information that Penguin Australia Pty Ltd now holds as a result the purchase of Angus & Robertson, or that it will collect through the Angus & Robertson site in the future, will be used, disclosed, managed and stored in accordance with Penguin Australia Pty Ltd’s privacy policy and you consent to Penguin Australia Pty Ltd handling your information as provided for in this policy.
