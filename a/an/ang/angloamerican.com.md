## IP ADDRESSES, COOKIES AND GIFS

We may collect information about your computer, including where available your IP address, operating system and browser type, for system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers. This is statistical data about our users' browsing actions and patterns, and does not show personal details that identify you.

For the same reason, we may obtain information about your general internet usage by using a cookie file which is stored on the hard drive of your computer. Cookies are small pieces of information sent by a web server to a web browser which allow the web server to recognise the web browser. They help us to improve our Site and to deliver a better and more personalised service. They enable us:

  * To estimate our audience size and usage pattern.
  * To store information about your preferences, and so allow us to customise our Site according to your individual interests.
  * To speed up your searches.
  * To recognise you when you return to our Site.



You can control how your browser handles cookies received from websites. You can choose to refuse all cookies, or to be prompted before a cookie is saved to your hard drive, or to only accept cookies from certain websites that you designate. Information on deleting or controlling cookies is available at [www.AboutCookies.org](http://www.aboutcookies.org/ "Opens in a new window"). By refusing to accept cookies from us, you may not be able to use some of the features and functionality available on our Site.

We may use "clear GIFs” (aka "Web beacons” or "pixel tags”) or similar technologies, in our Site and/or in our communications with you to enable us to know whether you have visited a web page or received a message. A clear GIF is typically a one-pixel, transparent image (although it can be a visible image as well), located on a web page or in an e-mail that communicates to us whether you viewed an email that we sent you or visited a certain page on our Site. A clear GIF may enable us to relate your viewing or receipt of a web page or message to other information we hold about you.

Our server automatically collects data about your server’s internet address when you visit us. This information, known as an Internet Protocol address, or IP Address, is a number that’s automatically assigned to your computer by your internet service provider whenever you’re on the internet. When you request pages from our Site, our servers may log your IP Address and sometimes your domain name. Our server may also record the referring page that linked you to us (e.g., another website or a search engine); the pages you visit on our Site; the website you visit after our Site; the ads you see and/or click on; other information about the type of web browser, computer, platform, related software and settings you are using; any search terms you have entered on our Site or a referral site; and other web usage activity and data logged by our web servers. We use this information for internal system administration, to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Site. Such information may also be used to gather broad demographic information, such as country of origin and internet service provider. Any or all of activities with regard to our Site usage information may be performed on our behalf by our services providers.

## WHERE WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL DATA

The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA") and your country for the purposes outlined in this Privacy and Cookie Policy. It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA and your country who work for us or for one of our service providers for the purposes outlined in this Privacy and Cookie Policy.

More specifically, we may transfer your data to: 

  * [your local Anglo American entity for the purpose of managing our and their relationship with you and for the purposes outline in this Privacy and Cookie Policy]



By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing of your personal data worldwide on our corporate systems, to other affiliates within the Anglo American group, and/or agents, subcontractors or service providers of the Anglo American group for the abovementioned purposes. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy and Cookie Policy.

## SECURITY

Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our Site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.

While we have implemented reasonable technical and organisational precautions to protect the security and integrity of personal data provided to our Site, due to the inherent nature of the internet as an open global communications vehicle, we cannot guarantee that information, during transmission through the internet or while stored on our system or otherwise in our care, will be absolutely safe from intrusion by others, such as hackers. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your Personal Data.

You agree to (a) immediately notify us of any unauthorised use of your password or account or any other breach of security, and (b) ensure that you exit from your account at the end of each session. It is your responsibility to control the dissemination and use of your password, control access to and use of your account, and notify us when you desire to cancel your account on this Site. We are not responsible or liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this provision.

We will not be liable for disclosure of your information due to errors or unauthorised acts of third parties during or after transmission.

We recommend that you change your password every three months. If you are using a public computer (e.g. at a library), or a shared computer, we urge you to log out of your account and our Site altogether, and quit the browser application before you leave the computer. This will help prevent others from accessing your account and any personal information.

In the unlikely event that we believe that the security of your personal information in our possession or control may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you of that development. If a notification is appropriate, we would endeavour to do so as promptly as possible under the circumstances, and, to the extent we have your e-mail address, we may notify you by e-mail. You hereby consent to our use of e-mail as a means of such notification.

## USES MADE OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA

  * To send you notices (for example, in the form of e-mails, SMS, mailings, and the like), and otherwise correspond with you, about products, services, companies and events, sponsored by us and others, that We think might interest you, where you have consented to be contacted for such purposes.



Your personal information may be retained, processed and used (by us and our service providers) for as long as necessary and in locations that we consider appropriate for the purposes identified in this Privacy Policy.
