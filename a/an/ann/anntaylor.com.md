Your cookie also allows us to recognize you when you return to our site and provides you with access to your account information. Cookies do not contain any personally identifiable information, such as your name, address or any financial information on your computer.

**How does ANNTAYLOR.COM make sure my order information is secure?**  
The safety of your credit card information is important to us, and Ann Taylor has taken measures to protect the security of your online order information. 

Ann Taylor uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to keep your online order information safe. SSL technology encrypts your credit card number, order information and personal information before it is transmitted to protect it from being decoded by anyone other than Ann Taylor. Our site also displays the VeriSign Secure Site Seal, which indicates that the site has been authenticated by VeriSign and that confidential transactions with the site are secured by SSL encryption. 

Once you enter the checkout page, your computer will begin communicating with our server in secure mode. You can determine the security of your connection by looking at the bottom of your Internet browser window after you have accessed our website-SSL technology is active if there is a solid key or a closed lock. You can also double-check by looking at the URL line of your browser. When accessing a secure server, the first characters of the site address will change from "http" to "https." 

Some versions of browsers and some firewalls don't permit communication through secure servers like the ones we use to process orders at ANNTAYLOR.COM. If you cannot access the secure server for any reason, you can place your order by calling 1-800-DIAL-ANN. 

While we implement the above and other security measures to protect your information, please note that no data transmitted over the Internet or any other public network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. 

**Does ANNTAYLOR.COM link to other sites?**   
The ANNTAYLOR.COM website may include links to other websites that are not under our control. These other websites have their own policies regarding privacy that you should review. Ann Taylor has no responsibility for these linked websites. 

**How does ANNTAYLOR.COM protect children's privacy?**   
Ann Taylor is concerned about the privacy of young children and we do not knowingly collect any personal information from a child under 13 years of age. Ann Taylor does not sell products for purchase by children.
