# Annual Reviews

Annual Reviews is firmly committed to protecting the privacy of personal information provided by those visiting and interacting with our organization online. The following discloses our policies for information gathering and dissemination on this Web site.

Web site Usage Information  
We may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and administer our Web site. We use cookies and we associate Institutional IP addresses with their institutions only to track usage of the Annual Reviews site. We also track the quantity of traffic to the various areas of our site. Annual Reviews does not track what individual users read but rather how often each page is visited. This helps us to maintain a useful and informative Web site.

**No Ad Servers:** We have no relationships with any ad server companies.

The Information We Collect  
Our order forms ask users to give us contact information that includes name, email address, email preferences to receive or not recieve email, email format preference (HTML vs. Text), postal address, phone numbers, and facts about their order. In some cases, we request sensitive information from our visitors, such as credit card numbers during the placement of orders.

We use customer contact information from these order forms to send the user order confirmation via email, follow-up information, as well as information about Annual Reviews and our scientific and product offerings. **We never sell, share, or trade any of our customer information with other companies**.

Persons who supply us with their telephone numbers when ordering may receive calls from us regarding the orders they have placed, and associated product offerings.

Links  
This site contains links to the web sites of other organizations. Annual Reviews is not responsible for the privacy practices or the changing content of such web sites. Please review the privacy policies of these sites as you are reviewing ours here.

Security Technology  
Annual Reviews has made a substantial investment in the latest server, database, backup and firewall technologies to protect our information assets. We always use industry-standard encryption technologies when exchanging data with our users. All data resides in a tightly controlled, secure data center. We have appropriate security measures in place in our physical facilities to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of information that we have collected from you via the web. We will maintain safeguards to protect the security of the servers handling your personal information.

Annual Reviews Email Practices  
When you subscribe to any Annual Reviews Email Announcement list, purchase Annual Reviews' publications and/or products, submit your information at an Annual Reviews trade show/event booth, or register on our web site, we will use the email address (and format preference if applicable) you provide to send you information about our company or product offerings.

If/when Annual Reviews changes its policies on the use of personal information, or we begin to use customer information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our privacy notice, we will announce the revision on our homepage and state our revised policies here.

If you are concerned about how your information is used, you should check back at our web site periodically.
