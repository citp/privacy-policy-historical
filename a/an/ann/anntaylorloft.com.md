If you are visiting any of our Sites through a link from another website or search engine, information about your visit to our Sites may be collected by the provider of the other website or search engine. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of these other websites or search engines.

We may also enable you to navigate to other sites and services from our Sites, and we may display content from these other sites and services. We do this for your convenience. We don't endorse or generally have any affiliation with these other sites and services. And we don't control and aren't responsible for their web practices. Whether their content appears within our web environment (like a map frame), or you leave our Sites to view the content on another website, those entities' terms, conditions, and privacy policies govern your online experience unless there's a conspicuously posted statement by us that says otherwise. Please view their terms of service and privacy policies if you have any question about their practices.

Here are some examples of situations where information may be collected by other sites and services:

  * **Sweepstakes, Contests, and Survey Sites**. We may rely on the expertise of other entities to run sweepstakes, contests, and surveys. In these cases, the other entity's privacy policy may apply to any personal information you provide in connection with the event. Please take note of who's running the event in question, and the terms, conditions, and policies that apply.
  * **Social Networking or Other User-Generated-Content Sites**. We may facilitate easy access to social networking sites and other sites that host user-generated content.

This location information is collected in a form that does not contain your contact information and may be used by ANN to provide and improve location-based products and services (including, for example, helping us offer you the location of ANN stores nearby). Our applications may be designed to collect information even if you are not logged into the mobile ANN applications or the Sites. Your device may offer privacy and security settings that allow you to manage how your device and browser share location information with others, as well as how your browser handles cookies and related technologies.

### What are cookies? Do the Sites use cookies or other technologies? __

**Cookies**. Cookies are a browser feature that assign a unique identification to your computer or mobile device. Cookies are typically stored on your mobile device or computer's hard drive and are used by our Sites to help us recognize your browser as a previous visitor, personalize your shopping experience and save and remember any preferences or other actions that may have been set while your browser was visiting our Sites. For example, if you place items in your online shopping cart, we may use cookies to keep those items in your cart for your future access. We may also use technologies, such as cookies, to provide you with a more personalized online display advertising tailored to your interests. To opt out of Loft cookies used for this online advertising, [click here](http://dtmc.loft.com/adinfo/choice/prod/?type=fpc&cid=2412&cname=LOFT&cmagic=186fb2&clogo=Loft.png&loc=us&lang=en-us).

You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your Internet or mobile browser. In order to disable cookies, please consult your browser's help section for instructions. If you turn off cookies, however, you may not be able to use some of the features of our Sites, and you will not be able to purchase from our Sites, as we will not be able to track your online order. You may still place an order by calling us at 1-800-DIAL-ANN or 1-888-LOFT-444.

### Other technologies. __

We may use "pixel tags" (also called web beacons, web bugs or clear gifs), which are tiny graphic images that are placed in the code on our Sites and in our emails. Pixel tags help us analyze our customers' online behavior and measure the effectiveness of our Sites and our advertising. We work with service providers that help us track, collect and analyze this information. We use pixel tags, either alone or in conjunction with cookies, to collect information about your visit, including the pages you view, the features you use, the links you click, and other actions you take in connection with the Sites. This information may include your mobile device or computer's IP address, your browser type, your operating system, date and time information, and other technical information about your computer or mobile device. We may also track certain information about the identity of the website you visited immediately before coming to our Sites as well as the identity of the websites you visit after you leave our Sites.

We may also use Local Shared Objects (sometimes referred to as "flash cookies"), browser web storage (including HTML5) and application data caches. These are used to enhance your user experience, for example, by storing your user preferences and settings, and in connection with animated content on our Sites. These mechanisms operate similarly to browser cookies, but can store data more complex than simple text. To find out more about flash cookies or how to disable them, please click here [http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/526/52697ee8.html.](http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/526/52697ee8.html)

Some web browsers may transmit "do not track" signals to the websites and other online services with which the browser communicates. There is no standard that governs what, if anything, websites should do when they receive these signals. We currently do not take action in response to these signals. If and when a standard for responding is established, we may revisit this policy on responding to these signals.

By visiting our Sites, you consent to our placement of cookies, pixel tags, Local Shared Objects and other similar technologies on your computer and/or mobile device.

**Service providers' use of cookies and other technologies.** ANN also may allow service providers to collect information about your online activities through cookies and other technologies so that these entities can provide services to us. These and other third parties may collect or receive information about your use of our services, including through the use of cookies, web beacons and other technologies, and this information may be collected over time and combined with information collected on different websites and online services. These service providers may use information about your activities on our Sites and other websites and combine that information with other information (such as an email address) to serve advertisements on our behalf across the Internet. Some of these entities may be participants in the Network Advertising Initiative and/or the Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. Both of these programs allow users to opt out of ad targeting from participating companies. To learn more, please click here <http://www.networkadvertising.org/> or here <http://www.aboutads.info/>. To opt out, please click here <http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp> or <http://www.aboutads.info/choices/>.

### How does ANN protect the security of my order information? __

The safety of your credit card information is important to us, and ANN has taken measures to help protect the security of your online order information.

ANN uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to help keep your online order information safe. SSL technology encrypts your credit card number, order information and personal information before it is transmitted to help protect it from being decoded by anyone other than ANN. Our Sites also display the VeriSign Secure Site Seal, which indicates that our Sites have been authenticated by VeriSign and that we use SSL encryption to transmit confidential information during sales transactions.

Specifically, once you enter the checkout page, your computer will begin communicating with our server using SSL encryption. You can determine the security of your connection by looking at the bottom of your Internet browser window after you have accessed our Sites. SSL technology is active if there is a solid key or a closed lock. You can also double-check by looking at the URL line of your browser. When accessing a security-enhanced server, the first characters of the site address will change from "http" to "https".

Some versions of browsers and some firewalls don't permit communication through security-enhanced servers like the ones we use to process orders on our Sites. If you cannot access the security-enhanced server for any reason, you can place your order by calling 1-800-DIAL-ANN or 1-888-LOFT-444.

While we implement SSL technology and other security measures to protect your information, please note that no data transmitted over the Internet or any other public network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

### What if I am accessing the Sites from outside the United States? __

If you are visiting our Sites from a location outside of the United States, you may be connected to servers located within the United States or in other countries whose data protection laws may not be equivalent to the laws in your country of residence. By providing your information to us, you are consenting to the transfer of your personal information to facilities located outside of your country of residence, and understand that your information will be stored and processed in accordance with U.S. law.

### What happens to my personal information when I place an order from outside the United States? __

ANN offers customers the ability to ship orders internationally. In these cases, ANN partners with Borderfree, ("Borderfree"), a U.S.-based service provider that we have contracted with to facilitate the sale and fulfillment of international online purchases. Borderfree will process your information in accordance with its privacy policy. To learn more about Borderfree's privacy policy, please visit [www.Borderfree.com/privacy.](http://www.borderfree.com/privacy)

When we identify that your order is one that will be shipped internationally, we work with Borderfree to complete your order. On the checkout page, you will be required to submit credit card and contact information to Borderfree to complete your order. Borderfree will be solely responsible for processing your financial transaction and we will not have access to your credit card information. Upon completion of your order, Borderfree will notify us of the approval of your order, and we will then ship approved orders to Borderfree. Simultaneously, Borderfree will purchase the product from us, which allows them to take title to the product(s), bill your credit card, collect and remit any duties and taxes to the appropriate taxing authority and arrange for the product to be delivered to you. In this process, Borderfree makes the sale to you as the merchant of record. When ordering a product, you will be presented with Borderfree's terms and conditions and privacy policy to which you must agree in order to complete your transaction.

Once you place your order, you will be prompted to confirm whether you would like to receive marketing and other communications from ANN brands. If you agree that Borderfree may share your data with ANN, we will protect and use your information in order to supply you with such communications and as otherwise set forth in our Privacy Policy.

### What is "phishing"? __

"Phishing" is a scam designed to steal your personal information. If you receive an email that looks like it is from us asking you for your personal information, do not respond. We will never request your password, user name, credit card information or other personal information through email.

### How does ANN protect children's privacy? __

ANN is concerned about the privacy of young children and our Sites do not knowingly collect any personal information from a child under 13 years of age.

### What are my California privacy rights? __

Residents of the State of California may request a list of all third parties to which ANN has disclosed personal information during the preceding year for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. If you are a California resident and want a list, you should send a request to [clientservices@anninc.com](mailto:clientservices@anninc.com) or contact us at:  
ANN CLIENT SERVICES ATTN: Senior Director, Client Contact, 4079 Executive Parkway, 3rd Floor, Westerville, Ohio 43081

You need to provide the statement "Your California Privacy Rights" in the subject field of your e-mail or on the envelope or post card and in the actual request. For all requests, please include your name, street address, city, state, and zip code. We will not accept requests via the telephone or by facsimile. We are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent properly, or that do not have complete information.

### What if there are changes to this Privacy Policy or if I have other questions? __

We may update the Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy or our information practices change in the future, we will notify you by posting the changes on our Sites. You may wish to check this section from time to time, because by visiting our Sites, you agree to accept these changes to the Privacy Policy. Except as otherwise mentioned herein, this Privacy Policy only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you on our Sites. 

If you have any questions about our Privacy Policy, please contact us:  
ANN CLIENT SERVICES ATTN: Senior Director, Client Contact, 4079 Executive Parkway, 3rd Floor

### What are cookies? Do the Sites use cookies or other technologies? __

**_Cookies_**. Cookies are a browser feature that assign a unique identification to your computer or mobile device. Cookies are typically stored on your mobile device or computer's hard drive and are used by our Sites to help us recognize your browser as a previous visitor, personalize your shopping experience and save and remember any preferences or other actions that may have been set while your browser was visiting our Sites. For example, if you place items in your online shopping cart, we may use technologies, such as our own cookies to provide you with personalized online display advertising tailored to your interests. To opt out of Loft cookies used for this online advertising, [click here](http://dtmc.loft.com/adinfo/choice/prod/?type=fpc&cid=2412&cname=LOFT&cmagic=186fb2&clogo=2412.png&loc=us&lang=en-us).

You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your Internet or mobile browser. In order to disable cookies, please consult your browser's help section for instructions. If you turn off cookies, however, you may not be able to use some of the features of our Sites, and you will not be able to purchase from our Sites, as we will not be able to track your online order. You may still place an order by calling us at 1-800-DIAL-ANN or 1-888-LOFT-444.

**_Other technologies_**. We may use "pixel tags" (also called web beacons, web bugs or clear gifs), which are tiny graphic images that are placed in the code on our Sites and in our emails. Pixel tags help us analyze our customers' online behavior and measure the effectiveness of our Sites and our advertising. We work with service providers that help us track, collect and analyze this information. We use pixel tags, either alone or in conjunction with cookies, to collect information about your visit, including the pages you view, the features you use, the links you click, and other actions you take in connection with the Sites. This information may include your mobile device or computer's IP address, your browser type, your operating system, date and time information, and other technical information about your computer or mobile device. We may also track certain information about the identity of the website you visited immediately before coming to our Sites as well as the identity of the websites you visit after you leave our Sites.

We may also use Local Shared Objects (sometimes referred to as "flash cookies"), browser web storage (including HTML5) and application data caches. These may be used to enhance your user experience, for example, by storing your user preferences and settings, and in connection with animated content on our Sites. These mechanisms operate similarly to browser cookies, but can store data more complex than simple text. To find out more about flash cookies or how to disable them, please click here <http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/526/52697ee8.html>.

By visiting our Sites, you consent to our placement of cookies, pixel tags, Local Shared Objects and other similar technologies on your computer and/or mobile device.

**_Service providers' use of cookies and other technologies_**. ANN also may allow service providers to collect information about your online activities through cookies and other technologies so that these entities can provide services to us. These service providers may use information about your activities on our Sites and other websites and combine that information with other information (such as an email address) to serve advertisements on our behalf across the Internet. Some of these entities may be participants in the Network Advertising Initiative and/or the Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. Both of these programs allow users to opt out of ad targeting from participating companies. To learn more, please click here <http://www.networkadvertising.org/> or here <http://www.aboutads.info/>. To opt out, please click here <http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp> or <http://www.aboutads.info/choices/>.

### How does ANN protect the security of my order information? __

The safety of your credit card information is important to us, and ANN has taken measures to help protect the security of your online order information.

ANN uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to help keep your online order information safe. SSL technology encrypts your credit card number, order information and personal information before it is transmitted to help protect it from being decoded by anyone other than ANN. Our Sites also display the VeriSign Secure Site Seal, which indicates that our Sites have been authenticated by VeriSign and that we use SSL encryption to transmit confidential information during sales transactions.

Specifically, once you enter the checkout page, your computer will begin communicating with our server using SSL encryption. You can determine the security of your connection by looking at the bottom of your Internet browser window after you have accessed our Sites. SSL technology is active if there is a solid key or a closed lock. You can also double-check by looking at the URL line of your browser. When accessing a security-enhanced server, the first characters of the site address will change from "http" to "https."

Some versions of browsers and some firewalls don't permit communication through security-enhanced servers like the ones we use to process orders on our Sites. If you cannot access the security-enhanced server for any reason, you can place your order by calling 1-800-DIAL-ANN or 1-888-LOFT-444.

While we implement SSL technology and other security measures to protect your information, please note that no data transmitted over the Internet or any other public network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

### What if I am accessing the Sites from outside the United States? __

If you are visiting our Sites from a location outside of the United States, you may be connected to servers located within the United States or in other countries whose data protection laws may not be equivalent to the laws in your country of residence. By providing your information to us, you are consenting to the transfer of your personal information to facilities located outside of your country of residence, and understand that your information will be stored, accessed and processed in accordance with U.S. law, including that in certain circumstances courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies or security authorities in the United States may be entitled to access your personal information. For more information about our policies and practices related to the use of service providers located outside of your country of residence, please contact for more info.

### What happens to my personal information when I place an order from outside the United States? __

ANN offers customers the ability to ship orders internationally. In these cases, ANN partners with Borderfree, ("Borderfree"), a U.S.-based service provider that we have contracted with to facilitate the sale and fulfillment of international online purchases. Borderfree will process your information in accordance with its privacy policy. To learn more about Borderfree's privacy policy, please visit [www.Borderfree.com/privacy](http://www.borderfree.com/privacy).

When we identify that your order is one that will be shipped internationally, we work with Borderfree to complete your order. On the checkout page, you will be required to submit credit card and contact information to Borderfree to complete your order. Borderfree will be solely responsible for processing your financial transaction and we will not have access to your credit card information. Upon completion of your order, Borderfree will notify us of the approval of your order, and we will then ship approved orders to Borderfree. Simultaneously, Borderfree will purchase the product from us, which allows them to take title to the product(s), bill your credit card, collect and remit any duties and taxes to the appropriate taxing authority and arrange for the product to be delivered to you. In this process, Borderfree makes the sale to you as the merchant of record. When ordering a product, you will be presented with Borderfree's terms and conditions and privacy policy to which you must agree in order to complete your transaction.

Once you place your order, you will be prompted to confirm whether you would like to receive marketing and other communications from ANN brands. If you agree that Borderfree may share your data with ANN, we will protect and use your information in order to supply you with such communications and as otherwise set forth in our Privacy Policy.

### What is "phishing"? __

"Phishing" is a scam designed to steal your personal information. If you receive an email that looks like it is from us asking you for your personal information, do not respond. We will never request your password, user name, credit card information or other personal information through email.

### How does ANN protect children's privacy? __

ANN is concerned about the privacy of young children and our Sites do not knowingly collect any personal information from a child under 13 years of age.

### What are my California privacy rights? __
