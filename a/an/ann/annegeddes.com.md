# Privacy Policy | Anne Geddes

### Privacy Policy 

Your right to privacy is our number one concern. Below are the guidelines we use for protecting the information you provide us during a visit to the Anne Geddes website annegeddes.com or our Apps, including when you sign up for our newsletter. Our policy is to respect and protect the privacy of our visitors at all times. Visiting the website or using our Apps should be a rewarding experience where you feel confident and secure about the information you share with us. If you have additional questions or would like further information on privacy issues, please feel free to [contact us](https://web.archive.org/contact-us/) by emailing [customersupport@annegeddes.com](mailto:customersupport@annegeddes.com).

### How do we collect or receive your information?

The information we collect about you is personally identifiable information required as part of the site’s sign-up process to receive our newsletter. Signing up for the newsletter is completely optional and is not a prerequisite of using the site.

There are other instances where we collect personally identifiable information. However, at all times, you have the option of choosing whether or not to reveal such personal information to us.

### What happens with this information?

Anne Geddes does not sell or otherwise disclose personal information about you, except as described in this Privacy Notice.

From time to time we may share certain information such as email and other addresses we collect with select business partners, for the purpose of communicating with you about products and services, offers, events and promotions that we believe may be of interest to you.

The only other parties who have access to such information are those employees within the Anne Geddes family of businesses who need it to do their jobs. Our employees are educated about the policies and practices in regard to safeguarding customer information, preventing its unauthorized access, use or disclosure and ensuring its proper handling.

Any third parties that need access to our site for operational or other support services must agree to safeguard your information in strict compliance with our policy. We may, under rare circumstances, provide information to regulatory authorities and law enforcement officials in accordance with applicable law. We may also disclose customer information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.

### What are “Cookies” and how are they used on this site?

Cookies are small pieces of information (or identifiers) which our website or apps can send to your computer or mobile device to be stored for record-keeping purposes to facilitate your next visit to our site. Cookies make navigation easier for you by saving your preferences while you’re visiting. Cookies can help us to tailor our website to better match your needs and interests, including targeted advertising, and allow us to better understand how visitors use our site, which, in turn, helps us to focus our resources on improving the site. The use of cookies is an industry standard and you’ll find them at most major websites.

### Can I disable these cookies?

Most web and mobile browsers and devices allow you to exercise control over such files by erasing them, blocking them, selecting private or “do not track me”, or notifying you when such a file is stored. Please take a look at your particular device for instructions on this function. In most instances, you will find this function within the preferences section. If you do elect to disable cookies, or enable private browsing you may not be able to take full advantage of a personalized experience.

### Why do I need to know this?

We want you to know why we ask you to accept a cookie and we want to be sure you understand that accepting a cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any personal information about you. We know that a lot of people have concerns about privacy, but in talking with many of our users, we feel that the benefit we both gain from their proper use is worthwhile. We value the relationships we have with our visitors, so we respect these concerns.

### How do I opt-out of receiving emails from the site?

Our site requires you to voluntarily opt-in to receive any information from us. We also provide you with the opportunity to opt-out of receiving any future communications at any time. If you want to remove your information from our database and not receive future communications or registration-required service(s), please click here or simply click on “Unsubscribe” at the end of the next newsletter you receive.

### What is the privacy policy covering teens (people 13-17 years of age)?

Visitors between 13 and 17 years of age are encouraged to make their parent or guardian aware of their membership, signing up for a newsletter and involvement in this site.

### How secure is my connection?

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet and WIFI can be guaranteed 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we can’t ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems. We aim to utilize the latest available technology to ensure the highest level of privacy and security for our visitors.
