# Privacy Policy | Anne Geddes

Your right to privacy is our number one concern. Below are the guidelines we use for protecting the information you provide us during a visit to annegeddes.com and an explanation of how that information is used. Our policy is to respect and protect the privacy of our visitors at all times. Visiting this website should be a rewarding experience where you feel confident and secure about the information you share with us. If you have additional questions or would like further information on privacy issues, please feel free to [contact us](https://web.archive.org/contact-us/).

There are two categories of information we collect about you when you visit our site.

The first type of information we collect about you is personally identifiable information required as part of the site’s membership process. Membership is completely optional and is not a prerequisite of using the site. Our site’s membership form requires users to give us contact information like your name, country of origin and email address. You have the option to provide us with additional information like birthday, address and gender. By registering you will receive an enhanced and personalized experience when visiting the site. Further, you will receive email newsletters and alerts from us.

There are other instances where we collect personally identifiable information. However, at all times, you have the option of choosing whether or not to reveal such personal information to us. Examples of when you may voluntarily submit this kind of information include when you sign the Guestbook, or send us feedback or questions.

The second category of information we collect is non-personally identifiable information, in the form of log files. These files enable the generation of broad demographic statistics. Information such as the number of unique visitors, number of visitors from a particular country, the most popular pages and downloads allow us to gain a better understanding of site development needs and visitor trends so that we can improve our website and your annegeddes.com experience. Information gathered from log files is not used in association with any personal details you may divulge.

Annegeddes.com does not sell or otherwise disclose personal information about you, except as described in this Privacy Notice.

From time to time we may share certain information such as email addresses we collect with select business partners, for the purpose of communicating with you about products and services, offers, events and promotions that we believe may be of interest to you.

The only other parties who have access to such information are those employees within the Anne Geddes family of businesses who need it to do their jobs. Our employees are educated about the policies and practices in regard to safeguarding customer information, preventing its unauthorized access, use or disclosure and ensuring its proper handling.

Any third parties that need access to our site for operational or other support services must agree to safeguard your information in strict compliance with our policy. We may, under rare circumstances, provide information to regulatory authorities and law enforcement officials in accordance with applicable law. We may also disclose customer information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.

You may opt-out at any time from sharing any information with our business partners. To opt-out, please [click here](https://web.archive.org/members/?a=edit) and adjust your membership accordingly. If you opt out, your information will remain accessible to Anne Geddes and other parties as otherwise described in the “What Happens with This Information” section of this Privacy Policy.
