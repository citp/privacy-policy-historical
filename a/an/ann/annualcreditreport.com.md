### Using cookies technology

  


#### What is a cookie?

A cookie is a piece of information that a web server may transfer to your web browser when you visit this website. Cookies are commonly used by websites to improve your experience and to let computer systems recognize your browser. Only the information that you provide, or the choices you make while visiting a website, can be stored in a cookie. For example, the site cannot get your email unless you choose to type it. Allowing a website to create a cookie does not give that or any other site access to the rest of your computer, and only the site that created the cookie can interpret it. 

  


#### How we use cookies on this website   
You must allow cookies if you want to get credit reports from the nationwide consumer credit reporting companies through this website.

This website uses cookies to: 

  * Allow you to ask for a free credit report from more than one nationwide consumer credit reporting company during a visit without re-entering your information more than once.
  * Allow us to gather collective statistical data to help us manage and develop this website.
  * Help improve how you navigate this website 



The cookies on this site collect information only while you are on the site, not after you leave it to go to other sites on the Internet. No one else can read the data our cookies collect unless you give them permission to read them. We may sometimes use other companies to set cookies on this website and collect cookie information for us. We use the cookie information collected by these companies in the same way we discuss above. Those companies may not use these cookies for their own internal purposes or share the information collected with any party except us and the three nationwide consumer credit reporting companies and their contractors. 

  


#### Must I allow you to use cookies?

You can decide if and how your computer will accept a cookie by setting your preferences in your web browser. Internet Explorer is set up to allow cookies. However, you can specify that you be prompted before a site puts a cookie on your hard disk. You must enable cookies to get your credit reports from the nationwide consumer credit reporting companies through this website.
