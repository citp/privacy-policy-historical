### How we help safeguard your information

When you ask for free credit reports online, programs encrypt the information you provide on the request form before sending it to the nationwide consumer credit reporting company or companies you select. After the credit reporting company gets the information, it decrypts it. We always operate physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to help guard your personally identifiable information. This site's security protocols and measures protect your personally identifiable information from unauthorized access or alteration. These measures include internal and external firewalls, physical security and technological security measures, and encryption of certain information.

Please note, however, that no data transmission or storage can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect the information we maintain, we cannot ensure or guarantee the security of the information you transmit to us or that we collect, retain or share.

A cookie is a piece of information that a web server may transfer to your web browser when you visit this website. Cookies are commonly used by websites to improve your experience and to let computer systems recognize your browser. Only the information that you provide, or the choices you make while visiting a website, can be stored in a cookie. For example, the site cannot get your email unless you choose to type it. Allowing a website to create a cookie does not give that or any other site access to the rest of your computer, and only the site that created the cookie can interpret it.

The cookies on this site collect information only while you are on the site, not after you leave it to go to other sites on the Internet. No one else can read the data our cookies collect unless you give them permission to read them. We may sometimes use other companies to set cookies on this website and collect cookie information for us. We use the cookie information collected by these companies in the same way we discuss above.
