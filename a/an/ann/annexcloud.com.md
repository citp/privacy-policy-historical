#### **Personal Information We Collect**

We collect Personal Information from Customers and, on behalf of our Customers, from individual end users (“End Users”). As part of our Services to our Clients, we provide Consumers the ability to submit images, reviews, questions and answers, and to comment on or rate goods, products and services on websites and mobile applications (collectively, “User-Generated Content”). You should be aware that any information provided in the area that is intended to collect such User-Generated Content will be published on a publicly facing website or mobile application and will be read, collected, and used by Annex Cloud, its subsidiaries, vendors and Clients. User-Generated Content is used for providing Services to our Clients, marketing research, new product development, to personalize or improve our Services, to detect fraudulent activities and for analytical purposes. 

We may collect Personal Information from End User’s who: 

  * 1\. upload user-generated content to Customer digital properties (such as a Customer’s website);
  * 2\. use Customer hashtags or branded location tags on their social media posts;

The Customer Account Info may be collected by both Annex Cloud and the applicable Annex Cloud Customer. Annex Cloud uses Customer Account Info to assist with the creation of an account, to detect fraud and inauthentic content, to personalize your services, to provide you the ability to review, comment on or rate products, or to otherwise create content across Customer digital properties. 

#### Social Media Features 

Our Site includes social media features, including Social Login features. These features may collect your IP address, information about which page you are visiting, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly by our Services. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the social media company providing them. 

#### Use of Personal Information

Customers: We use the Personal Information we have collected from you to provide you with information about and access to our Services, to communicate with you about updates, maintenance, outages or other technical matters concerning our Services, to respond to your questions or inquiries regarding our Site or Services and to allow you to download information such as whitepapers.

End Users: We only process Personal Information we collect from you to provide the services for which our Customers have engaged us. Our Customers use the information we collect in accordance with their own privacy policies. The Personal Information Annex Cloud collects from End Users helps our Customers communicate with End Users regarding content that they have submitted through our Services, or to administer a promotion, survey or other feature. Furthermore, our Customers to whom you have submitted content through any of Annex Cloud Services or whose brand hashtags or branded location tags you have included in your social media posts, or whose products you have purchased from a Customer digital property after interacting with the user galleries, reviews, or any other user-generated content on those digital properties, may use your username or email address to communicate with you, in addition to using your photo.

We may also use the information we collect automatically from End Users of our Services to improve the Services we offer to our Customers, and to improve marketing, analytics and the functionality of the Services.

We do not sell your name, phone number, email or the email addresses of referrals, to third parties.

#### Retention Of Personal Information

Annex Cloud will retain Personal Information for as long as needed to provide the Services or as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

#### Log Data

Like many site operators, we collect information that your browser sends whenever you visit our Site or use our Services ("Log Data"). 

This Log Data may include information such as your computer's Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, browser version, the pages of our Site that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages and other statistics.

In addition, we may use third party services such as Google Analytics that collect, monitor and analyze this data for purposes of analyzing trends, administering the Site and Services, tracking users’ movements around the Site and Services, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by the third parties mentioned above on an individual as well as aggregated basis.

#### Communications 

We may use your Personal Information to contact Customers with newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information on an Opt-in basis. If you are a Customer and no longer wish to receive these communications you can follow the unsubscribe instructions contained in those emails or contact us directly (see Contact Us below).

#### Cookies

Cookies are files with small amounts of data, which may include an anonymous unique identifier. Cookies are sent to your browser from a website and stored on your computer's hard drive.

We use cookies to analyze End User interactions with our Services and purchases on the digital properties of those Customers who have chosen to implement them. End Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use the Services, but your ability to use some features or areas of our Services may be limited. 

Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret web browser-based “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) signals other than cookies, we do not currently respond to undefined “DNT” signals to the Site.

#### Third Party Data

Annex Cloud uses cookies or similar technologies from third party providers to assist us with analyzing site traffic, help us determine the effectiveness of content on our site, and related activities. 

We disclose certain data collected by our Services, (e.g. User-Generated Content) as well as consumer Account Info and aggregated and anonymized data to third-party service providers (e.g. data storage and processing facilities, email service providers, ) in order for those service providers to perform business functions for us or on our behalf. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.

We disclose User-Generated Content, Customer Account Info and aggregated and anonymized data to our partners for use in their products and services. For example, we provide reviews about retailers to Google for use in Google's products and services such as AdWords. If you do not want us to share your personal information with these companies, you may opt-out as described in this policy. 

Annex Cloud may rely on third parties to transfer personal information. Only information that is in the specific scope of use as outlined in this privacy policy, and has affirmative consent, will be transferred. All third party’s used by Annex Cloud are under contract and required to comply with US-EU Privacy Shield principles as described below. Annex Cloud will take steps that are appropriate and reasonable to make sure that the third party is actually complying with these principles. These steps may include monitoring and evaluating mechanisms. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, please visit <https://privacyshield.gov/>

The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

#### Business Transfer 

In the event that Annex Cloud - or substantial portion of all of its assets - are acquired by one or more third parties as a result of an acquisition, merger, sale, reorganization, consolidation or liquidation, such databases containing Personal Information may be one of the transferred assets. In the event of such a transfer, Annex Cloud will place a prominent notice on our Site of any change in ownership or uses of your Personal Information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your Personal Information.
