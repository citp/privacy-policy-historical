### **Privacy Policy summary**

In this digital day and age, it’s important to understand how your information is handled. Our Privacy Policy details the kind of information we collect, why we need it and how we use it.

#### **Collecting your personal information**

Most of the information we collect is provided by you directly – like your name, email, date of birth and phone number. However, there will be times when we need to request information about you from a third party, like a credit report from a credit reporting body. This helps us make an informed decision about your application.

#### **Your information helps us provide you with a product or service**

We use your information so we can provide and support you with your product or service. But we also use it for other reasons. Like helping with the administration of your account, and for operational and legal purposes. Or, to tell you about other products or services you might be interested in.

At times, we need to share your information with third parties. For example, we often use other organisations to help provide you with your product. When this happens, we may need to share your information with them.

#### **Managing your personal information**

We take protecting your information very seriously. That’s why we have a range of security measures in place to help manage and safeguard your information. If at any time, you want to access or correct your personal information, or if you have any concerns, you'll find our contact details below. To find out more, please read our [Privacy Policy](https://web.archive.org/privacy/centre/policy/) and watch our short video above.
