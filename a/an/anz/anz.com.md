About This Privacy and Security Statement

This Privacy and Security Statement applies to this Web Site which is operated by Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited (ACN 005 357 522) ("ANZ") under the domain name "www.anz.com" ("ANZ Web Site"). The ANZ Web Site is operated on behalf of ANZ and its related bodies corporate (together called the "ANZ Group"). 

This Privacy and Security Statement may also apply to services offered by ANZ on Web Sites hosted by third parties. If so, express reference to this Privacy and Security Statement will be made on those Web Sites. 

ANZ understands and appreciates that you, as an ANZ Web Site visitor, are concerned about your privacy and about the confidentiality and security of information we may gain about you online. ANZ is committed to protecting your privacy. This ANZ Privacy and Security Statement explains how your personal information will be treated as you access and interact with the ANZ Web Site. 

As the ANZ Web Site develops and as technology evolves, ANZ will continue to strive to provide you with better and more customised services and with a more effective Web Site. ANZ encourages you to review the ANZ Privacy and Security Statement periodically because the Privacy and Security Statement may change from time to time. 

In addition to the provisions of this Privacy and Security Statement, there may also be specific and additional privacy provisions which apply to certain sections of the ANZ Web Site. Because those specific and additional provisions also relate to your privacy protection, you should review them wherever they are accessible by you on the ANZ Web Site. In the event of any inconsistency between the provisions of this Privacy and Security Statement and those other specific and additional provisions, the specific and additional provisions will prevail. 

The information that we will collect about you will depend on how you use the facilities offered by the ANZ Web Site. 

If you visit the ANZ Web Site to read, browse or download information, our system will record the date and time of your visit to our site, the pages viewed and any information downloaded. 

The ANZ Web Site offers a number of interactive facilities including tools such as budget planners and home loan calculator as well as online application forms. 

If you use any of the tools such as the budget planner or home loan calculator we generally do not capture any personal information that you may enter when using these tools. An exception is where a tool such as a budget planner allows you to suspend your plan and retrieve the details at a later time. In that case the information is stored on our systems so that you may recover the information when you resume your plan. Any information stored in a suspended budget planner or other similar tool is not processed by us. 

If you decide to complete an online application form, the information that you enter onto the online form will only be collected by us if you submit your online application. If at any stage you cancel your application or log out prior to submitting your application, the information you have entered up to that point will be automatically deleted. If you suspend your application, for example because you wish to complete it at another time, the information that you have entered will be retained in our systems so that you may recover the information when you resume your application. Online applications that have been suspended are not processed by us. 

The ANZ Web Site also contains links to the Web Sites of third party providers of goods and services ("Third Party Web Sites"). If you have accessed Third Party Web Sites through the ANZ Web Site and if those third parties collect information about you, ANZ may also collect or have access to that information as part of our arrangements with those third parties. 

Third Party Web Sites should contain their own privacy statements and those third parties are responsible for informing you about their own privacy practices. 

We use "cookies" as a fundamental part of our interaction with your Internet browser. A purpose is to provide you with better and more customised service and with a more effective Web Site. 

A "cookie" is a small text file placed on your computer by our web page server. A cookie can later be retrieved by our webpage servers. Cookies are frequently used on Web Sites and you can choose if and how a cookie will be accepted by configuring your preferences and options in your browser. 

We use cookies: 

  * to allocate your ANZ identification number; 
  * to determine if you have previously visited the ANZ Web Site; 
  * to identify pages you have accessed and Third Party Web Sites you have accessed; 
  * for marketing purposes; and 
  * for administrative and security purposes.



Most of the ANZ Web Site operates by use of cookies. 

Accordingly, if you wish to make full use of the ANZ Web Site, it is required that you accept cookies. If your browser is configured to reject all cookies you will be unable to use services on the ANZ Web Site that require cookies in order to participate. Those services include (but are not limited to): 

  * Online applications for loans; 
  * myanz.



You may still be able to use some information-only pages even if you do not accept cookies. 

We will only use or disclose personal information or information generated by cookies (“cookie information”) that you have provided to us when: 

  * you have authorised us to do so; 
  * we have given you notification of the intended use or disclosure and you have not objected to that use or disclosure; 
  * we believe that the use or disclosure is reasonably necessary to assist a law enforcement agency or an agency responsible for national security in the performance of their functions; or 
  * ANZ is authorised, required or permitted by law to disclose the information.



An exception is where you access a Third Party Web Site from the ANZ Web Site. In that case, cookie information and information about your preferences or other information that you provide about yourself may be shared between that third party, the person hosting the Third Party Web Site and members of the ANZ Group. ANZ uses the information to provide you with information about products and services that may be of interest to you. It may also be used for the enhancement of services offered through the ANZ Web Site and Third Party Web Sites. 

Third Party Web Sites should contain their own privacy statements and those third parties are responsible for informing you about their own privacy practices. 

We will preserve the content of any e-mail that you send us, if we believe that we have a legal requirement to do so. Any personal information contained in your e-mail, including your e-mail address, will be used or disclosed in ways set out in this Privacy and Security Statement. Your e-mail message content may be monitored by our Internet Service Provider or ANZ employees for trouble shooting and maintenance purposes or where e-mail abuse is suspected. 

ANZ takes reasonable steps to preserve the security of cookie and personal information in accordance with the ANZ Web Site Terms of Use and this Privacy and Security Statement. If your browser is suitably configured, it will advise you whether the information you are sending us will be secure (encrypted) or not secure (not encrypted). If secure transmission is indicated, ANZ currently uses 128 bit encryption. 

ANZ regularly reviews developments in security and encryption technologies. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed as totally secure. Accordingly, although ANZ strives to protect such information, ANZ cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we take reasonable steps to preserve the security of the information in our own systems. 

You acknowledge and accept that your use of the ANZ Web Site indicates your acceptance of the [**ANZ Web Site Terms of Use**](https://web.archive.org/web/20010603121508id_/http%3A//www.anz.com/australia/support/general/disclaimer.asp) and the Privacy and Security Statement. 

This is the current Privacy and Security Statement. It replaces any other Privacy and Security Statement for the ANZ Web Site published on the ANZ Web Site to date. ANZ may at any time vary the Privacy and Security Statement by publishing the varied Privacy and Security Statement on the ANZ Web Site. You accept that by doing this, ANZ has provided you with sufficient notice of the variation.
