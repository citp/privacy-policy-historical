Your use of this site constitutes your acceptance of all of the terms and
conditions contained in this Privacy Policy and your consent to any

We may change the terms of this Privacy Policy, so users are encour-
aged to review this page from time to time. Your continued use

We sometimes engage third parties to perform services for us,
including in connection with this site, that require us to disclose Users'

disclosure, we will require such parties to keep the information
confidential and to use it only to perform the services.
We may, from time to time, wish to disclose your information to third

believe such disclosure is required by law or for the protection of
persons or property.
Security
We use reasonable security safeguards to protect Personally
Identifiable Information we collect on this site from unauthorized
access, use, modification or disclosure. However, due to the design of
the Internet and other factors outside of our control, we cannot
guarantee that communications between you and our servers will be
free from unauthorized access by third parties.
