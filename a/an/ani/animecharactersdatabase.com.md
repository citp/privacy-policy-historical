    We are now working with Lijit Networks, Inc.
    
    Added updated links to 3rd Party Privacy Policies
    

## Update: Sat Jul 14 23:14:17 CDT 2012
    
    
     We now include Quantcast tracking code, but ONLY on this page ( privacy.php ). 
    However, our 3rd party ads often will use Quantcast on other parts of the site. 

##  Update: Sat Mar 31 05:36:16 CDT 2012 
    
    
    We no longer use Google AdSense.
    
    We now use PulsePoint ads.
    
    We have implemented a login accounting system.
    Each time you login or logout of Anime Characters Database
    we record:
     - the time
     - your ip
     - the User Agent your web browser sent in the http headers
     - user name
     - user id
     - session id
    
    This information is only available to L10 admins.
    This information is to be used only for investigating suspicious account activity. 
    

## Updated: May 15th, 2011
    
    
    Time for a new Privacy Policy.
    
    Change Number 1: We no long use Google Analytics Tracking services.
    
    We do our best to balance the need for Ad Revenue and respecting your privacy.
    
    All members have the option to Turn Off Ads by clicking a button in the side menu.
    Anyone can visit the Privacy Policy and click a similar button within the page.
    
    We try to minimize the amount of 3rd party content on the site.
    I can't stand web sites that connect to hundreds of third party sources,
     so I wont force that on the users of my web site.
    Where there are member comments, you may encounter 3rd party hosted Avatars,
     or linked images in comments.
    
    Anime Characters Database can be fully used with JavaScript turned off,
     and works great with NoScript ( a firefox extension ).
    Such a choice will make us worry about paying our hosting bills,
     but offers you faster browsing speeds, and max privacy!
    
    We do collect standard web access logs.
    These contain:
     - IP address
     - request time
     - request type
     - request URL
     - referrer URL
     - user agent
     - transfer size
     - status code
    We keep these logs for roughly a year.
    We do not sell our access logs.
    We do not share entire logs with anyone.
    Sections of logs may be made public.
    
    Our database at most records:
     - IP address
     - user agent
     - time
    as identifying markers when you post content to the site.
    The purpose being to identify spammers, and quickly remove related spam.
    
    We also maintain a usage stats table, which contains:
     - time first seen
     - time last seen
     - page requests
     - online today marker
     - ip address
     - session cookie
     - user agent
    Purpose: 
     - maintain a reliable user session
     - detect and prevent Denial of Service attacks
    
    Members are free to submit as much or as little personal information in their
     account profiles. 
    We try hard to maintain an unusually high level of server security.
    While we do have substantial security preventing intrusion, we have also
     spent vast amounts of time and effort obscuring the internals of our system
     to a point that should a hacker gain access, they will have a very foreign, 
     very limited system opened to them.
