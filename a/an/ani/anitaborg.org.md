If you have questions about what information we will require to be collected for a particular purpose, please contact us at [Privacy@AnitaB.org](mailto:privacy@anitab.org).

AnitaB.org also automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, information contained in or conveyed by cookies and other similar technology (as described below), and the page you request through automated a metrics platform such as Google Analytics. This information is automatically logged through these services and will not be connected to your personal information by AnitaB.org for any reason.

AnitaB.org may also collect certain personal information or other information that you voluntarily disclosed, including without limitation in connection with registering for events or mailing lists, submission of job applications, responses to survey questions, providing comments, suggestions, and other information that you voluntarily submit. If you choose to provide such information, you are giving AnitaB.org the permission to use and store it consistent with this policy. Therefore, please understand that when you sign in with AnitaB.org, you are not anonymous to us.

We may also obtain information, including personal information, from third parties and other sources. If we combine or associate information from other sources with personal information that we collect, we will treat the combined information as personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

## **How Is Such Information Used?**

We may use personal information we collect in order to establish and enhance our relationship with you. AnitaB.org may use personal information to share with you information that we feel may be of interest to you, such as invitations to attend AnitaB.org events or the events of other carefully chosen organizations, to review and enhance our products and service offerings, to contact you about your membership, to provide local networking and educational opportunities, or otherwise to further our charitable purpose and to comply with applicable law. If you make charitable donations to AnitaB.org or otherwise engage in off-line activities with AnitaB.org, this Donor Information may be merged in our database with your online personal information. The information AnitaB.org collects and how the information is used will specifically depend on which of AnitaB.org’s products or services you use. AnitaB.org will only require you to provide us with information if it is needed for the legitimate interest of providing you with a product or service or the execution of a transaction. Any time you voluntarily submit information in additional to that described above, you are providing the information on a voluntary basis whereby you consent to our use of the information as described at the time requested. You can contact us at any time to adjust your privacy preferences or ask questions about how the information might be used.

Your personal information is only retained by AnitaB.org for as long as needed to facilitate the product or service, facilitate communication, or otherwise execute the purpose for which the information was obtained in the first place. This means that although much of the information can be deleted automatically (e.g. when you elect to unsubscribe from a newsletter), some will require manual review before doing so (e.g. you have purchased a ticket for an event and we need some way to verify who you are in order to be admitted to the event).

Tasks related to event organization and other functions of AnitaB.org are performed both by employees, agents and contractors of AnitaB.org and by volunteers (“AnitaB.org Volunteers”) who are not employees. By making use of the Site(s), you consent to allow AnitaB.org employees, agents, contractors, and AnitaB.org Volunteers to access any personal information you submit to the Site(s) to provide AnitaB.org with a specific service and not for any other purpose.

Additionally, AnitaB.org generally uses the information to operate, maintain, enhance, and provide all of the features and services found on the Site(s). Under certain circumstances (for example if you win a contest) we may post your personal information on the Site(s). However, we will notify you of this possibility when collecting personal information or we will obtain your consent to post this information. We may share your personal information with certain other websites that we link to (and that you click upon) in order to achieve the purpose of the connection with the Site(s). AnitaB.org may also use the information that we collect to understand and analyze the usage trends and preferences of our users, to improve the way the Site(s) work and look, and to create new features and functionality. The information may be stored and maintained for as long as reasonably necessary to effectuate the service requested and for a reasonable time thereafter.

We may conduct research on our customer demographics, internet usage, and interests and behavior based on personal data we gather.

AnitaB.org may share this type of non-identifiable data with a variety of third parties, including its affiliates, advertisers and other current and prospective business partners.

Our agreement with these companies prohibits them from sharing your information with any third party or using it for any other purpose. Non-identifiable click stream and demographic information may also be shared with our advertisers and business partners.

## **International Transfers**

The Site(s) are hosted in the United States. If you choose to use the Site(s) from the European Union or other regions of the world with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, then please note that you are transferring your personal information outside of those regions to the United States and by providing your personal information on the Site(s) you consent to that transfer. AnitaB.org will comply with the terms of this Privacy Policy regardless of where the information originates.

## **In the Event of Merger or Sale**

In the event that AnitaB.org is acquired by or merged with a third-party entity, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information that we have collected from users as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control.

## **Third-Party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites**

The Site(s) may be linked to internet websites operated by other companies or third-party sponsors. Some of these websites may be co-branded with our name or logo, even though they are not operated or maintained by us. AnitaB.org may also permit other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the Site(s). These third-party ad servers or ad networks may use technology to send, directly to your browser, some of the advertisements and links that appear on the Site(s). These advertisers may automatically receive your IP address if this happens.

AnitaB.org may work with third parties (e.g., Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook) who use web beacons, pixel tags, JavaScript code, and other technologies to collect or receive information from our Site and elsewhere on the Internet and use that information to provide measurement and conversion services and target advertisements. You may be able to opt-out of the collection and use of information for ad targeting by visiting [www.aboutads.info/choices](http://www.aboutads.info/choices?__hstc=155023335.9b2f00157800b53c8fc888a234b96999.1474570080171.1474570080171.1474570080173.2&__hssc=155023335.2.1474570080173&__hsfp=1766097770) or by enabling do-not-track settings in your browser if your browser provides those settings.

Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, the Sites are not intended for or directed to persons under the age of 13 and AnitaB.org does not knowingly collect or maintain personal information on the Sites from persons under 13 years-of-age. Any person who provides their information to AnitaB.org through any part of Site(s) represents to AnitaB.org that they are 13 years of age or older. If AnitaB.org learns that personal information of persons less than 13 years-of-age has been collected on AnitaB.org without verifiable parental consent, then AnitaB.org will take the appropriate steps to delete this information. If you are a parent or guardian and discover that your child under the age of 13 has provided personal information to AnitaB.org, then you may alert AnitaB.org at [Privacy@AnitaB.org](mailto:privacy@anitab.org) and request that AnitaB.org delete that child’s personal information from its systems.
