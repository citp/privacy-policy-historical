## Privacy Policy

Last Updated: February 14, 2011 

Your privacy is important, so the Anita Borg Institute for Women and Technology (“ABI”) has created the following Privacy Policy to let you know what information we collect when you visit our Site(s) (as defined below) and online services, why we collect it and how it is used. 

### Your Consent To This Privacy Policy

By using the Site(s), you expressly consent to the information handling practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not want information about you to be used in the manner set forth in this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Site(s). 

This is our entire and exclusive Privacy Policy and it supersedes any earlier version. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into by reference and made a part of our Terms of Use for the Sites. We may periodically make changes to this Privacy Policy that we will include on this page. The effective date at the top of this page indicates the date of the most current Privacy Policy in effect. It is your responsibility to review this Privacy Policy frequently and remain informed about any changes to it, so we encourage you to visit this page often. Your continued use of the Site(s) constitutes your agreement to this Privacy Policy and any future revisions. ABI shall not be liable for any damages You may suffer as a result of its failure to provide You notice of any changes to this Privacy Policy as set forth herein. If you would like to be notified when this Privacy Policy is updated, please contact us by email at privacy@anitaborg.org or by postal mail at Privacy Director, Anita Borg Institute for Women and Technology, 1501 Page Mill Road, ms 1105, Palo Alto, CA 94304. 

### Scope of Policy

This Privacy Policy explains the data collection and use practices of anitaborg.org, systers.org and any other websites or services, available through such sites, owned or operated by ABI (the “Sites”). This Privacy Policy does not apply to offline ABI activities, products or services, and does not apply to third-party sites with which ABI may be affiliated, for example, where users may donate money to ABI or register for ABI events. Please consult the privacy policies of such third-party sites. Certain additional terms governing privacy on the systers.org site (“Systers Site”) and restricted-access e-mail discussion lists, now or in the future (the “Systers Lists”) are set forth on the Systers List FAQs and below. 

### What Information Is Collected?

“Personal Information” means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, password, home or other physical address, an email address, phone number or other contact information, whether at work or at home. 

ABI also automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, cookie information and the page you request. 

ABI may also collect certain Personal Information or other information that you voluntarily disclosed based on your use of the Site(s), including without limitation in connection with registering for events or mailing lists, submission of job applications, responses to survey questions, providing comments, suggestions, and other information that you voluntarily submit. If you choose to provide such information, you are giving ABI the permission to use and store it consistent with this policy. Therefore, please understand that when you sign in with ABI, you are not anonymous to us. 

We may also obtain information, including Personal Information, from third parties and sources other than the Site(s). If we combine or associate information from other sources with personally identifiable information that we collect through the Site(s), we will treat the combined information as personally identifiable information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. 

### How Is Such Information Used?

We may use Personal Information collected on the Site(s) in order to establish and enhance our relationship with you. ABI may use Personal Information to share with You information that we feel may be of interest to you, such as invitations to attend ABI events or the events of other carefully chosen organizations, to review and enhance our products and service offerings, to contact you about your membership, to provide local networking and educational opportunities, or otherwise to further our charitable purpose and to comply with applicable law. If you make charitable donations to ABI or otherwise engage in off-line activities with ABI, this information may be merged in our database with your online Personal Information. 

Tasks related to event organization and other functions of ABI are performed both by employees, agents and contractors of ABI and by volunteers (“ABI Volunteers”) who are not employees. By making use of the Site(s), you consent to allow ABI employees, agents, contractors, and ABI Volunteers to access any Personal Information you submit to the Site(s) to provide ABI with a specific service and not for any other purpose. 

Additionally, ABI generally uses the information to operate, maintain, enhance, and provide all of the features and services found on the Site(s). We may also send information or offers to groups of users on behalf of other businesses. Under certain circumstances (for example if you win a contest) we may post your Personal Information on the Site(s). However, we will notify you of this possibility when collecting Personal Information or we will obtain your consent. We may share your Personal Information with certain other websites that we link to (and that you click upon) in order to enhance your experience in connection with the Site(s). ABI may also use the information that we collect to understand and analyze the usage trends and preferences of our users, to improve the way the Site(s) work and look, and to create new features and functionality. The information may be stored and maintained for as long as reasonably necessary to effectuate the service requested and for a reasonable time thereafter. 

### When ABI Discloses Information

ABI discloses such Personal Information to third parties as follows: (i) to agents, subcontractors and other third parties, including ABI volunteers, who are engaged by ABI in making the ABI products and services available and otherwise assisting ABI in its charitable purpose, including fundraising; and (ii) to selected affiliates, marketing partners and other organizations that ABI may affiliate with in furtherance of its charitable purpose. In addition, if you register to attend an event or conference sponsored by ABI, ABI may also disclose Personal Information in the form of a list of attendee contact information to other attendees at such conference or event; provided, that ABI will provide you with the opportunity to opt-out of such disclosure. 

ABI may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (1) comply with state or federal laws (such as U.S. Copyright law), or respond to a court order, judicial or other government subpoena or warrant, or otherwise comply with legal process served on ABI or the Site(s); (2) protect and defend the rights or property of ABI or otherwise take precautions against liability; or (3) act in urgent circumstances to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of ABI and users of ABI, its websites or the public; (4) protect ABI from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses;(5) investigate and defend ourselves against third party claims or allegations; (6) assist government enforcement agencies;  
or (7) protect the security or integrity of the Site(s). In some cases, we may make such disclosures without first providing notice to users. 

### Systers Site

ABI collects the following Personal Information from you when you register to use the Systers List: e-mail address, full name, gender, and a short essay discussing involvement in technical computing. We also collect and archive submissions to the Systers List and thus we retain any Personal Information you choose to include in those submissions. 

Personal Information collected on the Systers Site may be used for the purposes of enabling registration, maintenance, support and participation in the Systers List. 

In addition, archives of emails sent to the Systers List are maintained on the Systers Site and are accessible to list members. When they register to participate, Systers List members agree to be bound by the Systers List FAQs, which requires that information posted to the Systers List not be shared with non-members unless the explicit permission of the poster is sought and received, but ABI is not responsible for any undesired dissemination of information by members of the Systers List. 

### Anonymous Aggregated Data

Anonymous data is information (originally personally identifiable or non-personally identifiable) that subsequently is used in aggregate form. We may collect anonymous data whether or not you are a registered member of ABI. We may use anonymous data for purposes of research or analysis. We may conduct research on our customer demographics, internet usage, and interests and behavior based on personal data we gather. Although anonymous data may be based in part on personal data, it does not identify you personally. 

ABI may share this type of anonymous data with a variety of third parties, including its affiliates, advertisers and other current and prospective business partners. ABI may use anonymous data collected for website administration, advertising and promotional purposes, for understanding the usage, viewing, and demographic patterns for certain programs, content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality on the Site(s), and we may share such information with various affiliated and unaffiliated entities for such purposes. We may also enter into agreements with outside companies that possess technology that allows us to customize the advertising and marketing messages you receive while using the Site(s). Your non-personally identifiable information and click stream data about your activities may be shared with these companies so this customization can be accomplished. Our agreement with these companies prohibits them from sharing your information with any third party or using it for any other purpose. Anonymous click stream and demographic information may also be shared with our advertisers and business partners. 

### Choice

You may, of course, decline to share your Personal Information with ABI, in which case ABI will not be able to provide to you some of the features and functionality found on the Site(s). If you would like us to limit communications to you or use or disclosure of your Personal Information, please make your request by email to privacy@anitaborg.org. We will respond within a reasonable period to notify you either that we will use reasonable efforts to accommodate your request or alternatively, that we are unable to do so and will delete your Personal Information from our databases. 

### Access

The accuracy of information provided by you to the Site(s) is your responsibility. You agree You will not knowingly post inaccurate information to the Site(s). In limited circumstances, such information may be changed or deleted by request. If someone has spoofed your e-mail address or you have another reason you would like to have such information edited or removed, please send an email to privacy@anitaborg.org with your request. Other Personal Information may be corrected, amended or deleted by requesting such change by email to privacy@anitaborg.org. 

### Security Notice

Except as required by law, ABI does not use encryption or other comparable security measures for the information that you provide to us, and accordingly it is possible that this information could be intercepted over the Internet or otherwise accessed by unauthorized parties. In addition, any information sent to us by email may not be secure during transit, due to the nature of email. We cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that you transmit to ABI, and you do so at your own risk. ABI does not provide any guarantees that information will not be accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. 

If ABI learns of a security systems breach we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. By using the Site(s) or providing personal information to us you agree that we can communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy and administrative issues relating to your use of the Site(s). ABI may post a notice on our Site(s) if a security breach occurs. If this happens, you will need a web browser enabling you to view the  
Site(s). ABI may also send an email to you at the email address you have provided to us, if any, in these circumstances. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice) you should notify us at privacy@anitaborg.org. 

### International Transfers

The Site(s) are hosted in the United States. If you choose to use the Site(s) from the European Union or other regions of the world with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, then please note that you are transferring your Personal Information outside of those regions to the United States and by providing your Personal Information on the Site(s) you consent to that transfer. 

### In the Event of Merger or Sale

In the event that ABI is acquired by or merged with a third-party entity, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information that we have collected from users as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control. 

### Third-Party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites

The Site(s) may be linked to internet websites operated by other companies or third-party sponsors. Some of these websites may be co-branded with our name or logo, even though they are not operated or maintained by us. ABI may also permit other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the Site(s). These third-party ad servers or ad networks may use technology to send, directly to your browser, some of the advertisements and links that appear on the Site(s). These advertisers may automatically receive your IP address if this happens. These advertisers may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content. 

You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party websites and third party ad servers or ad networks. ABI’s privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other third party advertisers or websites. Please be aware that ABI does not warn you when you have chosen to link through to another website from the Site(s). 

### Children

Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, the Site(s) are not intended for or directed to persons under the age of 13 and ABI does not knowingly collect or maintain Personal Information on the Site(s) from persons under 13 years-of-age. Any person who provides their information to ABI through any part of Site(s) represents to ABI that they are 13 years of age or older. If ABI learns that personally identifiable information of persons less than 13 years-of-age has been collected on ABI without verifiable parental consent, then ABI will take the appropriate steps to delete this information. If you are a parent or guardian and discover that your child under the age of 13 has provided Personal Information to ABI, then you may alert ABI at privacy@anitaborg.org and request that ABI delete that child’s personal information from its systems. 

### Cookies

To the extent website usage information is developed through use of session cookies, we will only use this information to facilitate your use of our Site(s). Cookies are data files that are written onto your computer by a website. Cookies remember information about your activities on a website. The data collected by the cookies is associated with your computer IP address for the duration of the cookie. ABI may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. At the end of your visit, the session cookies are removed. Per-session cookies do not permanently record data and are not stored on your computer’s hard drive. Per-session cookies are cached (stored in memory) while you are visiting the Site(s) and are deleted from your cache when you leave the Site(s). A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Site. Persistent cookies can be removed. Please review your web browser “Help” file to learn the proper way to modify your cookie settings. However, without cookies you will not have access to certain services on the Site. Third party advertisements displayed in connection with the Site may also contain cookies set by internet advertisers. We do not control these cookies and users of the Site should check the privacy policy of the advertiser to see whether and how it uses cookies. 

ABI may use “cookies” information to: (a) remember your information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the Site; (b) provide customized third-party advertisements, content, and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of third-party marketing campaigns; (d) monitor aggregate site usage metrics such as total number of visitors and pages viewed; and (e) track your entries, submissions, and status in any promotions or other activities. 

### Your California Privacy Rights

Beginning January 1, 2005, California law permits individuals who reside in California to request certain information regarding the disclosure of personal information collected by ABI to third parties for marketing purposes. If you are a California resident, and would like to know whom ABI shared information with and what information was shared you may request this information by contacting ABI as set forth below. ABI also honors any other legal disclosure requirements imposed by other applicable jurisdictions.
