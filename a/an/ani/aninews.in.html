<ul type="disc">
  <li>what kind of information we collect; </li>

  <li>why we collect it; </li>
  <li>how we use it; </li>
  <li>how we disclose it; </li>
  <li>opting in and out; </li>
  <li>management and security; </li>
  <li>how to seek access to and update your       personal information; and </li>

</ul>
<p>We may, from time to time,  review and update this policy, including taking account of new or amended laws,  new technology and/or changes to our operations. All personal information held  by us will be governed by the most recently updated policy. <br>
    <br>
  This policy was last updated in  January 2012. <br>
  <br>
  </p><h3>What information we collect<br>
  </h3>
  <p>In  general, the personal information we collect about you includes (but is not  limited to) your name, contact details including phone numbers and addresses. <br>
    We also  collect information about you that is not personal information. <strong>For example</strong>, we may collect data relating to your activity on our websites  (including IP addresses) via tracking technologies such as cookies, or we may  collect information from you in response to a survey. We generally use this  information to report statistics, analyse trends, administer our services,  diagnose problems and target and improve the quality of our products and  services. To the extent this information does not constitute personal  information, the National Privacy Principles do not apply and we may use this  information for any purpose and by any means whatsoever. <br>
    We  generally advise that you do not publish or communicate personal information,  or at least limit the personal information that you publish or communicate, to  the public via our services, such as in our classifieds, forums or blogs (<strong>Non-Confidential Information</strong>). You  acknowledge that we cannot control any third party collection or use of your  Non-Confidential Information. You agree that we may use and disclose  Non-Confidential Information for any purpose and by any means whatsoever. </p>
  <p>
  
  </p><h3>How we  collect it</h3><br>
    We may collect your personal information from a variety of sources,  including from you, advertisers, mailing lists, recruitment agencies, contractors  and business partners. We may collect your personal information when you  request or acquire a product or service from us, register with us as a member,  provide a product or service to us, complete a survey or questionnaire, enter a  competition or event, contribute in a fundraising event, participate in our  services (including our blogs and forums) or when you communicate with us by  e-mail, telephone or in writing (<strong>for example</strong> if you contact us to make a  complaint or provide feedback). <br>
    If, at  any time, you provide personal or other information about someone other than  yourself, you warrant that you have that person’s consent to provide such  information for the purpose specified. <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Why we collect it</h3><br>
    The  primary purpose for which we collect information about you is to provide you  with products and services you have requested. We also collect information  about you for the purposes outlined below. <br>
    We may  state a more specific purpose at the point we collect your information. <br>
    If you  do not provide us with the information that we request, we may not be able to  provide you with our products or services.<strong> For example</strong>,  if you do not register as a member of a website, you will not be able to access  features or services that are reserved for members only. <br>
    <br>
    <h3>How we use it</h3><br>
    In  addition to the primary purpose outlined above, we may use the personal  information we collect, and you consent to us using your personal information:
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
  <ul type="disc">
  <li>to provide you with news and information       about our products and services; </li>
  <li>to send marketing and promotional material       that we believe you may be interested in. This material may relate to any       of our businesses or a third party business which we believe may be of       interest to you; </li>
  <li>to personalise and customise your       experiences; </li>
  <li>to manage and enhance our products and       services; </li>
  <li>to communicate with you, including by email,       mail or telephone; </li>
  <li>to conduct competitions or promotions on       behalf of us and selected third parties; </li>
  <li>to verify your identity; </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>to investigate any complaints  about or made by you, or if we have reason to suspect that you are in breach of  any of our terms and conditions or that you are or have been otherwise engaged  in any unlawful activity; and/or </li>
  <li>as required or permitted by any  law (including the Privacy Act). </li>
</ul>
<p></p><h3>How we disclose it</h3><br>
  We may  disclose personal information, and you consent to us disclosing your personal  information, to other members of the our group (in which case, your personal  information will be collected, used, disclosed, managed and stored in  accordance with this policy). <br>
  We may  also disclose personal information, and you consent to us disclosing your  personal information, to third parties: <p></p>
<ul type="disc">

  <li>authorised by you to receive information       held by us; </li>
  <li>as part of any investigation into you or       your activity, <strong>for example</strong>, if we have reason to suspect that you have       committed a breach of any of our terms and conditions, or have otherwise       been engaged in any unlawful activity, and we reasonably believe that       disclosure is necessary to the Police, any relevant authority or       enforcement body, or your Internet Service Provider or network       administrator; </li>
  <li>as required or permitted by any law       (including the Privacy Act). </li>

<p></p><h3>Opting in or out</h3><br>
  At the  point we collect information from you, you may be asked to “opt in” to consent  to us using or disclosing your personal information other than in accordance  with this policy or any applicable law. <strong>For example</strong>,  you may be asked to opt-in to receive further information or communications  from our advertisers and supporters which do not fall into one of the  categories described above. <br>
  You  will generally be given the opportunity to “opt out” from receiving  communications from us or from third parties that send communications to you in  accordance with this policy. <strong>For example</strong>, you will be given the option  to unsubscribe from e-newsletters and other marketing or promotional material  sent by us. You may “opt out” from receiving these communications by clicking  on an unsubscribe link. <br>

  </strong><br>
  <h3>Management and security</h3><br>
  Other  than in relation to Non-Confidential Information, we will take all reasonable  steps to protect the personal information that we hold from misuse, loss, or  unauthorised access, including by means of firewalls, and password access. <br>
  However,  you acknowledge that the security of online transactions and the security of  communications sent by electronic means or by post cannot be guaranteed. You  provide information to us via the internet or by post at your own risk. We  cannot accept responsibility for misuse or loss of, or unauthorised access to,  your personal information where the security of information is not within our  control. <br>
  You  acknowledge that we are not responsible for the privacy or security practices  of any third party (including third parties that we are permitted to disclose  your personal information to in accordance with this policy or any applicable  laws). The collection and use of your information by such third party/parties  may be subject to separate privacy and security policies. <br>
  If you  suspect any misuse or loss of, or unauthorised access to, your personal  information, please let us know immediately. <br><br>
  <h3>Accessing and updating your information and how to contact us</h3><br>

  Members  of our websites will generally be able to access and update their membership  details online. <br>
  We  request that you keep your information as current as possible so that we may  continue to improve our service to you. <br>
