## INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE

### By Anime-Planet.

Anime-Planet does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or non-affiliated companies except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:

  * We provide the information to partners who work on behalf of or with Anime-Planet under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal information in connection with Anime-Planet’s provision of its services to you. They may also communicate with you about offers from Anime-Planet and our marketing partners. However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information. 
  * We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. 
  * We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Anime-Planet's terms of use, or as otherwise required by law. 
  * We transfer information about you if Anime-Planet is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, Anime-Planet will notify you, via an announcement on our site, before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.



Anime-Planet displays targeted advertisements based on personal information. Advertisers (including ad serving companies) may assume that people who interact with, view, or click targeted ads meet the targeting criteria—for example, women ages 18-24 from a particular geographic area. 

  * Anime-Planet does not provide any personal information to the advertiser when you interact with or view a targeted ad. However, by interacting with or viewing an ad you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad. 
  * Anime-Planet advertisers include financial service providers (such as banks, insurance agents, stock brokers and mortgage lenders) and non-financial companies (such as stores, airlines, and software companies). 



We may share aggregated information that includes non-identifying information with third parties for industry analysis, demographic profiling, and to deliver targeted advertising about other products and services. Any aggregated information shared in these contexts will not contain your personal information.

Please be aware that when you register to become an Anime-Planet member, post recommendations and reviews, register for and/or participate in forums and create personal lists such as lists of favorite characters, personal anime/mange lists, etc., other users are able to see that information, including any bio information you provide about you, location, gender, birth date and/or age, your screen or user name, in addition to any comments or submissions that you post or submit. We recommend that you guard your anonymity and sensitive information and that you not use your real name as your screen or user name to the extent that allows others to identify you.
