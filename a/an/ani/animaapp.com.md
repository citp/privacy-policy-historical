         automatically via his/her use of the Services (“Non-personal Information”).
         Such Non-personal Information does not enable us to identify the Visitor or
         User from whom it was collected. The Non-personal Information collected

    and Users’ Personal Information and/or Users-of-Users’ Personal Information, in
    its entirety or in part – depending on each of their particular roles and purposes
    in facilitating and enhancing our Services and business, and may only use it for
    such purposes.
    Note that while our Services may contain links to other websites or services, we
    are not responsible for such websites’ or services’ privacy practices. We
    encourage you to be aware when you leave our Services and read the privacy
    statements of each and every website and service you visit before providing your
    Personal Information. This Privacy Policy does not apply to such linked third
    -party websites and services.
                                             15


61. Law Enforcement, Legal Requests and Duties:
    Where permitted by local data protection laws, AnimaApp may disclose or
    otherwise allow others access to your Personal Information pursuant to a legal
    request, such as a subpoena, legal proceedings, search warrant or court order, or
    in compliance with applicable laws, if we have good faith belief that the law
    requires us to do so, with or without notice to you.
62. Protecting Rights and Safety:
    AnimaApp may share your Personal Information with others if we believe in good
    faith that this will help protect the rights, property or personal safety of
    AnimaApp, any of our Users, any Users-of-Users, or any member of the general
    public, with or without notice to you.
63. Social Media Features and Framed Pages:
    Our Services include certain Social Media features and widgets, single sign on
    features, such as the “Facebook Connect” or “Google Sign-in”, the “Facebook
    Like” button, the “Share this” button or other interactive mini-programs (“Social
    Media Features”).These Social Media Features may collect information such as
    your IP address or which page you are visiting on our Website, and may set a
    cookie to enable them to function properly. Social Media Features are either
    hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Services. Your interactions with
    these third parties’ Social Media Features are governed by their policies and not
    ours.
    In addition, our Services may enable you to share your Personal Information with
    third parties directly, such as via page framing techniques to serve content to or
    from Third Party Services or other parties, while preserving the look and feel of
    our Website and Services (“Frames”). Please be aware that if you choose to
    interact or share any Personal Information via such Frames, you are in fact
    providing it to these third parties and not to us, and such interactions and
    sharing too are governed by such third parties’ policies and not ours.
64. AnimaApp Subsidiaries and Affiliated Companies:
    We may share Personal Information internally within our family of companies,
    for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. For example, we may share your

    Personal Information with AnimaApp, our US-based subsidiary, in the course of
    facilitating and providing you (and your Users-of-Users) with our Services. In
    addition, should AnimaApp or any of its affiliates undergo any change in control,
    including by means of merger, acquisition or purchase of substantially all of its
    assets, your Personal Information may be shared with the parties involved in
    such event. If we have good faith that such change in control might materially
    affect your Personal Information stored with us, we will notify you via e-mail
    and/or prominent notice on our Website of this event and certain choices you
    may have regarding your Personal Information.
65. To clarify, AnimaApp may share your Personal Information in manners other than
    as described above, pursuant to your explicit approval, or if we are legally
    obligated to do so. Moreover, AnimaApp may transfer, share, disclose or
    otherwise use Non-personal Information in its sole discretion and without the

Communications from AnimaApp
71. Promotional Messages:
    We may use your Personal Information to send you promotional content and
    messages by e-mail, text messages, direct text messages, marketing calls and
    similar forms of communication from AnimaApp or our partners (acting on
    AnimaApp’s behalf) through such means.
    If you do not wish to receive such promotional messages or calls, you may notify
    us at any time or follow the “unsubscribe” instructions contained in the
    promotional communications you receive.
                                           18


    We take steps to limit the promotional content we send you to a reasonable and
    proportionate level, and to send you information which we believe may be of
    interest or relevance to you, based on your information.
72. Service and Billing Messages:
    AnimaApp may also contact you with important information regarding our
    Services, or your use thereof.
    For example, we may send you a notice (through any of the means available to
    us) if a certain Service is temporarily suspended for maintenance; reply to your
    support ticket or e-mail; send you reminders or warnings regarding upcoming or
    late payments for your current or upcoming subscriptions; forward abuse
    complaints regarding your User Website; or notify you of material changes in our
    Services.
    It is important that you are always able to receive such messages. For this
    reason, you are not be able to opt-out of receiving such Service and Billing
    Messages unless you are no longer a AnimaApp Visitor or User (which can be
    done by deactivating your account).
Data Retention
73. We may retain your Personal Information (as well as your Users-of-Users’
    Information) for as long as your User Account is active, as indicated in this
    Privacy Policy or as otherwise needed to provide you with our Services.
    We may continue to retain such Personal Information even after you deactivate
    your User Account and/or cease to use any particular Services, as reasonably
    necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes regarding our
    Users or their Users-of-Users, prevent fraud and abuse, enforce our agreements
    and/or protect our legitimate interests.
    We maintain a data retention policy which we apply to information in our care.
    Where your Personal Information is no longer required we will ensure it is
    securely deleted.
Security
                                           19


74. AnimaApp has implemented security measures designed to protect the Personal
    Information you share with us, including physical, electronic and procedural
    measures. Among other things, we offer HTTPS secure access to most areas on
    our Services; the transmission of sensitive payment information (such as a credit
    card number) through our designated purchase forms is protected by an industry
    standard SSL/TLS encrypted connection; and we regularly maintain a PCI DSS
    (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards) certification. We also regularly
    monitor our systems for possible vulnerabilities and attacks, and regularly seek
    new ways and Third Party Services for further enhancing the security of our
    Services and protection of our Visitors’ and Users’ privacy.
    Regardless of the measures and efforts taken by AnimaApp, we cannot and do
    not guarantee the absolute protection and security of your Personal Information,
    your Users-of-Users’ Information or any other User Content you upload, publish
    or otherwise share with AnimaApp or anyone else.
    We therefore encourage you to set strong passwords for your User Account and
    User Website, and avoid providing us or anyone with any sensitive information of
    which you believe its disclosure could cause you substantial or irreparable harm.
    Furthermore, because certain areas on our Services are less secure than others
    (for example, if you set your Support forum ticket to be “Public” instead of
    “Private”, or if you browse to a non-SSL page), and since e-mail and instant
    messaging are not recognized as secure forms of communications, we request
    and encourage you not to share any Personal Information on any of these areas
    or via any of these methods.
    If you have any questions regarding the security of our Services, you are welcome
    to contact us at ​privacy@animaapp.com​.
Public Forums and User Content
75. Our Services offer publicly accessible websites, blogs, communities and support
    forums. Please be aware that any information you provide in any such areas may
    be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of
    your Personal Information from our blogs, communities or forums, feel free to
    contact us at: privacy@animaapp.com. In some cases, we may not be able to
                                           20


    remove your Personal Information from such areas. For example, if you use a
    third party application to post a comment (e.g., the Facebook social plugin
    application) while logged in to your related profile with such third party, you
    must login into such application or contact its provider if you want to remove the
    Personal Information you posted on that platform.
76. In any event, we advise against posting any information (or use any posting
    means to post information) you don’t wish to publicize on these platforms.
77. If you upload any User Content to your User Account or post it on your User
    Website and/or provide it in any other way as part of the use of any Service, you
    do so at your own risk.
78. We have put adequate security measures in place to protect your Personal
    Information. However, we cannot control the actions of other Users or members
    of the public who may access your User Content, and are not responsible for the
    circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures you or we may have
    placed on your User Website (including, for instance, password-protected areas
    on your User Website). You understand and acknowledge that, even after its
    removal by you or us, copies of User Content may remain viewable in cached and
    archived pages or if any third parties (including any of your Users-of-Users) have
    copied or stored such User Content. To clarify, we advise against uploading or
    posting any information you do not wish to be public
Updates and Interpretation

    provisions of it will remain in full effect and an enforceable term will be
