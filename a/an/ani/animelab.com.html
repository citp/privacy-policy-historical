			Additionally, AnimeLab uses Google Analytics code that allows for certain forms of display advertising and other advanced features.

					Hey there, we see that you're running an ad-blocker and may be blocking ads on AnimeLab. By simply adding AnimeLab to your ad-blocker's whitelist you'll be ensuring that we can keep streaming free anime.
				</p>
				<p>
					Alternatively, why not get rid of ads forever by upgrading your account to Premium? You'll also get to watch dubbed shows, in HD and with no delays. It's a no brainer!
