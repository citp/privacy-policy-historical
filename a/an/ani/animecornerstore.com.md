# Privacy / Security Statement

[](http://us.st11.yimg.com/us.st.yimg.com/I/animecorner_1927_172695067)

**_Site Security at the Anime Corner Store_**

_**I Want you to Feel Comfortable Placing an Order!** _

_I know that you are concerned about Internet security. So am I! That's why we have built in some of the most advanced security technologies available for an on-line shopping site. The Store portion of Robert's Anime Corner uses a server which supports advanced 128-bit SSL encryption. Here's how it works:

**SSL encryption** is active on our site in all areas where customer information is requested. You can check to see that you have entered an SSL-active area by looking on the bottom of your screen. If you see 

**an unbroken key or a closed lock ** (depending on your browser), you will know that SSL technology is in place and ready to encrypt your information. _

_You'll see a key (Netscape) or a closed lock  (AOL & Internet Explorer).   
  
You can also check by looking at the URL line of your browser. When you are in an SSL-active area, the first letters of our website address will change from  **"http:" ** to  **"https:" ** (the 's' means 'secure'). 

When you place your order with my store online, your information is 

**transmitted across the Internet in an encrypted (scrambled) form , ** which is then decoded when it gets to our computers here. Your personal information, including your credit card information, is safe from prying eyes. _

_**Shop with confidence! ** _

**_Your Privacy and the Use of Your Personal Information_**

**Your Privacy Matters!**
