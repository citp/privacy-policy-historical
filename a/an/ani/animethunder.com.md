**Use of Cookies**

On the Internet, a “cookie” is a piece of information (a file) that a Web site transfers to a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. The use of cookies is common on the Internet. The process we use to serve advertisements and to track use of AnimeThunder.com involves cookies. We use cookies to recognize users who have already registered on AnimeThunder.com, allowing those users to speed up their future activities on the site. Cookies help AnimeThunder.com track the frequency and placement of advertisements. Cookies also enable us to measure aggregate (total) usage and traffic to AnimeThunder.com. This aids us in producing content that best meets our users’ preferences. We may use that information to display advertisements that we think will be of particular interest to you. You may configure your browser to reject cookies, but this may interfere with some functionality of AnimeThunder.com. Certain pages of AnimeThunder.com may contain electronic images (called a “single-pixel GIF” or “web beacon”) that allow a web site to count users who have visited that page. AnimeThunder.com may occasionally use web beacons in order to count users and to recognize registered users by accessing the AnimeThunder.com cookies.

**Information Use**

We use the information we gather for four general purposes:

• To customize the advertising and content you see.

• To enhance the user experience. We use tracking information to determine how well each page performs overall based on aggregate user demographics and traffic patterns to those pages. This helps us continue to build a better service for you.

• To fulfill your requests for certain products and services, such as sending out electronic newsletters and enabling users to participate in polls, contests etc.

• To send you information you agreed to receive about topics we think will be of interest to you.
