It may also be processed by third parties and staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers as necessary for operating the Site.  If any processing of your Information is to take place outside of the EEA in a third country or international organisation which does not ensure an adequate level of data protection, we may only transfer your Information if appropriate safeguards have been implemented and on the condition that enforceable data subject rights and effective legal remedies for data subjects are available.  The safeguards may be by way of EU Model Contract Clauses, binding corporate rules, approved code of conduct or approved certification mechanism.

      <strong>YOUR RIGHTS:</strong> You have a number of rights as a data subject as summarised below: 
      </p><ul>
        <li><strong>ACCESS:</strong> You have the right to obtain confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning you are being processed and, where that is the case, to access your Information and details of how we process it, as long as this does not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.  You may request a copy of Information undergoing processing, subject to evidence of your identity (normally a certified copy of your passport plus an original copy of a utility bill showing your current address). The first copy shall be provided without charge, but reasonable administration fees shall be charged for additional or subsequent copies.</li>

            <li>The Information has to be erased for compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>RIGHT TO RESTRICTION OF PROCESSING:</strong>  You have the right to restrict our processing on specified grounds.</li>
        <li><strong>NOTIFICATION:</strong>  Where you have asked us to rectify, erase or restrict processing of your information, we shall communicate the same to each recipient to whom your Information has been disclosed, unless this proves impossible or involves disproportionate effort, in which case we shall let you know.</li>  
        <li><strong>DATA PORTABILITY:</strong> You have the right in specific circumstances where processing is based on consent to receive your Information in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and have the right to transmit the Information to another controller without hindrance, provided that our processing is carried out by automated means.</li>
        <li><strong>RIGHT TO OBJECT:</strong>  In certain circumstances you have the right to object to our processing of your Information, including in relation to profiling, direct marketing or scientific or historical research purposes.</li>
        <li><strong>AUTOMATED INDIVIDUAL DECISION MAKING:</strong> You have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning you unless this is necessary for our contract, is authorised under applicable law or is based on your explicit consent.</li>
      </ul>
    <p></p>
    <p>You can exercise these right by contacting us at support@answerthepublic.com and/or by following our online account procedures.  We shall respond to your requests without undue delay and in any event within one month unless we need to extend such period by up to two further months in specific circumstances.  Please note that if you delete or restrict your account or required Information, this may prevent you from making full use of our Site.</p>


    <p><strong>SECURITY:</strong>  Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our Site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone, including people who work for us.</p>

    <p>The transmission of you Information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your Information, we cannot guarantee the security of your Information transmitted to or from our Site; any transmission is at your own risk.  Once we have received your Information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.</p>
