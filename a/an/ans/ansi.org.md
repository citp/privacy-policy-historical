## Information We Collect Through Automatic Data Collection Technologies

As you navigate through and interact with our Websites, we may use automatic data collection technologies to collect certain information about your equipment, browsing actions, and patterns, including:

  * Details of your visits to our Websites, including traffic data, location data, logs, and other communication data and the resources that you access and use on the Websites; and
  * Information about your computer and internet connection, including your IP address, operating system, and browser type.



We also may use these technologies to collect information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or other online services (behavioral tracking). For example, when someone visits a particular ANSI page they may receive future ads from Google on other sites they visit.  You can disable cookies in your browser settings and you can opt out of Google’s use of cookies at <https://www.google.com/settings/ads>, for information on how you can opt out of behavioral tracking on the websites and how we respond to web browser signals and other mechanisms that enable consumers to exercise choice about behavioral tracking.

The information we collect automatically is statistical data and does not include personal information, but we may maintain it or associate it with personal information we collect in other ways or receive from third parties. It helps us to improve our Websites and to deliver a better and more personalized service, including by enabling us to:  


  * Estimate our audience size and usage patterns;
  * Store information about your preferences, allowing us to customize our Websites according to your individual interests;
  * Speed up your searches; and
  * Recognize you when you return to our Websites.
  * The Websites automatically collect visitor data, which is not personally identifiable.  The data is used to understand the use of the site and to better understand the needs of our visitors.  The type of information that is collected about you for analytics may include demographics for age, gender, geographic location and language.  The Websites also collect information about which pages were visited, how long a visit lasted, and browser type or device and other information which is not personally identifiable. 
  * If you interact with forms on the Websites, you may provide personal information such as phone number, address and email address so we can interact with you directly.  The Websites use cookies.  Third parties, such as Google may use cookies to serve ads based on your visit.  These ads may appear on other sites you visit.  We also use third party email and cloud services for record keeping or to send information or deliver services to you.



The technologies we use for this automatic data collection may include:

  * Cookies (or browser cookies). A cookie is a small file placed on the hard drive of your computer. You may refuse to accept browser cookies by activating the appropriate setting on your browser. However, if you select this setting you may be unable to access certain parts of our Websites. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you direct your browser to our Websites;
  * Web Beacons. Pages of our Websites and our e-mails may contain small electronic files known as web beacons (also referred to as clear gifs, pixel tags, and single-pixel gifs) that permit ANSI, for example, to count users who have visited those pages or opened an email and for other related website statistics (for example, recording the popularity of certain website content and verifying system and server integrity).



We do not collect personal information automatically, but we may tie this information to personal information about you that we collect from other sources you provide to us.

## Third-Party Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies

Some content or applications, including advertisements, on the Websites are served by third-parties, including advertisers, ad networks and servers, content providers, and application providers.

## Choices About How We Use and Disclose Your Information

We strive to provide you with choices regarding the personal information you provide to us.

We have created mechanisms to provide you with the following control over your information:

## Accessing and Correcting Your Information 

You can review and change your personal information by logging into the Website and visiting your account profile page.

You may also send us an email at [privacy@ansi.org](mailto:privacy@ansi.org) to request access to, correct or delete any personal information that you have provided to us. We cannot delete your personal information except by also deleting your user account. We may not accommodate a request to change information if we believe the change would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect.

If you delete your User Contributions from the Websites, copies of your User Contributions may remain viewable in cached and archived pages, or might have been copied or stored by other Website users. Proper access and use of information provided on the Website, including User Contributions, is governed by our terms of use <https://www.ansi.org/about_ansi/terms>.

## Data Security  \- Applicable only to ANSI’s Webstore and Membership Dues Portal

We have implemented measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure.

Online transactions utilize a secure server and automated credit or debit card authorization service.  For security reasons, this system will store approval codes, but not credit card numbers.  Credit card information must be re-entered for all future transactions.

The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our Websites, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone. We urge you to be careful about giving out information in public areas of the Website like message boards. The information you share in public areas may be viewed by any user of the Websites.

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to our Websites. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any settings or security measures contained on the Websites.

If you believe, we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at [info@ansi.org](mailto:info@ansi.org) or [privacy@ansi.org](mailto:privacy@ansi.org).
