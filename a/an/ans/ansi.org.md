The American National Standards Institute, Inc. ("ANSI") is committed to protecting your personal information.

This Privacy Policy Statement applies to the following ANSI-administered website (the "ANSI website"): [www.ansi.org](https://web.archive.org/default.aspx). 

By using the ANSI website, you consent to the collection and use of information by ANSI as set forth herein. 

If ANSI changes its privacy policies it will post any changes to the ANSI Privacy Policy Statement so please continue to check this Statement for any updates. 

If you have any questions regarding this Privacy Policy Statement, please contact us at [info@ansi.org](mailto:info@ansi.org).

ANSI only collects information in order to assist your needs. ANSI may collect two different types of information: personally identifiable information you choose to provide, and non-personally identifiable information to help us better serve your needs.

**Personally Identifiable Information:**

ANSI collects information that you provide in order to provide you with ANSI’s services and/or products, and in some cases to contact you about our programs, products or services. Such information may include your name, email address, an account password, and for the purchase or our products or services, payment information.

We do not sell, rent or trade your personally identifiable information to third parties. We take reasonable steps to maintain the security of the personally identifiable information that we collect, however, no data transmission over the internet can be guaranteed to be completely secure.

We may share non-personally identifiable information (information that does not identify you individually) to our affiliates, partners or standards developers in order to provide the product or service you have requested. We may also share personally identifiable information to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request.

We may use your personally identifiable information to send you additional information about the products and services that we offer. We give you the option not to receive such further promotional information. We also provide you with a means to review and modify personal information that you have provided to ensure it is accurate and up-to-date, either directly online or by contacting our web site administrator at [info@ansi.org](mailto:info@ansi.org). 

If you would like to change any of your personally identifiable information, please send an email to [info@ansi.org](mailto:info@ansi.org).

**Non-Personally Identifiable Information:**

We use non-personally identifiable information to better understand your use of the ANSI website and to enhance your enjoyment and experience.

The ANSI website may utilize a technology called "cookies" to assist returning shoppers. Cookies are small bits of data that web servers store on the user's hard drive. Cookies record information about visits to a particular site, and can only be read back later by the site that created them. Cookies store data such as a log-in ID and password so that the user only has to enter that data once. Cookies make it possible to create a "shopping cart" into which the user can place selections before checking out. With cookies, a user can even log-off half way through a shopping expedition and pick up later at the point where he or she left the transaction. Though ANSI monitors traffic to its websites and the pages that are visited, neither "cookies" nor data about individual customers are correlated with viewing habits or shopping preferences. 

You can disable "cookies" on your computer by indicating this in the preferences or options menus in your browser. However, it is possible that some parts of the ANSI website will not operate correctly if you disable "cookies".

The ANSI website may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit the ANSI website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please contact us at [info@ansi.org](mailto:info@ansi.org).
