## Information We Collect about You and How We Collect It

We only collect information from or about you that is reasonably necessary for us to provide you or those on whose behalf you act the relevant service, business relationship and/or communication that is consistent with the nature of such service, business relationship and/or communication. As a result, we collect several types of information from and about users of our ANSI Sites, including **:**

  * Information by which you (or those on whose behalf you act) may be personally identified, such as name, postal address, e-mail address, telephone number, or any other information the website collects that is defined as personal or personally identifiable information under an applicable law, and any other identifier by which you may be contacted (”Personal Information”); 
  * Information that is about you but does not identify you individually; and/or
  * Information about your internet connection, the equipment you use to access our ANSI Sites and usage details.



As detailed below, we collect this information in three ways:

  * Directly from you when you provide it to us;
  * Automatically as you navigate through the ANSI Sites; information collected automatically may include usage details, IP addresses, and information collected through cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technologies; and
  * Indirectly from other sources, including from you or your principal's involvement in ISO USNC, and IEC, developing American National Standards, conformity assessment activities, and research, consulting and educational services.



> ### Information You Provide to Us Directly
> 
> The information we collect on or through our ANSI Sites may include:
> 
>   * Information that you provide by filling in forms on our ANSI Sites. This includes information provided at the time of becoming a member of ANSI, registering to use our ANSI Sites, subscribing to one of our services, posting material, or requesting further services. We may also ask you for information when you register for an event sponsored by us or when you report a problem with our ANSI Sites;
>   * Records and copies of your correspondence (including email addresses), if you contact us;
>   * Your responses to surveys that we might ask you to complete for research or scheduling purposes; and
>   * Your search queries on the ANSI Sites.
> 

> 
> You also may provide information to be published or displayed (hereinafter, “posted”) on public areas of the ANSI Sites, or transmitted to other users of the ANSI Sites or third parties (collectively, “User Contributions”). Your User Contributions are posted on and transmitted to others at your own risk. Although we do our best to protect your Personal Information, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. Additionally, we cannot control the actions of other users of the ANSI Sites with whom you may choose to share your User Contributions. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that your User Contributions will not be viewed by unauthorized persons.

> ### Information We Collect Automatically through Data Collection Technologies
> 
> As you navigate through and interact with our ANSI Sites, we may use automatic data collection technologies to collect certain information about your equipment, browsing actions, and patterns, including:
> 
>   * Details of your visits to our ANSI Sites, including traffic data, location data, logs, and other communication data and the resources that you access and use on the ANSI Sites; and
>   * Information about your computer and internet connection, including your IP address, operating system, and browser type.
> 

> 
> We also may use these technologies to collect information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or other online services (behavioral tracking). For example, when someone visits a particular page of an ANSI Site they may receive future ads from Google on other sites they visit.  You can disable cookies in your browser settings and you can opt out of Google’s use of cookies at <https://www.google.com/settings/ads>.
> 
> The information we collect automatically is statistical data and does not include Personal Information, but we may maintain such data or associate it with Personal Information we collect in other ways or receive from third parties. Automatic data collection helps us to improve our ANSI Sites and to deliver a better and more personalized service, including by enabling us to:
> 
>   * Estimate our audience size and usage patterns;
>   * Store information about your preferences, allowing us to customize our ANSI Sites according to your individual interests;
>   * Speed up your searches; and
>   * Recognize you when you return to our ANSI Sites.
> 

> 
> The ANSI Sites automatically collect visitor data, which is not personally identifiable.  The data is used to understand the use of the site and to better understand the needs of our visitors.  The type of information that is collected about you for analytics may include demographics for age, gender, geographic location and language.  The ANSI Sites also collect information about which pages were visited, how long a visit lasted, and browser type or device and other information which is not personally identifiable. 
> 
> The technologies we use for this automatic data collection may include:
> 
>   * Cookies (or browser cookies). A cookie is a small file placed on the hard drive of your computer. You may refuse to accept browser cookies by activating the appropriate setting on your browser. However, if you select this setting you may be unable to access certain parts of our ANSI Sites. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you direct your browser to our ANSI Sites;
>   * Web Beacons. Pages of our ANSI Sites and our e-mails may contain small electronic files known as web beacons (also referred to as clear gifs, pixel tags, and single-pixel gifs) that permit ANSI, for example, to count users who have visited those pages or opened an email and for other related website statistics (for example, recording the popularity of certain website content and verifying system and server integrity).
> 


> ### Information We Collect from Other Sources
> 
> As you participate in standardization, conformity assessment, and related educational and research activities, you may undertake activities or work with entities that, in turn, provide information which is collected by our companies. Here are a few examples of how we collect information from other sources. 
> 
> ANSI is the sole U.S. representative to ISO, and ANSI has a team that interfaces with ISO and plays an active role in ISO’s governance. Similarly, ANSI, through the USNC, serves as the focal point for U.S. parties interested in development, promulgation and use of globally-relevant standards for the electrotechnical industry.  When you or your principal participate in ISO and IEC standards development processes, we might acquire information from or about you, including in connection with your participation in U.S. Technical Advisory Groups, voting, committees, events, educational programs and research. 
> 
> ANAB is engaged in the assessment of conformance to standards, undertaking work and training in areas such as testing, certification, and accreditation of management systems, laboratories, products, and inspection bodies in a global marketplace.  ANAB is a member of international organizations of conformity assessment bodies, including the International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC),  International Accreditation Forum (IAF), Asia Pacific Accreditation Cooperation (APAC) and Inter-American Accreditation Cooperation (IAAC). When you or your principal participate in ILAC and IAF activities, ANAB might acquire information from or about you, including in connection with your participation in voting, committees, events, educational programs and research. 
> 
> Workcred, through research, consulting, education and training, and stakeholder collaboratives, is dedicated to increasing the quality, market value, and effectiveness of credentials.  Among its many activities, Workcred presents at national workforce conferences and serves on national task forces, panels and boards.  When you or your principal participate in these activities, Workcred might acquire information from or about you.
