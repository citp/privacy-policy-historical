		<h1 id="18">1. DATA PROTECTION</h1>
		<p>By submitting an order you agree to the processing by us of your personal information and the disclosure of that information as set out in this clause 8. Further information about the manner in which we process your information is set out in our privacy policy.</p>
		<p>We may use any personal information provided to us by you or obtained by us from any third party relating to you for any purposes relating to the provision of our goods and services.</p>
		<p>You agree that we may use Personal information provided by you in order to conduct appropriate anti fraud checks. Personal Information that you provide may be disclosed to a credit reference or fraud prevention agency, which may keep a record of that information.</p>
		<p>We may notify you by e-mail or by post about goods and services available from ANSH46. If you would prefer not to receive such information please e-mail us at the following address: customerservice@ANSH46.com</p>
		<p>We may disclose any personal information provided to us by you or obtained by us from any third party relating to you to:</p>
		<p>Any person, firm or company to whom we may sell the whole or a substantial part of our business or to whom we may transfer any part of our rights or obligations under this agreement; and For the purposes of assisting us in providing our goods and services and maintaining and supporting any equipment utilised by us we may need to disclose or provide access to personal data held by us relating to you to the supplier of such equipment or any third party providing maintenance and support services. Any such disclosure or access will be made under strict terms of confidentiality. Any such disclosure or transfer referred to above may take place via electronic means using the internet (or otherwise).</p>
		<p>The disclosures which we may make under clauses 8.4 and 8.5 above may involve the transfer of personal data relating to you to countries outside the european economic area which countries may not have in place adequate rules relating to data protection and privacy of personal data.</p>
		
		<h1 id="19">2. SECURITY POLICY</h1>
		<p>We use secure socket layer technology (ssl). This means that when you place orders with us on our secure online ordering system, all of the information is encrypted or scrambled, so that the data you send is an unintelligible string of seemingly random characters. When these characters are received by our web server, the server's ssl software converts them back into useful information. The same thing happens with data you receive from our server. Your interactions are therefore private.</p>
		
		<h2>PROTECTING YOUR SECURITY</h2>
		<p>To ensure that your credit, debit or charge card is not being used without your consent, we will validate name, address and other personal information supplied by you during the order process against appropriate third party databases. By accepting these terms and conditions you consent to such checks being made. In performing these checks personal information provided by you may be disclosed to a registered Credit Reference Agency which may keep a record of that information. You can rest assured that this is done only to confirm your identity, that a credit check is not performed and that your credit rating will be unaffected. All information provided by you will be treated securely and strictly in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998.</p>

		<h2>HOW DOES IT WORK?</h2>
		<p>You only need to register with vBv and SecureCode once to create your password for each of your relevant payment cards. Then whenever you shop online using your registered cards you'll be asked to enter the relevant password as an additional validation before the order is confirmed. Simply follow the instructions that appear once you have submitted your order. The details you enter in this process will be submitted to your card issuer over a secure link and can not be viewed nor will they be held by ANSH46.</p>
		
		<h2>WHAT IF I AM ALREADY REGISTERED?</h2>
		<p>If you've already registered you just need to enter your own personal password as indicated on the box that appears once you've submitted your order.</p>
