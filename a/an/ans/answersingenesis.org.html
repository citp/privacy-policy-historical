As such, it is an irrefutable argument—an “ultimate proof” of the Christian worldview. This book by astrophysicist and apologist Dr. Jason Lisle is a completely new 21st-century guide to defending the Christian faith, emphasizing the Genesis account of creation.</p>-->

	<p>In the first scientific study of its kind, the “Beemer Report” reveals startling facts discovered through 20,000 phone calls and detailed surveys of a thousand 20–29 year olds who used to attend evangelical churches on a regular basis, but have since left it behind.</p>
 
	<p>In this powerful book, popular author Ken Ham and consumer behavior research/analyst C. Britt Beemer combine to reveal trends that must be dealt with now . . . before we lose another generation!</p>
