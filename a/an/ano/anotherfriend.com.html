     <h1 class="article">Privacy Statement</h1>
     <span class="article">Last updated 26th June 2012</span>
     <br><br>
     <h2 class="article">1. We Protect Your Privacy</h2>
     <p class="article">At anotherfriend.com we have created this privacy statement to demonstrate our commitment to protecting your privacy and to inform you about how we handle your personal information.</p>
     <p class="article">This Privacy Statement only applies to transactions and activities in which you engage, and data gathered on anotherfriend.com and any other partner website to whom we may link, but does not apply to any other website or offline point of contact between anotherfriend.com, or any other company, and consumers</p>
     <p class="article">This is a legal document which sets out how anotherfriend.com (WebDev Ltd) handles and stores data which identifies you. You should read it in conjunction with our Terms &amp; Conditions and Safety Tips, of which this Privacy Statement forms part. Please review this Privacy Statement periodically as we will modify it from time to time. Each time you visit the Site and provide us with information, by doing so you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Statement at that time.</p>
     <p class="article">We confirm that all personal data collected and stored by us is held in accordance with the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003.</p>

     <h2 class="article">2. Your IP Address</h2>
     <p class="article">Like most E-commerce Websites, each time you visit the Site, we automatically collect your IP Address on the web page from which you came. In order to administer and optimise the Site for you and to diagnose problems with our Site, we use your IP Address to help identify you and to gather broad demographic information about you. We receive other data from the computer, mobile phone or other device you use to access anotherfriend.com.&nbsp;This may include your IP address, your location, type of browser used or the pages you visit.</p>

	<a name="cookie"></a>
    <h2 class="article">3. Cookies</h2>
    <p class="article">We use small files called "Cookies" to enhance the user experience of the WebDev Ltd service and to track some site activities. Most companies on the Internet use cookies (or similar technological methods), including our advertising partners and the platform. For example, we can use them to know that you are connected to the Site, to help you use the modules and share social or buttons to know when you interact with our advertising partners or platform.  If you wish to disable these cookies, the "help" section of your browser will tell you how but this will affect your access to some sections of the Site as you will only be able to browse the Site but will be unable to log on. You can find out more about cookies at www.cookiecentral.com.</p>

     <h2 class="article">4. Information we collect from you</h2>
     <p class="article">Anotherfriend.com only requests information that it is necessary in order for us to fulfill our obligations to you in providing the Dating service for which you have registered and providing introductions to other interested members. We require visitors to the Site to give us contact information (including their name and email address) and demographic information (like their age, occupation, height) to become a member. We then use this information to contact the visitor when necessary for support or to respond to member's emails. In this way, to protect your privacy, anotherfriend.com acts as a gateway for all messages, so your email address is never revealed and other members can only see the Site user name you have chosen. Thus, this is a two-way private email system which allows you to communicate without having to give your email address to others. The personal profiles that are posted on the Site are available to all visitors’ not just subscribers to the service.</p>
     <p class="article">We ask that you do not enter personal information or financial information in to your "Profile" (for example, don’t use your address as your user name, or include your name or address in your "about me" section) because if you do then it may be posted publicly on the Site and the information will then be treated as "demographic information" that is "Public Information".</p>
     <p class="article">The Site has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control and in order to comply with the provisions of the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003. All data is stored on highly protected databases, which are amongst the best software available today for secure software transactions. However, visitors should note that while WebDev Ltd makes all reasonable efforts to protect subscribers’ privacy, subscribers should be aware that information disclosed while connected to the Internet is transferred to the WebDev Ltd servers over a publicly available telecommunications network. WebDev Ltd cannot be held responsible, and accepts no liability, for unauthorised access to the public network beyond its reasonable control and all information provided by subscribers is done entirely at the subscribers’ own risk.</p>
     <p class="article">Personal data is collected and processed in accordance with the provisions of the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003 which is a piece of Irish legislation. WebDev Limited processes personal and non-personal data on our servers in the United States of America and in other countries. In some cases, we may process personal and non-personal data on a server outside of your own country. We may process personal and non-personal data to provide the Services. Where personal data is collected in a third country but processed and held on our servers in Ireland in order for WebDev Ltd to provide the service for which subscribers have subscribed, please note that any transfer of such data will only be such as is necessary for WebDev Ltd to perform the contract to which the subscriber is party. All such transfers, when taking place within WebDev Limited, are governed by EU- approved Binding Corporate Rules for International Data Transfer. Where such transfers are to a United States affiliate or subsidiary, we shall use reasonable endeavors to procure that such affiliate or subsidiary subscribes to the US “Safe Harbor” principles or such data transfers are governed by the provisions of an EU-approved Standard Form Model Contract for international transfers of data.</p>

     <h2 class="article">5. Information other Sites collect from you.</h2>
     <p class="article">On this website, we may place links to other websites operated by other parties. When you click on these links and visit other websites, regardless of whether or not they contain our brand-name, or other references to us, you need to be aware that we do not control these websites or their businesses, and this Privacy Policy does not apply to these Websites.
