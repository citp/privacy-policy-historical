<h2>PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
<p><br></p>
<p>Last Updated: March 1, 2007</p>
<p>Another Game Site strives to offer its visitors the many advantages of Internet technology and to provide an 
interactive and personalized experience. We may use Personally Identifiable Information (your name, e-mail address, street 
address, telephone number) subject to the terms of this privacy policy. We will never sell, barter, or rent your email 
address to any unauthorized third party. Period." </p>
<h4>How we gather information from users </h4>
<p>How we collect and store information depends on the page you are visiting, the activities in which you elect to 
participate and the services provided. For example, you may be asked to provide information when you register for access to 
certain portions of our site or request certain features, such as newsletters or when you make a purchase. You may provide 
information when you participate in sweepstakes and contests, message boards and chat rooms, and other interactive areas of 
our site. Like most Web sites, Another Game Site also collects information automatically and through the use of 
electronic tools that may be transparent to our visitors. For example, we may log the name of your Internet Service 
Provider or use cookie technology to recognize you and hold information from your visit. Among other things, the cookie may 
store your user name and password, sparing you from having to re-enter that information each time you visit, or may control 
the number of times you encounter a particular advertisement while visiting our site. As we adopt additional technology, we 
may also gather information through other means. In certain cases, you can choose not to provide us with information, for 
example by setting your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but if you do you may be unable to access certain portions of 
the site or may be asked to re-enter your user name and password, and we may not be able to customize the siteâ€™s features 
according to your preferences. </p>
<h4>What we do with the information we collect </h4>
<p>Like other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance your visit and deliver more individualized content and 
advertising. We respect your privacy and do not share your information with anyone. </p>
<p>Aggregated Information (information that does not personally identify you) may be used in many ways. For example, we may 
combine information about your usage patterns with similar information obtained from other users to help enhance our site 
and services (e.g., to learn which pages are visited most or what features are most attractive). Aggregated Information may 
occasionally be shared with our advertisers and business partners. Again, this information does not include any Personally 
Identifiable Information about you or allow anyone to identify you individually. </p>
<p>We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on Another Game Site to communicate with you about your 
registration and customization preferences; our Terms of Service and privacy policy; services and products offered by 
Another Game Site and other topics we think you might find of interest. </p>
<p>Personally Identifiable Information collected by Another Game Site may also be used for other purposes, including 
but not limited to site administration, troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce transactions, administration of 
sweepstakes and contests, and other communications with you. Certain third parties who provide technical support for the 
operation of our site (our Web hosting service for example) may access such information. We will use your information only 
as permitted by law. In addition, from time to time as we continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or 
partner with other companies or businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets. We 
may also disclose your information in response to a court order, at other times when we believe we are reasonably required 
to do so by law, in connection with the collection of amounts you may owe to us, and/or to law enforcement authorities 
whenever we deem it appropriate or necessary. Please note we may not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in such 
cases. </p>
<h4>Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements </h4>
<p>Another Game Site expects its partners, advertisers and affiliates to respect the privacy of our users. Be aware, 
however, that third parties, including our partners, advertisers, affiliates and other content providers accessible through 
our site, may have their own privacy and data collection policies and practices. For example, during your visit to our site 
you may link to, or view as part of a frame on a Another Game Site page, certain content that is actually created or 
hosted by a third party. Also, through Another Game Site you may be introduced to, or be able to access, information, 
Web sites, features, contests or sweepstakes offered by other parties. Another Game Site is not responsible for the 
actions or policies of such third parties. You should check the applicable privacy policies of those third parties when 
providing information on a feature or page operated by a third party. </p>
<p>While on our site, our advertisers, promotional partners or other third parties may use cookies or other technology to 
attempt to identify some of your preferences or retrieve information about you. For example, some of our advertising is 
served by third parties and may include cookies that enable the advertiser to determine whether you have seen a particular 
advertisement before. Other features available on our site may offer services operated by third parties and may use cookies 
or other technology to gather information. Another Game Site does not control the use of this technology by third 
parties or the resulting information, and is not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties. </p>
<p>You should also be aware that if you voluntarily disclose Personally Identifiable Information on message boards or in 
chat areas, that information can be viewed publicly and can be collected and used by third parties without our knowledge 
and may result in unsolicited messages from other individuals or third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of 
Another Game Site and this policy. </p>
<h4>Children </h4>
<p>Another Game Site does not knowingly collect or solicit Personally Identifiable Information from or about children 
under 13 except as permitted by law. If we discover we have received any information from a child under 13 in violation of 
this policy, we will delete that information immediately. If you believe Another Game Site has any information from or 
about anyone under 13, please contact us at the address listed below. </p>
<h4>Contacting Us. </h4>
<p>We can be reached by contacting: </p>
<p>Another Game Site</p>
<p>Email: admin@Another Game Site </p>
<h4>Changes to this Policy </h4>
<p>Another Game Site reserves the right to change this policy at any time. Please check this page periodically for 
changes. Your continued use of our site following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes. 
Information collected prior to the time any change is posted will be used according to the rules and laws that applied at 
the time the information was collected. </p>
<h4>Governing law </h4>
<p>This policy and the use of this Site are governed by California law. If a dispute arises under this Policy we agree to 
first try to resolve it with the help of a mutually agreed-upon mediator in the following location: Los Angeles, 
California. Any costs and fees other than attorney fees associated with the mediation will be shared equally by each of us.
</p>
<p>If it proves impossible to arrive at a mutually satisfactory solution through mediation, we agree to submit the dispute 
to binding arbitration at the following location: Los Angeles, California, under the rules of the American Arbitration 
Association. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitration may be entered in any court with jurisdiction to do so.
</p>
<p>Another Game Site is controlled, operated and administered entirely within California. This statement and the 
policies outlined herein are not intended to and do not create any contractual or other legal rights in or on behalf of any 
party.</p>
