                  </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                  If the Company is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, We will continue to ensure the confidentiality of any personal information and give affected Users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
              </p>
          </li>

          <li>
              <em>2.4 Where Your information is located</em>

      <p>
          We work hard to protect the Website and Our users from unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of information We hold.
      </p>
      <p>
          In particular:

      <ol>
          <li>
              We encrypt many of Our services using SSL
          </li>
          <li>
              We review Our information collection, storage and processing practices, including physical security measures, to guard against unauthorized access to systems.
          </li>
          <li>
              We restrict access to personal information to the Company’s employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to process it for Us, and who are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.
          </li>

      <p>
          Data you provide Us with will be stored on secure servers. We take all reasonable steps to ensure the safety of the data transfer in agreement with this Policy. Transmission of data via the Internet is never completely secure, thus a guarantee of data sent electronically or transmitted cannot be given. Information offered is therefore at Your own risk.
