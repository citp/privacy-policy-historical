### Information We Collect and Use

We collect and use personal information about you to establish your user account, and to interact with you to provide customer service. Specifically, when you set up an account with any of our services, we require your e-mail address and first and last name. You will also be asked to provide your phone number and address, which allows us to personalize our services to you; however, this information is optional and not required to establish an account.

We may also collect credit card information in connection with any purchase you may make. Any such information required to process a transaction is collected securely by our credit card processor and we do not have access to your credit card information, other than the last 4 digits of your account number, which we retain for tracking purposes.

At times we receive data from third-party organisations when they have received your consent to share data with third-parties.

### Information Sharing and Disclosure

Credit Card Processing. As mentioned above, we will pass your information securely to our credit card processor, as required. We only use credit card processors that are fully PCI compliant.

Aggregate, Non-Personal, or De-identified Information. We may share aggregated information (i.e., information about you and other users collectively, but not specifically identifiable to you) and other non-personal, de-identified, or anonymous information we collect, with third parties to optimize their ability to reach their target markets.

As Required by Law. We may be required to share your personal information with law enforcement or government agencies in response to subpoenas, court orders, federal/state audits or similar circumstances whenever we believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Use, or as otherwise required by law.

Business Transfer. As with any other business, it is possible that we could in the future enter into a substantial corporate transaction, such as the sale of our business, a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale. If such a transaction occurs, the successor company would have access to the information maintained by us, including your personal information, but would continue to be bound by this Privacy Policy.
