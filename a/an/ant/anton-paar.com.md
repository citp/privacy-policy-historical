# Privacy Policy :: Anton-Paar.com

The protection of your personal data is of particular concern to us. Therefore, we process your personal data only on the basis of the applicable data protection laws (GDPR). We take careful precautions to protect your data from loss, manipulation, and unauthorized access. The precautions are in accordance with the current state of technology. In this statement on our Data Privacy Policy we inform you about the most important aspects in the context of data processing on our website.  


### 1 | Storage of access data in server log files

You can visit our website without disclosing any personal information. We store only the access data in server log files such as the names of the files requested, the date and time of the query, the data volumes transferred, browser type, IP-address, and the requesting provider. These data are evaluated exclusively to ensure trouble-free operation of the site and to improve our offer, but do not allow any conclusions to be drawn about the person behind the user. In the case of concrete indications of unlawful use, we reserve the right to review the data retrospectively.  


### 2 | Cookies

Our website makes use of so-called cookies in order to recognize repeated use of our website by the same user/internet connection subscriber. Cookies are small text files that your internet browser downloads and stores on your computer. They are used to improve our website and services. 

To a certain extent, however, these cookies also pass along information used to automatically recognize you. Recognition is possible because your IP address is saved in the cookies. The information thereby obtained is used to improve our services and to enhance easier access to the website. 

You can prevent cookies from being installed by adjusting the settings on your browser software accordingly. You should be aware, however, that by doing so you may not be able to make full use of all the functions of our website. By using this website without deactivating the installation of cookies in your browser software, you consent to the processing of your data collected by Google in the manner and for the purposes set out above. 

### 3 | Contacting us

On our website we offer you the opportunity to contact us via our contact forms, via email or via LiveChat (see section 7). For the purpose of processing your request and subsequent communication with you, the information you provide will be stored and forwarded to the persons responsible exclusively within the Anton Paar Group (see section 7). A comparison of the data collected with data, which may be collected by other components of our site, is also not made. 

If you contact us via an email link (e.g. info@anton-paar.com), the date and time of the incoming mail, sender and recipient, and the subject of the email will be logged. These data are automatically deleted after two months. An evaluation of these data is only done to reconstruct and correct systemic deviations. The content of your email can only be viewed by the recipient.  


### 4 | Data storage Webshop (Service not applicable to every company of the Anton Paar Group.)

The data provided by you are required for the execution of the contract and for the performance of pre-contractual services and measures. Without this data we cannot conclude the contract with you. A transfer of data to third parties only takes place to the transport company commissioned by us for the delivery of the goods / and to our tax consultant for the fulfillment of our tax obligations (see section 7). 

Credit card data is never stored with us. Nevertheless, the protection of your payment-related information has the highest priority for transactions with credit card data. The entire payment process is for this reason handled by certified Payment Service Providers according to PCI-DSS standards, which have the best security systems and only forward the result of the transactions to us. This approach virtually eliminates the misuse of your data. 

In the case of a contract, all data from the contractual relationship are stored in any case until the expiry of the tax retention period. In any case, the data: name, address, purchased goods, and date of purchase will be stored at least until the end of product liability.
