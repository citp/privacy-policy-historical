			<b>AntennaWeb.org Privacy Policy (updated May 23, 2012)</b></p>
		<p>
			At <b>Broadcast Interactive Media, LLC</b>, we recognize the importance of privacy
			to users of AntennaWeb.org. This Privacy Policy explains what type of information
			may be collected from you when you access AntennaWeb.org and how that information
			may be used. Please note that this Privacy Policy pertains only to AntennaWeb.org,
			and is separate and distinct from the privacy policies, end user license agreements,
			terms or service, or terms of use governing: (a) YouNews®; (b) the web sites, applications
			and services of BIM's clients; (c) the web sites, applications and services that
			may link to or from AntennaWeb.org; and (d) other BIM web sites, applications or
			services.</p>
		<p>
			<b>Gathering of Information</b></p>
		<p>
			BIM may collect personally-identifying information from AntennaWeb.org for a variety
			of purposes. Such personally identifying information may include, but is not limited
			to, your address.</p>
		<p>
			BIM may ask you to provide certain personal information when you register for certain
			features or services that BIM may include AntennaWeb.org. BIM also may ask you to
			provide personal information in other limited circumstances specified at the time
			the information is gathered. Any information that you submit on or through AntennaWeb.org
			may become public.</p>
		<p>
			Like all other Web servers, BIM's Web server may automatically create log files
			for each user who accesses AntennaWeb.org. These "access logs" may allow BIM to
			make AntennaWeb.org more useful to our users. The access logs may record the identifier
			provided for your mobile device by your wireless carrier ("carrier identifier").
			Otherwise, the access logs do NOT record a user's name, address, e-mail address,
			credit card numbers, or any other personally-identifying information. Rather, they
			may contain some or all of the following information:<br>
			<br>
			</p><ul>
				<li>The Internet Protocol Address (IP Address) of the device which downloaded, installed
					or used the Mobile Application.</li>
				<li>The date of use.</li>
				<li>The time of use.</li>
				<li>The path taken through AntennaWeb.org.</li>
				<li>The operating system and device type being used.</li>
				<li>A list of files downloaded or viewed.</li>
				<li>The amount of time spent listening to/viewing media files.</li>
				<li>Any errors encountered.</li>
				<li>The device’s geographic location.</li>
			</ul>
		<p></p>
		<p>
			<b>Cookies and Other Technologies</b></p>
		<p>
			BIM may also use 'cookies' to collect information. A cookie is a string of characters
			that can be written to a file on the user's device when the user accesses AntennaWeb.org.</p>
		<p>
			BIM may use cookies to track users' activity through AntennaWeb.org in order to
			improve the site, the application architecture, to offer the features that would
			not be possible without them, to offer third party content, and to recall specific
			information to save the user time during subsequent use of AntennaWeb.org. For example,
			cookies may allow BIM to remember your (and/or your device’s) location. Interactive
			features may also use cookies. Our sponsorship service vendors, which serve sponsorship
			messages onto AntennaWeb.org, and third party vendors that measure and analyze the
			use of AntennaWeb.org for BIM, may also use their own cookies.</p>
		<p>
			BIM and the third party vendors that measure and analyze use of AntennaWeb.org for
			BIM also may use web beacons, alone or in conjunction with cookies, to help compile
			information about and facilitate usage of AntennaWeb.org. A web beacon is an electronic
			image, also known as a single-pixel (1x1) or clear .gif., which can be used to recognize
			certain information on your device, such as cookies, the time and date of your actions
			within AntennaWeb.org, and a description of where content is placed. We may use
			web beacons on AntennaWeb.org from time to time for this and other purposes.</p>
		<p>
			<b>Use of Information</b></p>
		<p>
			BIM may use personally-identifying information to:<br>
			<br>
			</p><ul>
				<li>manage or administer AntennaWeb.org;</li>
				<li>optimize or customize the delivery of advertising or content to you and other users
					of AntennaWeb.org;</li>
				<li>respond to user messages; </li>
				<li>list device location (city, state and/or country) information;</li>
				<li>contact users for an online survey;</li>
				<li>send e-mail newsletters and other communications, including marketing and promotional
					communications, from BIM, BIM sponsors, BIM suppliers, BIM licensors, and BIM clients
					to users;</li>
				<li>other internal BIM or BIM client purposes; and/or</li>
				<li>for other purposes specified at the time the information is gathered.</li>
			</ul>
		<p></p>
		<p>
			Excluding information provided by the user, which may become public as discussed
			above, personally-identifying information collected by BIM may be given to the following
			third parties:<br>
			<br>
			</p><ul>
				<li>BIM’s clients, suppliers, licensors, advertising partners, and service vendors;
					and</li>
				<li>other third parties when you specifically consent to such distribution (such as
					the disclosure of your name to a friend when you email, send via SMS or text message,
					or otherwise share a story to that friend).</li>
			</ul>
		<p></p>
		<p>
			In these circumstances, the information is provided to a third party for the purposes
			of<br>
			<br>
			</p><ul>
				<li>send e-mail newsletters and other communications, including marketing and promotional
					communications, from BIM, BIM sponsors, BIM suppliers, BIM licensors, and BIM clients
					to users;</li>
				<li>delivering communications from BIM or BIM clients, suppliers, licensors, advertising
					partners or service vendors;</li>
				<li>providing services for and on behalf of BIM; or </li>
				<li>serving other BIM purposes.</li>
			</ul>
		<p></p>
		<p>
			BIM also may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or if it
			believes that such action is necessary to: (a) comply with the law or with legal
			process, (b) protect against misuse or unauthorized use of AntennaWeb.org, or (c)
			protect the personal safety or property of users of AntennaWeb.org, the public or
			BIM and its employees.</p>
		<p>
			If you do not want your personally-identifying information to be collected or used
			for any of these purposes, please do not provide it and do not access AntennaWeb.org.</p>
		<p>
			<b>Third-Party Advertising</b></p>
		<p>
			We use several third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you access AntennaWeb.org.
			Some of these companies may use information about your visits to this and other
			websites in order to provide advertisements on AntennaWeb.org and other sites about
			goods and services that may be of interest to you. If you would like more information
			about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used
			by some of these companies, please <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="new">click here.</a></p>
		<p>
			<b>Security</b></p>
		<p>
			BIM has in place what we believe to be appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial
			procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. However, no
			Internet, e-mail or mobile transmission is ever fully secure or error free and BIM
			cannot guarantee that any information will be or remain safe or secure. Because
			most e-mail and mobile transmissions are not encrypted, you should take special
			care in deciding what information you send to us via e-mail, SMS or text message,
			or other mobile transmission.</p>
		<p>
			<b>Children</b></p>
		<p>
			If you are under 13 years of age, please do not access AntennaWeb.org. AntennaWeb.org
			is not intended for children under 13, and BIM will not knowingly collect any information
			from any children under the age of 13. If we discover that we have collected any
			personally-identifying information from a child under the age of 13, we will promptly
			remove that information from our database.</p>
		<p>
			<b>Acceptance of Privacy Policy Terms</b></p>
		<p>
			BIM reserves the right to change this policy. Any changes to this policy will be
			posted to this page as soon as reasonably possible, so please check this page periodically.
			Use of AntennaWeb.org constitutes consent to any policy then in effect.</p>
		<p>
			<b>Links to other Sites and Services</b></p>
		<p>
			It is important to note that AntennaWeb.org may contain links to other sites, applications
			and services maintained by third parties that may not follow the same privacy policies
			as AntennaWeb.org. For instance, clicking or tapping on a sponsorship notice or
			some third party logos on AntennaWeb.org will take you to an entirely different
			site, application or service. These sites, applications and services may use cookies,
			collect data, and use the data in ways that AntennaWeb.org would not. BIM is not
			responsible for the privacy practices or any information or materials on these other
			sites, applications and services. Please visit these sites or applications if you
			wish to review their privacy policies.</p>
		<p>
			AntennaWeb.org may in the future include certain embedded tools provided and controlled
			by third parties and governed by the terms and policies of the third parties. You
			should only use these third party tools if you agree to their respective terms and
			policies.</p>
		<p>
			AntennaWeb.org may include a tool that allows you to sign in using information from
			your account with a third party service, such as Facebook, Twitter, Google, Yahoo,
			OpenID, or LinkedIn. Please be aware that those third party services are unrelated
			to BIM, and that your use of the third party services is subject to the terms and
			policies of those services.</p>
		<p>
			<b>International User Notice</b></p>
		<p>
			For international users, please note that it may be necessary to transfer your information
			internationally and, in particular, your information may be transferred to and processed
			in the United States. For residents of the European Union: the data protection and
			other laws of other countries outside of the European Union may not be as comprehensive
			as those of the European Union. Please be assured that we take steps to ensure that
			your privacy is protected as described in this policy. By accessing AntennaWeb.org,
			you agree to have your information used and transferred to the United States as
			set forth in this policy. If you access AntennaWeb.org from the European Union,
			Asia, or any other region with laws or regulations governing personal data collection,
			use and disclosure that differ from United States laws, please be advised that through
			your continued use of AntennaWeb.org, which is governed by U.S. law and this Privacy
			Policy, you are transferring your personal information to the United States and
			you consent to that transfer.</p>
		<p>
			<b>In the Event of Merger, Sale, or Bankruptcy</b></p>
		<p>
			In the event that BIM or AntennaWeb.org business is acquired by or merged with a
			third party entity, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer
			or assign the information we have collected from our users as part of such merger,
			acquisition, sale, or other change of control. In the unlikely event of our bankruptcy,
			insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors,
			or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors' rights generally,
			we may not be able to control how your personal information is treated, transferred,
			or used.</p>
		<p>

			us at <a href="mailto:legal@bimlocal.com?subject=Antenna%20Web%20Privacy%20Policy%20Feedback" title="Click here to email BIM regarding this Privacy Policy.">legal@bimlocal.com</a>.</p>
