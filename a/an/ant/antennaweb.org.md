**Our Committment to Privacy**  
Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To ensure this notice is easy to find, it is available on our homepage and at every point where personal identification is requested.

**The Way We Use Information**  
We use the information you provide to promote HDTV-related consumer products. We also use the information you provide to conduct research. We do not share the information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete the delivery of marketing materials or research.

Removal requests made any other way may not be processed.  
  
**Our Commitment To Data Security**  
We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose any information that could be used to identify those individuals.  
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.  
**Our Commitment To Children's Privacy**  
Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under the age of 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under the age of 13.  
To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.  
**How To Contact Us**  
Should you have other questions or concerns about these privacy policies, please send us an e-mail at [CEA@CE.org](mailto:CEA@CE.org).   
Effective December 2004
