Funcom takes the privacy of its customers seriously and wants you to understand how and why it collects, uses and maintains the privacy of your personal information. This Privacy Policy is part of the Terms of Use for the Services offered by Funcom. Funcom is not responsible or liable for any third party websites not under the control of Funcom, accessible through the Game or from Funcom controlled websites. This Privacy Policy does not apply to such third party websites. Accessing Funcom’s website implies acceptance of the Funcom Privacy Policy.

### What information does Funcom collect?

Personal Information: Funcom collects information you voluntarily provide during the registration process in order to grant you access to products and service provided by Funcom and its affiliates. This "Personal Information" may include your name, your address, your email, and payment details such as credit card information. Funcom uses this information to collect payments and to provide access to our products and services.

Computer Information: Funcom may collect and store your internet protocol address.  As noted in individual game's End User License Agreements and/or Terms of Service. We may use this information to remotely check your computer to determine if any “Restricted Software” (as such term is defined in the EULA) is installed or if any necessary software patches supplied by Funcom have been installed.

Chat Room Information: Funcom may monitor any Chat room on the Funcom website(s) for the purpose of determining whether a violation of the Chat room guidelines has occurred and to take appropriate action as we deem reasonably necessary. Funcom encourages you not to use your real name or disclose personal information in a Chat room – once posted any personal information will no longer be private.

Non-personal Information: Funcom may from time to time collect information such as number of players on-line for a particular time period, number of players by country, and average session length on an aggregated basis. This non-personal information does not specifically identify you or any other single user.

### How do we protect your personal information and do we share it with others?

Information In Transit: To protect private and confidential information from interception and visibility to unauthorized persons while in transit, the connection between your web browser and the registration server operated by Funcom is encrypted and verified using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology. When setting up a unique session between you and Funcom, the server at Funcom will send its public key to your browser. In return, your browser will generate a randomly generated secret key based on the key it received from Funcom. This key is then sent back and checked by the server at Funcom. Transferring personal data over the Internet may involve transferring the data on electronic systems in jurisdictions with a different level of data protection regulations than in the EEA. By accepting this Privacy Policy you accept that transfer of personal data can take place over the Internet by use of electronic systems in such jurisdictions.

Information In Storage: Information you provide to Funcom is stored on servers operated by Funcom AS, Oslo, Norway and physically placed in the United States and The Netherlands. The servers handling registrations are placed in a physically shielded environment. By clicking on the padlock symbol in your browser you can check the information encapsulated in the certificate to verify you are connected to the registration server owned and operated by Funcom.

While Funcom uses reasonable efforts to protect your privacy, due to the nature of the Internet we cannot guarantee that a third party will not be able to unlawfully intercept a private communication. BY ACCEPTING THIS PRIVACY POLICY, YOU ACCEPT THE RISKS RELATED TO POSSIBLE UNLAWFUL INTERCEPTIONS OR EXPLOITATIONS OF YOUR INFORMATION BY THIRD PARTIES AND RELEASE FUNCOM OF ANY LIABILITY IN THIS REGARD.

We may provide your personal information on a confidential basis to affiliates of Funcom and third parties necessary to allow Funcom to provide you with the Services.

FUNCOM ENDEVOURS TO ENSURE THAT ALL PARTNERS FOLLOW THE SAME OR SIMILAR HIGH STANDARDS OF DATA PROTECTION. ALL COMMUNICATIONS OF PERSONAL DATA TO PARTNERS ARE HANDLED USING THE INDUSTRY STANDARD SECURE SOCKETS LAYER (SSL) ENCRYPTION. BY ACCEPTING THIS POLICY YOU CONSENT TO THE TRANSFER OF YOUR INFORMATION TO A THIRD PARTY FOR FRAUD SCREENING, PAYMENT PROCESSING AND ANY OTHER PARTNER REQUIRED TO PROVIDE CONTINUED SERVICE.

Beyond this period Funcom does not guarantee that your old characters and their names will not be deleted. We may ask you to re-provide certain information for verification purposes.
