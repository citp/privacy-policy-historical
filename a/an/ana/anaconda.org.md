These third party service providers are limited to only using information as instructed to provide contracted services to us.

Anaconda may also disclose your personal data as required by law such as to comply with a subpoena or similar legal process.

**EU-U.S. AND SWISS-U.S. PRIVACY SHIELD FRAMEWORK**

Anaconda has adopted and complies with the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks (“Privacy Shield”) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data transferred from the European Union to the United States or personal data transferred from Switzerland to the United States.  Anaconda has self-certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles.  If there is any conflict between the terms in our privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.  To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit the [Privacy Shield Website](https://www.privacyshield.gov/).

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has jurisdiction over Anaconda’s compliance with the Privacy Shield.

Under the Privacy Shield, Anaconda is responsible for the processing for personal data we receive and subsequently transfer to a third party service provider acting for or on our behalf. Anaconda is also liable for ensuring that the third party service providers we engage support our Privacy Shield commitments. Further, all Anaconda employees who handle personal data from the EU are also required to comply with the principles stated in this Policy.

In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles Anaconda commits to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your personal data.

Anaconda also commits to cooperate with and comply with the advice of the Commissioner with regard to personal data transferred from Switzerland. In either instance, such action is provided at no cost to you.

Under certain conditions, more fully described on the [Annex I to the Privacy Shield Principles](https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=ANNEX-I-introduction), you may invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.

Anaconda has taken steps to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of systems and services processing personal data, and will restore the availability and access to personal data in a timely manner in the event of a physical or technical incident.

Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. If we change this Privacy Policy in ways that affect how we use your personal data, we will advise you of the choices you may have as a result of those changes. We will also post a notice on our website that this Privacy Policy has changed.
