<p><span>This statement details how Analog Devices, Inc., One Technology Way, Norwood, Massachusetts, USA 02062 (“ADI”) handles any personal information visitors may disclose through their use of the Web site (“Site”).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Collection of Personal Information</span></p>
<p>
Visitors to the ADI Site may use many of the Site’s features without revealing any information that ADI can use to identify visitors personally, such as name, address, phone number or email address (“personal information”). However, in some instances, ADI requests that users provide certain personal information in order to facilitate future communications, make a purchase of Analog Devices products, or receive software, tools, information or other materials from ADI. This policy sets forth the practices that Analog Devices intends to follow with respect to such personal information, as well as other information that can be used to identify a visitor’s computer or device. The Analog Devices policy governing the personal information of employees, independent contractors, consultants and job applicants can be found&nbsp;<a href="http://www.analog.com/en/about-adi/careers/job-search/adi-global-data-privacy-policy-statement.html">here</a>.</p>
<br>
<span class="analog-text-bold">Declining the Collection of Personal Information</span><br>
<br>
To the extent that ADI seeks personal information from you, you will be prompted to provide that information, but you will always have the choice to decline to provide the information and not receive the services or materials from ADI.<br>
<br>
<span class="analog-text-bold"><a name="cookies"></a>Cookie Notice</span><br>
<br>
A cookie is a tiny piece of text placed on your computer's hard drive by a website you visit. Cookies help the website to remember information about your visit, like your preferred language and other settings. This makes the website more user friendly and your visits to the site more productive for you.
<div><br>
</div>
<div>ADI uses cookies for many purposes. &nbsp;For example, we use cookies to continuously evaluate and improve our Site’s performance, navigation and ease of use. We also use cookies to improve the effectiveness and relevance of our email communications.&nbsp;<br>
<div><br>
</div>
</div>
<div>Your privacy matters to ADI so whether you are new to our Site or a long-time user, please do take the time to get to know our practices on use of cookies, provided below.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>We use cookies in order to enable the basic functioning of the Site, performance and functionality cookies in order to enable and streamline the basic functioning of the Site across multiple webpages and browser sessions, to simplify your use of our Site, to monitor, analyze and improve the performance and effectiveness of our Site, and advertising or targeting cookies to serve you advertisements that are customized and relevant to you. Cookies collect the following information: User Country, Language, Location Information, User Company, Industry Information and User Enrollment Attributes such as E-mail and First and Last Name. &nbsp;These tools also allow ADI to track your use of the Site over time and associate that data with other information, such as your IP address. They also can provide information about your responses to our emails.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Personal information and data collected by these cookies is stored on servers in the United States, i.e. in a country outside the European Economic Area. Please be aware that United States law may not offer the same privacy protections as the law of your jurisdiction. If you do not want your personal information and data to be collected, processed and stored in the United States of America, you should not use the Site.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>One advantage to you as a visitor to the Site is that information requested by us for purchasing ADI products will be pre-filled for you based on the ID we collect via a cookie. This saves you time in filling out information when visiting the Site and requesting information or samples, or when signing up for myAnalog, or any other function within the Site that requires registration. We also use information from cookies to identify ways to improve the Site.</div>
<div><br>
<div>
<p>ADI also uses these tools in its online advertising efforts. For example, we use these tools to tailor the communications that we send to you, including marketing messages and online ads.</p>
<p>ADI partners with certain third-party service providers to collect and analyze the information discussed above. These third parties may use web beacons and web logs or set and access cookies on your computer or other device. You may opt out of the use of ADI cookies by adjusting your browser settings accordingly. The use of cookies is voluntary, i.e. you can always disable the cookies by changing your cookie settings. However, please note that certain cookies are essential for the functionality of the Site, and rejecting all cookies may therefore limit or disrupt the quality of the Site and therefore your customer experience. The use of the site is possible anonymously or by using an alias, unless you purchase ADI products.&nbsp;</p>

<span class="analog-text-bold">How ADI Uses and Shares your Personal Information</span><br>
<br>
ADI will use the personal information you provide for legitimate business purposes, such as to facilitate future communications with you, assist you in making a purchase of ADI products, respond to your request for ADI information and materials, or inform you about products or services that might interest you. ADI will share your personal information with authorized third parties in connection with fulfillment of legitimate business uses that are intended to serve you, such as shipping products or materials requested by you. ADI also may share your information with our distribution partners and others in order for them to provide you with information about ADI and other products and services that we believe may be of interest to you. In addition, ADI reserves the right to collect and share personal information as part of (i) an investigation or response to a violation of ADI terms and conditions of use, fraud, illegal activities or other actions or threats that may damage ADI, the Site, or other property, or injure or threaten ADI's customers or other persons, (ii) compliance with a court order, subpoena, government investigation or other legal process, or (iii) transfer or sale of a business unit. Finally, ADI uses third-party platforms to store, analyze, and manage certain personal and other information, which helps ADI improve its operations, marketing and customer service and more effectively tailor our communications with you.<br>
