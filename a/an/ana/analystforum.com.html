<td><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">analystforum.com's Privacy
Policy:</font></font></b>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">analystforum.com's policy
is to respect and protect the privacy of our users. This policy statement
tells you how we collect information from you and how we use it. Using
the Internet should be a fun experience and we want to help you make it
so.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1"></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">The information you provide
analystforum.com will not be disclosed to third parties without your consent.
analystforum.com may disclose user information in special cases when we
have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to
identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing
injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally)
analystforum.com's rights or property, or anyone else that could be harmed
by such activities. analystforum.com may disclose user information when
we believe in good faith that the law requires it.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1"></font></font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">analystforum.com shares aggregate
information about our users with advertisers, business partners, sponsors
and other third parties. For example, we will say analystforum.com's audience
is x percent females and y percent males. This data is used to customize
analystforum.com's content and advertising to deliver a better experience
for our users.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1"></font></font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">There are cases where analystforum.com
may ask you for personal information such as your name, email address,
and birth date. For example, we request personal information when you register
for our forums account, for online shopping, or auctions. analystforum.com
needs to collect this information for fulfilling prizes, tracking/verifying
compliance with analystforum.com's policies as well as federal, state and
local laws and/or for editorial and feedback solicitation purposes.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1"></font></font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">In case you change your mind
or some personal information may change (such as your zip code), we will
endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove the personal data
you give us. You can do this at the member information page or by contacting
Customer Service at <a href="mailto:customerservice@analystforum.com">customerservice@analystforum.com</a>.</font></font>
</p><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">Use of IP Addresses:</font></font></b>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">An IP address is a number
that's automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing
the Web. Web servers -- the big computers that "serve up" Web pages --
automatically identify your computer by its IP address.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">analystforum.com collects
IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, to report aggregate
information to our advertisers, and to audit the use of our site. When
guests request pages from analystforum.com, our servers log the guests'
IP addresses. We do not normally link IP addresses to anything personally
identifiable, which means that a user's session will be logged, but the
user remains anonymous to us. We can and will use IP addresses to identify
a user when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our house
rules or terms of service or to protect our service, site, customers or
others.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">Some services within analystforum.com,
such the Forums area, may display IP addresses along with the message poster's
name and message.</font></font>
</p><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">Opt-In and Opt-Out Features:</font></font></b>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">analystforum.com puts control
over communications directed to you where it belongs... in your hands:&nbsp;</font></font>
</p><ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">We send e-mail newsletters only
to users who ask to receive them.&nbsp;</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">Once you are on the list --
you can easily get off. Each e-mail newsletter you receive has your address
stamped on it, along with simple instructions on how to immediately unsubscribe
that address from our newsletter list.&nbsp;</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">We will never make your name
or address available to any other companies or agencies.</font></font></li>
</ul>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">Links to Other Sites:</font></font></b>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">Users should be aware that
when you are on analystforum.com, you could be directed to other sites
that are beyond our control. There are links to other sites from analystforum.com
pages that take you outside our service. For example, if you "click" on
a banner advertisement or a listing in the Test Preparation Directory,
the "click" takes you off the analystforum.com site. This includes links
from advertisers, sponsors and partners. These other sites may send their
own cookies to users, collect data or solicit personal information.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">Please keep in mind that
whenever you give out personal information online --- for example, via
message boards or chat --- that information can be collected and used by
people you don't know. While analystforum.com strives to protect its user's
personal information and privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any
information you disclose online and you do so at your own risk.</font></font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">analystforum.com's policy
does not extend to anything that is inherent in the operation of the Internet,
and therefore beyond analystforum.com's control, and is not to be applied
in any manner contrary to applicable law or governmental regulation.</font></font>
</p><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">Your Acceptance of These
Terms:</font></font></b>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">By using this site, you
signify your assent to the analystforum.com Privacy Policy. If you do not
agree to this policy, please do not use our site. Your continued use of
the analystforum.com site following the posting of changes to these terms
will mean you accept those changes.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1"></font></font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">If you have any questions
or comments about our privacy practices, please contact us at <a href="mailto:customerservice@analystforum.com">customerservice@analystforum.com</a>.</font></font></p></td>
