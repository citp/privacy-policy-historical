# Privacy Policy | Anastasia Beverly Hills

When you provide Anastasia Beverly Hills ("ABH") with information through the Anastasia Beverly Hills web site (the "Site"), we respect your privacy. It is important for you to understand what information we collect about you during your visit and what we do with that information. Your visit to the Site is subject to this Privacy Policy and our Terms and Conditions. Please note that this Privacy Policy governs only information provided to the Site and communications from ABH through the Site. It does not govern any other information or communications that may reference ABH.

1\. COLLECTION OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION BY ABH

ABH does not collect personally identifiable information about you, unless you choose to provide us with such information directly or through a third party. For example, if you decide to complete a user registration form, complete an online survey or make a purchase, you may be asked to provide certain information such as your contact information (name, email address, mailing address, and telephone number), occupation, age group, gender and product and/or cosmetic concerns, and the brands and products that you typically use. If you decide to place an order, we will also need to know your delivery and billing address, credit card number, and expiration date. To protect your personal information, users registering at the Site must also enter a user name/email address and password. If you would prefer that we not collect any personally identifiable information from you, please do not provide us with any such information. When you submit your personally identifiable information on the Site, you are giving your consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.

2\. USE OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION BY ABH

If you opt-in during the Site registration process or at other times when you submit personally identifiable information, the information you provide may be used by ABH to create and deliver to you emails such as our newsletters, surveys or other email messages containing product and event information, cosmetics tips or promotions ("Opt-In Emails"). If you prefer not to receive such Opt-In Emails, please do not opt-in to receive these emails. If you do opt-in and later decide that you would no longer like to receive these emails, see Section 13 (Choice/Opt-Out) below. You may receive the benefit of hearing from ABH Online via mail or phone even if you have not opted-in to receive email.

If you have elected to provide us with your contact information, e.g., by registering at the Site, emailing our Customer Service department or placing an order, we may provide you with service related announcements concerning the Site or contact you regarding your customer service requests or your order. For example, all registered users will receive a welcoming email to confirm their registration. We may also contact you to respond to product questions or concerns that you may express. These types of communications are necessary to serve you, respond to your concerns and to provide the high level of customer service that ABH Online offers its customers.

**Device Identifiers:** Anastasia Beverly Hills also automatically collects an IP address or other unique identifier information (“ **Device Identifier** ”) for the computer, mobile device, technology or other device (collectively, “ **Device** ”) you use to access the Sites. A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device when you access a web site or its servers, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier. We may use a Device Identifier to, among other things, administer the Sites, help diagnose problems with our servers, analyze trends, track users' web page movements, help identify you and your shopping cart, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.

3\. USE OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION BY ABH COMPANIES

We may share your personally identifiable information with companies and business entities which are owned or controlled by ABH Online's parent company and distribute and market ABH brand products (the "ABH Companies"). ABH Companies may only use this information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

4\. DISCLOSURE OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION AND TRANSFER OF DATA

ABH may disclose any information, including personally identifiable information, we deem necessary, in our sole discretion, to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request. We may also exchange information, including personally identifiable information, with other companies and organizations for credit fraud protection and risk reduction.

ABH may retain other companies and individuals to perform functions consistent with our Privacy Policy on our behalf. Examples include customer support specialists, webhosting companies, fulfillment companies (e.g., companies that fill product orders or coordinate mailings), data analysis firms and email service providers. Such third parties may be provided with access to personally identifiable information needed to perform their functions, but may not use such information for any other purpose.

If you choose to participate in any promotions, sweepstakes, surveys, questionnaires or other events during your visit to our Site, the rules or terms and conditions for those events may indicate that your personally identifiable information will be shared with third parties. By choosing to participate and submitting your personally identifiable information with respect to such events, you consent to disclosure of your personally identifiable information to such third parties. ABH Online is not responsible for and disclaims all liability for any use of the information you choose to provide to such third parties.

The ABH Companies and third parties referenced in Sections 3 and 4 who will receive your information only for the purposes set forth in this Privacy Policy and the databases in which your personally identifiable information may be stored may be located both inside and outside the United States ("US"). By providing personally identifiable information to this Site, you acknowledge and accept that the ABH Company or third party which receives your personally identifiable information may be located in the US or within a state or country which does not guarantee the same level of protection for personally identifiable information as the one in which you reside.
