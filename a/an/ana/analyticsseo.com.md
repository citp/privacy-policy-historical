### **Data Sharing Programme & SEO Effectiveness Research**

The purpose of Analytics SEO is to make the process of optimising and managing websites more efficient and effective. With this in mind, we are giving customers the opportunity to participate in a community research programme. 

All data provided by customers is held securely and will only ever be presented at an aggregate level.

If you agree to participate in the Data Sharing Programme then we will statistically analyse your account activity, key events and your website analytics data feed alongside thousands of other websites to try and identify trends, insights and to research and report on significant factors that affect a site’s ability to rank well in the search engines. We will use this research to improve our tools, reports, advice and services and we will share our findings with anyone who has participated in the programme. 

All confidential data provided including details of site traffic and metrics will be held confidentially and all data provided and shared will be done so at an aggregate level and no data that can be used to identify a specific website will be published at any time. You may opt-out of the Data Sharing Programme at any time by changing your account type. Your site will automatically be opted out when your account is cancelled.

### **Our Commitment to Data Security**

In order to prevent unauthorised access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.

Each account holder is asked to create a unique password, which is required to access their account. It is each user's responsibility to protect the security of his or her login information.

These safeguards help prevent unauthorised access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of data, but no guarantee can be made that your information and data will be secure from intrusions and unauthorised release to third parties.

We will make reasonable commercial efforts to delete your information as soon as reasonably practical.

### **Our Commitment to Children's Privacy**

Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important to us. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under the age of 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.

### **How You Can Access or Correct Your Information**

You can access all your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain online by logging in to your account.

To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.
