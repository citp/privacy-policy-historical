See Section 9 on "Our Use and Sharing of Aggregated Information" below; </p></li> <li><p> To comply with any applicable law and assist law enforcement agencies under any applicable law, when we have a good faith belief that our cooperation with the law enforcement agencies is legally mandated or meets the applicable legal standards and procedures; </p></li> <li><p> To prevent fraud, misappropriation, infringements, identity theft and other illegal activities and misuse of the Services. </p></li> </ul>
					
					<h3>Our Use and Sharing of your ANKR Device Location Information</h3>
					<p> The Services are based on a community of all users of the Services sharing location information with us. Whenever a ANKR app is activated on a user's mobile device, we will collect detailed location information about any ANKR device(s) in reach of such mobile device, as collected and sent to us by the mobile device. </p> <p> Any location information we receive about ANKR device(s) located through a ANKR app will be stored by us on our cloud server. Such information can be associated by us with the account for which the ANKR device(s) have been registered (by linking the unique ANKR device identifier with the account information), for instance, where necessary to help you to track your ANKR device(s) in reach of other users' mobile devices with an activated ANKR app. </p> <p> However, your location information will be completely anonymous to other users, unless you actively decide to share these data, e.g., by choosing to share access to your Services' account with other people you trust, or by using social networks (see Section 8 on "Your Sharing of your Personal Information with Social Networks" below). We will not identify you personally to other users or otherwise make your location information available to any third party in personal identifiable form without your prior consent. </p>
					
					<h3>Our Use and Sharing of your Personal Information</h3>
					<p> We may share your personal information (including your location information and your ANKR devices' location information) with our third party service providers or affiliates, as authorized by us to collect, process and use your personal information as data processors on our behalf, such as, for instance, cloud based and hosting services, technical service providers, mail carriers, communication agencies and customer support service providers; these parties may be located in countries outside of your jurisdiction, including but not limited to the USA. </p> <p> An updated list of the parties engaged by us for the processing of your personal information may be requested from us at any time. </p> <p> Other than as indicated above, we will not share your personal information with any third parties, unless compelled by law to do so or if you have given your prior consent (for our use of aggregated information, see Section 9 on "Our Use and Sharing of Aggregated Information" below). </p>

Through this option, you may choose to have personal information and other content about you (e.g., the location of your ANKR device(s) and thus also of your tracked items) available, transmitted and shared through the Services with your other social network account(s). </p> <p> By setting your Services' account to integrate with social networks including by signing onto the Services by using your social network account (such as your Facebook account), you share information (including personal information) between the Services and such social networks. </p> <p> The social network's use of (personal) information is governed by that social network's privacy policy and controlled by the social network, not by this Privacy Policy or us. </p> <p> When you connect to the social network account through the Services for the first time or otherwise make the Services interact with your social network account, you will be asked to permit the social network to share your personal information stored on such social network with the Services. We collect your information from your social network account only in accordance with your privacy settings you have set up under your social network accounts. </p>
