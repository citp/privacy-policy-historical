# Company | Privacy Policy | Anki US

#### A. TYPES OF INFORMATION COLLECTED 

We and the Services collect different types of information through the Services. 

  1. #####  GENERAL INFORMATION 




Personal information is information about you that can be used by itself, or combined with other information, to personally identify you ("Personal Information"). We collect this information directly from you when you provide it to us and by other means. For example, when you make a purchase on our website, you provide us with your name, email, phone number, address and billing information. When you register to receive Anki news, we collect your age and email address. We do not collect more Personal Information than is reasonably necessary to provide you the Services or improve the Services.

  2. #####  SPECIFIC TO THE SERVICES 



  * ######  ACCOUNT INFORMATION 




When you sign up for an Anki account (an "Account"), we may collect information such as your name, player/driver name, email address, birthdate, password, address, and billing information (collectively, "Account Information"). If a child under the age of 13 (or older, depending on your country) registers for an Account, the email address of his or her parent/legal guardian is collected instead.

We use Account Information to create, manage, and maintain Accounts and provide the Services. For example, for Anki OVERDRIVE, you can reserve a driver name, which may be displayed to users you play with. We also back up stats and track progress on multiple devices for a better gameplay experience. For purchases on our website, we collect address and billing information to facilitate your current or future purchases.

  * ######  APP ANALYTICS DATA 




The Services collect gameplay data such as scores, achievements, and feature usage. The Services also automatically keep track of information such as events or failures within them. In addition, we may collect your device make and model, an Anki-generated randomized device ID for the mobile device on which you run our apps, robot/vehicle ID of your Anki device, ZIP-code level data about your location (obtained from your IP address), operating system version, and other device-related information like battery level (collectively, "Analytics Data"). Unless you create an account and log in, Analytics Data is stored under a unique ID and not connected to you. We use Analytics Data to enable and improve the Services and enhance your gameplay. For example, Analytics Data enables us to analyze crashes, fix bugs, and personalize or develop new features and services. If you are a user in Europe, you can opt-out from the collection of Analytics Data connected to you. For further information, please see Section E.

We also use Analytics Data, either alone or combined with other data, to create aggregated data which does not identify you personally ("Aggregate Data"). We may freely use and share Aggregate Data with our partners, for example, who perform functions on our behalf or help us improve the Services.

  * ######  COZMO 




Cozmo connects to his app via a direct Wi-Fi connection to your mobile device. Images from Cozmo's camera are processed in the Cozmo app to power his navigation and other features. They are not stored and do not leave the Cozmo app. Learn more about [Cozmo and Privacy](https://support.anki.com/hc/en-us/articles/236021007-COZMO-Cozmo-Privacy-Basics).

  * ######  VECTOR 




Vector has voice features. When you say the wake words, “Hey Vector”, Vector streams your voice command to the cloud, where it is processed. Voice command audio is deleted after processing, unless you opt in, for example by linking your Vector with a third-party voice service account. If you connect Vector with a third party voice service account, that voice service’s privacy policy applies to your interactions with that service. 

Vector also has camera features. When you ask Vector to take a picture, he’ll play a simulated shutter sound and take the shot. Pictures taken by Vector are stored on the robot. You can view, delete or share pictures taken by Vector from within your Vector App.

Learn more about [Vector and Privacy](https://support.anki.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007560234).

  * ######  MEET COZMO AND VECTOR’S KNOWN FACES




Both Vector and Cozmo (with the Cozmo App) can translate faces they see into encoded facial features, a set of numbers not recognizable by a person ("Facial Features Data"). Unless you either use Meet Cozmo from the Cozmo App (for Cozmo),or teach Vector your name (for Vector), Facial Features Data is discarded each time the robot goes to sleep and/or, for Cozmo, loses his connection to your mobile device.

If you use the Meet Cozmo section of your Cozmo App, or you introduce yourself to Vector by voice, you are permitting the robot to associate the name you provide with Facial Features Data for you. Facial Features Data is stored with the name you provide, and the robot uses this data to enhance and personalize your experience and do things like greet you by that name. This data is stored locally on the robot and in the robot’s app. It is not uploaded to Anki nor shared, and you can delete it anytime.

  * ######  OTHER FEATURES 




The Services provide you with options to share your information, such as via text messaging, email, or social media, or to receive push notifications from us. For example, the Services can ask if you'd like to share your play results with your friends or save images from our apps to your device. If you want to use these features, you will receive a request for access to your photos which you may allow or deny. If granted, we use this access to save images you create within the Services. For push notifications, you can opt-out anytime by turning off push notifications from your phone settings.

Our applications also request operating system permission to use wireless technology on your device. For example, the Overdrive and Cozmo applications use wireless technology to communicate with Anki robots during gameplay. You can turn on / off Bluetooth from your Bluetooth-compatible smartphone settings, although it may hinder your play. Some of our Services work with a software development kit (SDK) that we make available to you; we will tell you if different or additional policies apply to data generated through your use of our SDK.

  3. #####  AUTOMATICALLY AS YOU NAVIGATE: LOG FILES, COOKIES, AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES 




When you use or visit the Services, the services automatically record and store certain information in log files. Generally, we use this information in an aggregated and anonymized way. If we need to combine this type of information with Personal Information, we treat it as Personal Information. Automatically collected information includes statistical or technical information such as your Internet Protocol address, operating system, time and date, and how you navigate the Services.

On our websites, we may – depending on your cookie preferences – also collect information through the use of "Cookies" or similar tracking technologies, which are identifiers transferred to your browser. We use first and third party Cookies to help our websites work, provide you with relevant content and to improve our Services.

We also work with third parties to manage our advertising on other websites. Our third party advertising partners may use cookies or similar technologies on our and other sites (but not in our mobile applications), to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests, or to display ads that link back to our site.

Our third-party mail service provider provides us with anonymized and aggregated information about the respondents to our emails. You can unsubscribe from our marketing and research emails anytime by following the instructions included in them. We track open rates for our emails so we can improve our communications with you and our services. If you participate in our optional surveys, information you provide to us, including Personal Information, will be linked with your Account. We will not share the Personal Information you provide through a contest or survey with third parties unless we give you prior notice and choice. Some of our Services include links to third party websites or apps. We are not responsible for such websites. These sites may have their own privacy policies and practices.

  5. #####  SOCIAL MEDIA & CONTESTS 




We have a presence on various social media platforms, such as Facebook. We receive anonymized and aggregated demographic and use information from these services when you engage with us on them. In addition, we may offer sharing features and other integrated tools (such as the Facebook "Like" button). Such integrated features may share data and are governed by the privacy policies of the third parties that provide these features. From time to time, we may conduct contests and sweepstakes. If you participate, we may collect information from you, as described in the terms of the contest or sweepstakes.

#### F. CHILDREN 

Unless we note otherwise (for example, on product packaging), the Services are intended for audiences of all ages. In compliance with applicable law, when we collect Personal Information through the Services, in some regions we ask users to input their age. When a child signs up for an Account, we will send a notice via email to the child's parent or guardian, or obtain verifiable consent via other acceptable methods. If we do not receive consent within 14 days after sign-up, the child's Account will be deleted. The information collected and stored from the child may include a username (e.g., driver name) and parent’s email address. We may also collect and link to the child’s Account the Analytics Information. 

The information will be used for the purposes stated in this policy and as permitted under law. The information may also be shared as described in Section C, including with certain third party vendors that help us operate the Services, such as by sending out our email communications. 

We will only collect such Personal Information from children as is reasonably necessary to provide the Services. When applicable, parents/legal guardians have the right to consent to Anki's collection and use of Personal Information from the child without also consenting to its disclosure to independent third parties. Parents can revoke their consent anytime by contacting [privacy@anki.com](mailto:privacy@anki.com), and they can request modification or deletion of children’s accounts by following the process at Section E. We will notify the parent when important information changes, like when password or other settings changes are made to Accounts of children. 

#### G. SECURITY 

We take reasonable precautions to protect your data. Payment transactions are encrypted in transit. Although we endeavor to provide reasonable security, no system can prevent all potential breaches or guarantee perfect security.
