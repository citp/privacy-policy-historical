#### A. TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE INFORMATION

We collect several types of information through the Services:

  1. ##### General information collection




Personal information is information about you that can be used by itself, or combined with other information, to personally identify you (“Personal Information”). We collect this information directly from you when you provide it to us and by other means.

When you purchase an Anki product from our website, you provide us with your name, email, phone number, shipping and billing addresses, credit card information, and other information you affirmatively provide. When you register to receive Anki news we collect your age and email address.

If you choose to purchase an Anki product as a gift and send it to a third party, we will ask you for friend or family member's name and shipping information. We do not use the shipping information for any secondary purpose.

We do not collect more Personal Information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the Services or improve the Services.

  2. ##### Specific to the Services



  * ###### Sign-up for an Account (Account Information)




When you sign up for an Anki account (an "Account"), we may collect Personal Information and other information such as your name, driver name (please do not use your real name), email address, birthdate, password, address and billing information (“Account Information”). If a child under the age of 13 registers for an Account, the email address of his or her parent/legal guardian is collected instead.  When you create an Anki account, you can store your address and other billing information to make purchases.  

_What do we use this data for?_

When you sign-up for an Account, we use your Account Information to create this Account and to maintain and manage it for you. For example, your driver name will be displayed to other Anki users you play with. We also use your Personal Information to backup stats, track progress on multiple devices and reserve a unique driver name. We collect your address and other billing information to facilitate current or future purchases.

  * ###### Analytics data




We collect gameplay data such as game scores, game achievements, game performance, and your usage of various game features. We also automatically record information such as how often you use the Services, the events that occur within the Services and usage and performance data.

In addition, we may collect your device make and model, randomized device ID, vehicle ID, Geolocation Data (as defined below), operating system version and language your device is set to, as well as other device-related information like the battery level and the disk usage (collectively, “Analytics Data”). This Analytics Data is not connected to your name but stored under an anonymized unique ID.  

This information may include Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, the files viewed on our site (e.g., HTML pages, graphics, etc.), operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data.

_What do we use this data for?_

Analytics Data is used by us to enable usage of the Services, enhance your gameplay experience, and help improve our products and services. For example, it enables us to develop new features, to analyze crashes or to fix bugs that occurred within the Services and to develop new products and services.

We may also use Analytics Data, either alone or combined with other data and information, to create aggregated, anonymized data (“Aggregate Data”), which does not identify you personally.  We may freely use and share this Aggregate Data, for example, by posting it on publicly-accessible web sites such as Facebook and sharing it with hardware manufacturers, developers, platform hosts and marketing partners.

If you are a user in Germany, you can opt-out at any time from the collection of Analytics Data. For further information on how to opt-out please see Section E below.

  * ###### COZMO DATA




Cozmo connects to his app via a direct Wi-Fi connection to your mobile device. Images from Cozmo's camera are processed in the Cozmo app to power his navigation and other features. They are not stored and do not leave the Cozmo app. When you use Cozmo, the Cozmo app may translate pictures of faces Cozmo sees into encoded facial features, a set of numbers not recognizable by a person (“Facial Features Data”). Unless you play Meet Cozmo (as described below), Facial Features Data is discarded each time Cozmo goes to sleep or loses his connection to your mobile device. 

  * ###### Meet Cozmo




If you use the Meet Cozmo section of your Cozmo App, Cozmo can learn to associate a name you provide with Facial Features Data for a particular face across play sessions. If you have signed up through Meet Cozmo, Facial Features Data is stored with your player name, and used to enhance and personalize your gameplay and do things like greet you by your player name. This data resides locally on the Cozmo robot and in the Cozmo app. It is not uploaded to Anki servers nor shared, and you can delete it anytime by visiting the Meet Cozmo section of your Cozmo App.

  * _**Other features of the Services**_



Some features of the Services may provide you with options to share your information via text messaging, email, or social applications you have on your mobile device.  For example, the Services may allow you to share your race results with your friends. You may have the ability to save images to your device in our sharing of results feature. If you wish to do so, you will receive a notification indicating that the Services would like to access your photos which you may allow or deny. We only allow you to save the image you create within the Services to your device and we do not access other photos that you may have saved to your device.

With your devices' IP addresses we obtain zip-code level geographic information (which is not connected to your name but instead stored under an anonymized unique ID) (“Geolocation Data”). If you are a user in Germany, you may opt-out from us collecting Geolocation Data by visiting the setting sections of our application (see also Section E below).

If you opt-in to receive push notifications, we may send you notifications regarding service updates and other relevant messages.  You may opt-out of receiving these at any time by going to the phone settings and turning them off.

Our applications may also request permission to use Bluetooth on your device. The applications use Bluetooth to communicate with Anki vehicles and other in-game devices during gameplay. You can turn on / off Bluetooth at the device level.

  3. ##### Automatically as you navigate through the Site: log files, cookies and other technologies




When you visit the Services, certain information is or can be automatically recorded and stored in log files. Generally, we use this information in an aggregated and anonymized way. If we need to combine this type of information with Personal Information, we treat it as Personal Information. Automatically collected information includes:

  1. Statistical or technical information such as your computer or device's Internet Protocol address, operating system and browser type, time and date, and how you navigate through and interact with the Services.
  2.  Information collected via “Cookies” or similar tracking technologies, which are identifiers we transfer to your browser or device that allow us to recognize your browser or device and tell us how and when pages and features in our Services are visited and by how many people (“Cookie Information”).  You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or device to prevent or limit your device’s acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our features.  Through these Cookies, we may collect information about your online activity after you leave our Services.   Your browser may offer you a “Do Not Track” option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites.  Our Services do not support DO Not Track requests at this time, which means that we collect information about your online activity both while you are using the Services and after you leave the Services.  Also, if you click on a link to a third party website or service, a third party may also transmit cookies to you.  Again, this Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties, and we are not responsible for their privacy policies and practices.  Please be aware that cookies placed by third parties may continue to track your activities online even after you have left our Services, and those third parties may not honor “Do Not Track” requests you have set using your browser or device.  



Our partners use cookies or similar technologies to analyse trends, administer the website, track users’ movements around the website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.

We partner with a third party to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third party partner may use cookies or similar technologies in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. If you wish to opt out of interest-based advertising click [ here](http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/) [or if located in the European Union click [ here](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/)]. Please note you will continue to receive generic ads.

  4. ##### Emails and other communications and your choices




If you have provided us with your contact information, we may use this information to communicate with you about your order or Account, or to address your questions.

If you have, or, in case of a child under the age of 13, his or her parent/legal guardian has, given us consent by providing us your contact information, we may from time to time, subject to your marketing preferences, send you education, marketing, product support, and research emails. Our third-party mail service provider provides us with anonymized and aggregated demographic information about the respondents to our emails. You can unsubscribe from our marketing and research emails by following the instructions included in them. In addition, we may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. This confirmation helps us make our communications with you more interesting and improve our services.

We may also ask you to participate in surveys. These surveys are purely optional and help us improve our products and provide aggregate information, which we think may interest our registered users and visitors. If you choose to participate in an Anki survey, any information you provide to us, including Personal Information, will be linked with your Account in our system and to any Personal Information contained therein. We will not share the personal information you provide through a contest or survey with other third parties unless we give you prior notice and choice.

  5. ##### Social media




We have a presence on various social media platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. We receive from them anonymized and aggregated demographic and use information related to our presence on the respective social media platform when you choose to visit us on those sites or to communicate with us.

From time to time, we may conduct contests and sweepstakes on our social media channels or in cooperation with other partners. If you choose to participate in such contests and sweepstakes, we may collect information from you, as described in the terms of the respective contest or sweepstakes.

In addition, we may, from time to time, offer social sharing features and other integrated tools (such as the Facebook "Like" button), which let you share actions you take on the Services with other media, and vice versa. The use of such features may enable the sharing of information with your friends or the public, depending on the settings you establish with the third party that provides these features. These features may also collect your IP address, which page you are visiting and may set a cookie to enable the features to function properly. For more information about the purpose and scope of data collection and processing in connection with social sharing features, please visit the privacy policies of the third parties that provide these features.

  * With third parties that support our business, such as to process payments, to provide accounting services or to store and/or process information collected through the Services, and who are bound by contractual obligations to keep Personal Information confidential and adequately protected and use it only for the purposes for which we disclose it to them.
