### Your Rights

The GDPR provides you with certain privacy rights, including the right to access, correct or update your personal information.

You have the right to receive a copy of your information in a structured, machine-readable format.

If you are an EEA resident, you have the right to object to our processing that is based on legitimate interests.

If you wish to exercise any of the rights granted to you by the GDPR, contact us via email at [connect@aauw.org](mailto:connect@aauw.org) or via mail to the address set forth above, or you may submit the [GDPR action form](https://www.aauw.org/privacy-access-to-personal-information/) available on AAUW’s websites.

### Sensitive Information

AAUW requests that persons to whom the GDPR applies do not volunteer any personal data considered sensitive by the GDPR, including racial or ethnic origin or sexual preference, even if a field exists for such information to be voluntarily provided. AAUW is required by certain governmental agencies in the United States to inquire about some sensitive information in relation to particular services it provides, but the disclosure of such information is always voluntary for the individual concerned.
