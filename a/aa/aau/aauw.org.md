# Privacy Policy: AAUW

AAUW is committed to protecting the privacy of those who use aauw.org.

## General Browsing Information

AAUW does not collect any personally identifying information from users browsing our Web site. Aggregate demographic data such as pages views and unique visitors used for internal and marketing purposes is collected.

## Personally Identifiable Information

Occasionally, we will ask you to provide personally identifiable information such as when you send a secure contribution. Like many nonprofit organizations, AAUW obtains the names of potential supporters by renting membership lists of like-minded organizations and publications. Sometimes, instead of paying the rental fee, AAUW exchanges its list with another group’s list for a single use. By receiving mail from other similar groups, you help AAUW grow its programs and services. You may have your name excluded from any lists that AAUW sells or exchanges by contacting [connect@aauw.org](mailto:connect@aauw.org).

Personal information in e-mails sent to staff or AAUW leaders will be used to answer questions, address problems or complaints, or otherwise improve service. With any electronic communication, interception by unauthorized third parties is possible, so you may wish to transmit particularly confidential or sensitive information by regular mail.

## Member Tools and Communications

To gain access to members-only resources on aauw.org, you must be an AAUW member in good standing with a username and password.

Additionally, for e-mails sent in HTML format to our members through our listservs and electronic newsletters, we will collect specific information regarding what the recipient does with that e-mail. For those e-mails, AAUW will monitor whether a recipient subsequently clicks through to links provided in the message. Other information collected through this tracking feature includes: e-mail address of a user, the date and time of the user’s “click,” a message number, name of the list from which the message was sent, tracking URL number and destination page. AAUW only uses this information to enhance its products and distribution of those products to its members. This information is not sold or distributed in any other manner.

## Security

AAUW has appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures in place to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. Credit card information provided to AAUW is protected against unauthorized use by 128-bit encryption and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) security features, which scramble your personal information so that only your web browser and our Web site’s server can decipher it. However, no Internet or e-mail transmission is ever fully secure or error free. Because most e-mail is not encrypted, you should take special care in deciding what information you send to us via e-mail.

## Unsubscribing from Electronic Communications

All messages sent by AAUW through its listservs and electronic newsletters and other e-lists include information on how to unsubscribe quickly and easily through an automated system. If, at any time, you wish to opt-out of receiving communications from us, you may also send a written request to AAUW. Our unsubscribe requests are processed every week. If you wish to unsubscribe or need to process a change to your e-mail address, send your requested changes to [connect@aauw.org](mailto:connect@aauw.org).

## Policy Revisions

AAUW reserves the right to modify or amend this privacy statement at any time. Your continued use of this website will constitute your acceptance of those changes. If you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of this site, or your dealings with this Web site, you can contact us by e-mail at [connect@aauw.org](mailto:connect@aauw.org) or call 800.326.2289.

## Comment Policy

Our editorial staff will moderate all comments. While we do not censor based on point of view, we will delete comments (or links in comments) that are offensive or off topic.

While at no time will we attempt to change the meaning of a comment, we will, at our discretion, edit spelling or grammatical errors.  To protect the privacy of individuals, we will remove names when appropriate. When a significant change to a comment is made, there will be an editor’s note at the end of the comment.

AAUW reserves the right to change our comment policy at any time.
