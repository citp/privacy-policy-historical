# AAUW Website Policies - AAUW

The AAUW website, www.aauw.org, and online communications provide information and services in furtherance of AAUW's mission to advance equity for women and girls through advocacy, education and research. Content focuses on all aspects of AAUW including:

  * public policy priorities and advocacy 
  * community programs 
  * initiatives to combat sex discrimination 
  * research 
  * fellowships, grants, and awards 
  * membership services, programs, and benefits



This policy is designed to maintain the integrity of AAUW on the World Wide Web and in other online communications and to avoid the use of AAUW's name in ways inconsistent with its image, mission, policies, and programs.

1\. WWW.AAUW.ORG (INCLUDING LOGOS, WRITTEN CONTENT, PHOTOGRAPHS, GRAPHICS, VIDEO, AND AUDIO)  
The policy addresses three distinct audiences:

  * AAUW members, including regions, states, branches, branch members, members-at-large, college/university member institutions, student affiliates, and interbranch councils 
  * AAUW staff 
  * Other users 



Website content is developed by AAUW staff in consultation with leaders and members, and the website is maintained by the AAUW Information Technology Department. Any inquiries about the website or this policy should be directed to Webmaster, AAUW, 1111 Sixteenth St. NW, Washington, DC 20036, or [webmaster@aauw.org](mailto:webmaster@aauw.org).

Any entity or individual who uses, accesses, or links to www.aauw.org — including logos, written content, photographs, graphics, video, and audio — is bound by this policy. Use of, access to, or linkage to www.aauw.org shall constitute acceptance of and agreement to be bound by the terms in this policy. Entities or individuals who do not wish to be bound by these terms should not use, access, or link to www.aauw.org. AAUW has the right to restrict or revoke access to any entity or individual that violates any provision of this policy.

AAUW reserves the right to remove or not post any materials of external users onto www.aauw.org or materials that AAUW considers to be objectionable or outside its mission. Notwithstanding the reservation of this right, AAUW is not responsible for any material posted by any external users, for instance on chat rooms or bulletin boards. AAUW specifically disclaims any and all liability for any claims or damages that result from postings by external users. Although www.aauw.org includes links providing direct access to other Internet sites, AAUW has not participated in the development of those other sites and does not exert any editorial or other control over those sites.

  * Other users may create web links to any URL on www.aauw.org so long as such link is for educational and informational purposes; in furtherance of AAUW's mission to promote equity for all women and girls, lifelong education, and positive societal change; and consistent with AAUW policies and programs. Use may not create an implication of AAUW's endorsement of or affiliation with any third party. 
  * Without the explicit written permission of national AAUW staff or leaders, other users may not copy, reproduce, distribute, publish, display, perform, modify, create derivative works, transmit, or in any way exploit www.aauw.org, except that external users may download material for their own personal, noncommercial use.

3\. PRIVACY  
AAUW is committed to protecting the privacy of people who use www.aauw.org.

**A. General Browsing Information**

AAUW does not collect any personal information from users browsing our Web site. Only aggregate data — such as the number of hits per page — are collected. Aggregate data are only used for internal and marketing purposes and do not provide any personally identifying information.

**B. Personally Identifiable Information**

We will ask you to provide personally identifiable information occasionally, such as when you send a secure contribution. Like many nonprofit organizations, AAUW obtains the names of potential supporters by renting membership lists of like-minded organizations and publications. Sometimes, instead of paying the rental fee, AAUW exchanges its list with another group's list for a single use. By receiving mail from other similar groups, you help AAUW grow its programs and services. Please be assured, however, that any time you provide personally identifiable information to AAUW, you can have your name excluded from any lists that AAUW sells or exchanges.

Personal information in e-mails sent to staff or AAUW leaders will be used to answer questions, address problems or complaints, or otherwise improve service. Please be aware that with any electronic communication, interception by unauthorized third parties is possible, so you may wish to transmit particularly confidential or sensitive information by regular mail. 

**C. Third-Party Sites**

www.aauw.org has links to third-party sites. Since we do not control those websites, we encourage you to review the privacy and other policies posted on these third-party sites. 

**D. AAUW's Member Center**

To gain access to members-only resources on aauw.org, you must be an AAUW member. Additionally, for some e-mails sent in HTML format by AAUW to our members through our listservs and electronic newsletters, we will collect specific information regarding what the recipient does with that email. For those emails, AAUW will monitor whether a recipient subsequently clicks through to links provided in the message. Other information collected through this tracking feature includes: email address of a user, the date and time of the user's "click," a message number, name of the list from which the message was sent, tracking URL number and destination page. AAUW only uses this information to enhance its products and distribution of those products to its members. This information is not sold or distributed in any other manner.

**E. Cookies and Other Technologies**

AAUW also uses 'cookies' to collect information. A cookie is a string of characters that can be written to a file on the user's hard drive when the user visits a Web site. Only the Web site that set the cookie can read it, and it can only be used as a record keeping device to store user IDs and information that the site already has. It cannot be used to read other information from the user's hard drive. AAUW uses cookies to track users' activity through the site in order to improve the site's architecture, to offer the user interactive features that would not be possible without them, and to recall specific information to save the user time during subsequent visits to the site. 

**F. Unsubscribing from AAUW Electronic Communications**

All messages sent by AAUW through its listservs and electronic newsletters and other e-lists include information on how to unsubscribe quickly and easily through an automated system. If, at any time, you wish to opt-out of receiving communications from us, you may also send a written request to AAUW. Our unsubscribe requests are processed every week. If you wish to unsubscribe or need to process a change to your email address, send your requested changes to [connect@aauw.org](mailto:connect@aauw.org).

4\. SECURITY  
AAUW has in place what we believe to be appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. Credit card information provided to AAUW is protected against unauthorized use by 128-bit encryption and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) security features, which scramble your personal information so that only your web browser and our Web site's server can decipher it. However, no Internet or e-mail transmission is ever fully secure or error free. Because most e-mail is not encrypted, you should take special care in deciding what information you send to us via e-mail.
