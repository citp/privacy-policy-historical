_Important note for AAFP members_ : The AAFP maintains a membership database independent of its Web operations. The information from this database is drawn from membership applications, dues payment forms, subscriptions, product orders, CME reporting, member surveys and other correspondence between the AAFP and its members. 

If a non-member registers for a meeting, purchases a product from the AAFP's Web site or claims CME credit for an online course, the user's name, address and other personal identifying information are recorded. In some instances, demographic information is collected and recorded. 

_Credit Card information_ : The AAFP does not disclose credit card account information or activity provided by its customers. When members and customers choose to pay using their credit cards, the AAFP submits this information encrypted to obtain payment from the appropriate clearing house. If credit card numbers are stored in AAFP databases, they are encrypted.
