We keep track of this data for determining trends and statistics internally, and use this to improve the AAII user experience. This information is kept confidentially within AAII. 

**Use of Cookies**

AAII.com uses cookies to remember your login settings. This allows you to move through the site and certain member security points without any disturbance. Our site is set to keep you logged in for 60 minutes. This means that during a single browser session you can wander to any other site and come back to AAII.com and remain logged in. We are in no way extracting personal information through the use of computer cookies. 

Most browsers are set up to accept cookies, but you can configure your browser to not use cookies. Please note that doing so will reduce some site functionality.

AAII maintains a subscriber list and will generally only send emails and paper mailings to users regarding AAII products and services, or to fulfill against a transaction initiated by the user. However, we do on occasion make portions of this list available to carefully screened companies that offer personal finance products and services that we believe may be of interest to those affiliated with AAII. AAII makes sure that any third-party service providers we use are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy.
