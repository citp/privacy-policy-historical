# AA Ireland | Data Protection & Privacy Policy | AA Ireland

This document is the full AA Ireland Data Protection Statement and contains all the information you need, to understand how we use your personal data. A summary of this statement can be found on our Terms of Business booklet by clicking the Terms of Business link on the AA home page. 

"AA" means the AA group of companies including AA Ireland Limited. A list of the companies within the AA Group can be obtained from The Secretary, AA Ireland Ltd, 61a South William Street, Dublin 2.

AA recognises that protecting personal information is important to you and we are committed to protecting your privacy. This statement sets out how we will use and protect your information and how you can exercise your data protection rights. 

It is important that you read this Data Protection Statement and that you show it to anyone else who is named on your insurance policy or AA Membership as it also applies to them. It is important that they have agreed to their personal information being provided to us. 

We reserve our right to change this Data Protection Statement from time to time at our discretion. The most up to date version can be found on aa.ie. We encourage you to periodically review this statement to ensure you are informed about how we use and protect your personal data. 

All personal data we gather will be processed in accordance with all applicable data protection laws and principles. 

If you wish to raise a complaint on how we have handled your personal data, please contact our Data Protection Officer by email, compliance@theaa.ie or in writing to AA Ireland 20-21 South William Street, Dublin 2. Alternatively you can lodge a complaint with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner, Canal House, Station Road, Portarlington, Co Laois, R32 AP23

We will take all appropriate steps to keep your personal data safe. In the unlikely event of a security breach we will notify you promptly about the circumstances of the incident.

The personal data we require about you and other people named on your policy or Membership will be gathered and stored in line with this Data Protection Statement. This will be done by AA staff or, where you use them, the AA website or app. 

In order to gather the personal data we need to provide you with a policy or Membership we will obtain personal information directly from you or anybody else named on your policy or Membership. When gathering personal data for policies of insurance, we may request details about you or anybody else named on your policy regarding medical conditions and/or information relating to the alleged commission of, commission of or conviction for any relevant offence(s) by you or anybody to be named on your policy. 

We may ask you to provide medical information as part of the insurance sales process, including GP letters. Please do not send us the results of any genetic tests carried out on your or any person named on your policy. 

By supplying an eircode and/or address of a property when taking out an insurance policy, AA will carry out a search of a third party database to determine address based risk factors (called geocoding). This will return information relating to the area where your property is located as part of the insurance quotation process and will be used to assist insurers in rating, when providing you with a quotation. 

It is important that you give us correct information. If you provide us with inaccurate, incorrect or incomplete information for insurance policies, this may result in your insurer avoiding the contract of insurance refusing claims. This may result in you finding it difficult to arrange insurance in the future. For AA Membership, this may result in us cancelling your cover, or not providing you with service. 

We use the information we receive from you or which we obtain from our dealings with you as an AA customer (including in relation to products and/or services we provide to you and/or your use of those products and/or services) to provide quotes, products and/or services that you request, to communicate with you, and to personalise information provided to you. We ask for your home, mobile telephone number, and email address to enable us to contact you in relation to an enquiry you have made, to communicate with you about your quotation or product, to contact you if there is a problem with your order, or if there is another genuine reason for doing so. An example of how we may personalise information include using your information to generate an insurance quote for you.

We may use the personal data we gather for any or all of the following purposes – 

**Sensitive Data**

Sometimes we may need sensitive personal data such as past medical history. When this is required we will process this by obtaining your explicit consent first. Where we process personal data relating to criminal convictions we will do so for the assessment of risk to provide you with an insurance quotation. 

**Effect of not providing information**

If you do not provide the information that is required for an insurance or Membership quote, we may not be able to offer you a quote. Some categories of information are required for us to administer the products you hold with us and we would not be able to offer you a contract without this information. 

**Call Recording**

Calls, both inbound and outbound, may be recorded and monitored for training and quality purposes, to verify information, prevention of fraud, to manage complaints and to improve customer satisfaction.

## 4\. Sharing your information

## 5\. Collection of Data

To provide you with the product or service you have requested, we need to collect many categories of personal data for the purposes set out in this statement. 

The exact categories may change, however we have set out the types of information that we gather and use. The category headings and types of data collected noted below are not exhaustive; these are indicative of the data we may hold about you. The information listed under one heading may be used relating to activities that are noted under another heading. Data may be gathered in relation to both you and other people who are named on your insurance or Membership.

We will retain call recordings for 6 years from the date of the call. 

In some cases, we may need to keep personal data for a longer timeframe than specified above. Examples of this include long-running disputes and system back-ups (required for disaster recovery purposes). 

## 7\. Automated decision making

As part of the provision of your insurance contract, including at quotation stage, AA Ireland may use profiling. This means that we may use your personal data to evaluate, analyse or predict the performance of your contract of insurance. The results of this profiling may be a factor in fees or charges set by AA Ireland. This has no factor on the price of your insurance premium as this is determined by the insurer. 

## 8\. Your rights 

As a data subject, you have the rights which are detailed below. Certain restrictions may apply in some cases. Please send your request in writing, either by email or post, using the addresses noted in Section 1 above. 

It may take us up to 30 days to process your request. If we need extra time to process your request, we will notify you of this, and the reasons for the delay within 30 days of receiving your request. If we have reason to refuse your request, we will notify you of this within 30 days of receiving your request, and the reasons for the refusal.

Right to be forgotten | You have the right to have the personal data about you erased, in certain circumstances. You may request the deletion of your data in the follow circumstances – • The personal data is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was originally collected and processed • If you withdraw consent, and there is no other legal basis for processing the data (for example, if you withdraw your marketing consent and hold no active products or services with the AA) • If the data subject objects to the processing, and there are no legitimate grounds for the processing of the data • If the personal data has been unlawfully processed • If the personal data must be deleted for compliance with a legal obligation

If exercising this right to transfer data from another company, please note the contents of this Statement to ensure that you do not provide us with excessive data. We will not be responsible for the quality or accuracy of the data transferred to us.

Right to Object | You have the right to request us to stop processing your personal data. When making this request, please outline why you want us to stop processing your personal data.
