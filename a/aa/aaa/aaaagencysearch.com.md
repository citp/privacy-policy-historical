# AAAA Web Site Privacy Policy

Thank you for visiting the Web site of the American Association of Advertising Agencies (AAAA) and reviewing our privacy policy. The AAAA will collect no personal information about you when you visit our Web site unless you choose to provide that information to us.

Here is how we handle information about your visit to our Web site:

##   
Information Collected and Stored Automatically

If you do nothing during your visit but browse/search through the Web site, read pages, or download information, we will gather and store certain information about your visit automatically. This information does not identify you personally. We automatically collect and store only the following information about your visit:

  * The Internet domain (for example, “xcompany.com” if you use a private Internet access account, or “yourschool.edu” if you connect from a university’s domain) and IP address (an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web) from which you access our Web site;
  * The type of browser and operating system used to access our site;
  * The date and time you access our site;
  * The pages you visit;
  * The search term(s) used in our search engine; and
  * If you linked to the AAAA Web site from another Web site, the address of that Web site.



We use this information to help us make our Web site more useful to visitors, to learn about the number of visitors to our site and the types of technology our visitors use. We do not track or record information about individuals and their visits.

##   
If You Send Us Personal Information

If you choose to provide us with personal information by sending an e-mail to the AAAA, by making an online purchase/registering online for an AAAA event, or by filling out a form with your personal information and submitting it through our Web site, we use that information to respond to your message, to fulfill your order/request, and to help us provide you with information.

If you register for an online account to access members-only materials, your contact information and selected topics of interest will be used to help us communicate with you and develop content suited to your interests.

If you choose to make an online purchase or register online for an AAAA event, the AAAA reserves the right to use your contact information to communicate special offers and relevant products and services available from the AAAA, affiliate companies and selected sponsors. You can opt-out by e-mailing us at [webmaster@aaaa.org](mailto:webmaster@aaaa.org).

The AAAA does not disclose, share, release, publish, disseminate, rent, or sell any personally identifiable information to any third parties.

##   
Your Right to Review and Modify Data and Information

You have the right, at any time, to review and/or modify any of your personally identifiable information that you provide during registration, or any other voluntarily provided information. You may also remove yourself from our active databases of e-mail lists. To do so, you should send an e-mail to [webmaster@aaaa.org](mailto:webmaster@aaaa.org) requesting that (a) we provide a copy of your profile of personally identifiable information, (b) we update or modify certain personally identifiable information, and/or (c) you be removed from our databases of active e-mail lists.

We will endeavor to comply with your request as soon as reasonably possible. To protect your confidentiality, we can only send a requested profile to the e-mail address listed in the profile. In any event, our back-up files will maintain copies of your personally identifiable information. We reserve the right to contact former customers or users of the Web site from time to time.

##   
Changes to This Privacy Policy

Due to changing technological and marketing demands, we must reserve the right to change our policies regarding the privacy of your personally identifiable information in the future. If that happens, we will endeavor to promptly update this Privacy Policy. We may also attempt to provide a message to our customers whose e-mail addresses we have, in conformity with this Privacy Policy, advising of any such change(s). Your continued use of the Web site following changes to this policy will indicate that you accept the changes.
