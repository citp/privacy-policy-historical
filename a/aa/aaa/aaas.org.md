**Personal Information We Collect**

When you visit the AAAS and _Science_ Websites, there are four types of information you might provide to us: contact information you knowingly choose to disclose; billing information when you join, subscribe, or make a purchase; demographic or other information about you; and technical information collected  by us as you interact with our websites.

Demographic Information

In other areas, we collect or may collect demographic information such as your age, career focus and discipline, preferences, gender, educational degrees, ethnic background, interests, and household income range. Sometimes, we collect or may collect a combination of information types. Examples of areas on the AAAS and _Science_ Websites where we collect or may collect personal or combined personal and demographic data are pages where you can sign up to use a service, post a resume, enter a contest, or purchase a product.

Some of this information is collected through the use of cookies (described below).

**_Use of Personal Information_**

The information collected may be used by AAAS for the purpose of providing you with the content you request, operating and improving the AAAS and _Science_ Websites, fostering a positive user experience, and delivering the products and services that we offer.

We may use your contact information in order to send you e-mail, postal mail, or other communications regarding updates at the AAAS and _Science_ Websites, such as Job Alerts, newsletters, new opportunities, and additional listings which may be of interest to you. We may also use it to send you information   about third-party products and services that match your interests and preferences, if you opt in for this communication. The nature and frequency of these messages will vary depending upon the information we have about you. In addition, at the time of registration for certain services, such as _Science_ Careers Job Alerts, or free partial access to any of the AAAS and _Science_ Websites, you have the option to elect to receive additional communications, information, newsletters, and promotions relating to topics that may be of special interest to you.

**_Cookies_**

A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard drive by a webpage server. We use cookies to deliver faster and more accurate results and a more personalized site experience. We also use cookies to track clickstreams, for load balancing, and for analytic purposes.

We use AdWords Remarketing, a remarketing and behavioral targeting service provided by Google. We also use Google and Adobe Analytics data and the DoubleClick cookie to serve ads based on a user's prior visits to our website.

We also use a Google-provided tool called reCAPTCHA, which, on some form submissions, is intended to distinguish humans from robots in order to prevent spam and abuse of those forms.

**_Web Beacons_**

Our webpages may contain electronic images known as web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel GIFs) that allow us to count users who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services. Web beacons are not used to access your personally identifiable information on the AAAS and _Science_ Websites. They are a tool we use to compile aggregated statistics about our website usage. Web beacons collect only a limited set of information, including a cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on which the web beacon resides.

**_Feedback_**

We have, or may have, an area on our websites where you can submit feedback. Any feedback you submit in this area becomes our property, and we have a legitimate interest in contacting you for further information.

**_How We Protect Your Information_**

We are concerned with protecting your privacy and data, but we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and we cannot guarantee that your information on the AAAS and _Science_ Websites may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our industry- standard physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. We provide reasonable technical, administrative, and physical controls to secure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of personal information. If you have any questions about security on the AAAS and _Science_ Websites, you may contact us at **[dataprotectionoffice@aaas.org.](mailto:dataprotectionoffice@aaas.org)**

**_Payment Processing_**

We utilize third-party payment services to enable you to purchase certain products or services from the AAAS and _Science_ Websites, for example, when you purchase back issues of _Science_ through our authorized provider. In such cases, you will be directed to a third-party service provider’s website operated by that provider in order to make the purchase. Any information that you provide to such provider may be subject to the applicable service provider’s privacy policy and not this Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for and have no control over the privacy policies or practices of third-party service providers. Use of third-party service providers to purchase products or services offered on the AAAS and _Science_ Websites is solely at your risk.

All credit transactions occur in a secure area of our site to protect you from any loss, misuse, or alteration of information collected. However, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat those measures or use your personal information for improper purposes. When you place an order online at any of the AAAS and _Science_ Websites, your credit card information is protected through the use of encryption of web content using Transport Layer Security.

**_Resumes_**

On _Science_ Careers, we give you the option of putting your resume or CV (collectively referred to as “resume”) in our database. There are two ways of doing this:

You can post your resume in our database as either a public or private resume. Public resumes can be searched by parties with access to our searchable resume database.

If you allow your resume to be searchable, then all parties with access to our searchable resume   database (or copies thereof) will have access to your resume. We attempt to limit access to our searchable resume database (or copies thereof) only to paying employers, recruiters, hiring managers, headhunters, and human resource professionals, as well as law enforcement and national security agencies, but cannot guarantee that other parties will not gain access to this database. We are not responsible for the use made of resumes by third parties who access such resumes while they are in our searchable database. You may remove your resume from our searchable database at any time.

However, employers, recruiters, and others who have paid for access to that database or to obtain a copy of that database, as well as parties who have otherwise gained access to the database may have retained a copy of your resume in their own files or databases. We are not responsible for the retention, use, or privacy of resumes in these instances.

Please note: It is not our practice to restrict access to our resume database to any particular customer(s). Please be advised that your current employer or an entity affiliated with your current employer might be a customer of the ScienceCareers.org sites. We are not responsible for any actions or results that may occur as a result of any customer’s access to and/or use of your resume.

We reserve the right to remove from our database any resumes we consider to be illegal or offensive.

**_Virtual Career Fairs_**

If you register to participate in a _Science_ _Careers_ Virtual Career Fair, we will collect and retain information about you, including Personal Information. 

Information you provide when registering for a _Science_ _Careers_ Virtual Career Fair is collected through our Virtual Career Fair platform provider and is shared with the career fair sponsor as well as the employers you interact with during the career fair.  This information includes Personal Information such as your name, email address, resume and information from other questions you answer during the registration process.  This information may also include chat history from conversations/interactions that you have with employers participating in the career fair; for clarity, if you participate in private chats, the conversation/interaction between you and an employer will be shared only with that employer.  If you participate in public chats, all participants will see your conversation/interaction during the chat and the chat history may be shared with all participating employers.  This information may become subject to the policies of the employers with whom you interacted at the career fair.  We are not responsible for these policies or any actions or results that may occur as a result of any employer’s access to and/or use of your information.
