# AAAS - Privacy Policy

### AAAS Privacy Policy

#### Effective Beginning 18 March 2009

##### Introduction

The AAAS Web site is maintained by the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), 1200 New York Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20005. Featuring science, technology, and policy news and resources, the AAAS Web site provides a mechanism for engaging the public, and for communicating news and information to members, researchers, educators, students, policy-makers, reporters, and others.

##### Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy describes how administrators of the AAAS Web site collect and use the information that users may decide to share. The policy is intended to allow site visitors to make informed decisions when using the Web site, located at www.AAAS.org, and its directly associated domains (collectively, "AAAS" or "Web site"). By using or accessing www.AAAS.org, you accept the practices described in this Privacy Policy. The AAAS Employment Application Website (EAS), has its own Privacy Policy which is located at [http://www.aaas.org/go/privacy_employ/](http://www.aaas.org/go/privacy_employ/?sa_campaign=Internal_Ads/AAAS/legal_pages/2009-09-30/privacy/pan-aaas/).

Questions regarding this statement should be directed to our privacy staff at [privacy@aaas.org](mailto:privacy@aaas.org?subject=Privacy%20policy%20statement).

##### Information We Collect

When you visit AAAS, you provide us with two types of information, both of which are collected by us: personal information that you knowingly choose to disclose, and Web site use information collected by us as you interact with our Web site.

The Association's Web sites generally do not require registration. For those sections that do require registration, a separate privacy policy may be provided. In those cases, you must agree with that privacy policy to become a registered user.

When you enter AAAS Web sites, we collect your browser type and IP address. This information is gathered for all AAAS Web site users. In addition, we store certain information from your browser using "cookies." Cookies are pieces of data stored on a user's computer tied to information about that user. For example, we use session identification (ID) cookies to confirm that users are logged in. These cookies automatically terminate once the user closes the browser. By default, we use a persistent cookie that stores your login ID (but not your password) to make it easier for you to login when you come back to AAAS. You may block or remove this convenience feature through the settings in your Web browser.

By using this Web site, you agree and acknowledge that your posting of user content (as defined in the AAAS [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms_of_use.shtml?sa_campaign=Internal_Ads/AAAS/legal_pages/2009-09-30/privacy/pan-aaas/)) on the site is done solely at your own risk. We cannot control the actions of other users with whom you may choose to share information, nor can we guarantee that our security system will not ever be breached. We cannot and do not guarantee that user content you post on the site will not be viewed by unauthorized persons. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the site. You understand and acknowledge that, even after removal, copies of user content may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if other users have copied or stored your user content.

Any improper collection or misuse of information provided on AAAS is a violation of the AAAS Terms of Use and should be reported to [privacy@aaas.org](mailto:privacy@aaas.org?subject=Improper%20collection%20or%20misue%20of%20information).

By using a AAAS Web site, you are consenting to have any data you enter transferred to and processed in the United States.

##### Children Under Age 18

AAAS does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 18. If you are under 18, please do not send to us or post on our Web site any personal information about yourself, including your name, address, telephone number or email address. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 18 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 18, please contact us at [info@AAAS.com](mailto:info@AAAS.com?subject=Info%20from/about%20children).

##### Sharing Your Information with Third Parties

AAAS will share your information with third parties where such sharing is 1) permitted by you, or 2) legally required. We may also provide information to service providers to help us bring you the services we offer. Where we utilize third parties for the processing of any personal information, we implement reasonable contractual and technical protections limiting the use of that information to the AAAS-specified purposes.

We may be required to disclose user information pursuant to lawful requests, such as subpoenas or court orders, or in compliance with applicable laws. We may reveal information if we have a good-faith belief that an information request by regulatory or law enforcement officials or private litigants meets applicable legal standards. Additionally, we may share account or other information when we believe it is necessary to comply with law, to protect our interests or property, to prevent fraud or other illegal activity perpetrated through the AAAS service or using the AAAS name, or to prevent imminent bodily harm. This may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers, agents or government agencies.

Through interactions with third-party sites, we may inadvertently receive some information about you or your use of the third-party site even if you are logged out from AAAS, or that pertains to non-AAAS users, from those sites in conjunction with the technical operation of the system.

If the AAAS ownership were to change, your user information may be transferred to the new owner so the service can continue operations. In any such transfer of information, your user information would remain subject to this Privacy Policy, including its provision for revisions.

Certain information you post to the Web site may be shared with other users beyond these privacy policies. _All such sharing of information is done at your own risk._ Please keep in mind that if you disclose personal information on any information submitted to a Web site, such as a blog, comments, messages, photos, videos, or other items, this information may become publicly available.

##### Links

AAAS may contain links to other Web sites. We cannot be and are not responsible for the privacy practices of other Web sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by AAAS.

##### Changing or Removing Information

Generally, user submissions may be removed only by AAAS or, if posted to a Group, by a Group Administrator or AAAS.

##### Security

AAAS takes appropriate precautions to protect our users' information. When you enter sensitive information (such as your password), we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). Because email and instant messaging are not recognized as secure communications, we request that you not send private information to us by email or instant messaging services. If you have any questions about the security of AAAS Web site, please contact us at [privacy@aaas.org](mailto:privacy@aaas.org?Web%20site%20security).

##### Terms of Use, Notices and Revisions

Your use of AAAS, and any disputes arising from it, is subject to this Privacy Policy as well as our Terms of Use and all of its dispute resolution provisions including arbitration, limitation on damages and choice of law. We reserve the right to change our Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use at any time. We may modify this Privacy Policy, effective immediately upon notice to you either by (1) electronic mail or conventional mail, or (2) posting to the site (which shall be deemed constructive notice). Your continued use of the site following notice of any modification to this Privacy Policy shall be conclusively deemed an acceptance of all such modification(s). We encourage you to refer to this policy on an ongoing basis so that you understand our current privacy policy. Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Policy applies to all information that we have about you and your account.
