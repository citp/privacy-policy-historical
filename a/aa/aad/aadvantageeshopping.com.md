How Your Information Will Be Used

American uses personally identifiable information to complete transactions and fulfill requests for our services. American requires you to provide personal information when making a reservation to purchase airline tickets or related products and services such as renting cars or booking hotel rooms through an American Airlines reservations agent, travel agent, the AA.com® Web site or other travel-related Web site, or enrolling in the AAdvantage program. In addition to processing, confirming and fulfilling the travel or other services you request, American may use this data for administrative and analytical purposes such as information systems management, accounting, billing and audits, marketing, credit card processing and verification, customer-relations correspondence, and/or operation of the AAdvantage program. 

To the extent required by law, we may disclose personally identifiable information to government authorities, or to third parties pursuant to a subpoena or other legal process, and we may also use or disclose your information as permitted by law to protect the rights or property of American, our customers, our Web site, or its users. 

American does not sell any customer information or share your email address with third parties except in compliance with this policy. However, we may disclose customer information to companies affiliated with American and/or unaffiliated third parties to fulfill the products and services you have requested. We may also disclose this information to third parties, such as employers, who have arranged for discounts, purchased travel or other services on your behalf. Additionally, American may combine the information we receive from you with information collected from other sources. This information would be used to provide offers and/or services specifically tailored to your interests. 

If we sell a business unit to another company and your personal data is used by that business unit then your data may be transferred to the buyer along with the business for them to use in the same way. 

**For Non-EU Residents**  
American also uses customer information to identify, develop and market products and services that we believe you will value. From time to time, you may receive offers from affiliated American companies such as AMR Investments, American Eagle, AAdvantage participants, American Airlines Vacations, and AmericanConnection® or from carefully-selected third party companies with which we have a business relationship. In addition, we may provide information we collect about you to third-parties to distribute promotions, sweepstakes, marketing surveys, focus groups, interviews and other opportunities offered by American. These third-parties are subject to stringent data security and confidentiality requirements and, upon completion of their services, all customer information is returned to American or destroyed. You may choose to restrict these marketing communications and sharing of your information with third parties as outlined in the section titled **"How You Can Opt Out of Marketing Communications and Sharing of Your Information With American or Third Parties "**. 

**For EU Residents Only**  
American also uses customer information to identify, develop and market products and services that we believe you will value and may contact you by email, text message, or post. If you do not want to receive these communications from us, you will be able to opt out at the time you initially provide us with your details and each time we send you a subsequent email or text. You can also opt out by using the link in the section of this privacy policy entitled "How you can opt out of marketing communications and sharing of your information with American or third parties". If you are not an existing customer but would like to opt in to receive emails or texts from American, its affiliated American companies such as AMR Investments, American Eagle, AAdvantage participants, American Airlines Vacations, and AmericanConnection or from carefully-selected third party companies with which we have a business relationship then please submit your request by email to [international.customer.relations@aa.com](mailto:international.customer.relations@aa.com).
