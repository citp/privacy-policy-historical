Protecting Your Privacy

This Privacy Policy should answer your questions about the sources and kinds of information we collect, how we use it, when it may be shared with others, and how we reasonably attempt to safeguard its confidentiality and security; however, it is not a contract. American reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time and will notify users of any material changes by updating the policy here and by including a "NEWLY UPDATED" label with the "PRIVACY POLICY" link on the websites governed by this policy for 30 days after any material changes are made.  Under no circumstances, though, does this Privacy Policy create a legal right. 

We also provide you with ways to correct the data you provide us and to limit our sharing of this data with third parties. This Privacy Policy is applicable to Travel Reservations, Corporate Sales, Marketing Research, Customer Relations/Service, the AAdvantage® program, our mobile apps, and certain affiliated American websites.

Minors  


Due to the nature of our services, travel purchase information, which may include personally identifiable information, may be collected by American from children under the age of 13 when it is necessary to comply with the law, including federal aviation or security regulations, or as otherwise necessary for American to provide transportation needs and services.  We may retain personally identifiable information when necessary to provide transportation and related services to a child under the age of 13.  American does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13 other than when necessary to comply with the law or for safety and security reasons.

Security  


When you buy an American Airlines ticket or access your AAdvantage® account over the World Wide Web, your web browser connects with the website through SSL ("Secure Sockets Layer"). SSL is an industry-standard way to send personal information over the Internet. SSL ensures you are actually sending data to American Airlines and not someone who claims to be American Airlines. Look for one or more of these indicators on your browser to ensure you have a secure connection:  A security alert window tells you that you are about to use a secure connection. Some browsers let you choose whether to display this window.

While American Airlines reasonably attempts to safeguard and to prevent unauthorized access to your private information including, without limitation, your personally identifiable information, we cannot be responsible for the acts of those who gain unauthorized access, and we make no warranty, express, implied, or otherwise, that we will prevent unauthorized access to your private information. IN NO EVENT SHALL AMERICAN AIRLINES OR ITS AFFILIATES BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES (WHETHER CONSEQUENTIAL, DIRECT, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF, OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH, A THIRD PARTY'S UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO YOUR INFORMATION, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH DAMAGES ARE BASED ON CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, TORT OR OTHER THEORIES OF LIABILITY, AND ALSO REGARDLESS OF WHETHER AMERICAN AIRLINES WAS GIVEN ACTUAL OR CONSTRUCTIVE NOTICE THAT DAMAGES WERE POSSIBLE.

How Your Information Will Be Used

American’s Services

American uses personally identifiable information to complete transactions and fulfill requests for our services.  For example, American requires you to provide personal information when making a reservation to purchase airline tickets or related products and services such as renting cars or booking hotel rooms through an American Airlines reservations agent, travel agent, the AA.com® website or other travel-related website, or enrolling in the AAdvantage® program.

Administrative and Analytical Purposes

In addition to processing, confirming and fulfilling the travel or other services you request, American may use customer information for administrative and analytical purposes such as information systems management, accounting, billing and audits, marketing, credit card processing and verification, customer-relations correspondence, and/or operation of the AAdvantage® program.  American also uses customer information to identify, develop and market products and services that we believe you will value. 

Legal Requirements

Please note that the laws and regulations of several countries may require us to provide foreign and domestic government agencies with access to the data you disclose to us and data that we have about you and your travel plans, history, or status.  Further, to the extent required by law, we may disclose personally identifiable information to government authorities, or to third parties pursuant to a subpoena or other legal process, and we may also use or disclose your information as permitted by law to protect the rights or property of American, our customers, our website, or its users. 

With Whom Your Information Will be Shared

American does not sell any customer information or share your personal information with third parties except in compliance with this policy. However, we may disclose customer information to companies affiliated with American and/or unaffiliated third parties to fulfill the products and services you have requested and to process your information for our own administrative and analytical purposes. We may also disclose this information to third parties, such as employers, who have arranged for discounts, purchased travel or other services on your behalf. Additionally, American may combine the information we receive from you with information collected from other sources. This information may be used to provide offers and/or services specifically tailored to your interests. 

From time to time, you may receive offers from affiliated American companies such as AMR Investments, American Eagle, AAdvantage® participants, American Airlines Vacations, and AmericanConnection® or from carefully-selected third party companies with which we have a business relationship. In addition, we may provide information we collect about you to third-parties to distribute promotions, sweepstakes, marketing surveys, focus groups, interviews and other opportunities offered by American. These third-parties are subject to stringent data security and confidentiality requirements and, upon completion of their services, all customer information is returned to American or destroyed.

If we sell a business unit to another company and your personal data is used by that business unit, then your data may be transferred to the buyer along with the business for them to use in the same way.
