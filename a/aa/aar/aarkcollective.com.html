                        <p>AÃRK Collective ships worldwide and all shipping charges are included in the price stated on the website.  Australian orders are shipped for FREE using Australia Express Post, which provides an overnight service to most major cities, and a two-day service for the rest of the country. All International orders are shipped by UPS, DHL, FedEx or Australia Post with an option for standard shipping or express shipping. A tracking number will be sent to you via email once your order has been dispatched so you can track your item, and a signature will be required upon delivery.</p>
<p> Once payment has been received we usually dispatch your order within 24 hours. Delivery times vary depending on the country and Customs issues and are therefore only indicative. You may also be responsible for import duties and taxes on your international order. Unfortunately, we have no control over these charges or delays and cannot predict what they may be. We suggest that you contact your local Customs office for additional information. </p>
