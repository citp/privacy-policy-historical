In the following sections, we explain in more detail the types of information we collect online.  


**Information we collect automatically on our website.**  AARP may collect certain information automatically (either directly, through the use of cookies and Web beacons or through the use of third-party service providers, agents or independent contractors who help us maintain our websites and provide other administrative services to us). This information includes:

    * Web beacons (sometimes called transparent GIFs, clear GIFs or Web bugs) are small strings of code that provide a way for us to deliver a small graphic image (usually invisible) on a Web page or in an email. Web beacons can recognize certain types of information on your computer such as cookies, the time and date a page is viewed, and a description of the page where the Web beacon is placed.
  * Information about your interactions with email messages, such as the links clicked on and whether the messages were opened or forwarded
  * Upon request for assistance, your bandwidth speed and information about the software programs installed on your computer
  * Standard server log information

### 4\. Information Collected by Third Parties

We may allow third-party analytics companies, research companies or ad networks to collect nonpersonally identifiable information on our website. These companies may use tracking technologies, including cookies and Web beacons, to collect information about users of our site in order to analyze, report on or customize advertising on our site or on other sites.

We may provide links or automatically redirect you to third-party websites that do not operate under this Privacy Policy. For example, if you click on an advertisement presented on our site, you may be taken to a website that AARP does not operate or control. You should review the privacy policies and terms of use of all third-party websites you access. These third-party websites may independently solicit and collect information from you. On occasion, those third-party websites may provide us with information about your use of those sites.

### 5\. With Whom Your Information May be Shared

AARP is committed to maintaining your trust and we want you to understand when and with whom your information may be shared.

Your information may be shared with:  


  * **Service Providers.  **Service Providers are third parties with whom we may work to offer a service or feature such as a job search feature that is operated by Indeed or LinkedIn. You can tell when you are accessing a service offered by a Service Provider because the Service Provider's name will be featured prominently. You may be asked to provide information about yourself to register for a service offered by a Service Provider. In doing so, you may be providing your information to both us and the Service Provider, or we may share your information with the Service Provider. Please note that the Service Provider's privacy policy may apply to its use of your information.
  * **Social Media Advertising Networks.   **We may share information about you with social media networks to allow for the delivery of customized advertising about products and services that you may be interested in.  We provide this information to the social media network so they can deliver the ad to the right social media user. The delivery of customized social media ads, and your ability to opt-out of receiving those ads, is governed by the privacy policies of the social media companies who deliver customized ads to you. ** **
  * **Licensed Providers.**  Licensed providers are third parties who make available special AARP-branded discounts, products or services. Some of the licensed providers of AARP-branded products and services, including many of those listed on the Member Benefits page on AARP.org, pay a fee for access to our membership list. These fees are used for the general purposes of AARP. Licensed providers are required to keep AARP member information confidential, and to use the information only to offer the contracted products or services to AARP and AARP members. Some of our licensed providers may also collect data about our members through their interactions with the members. The licensed providers may share some or all of this data with AARP so that we may make available more effective and personalized service to our members. We may share information including personally identifiable information collected with Licensed Providers, even if you are not an AARP member.
  * **Corporate Affiliates.  **We may share information including your personally identifiable information with wholly or majority owned affiliates or other affiliated organizations, such as AARP Foundation, AARP’s charitable affiliate, so they can provide you with information about services and programs that might interest you.  

  * **Approved Vendors.  **We may share your information including your personally identifiable information with companies we hire to provide certain a services such as sending mailings, improving advertising services, providing member benefits and managing databases or other technology.  

  * **Selected Nonprofit Organizations.**  We may occasionally engage in “list exchanges” with selected nonprofit organizations in which we may share your information including your personally identifiable information.  

  * **Aggregate Data.**  We may share aggregate statistics and other nonpersonally identifiable information with the media, government agencies, advertisers and other third parties. These aggregate statistics will not allow anyone to identify your name or other personally identifiable information.  




AARP May Share Your Information With Other Third Parties:  


  * **Pursuant to Legal Requirements.**  AARP will disclose your personally identifiable information in response to a subpoena or similar investigative demand, a court order, or a request for cooperation from a law enforcement agency or other government agency; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law.  

  * **To Protect Our Website and Users.  **We will disclose your personally identifiable information when we believe disclosure is necessary to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing; to protect and defend the rights, property or safety of our company, our employees, our website users or others; or to enforce our website terms and conditions or other agreements or policies.  

  * **In Connection With Business Transfers.**  We may share your personally identifiable information as required by law, such as in response to a subpoena or court order or in the unlikely event of a substantial corporate transaction, such as the sale of AARP or our affiliates, a merger, consolidation, asset sale or bankruptcy.



### 6\. How We Keep Your Information Secure

AARP uses commercially reasonable physical, procedural and technological security measures to help prevent unauthorized access to and improper use of the information we collect about you. For example, only authorized employees and authorized third parties are permitted to access personally identifiable information, and they may do so only for lawful purposes. When we share aggregate data with third parties we prohibit them from reengineering nonpersonal data to permit identification of individual users. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard your nonpublic personal information. However, no website or Internet network can be completely secure. Although we take steps to secure your information, we do not guarantee, and you should not expect, that your personal information, searches or other communications will always remain secure.
