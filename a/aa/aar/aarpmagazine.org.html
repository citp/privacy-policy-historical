<h1>AARP Privacy Policy</h1>


<p>
  <b>AARP understands how important privacy is to our members.</b>
  We are committed to protecting your privacy and want to make sure
  that you understand how your membership information is used. We
  also want you to be aware that you have choices about how we use
  this information.
</p>
<p>
  <b>What Information We Collect.</b> When you apply for
  membership, we ask for basic information such as your name,
  contact information, and date of birth. We keep track of your
  participation in AARP activities and member services so we can
  understand our members' interests and evaluate the
  effectiveness of our offerings. We also collect demographic
  information from other sources to help us learn more about member
  characteristics and needs. As explained in the Questions and
  Answers below, we may ask for additional information in your
  visits to www.aarp.org. All of this information helps us better
  serve our members and improve our programs.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Information Sharing.</b> We share your personal information
  only with companies we have selected to provide official AARP
  member services or support AARP operations. Some of the providers
  of AARP member services, including many of those listed on our
  <a href="http://www.aarp.org/benefits/">Member Services and
  Discounts</a> area, pay a fee for access to our membership list.
  Our contracts with these companies require them to keep the
  member information strictly confidential, and allow them to use
  the information only to offer the contracted services to AARP and
  AARP members. We oversee the companies' compliance through
  our wholly owned subsidiary, AARP Services, Inc. Other AARP
  affiliates, such as the AARP Foundation, may also have access to
  member information. Finally, we may release personal member
  information on the rare occasions when we are required to do so
  by law, or when necessary or appropriate to comply with legal
  process or to protect or defend AARP and its members. We do not
  sell or rent member information to telemarketers, mailing list
  brokers, or any other companies that are not offering AARP
  endorsed services or benefits.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Your Choices.</b> We respect your choices. If you do not want
  us to share your information with providers of AARP member
  services, you can contact us as specified below. You should then
  stop receiving AARP service provider mailings in about six to
  eight weeks. (Note: If you request services or information from
  an AARP service provider directly, we may still need to confirm
  to the provider that you are an eligible AARP member). You may
  also elect not to receive information about AARP activities, such
  as legislative events and educational programs, or about the
  activities of other AARP affiliates like the AARP Foundation.
</p>
<p>
  For More Information. For more detailed information about our
  privacy practices, and about privacy on www.aarp.org, please
  review the frequently asked questions below. To exercise your
  choices, or ask questions about your membership information,

<h2>
  Privacy and www.aarp.org: Questions and Answers
</h2>
<p>
  The following Questions and Answers address AARP and www.aarp.org
  privacy issues in more detail. We want to make sure that you
  understand the types of information that are collected at
  www.aarp.org, the ways in which that information is used and
  protected, and the choices that you have about this collection
  and use. Specifically, this privacy policy answers the following
  frequently asked <a name="questions" id="questions">questions:</a>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <a href="/aboutaarp/Articles/a2002-12-18-privacypolicy#1">Do I

  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  In this policy, we use the terms "AARP,"
  "we," "our," and "us" to refer to
  AARP and its subsidiary, AARP Services, Inc. We use the terms
  "you" and "your" to refer to www.aarp.org
  visitors like yourself.
</p>
<p>
  <b>1. Do <a name="1">I</a> have to submit any personal
  information in order to use www.aarp.org?</b>
</p>
<p>
  You do not need to give us any information about yourself in
  order to access most of www.aarp.org. You can visit our pages,
  read our publications, and learn about our member services on a
  completely anonymous basis.
</p>
<p>
  If you want to take advantage of some of the optional services
  available on www.aarp.org, however, we will sometimes request
  information that allows us to identify you ("personal
  information"). If you use the online form to join AARP or
  renew your membership, for example, we will ask for certain
  information to process your application (name, birth date, phone
  number, mailing address, e-mail address, employment status, and
  credit card number). If you register to receive <a href="http://www.aarp.org/emailnews/">e-mail newsletters</a>, we will
  ask for your name, address, member number, and e-mail address so
  that we can send you the newsletters. We may also ask for
  personal information when you participate in other activities or
  services on www.aarp.org, such as surveys and discussion groups.
</p>
<p>
  We also have relationships with certain providers and vendors
  that we have selected and approved to offer services and benefits
  on linked sites. On some of these sites, you may be asked to
  enter personal information in order to take advantage of their
  services or programs. If you decide to purchase services on the
  web site of one of our member benefits service providers, the
  contracted member benefit provider offering the services may ask
  for your name, member number, address, and e-mail in order to
  contact you about the services. Examples of sites operated in
  conjunction with AARP Service Providers include: the <a href="http://aarp.scudder.com/">AARP Investment Program from
  Scudder</a>, <a href="http://aarp.scudder.com/">AARP Health Care
  Options</a>, and <a href="http://www.aarppharmacy.com/tpl_default.asp?1">AARP Pharmacy
  Services</a>. These sites may also have their own unique privacy
  policies that you should review.
</p>
<p>
  Again, regardless of whether you are visiting www.aarp.org or an
  affiliated site, you do not have to disclose any personal
  information if you do not want to. You can always decide not to
  use the optional services that require the submission of such
  information. The choice is yours. We are only interested in
  offering you convenient online services that match your interests
  and needs.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="/aboutaarp/Articles/a2002-12-18-privacypolicy#questions">| Top
  Of Questions |</a>
</p>
<p>
  <b>2. <a name="2">Does</a> www.aarp.org collect non-personal
  information, using "cookies" or otherwise?</b>
</p>
<p>
  We also collect other types of information that do not allow us
  to identify your name, e-mail address, or other personal
  characteristics. This "non-personal information"
  includes the number assigned to your computer whenever you access
  the Internet ("IP address"), and the type of browser
  you use. None of this non-personal information allows us to
  identify or contact you. We use this information to help us
  evaluate how www.aarp.org is being used. By gathering this
  information, we can learn, among other things, how many people
  visit www.aarp.org, which www.aarp.org pages are the most and
  least popular, and which other web sites are the most frequent
  referral sources for www.aarp.org.
</p>
<p>
  We may also assign a "cookie" to your computer in some
  situations. Like an IP address, a "cookie" is a kind of
  online identification tag that allows us to recognize your
  computer each time you visit www.aarp.org.
</p>
<p>
  Unless you have already provided us with personal information on
  www.aarp.org or an affiliated site, cookies do not allow us to
  identify you by name, e-mail address, or other personal
  characteristics. We use cookies primarily to identify return
  visitors and make your www.aarp.org experience more convenient.
  The www.aarp.org discussion boards, for example, place a cookie
  on your computer so that the next time you visit the discussion
  board, messages posted since your last visit will be highlighted.
</p>
<p>
  AARP has also contracted with a vendor (<a href="http://www.doubleclick.com/us/corporate/privacy/privacy/default.asp?asp_object_1=&amp;">
  DoubleClick</a>) to place AARP-approved banner advertisements on
  www.aarp.org. The cookies allow AARP to manage the delivery of
  these ads - for example, by counting the number of times a
  visitor has viewed different banners. If a visitor has viewed the
  same banner a number of times, AARP can use the vendor's
  system to automatically display different banners in the next
  visit. AARP has complete control over the banners that are placed
  on www.aarp.org through this system.
</p>
<p>
  We use another vendor (<a href="http://www.websidestory.com/privacy/overview.html">WebSideStory</a>)
  to collect aggregate information about www.aarp.org usage - such
  as the most visited pages and features. This vendor also uses
  cookies and transparent images called "web bugs" to
  collect this information. Like cookies, web bugs do not allow us
  or the vendor to identify you by name or other personal
  characteristics. These vendors do not collect any personal
  information from members on www.aarp.org, and they do not share
  the non-personal information collected on www.aarp.org with
  anyone else for any other purpose.
</p>
<p>
  If you are uncomfortable allowing cookies to be placed on your
  computer, a feature on Computers and Technology will teach you
  how to set your browser so that it will not accept these cookies,
  or so that it will notify you whenever a web site is trying to
  use cookies. If you choose not to accept cookies, however, you
  may not be able to use certain features of www.aarp.org or linked
  sites. You will still be able to visit the general www.aarp.org
  pages on an anonymous basis, just as you have in the past.

  Of Questions |</a>
</p>
<p>
  <b>3. How <a name="3">is</a> this information used, and can I
  control the uses?</b>
</p>
<p>
  Our primary purpose in collecting this information is to provide
  you with the services you request, and to evaluate and improve
  other services that we offer. As explained above, for example, we
  ask for information so that we can process your membership
  application, send you the e-mail newsletters to which you have
  subscribed, and provide you with discounted shopping
  opportunities. We store your membership information in our
  computer files, and use this information to service your
  membership account, send you publications like "<a href="http://www.aarpmagazine.org">AARP The Magazine</a>" and the
  "<a href="http://www.aarp.org/bulletin/">AARP
  Bulletin</a>," and answer any questions that you may have
  about membership. We may also use this information for other
  purposes. For example, we may review demographic information,
  survey results, and statistical analyses of www.aarp.org usage in
  order to help us evaluate, modify, and develop services that are
  likely to be of interest to our members.
</p>
<p>
  On occasion, we will also use your membership information to send
  you notices in the mail about special member benefits, discounts,
  and offers. If you do not want to receive these mailings, you
  can: (1) e-mail us at <a href="mailto:member@aarp.org">member@aarp.org</a>, (2) call us at
  1-888-OUR-AARP (1-888-687-2277), or (3) write to us at AARP
  Membership Center, 3200 E. Carson Street, Lakewood, CA 90712. If
  you have subscribed to any of the www.aarp.org e-mail
  newsletters, and would like to stop receiving them, follow the
  instructions at the bottom of each of the newsletters that you
  receive. Some affiliated sites may also send you promotional
  e-mails if you asked to receive them when you registered for
  their respective services. In addition, each issue of these
  e-mail newsletters or notices will always include instructions
  for unsubscribing. Again, these notices are designed to describe
  the benefits of AARP membership, but we do not want to send them
  to you if you are not interested in receiving them.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="/aboutaarp/Articles/a2002-12-18-privacypolicy#questions">| Top
  Of Questions |</a>
</p>
<p>
  <b>4. Is <a name="4">any</a> information shared with other
  companies or organizations, and can I "opt out"?</b>
</p>
<p>
  AARP takes very seriously its responsibility to keep your
  personal information confidential and private. We do not sell or
  rent any of our members' personal information to
  telemarketers, mailing list brokers, or any other companies that
  are not offering AARP endorsed services or benefits. As explained
  above, we share member information with the limited number of
  companies that we have selected to provide AARP member services.
  These "AARP Service Providers" include the insurance
  companies offering plans through AARP Health Care Options, and
  the financial institutions offering products through AARP Credit
  Card Services and the AARP Investment Program. Most of these AARP
  Service Providers are listed in our Member Services page. Like
  most organizations, we also hire companies to provide certain
  administrative services that require access to member
  information, such as processing address labels, managing
  databases, and sending mailings ("approved vendors").
</p>
<p>
  We require all of these AARP Service Providers and approved
  vendors to hold member information in strict confidence. These
  providers and vendors are contractually required to maintain the
  security and confidentiality of all member information, and are
  prohibited from using that information for any purpose other than
  providing the services specified in their contracts with AARP. We
  audit and monitor these companies to ensure that the member
  information is protected.
</p>
<p>
  If you do not want us to share your personal information with
  AARP Service Providers, you can: (1) e-mail us at <a href="mailto:member@aarp.org">member@aarp.org</a>, (2) call us at
  1-888-OUR-AARP (1-888-687-2277), or (3) write to us at AARP
  Member Services, 3200 E. Carson Street, Lakewood, CA 90712. If
  you ask us not to share your personal information, you should
  then stop receiving AARP Service Provider mailings in about six
  to eight weeks. (Note: If you request services or information
  from an AARP Service Provider directly, we may still need to
  confirm to the provider that you are an eligible AARP member).
</p>
<p>
  We may also disclose personal information when required to do so
  by law or when such action is necessary or appropriate to comply
  with legal process served on AARP, to protect and defend the
  rights or property of AARP, or to protect the personal safety of
  users of the www.aarp.org. We reserve the right to contact the
  appropriate authorities in our discretion when visitors'
  activities appear to be illegal or inconsistent with our
  policies.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, we may sometimes share aggregate statistics and
  non-personal information with the media, government agencies,
  advertisers, and other third-parties. For example, we may publish
  statistics on the number of members in various states, or the
  number of visitors to www.aarp.org. These aggregate statistics
  will not allow anyone to identify member names or other personal
  information.

  Of Questions |</a>
</p>
<p>
  <b>5. What <a name="5">privacy</a> rules apply when I
  "click" over to other web sites?</b>
</p>
<p>
  www.aarp.org includes links to other web sites, some of which are
  operated by AARP Service Providers or approved vendors, and some
  of which are not. Sites operated by AARP Service Providers and
  approved vendors may also collect personal information, and may
  have their own privacy policies that differ from, and are not
  covered by, this privacy policy. For example, the <a href="http://aarp.scudder.com/">AARP Investment Program site from
  Scudder</a> has its own unique information collection practices
  and privacy policy. It is important that you review any privacy
  policies on these sites carefully before you use any services or
  programs offered.
</p>
<p>
  When you click to unaffiliated third-party sites, AARP is not
  responsible for, and has no control over, the information
  collection or privacy practices of that site. It is important
  that you review and understand the privacy policies posted on any
  linked sites you visit before volunteering any of your personal
  information. These sites may also collect cookies, or allow
  third-party advertisers on their sites to collect cookies. You
  can often find information regarding a site and its privacy
  policy on the site's home page. If you cannot find or do not
  like a site's privacy policy, you may prefer not to do
  business with, or offer information to, that site.

</p>
<p>
  <b>6. Do <a name="6">privacy</a> protections exist in discussion
  groups?</b>
</p>
<p>
  It is important to understand that the information you submit in
  discussion groups, bulletin boards, and chat rooms is publicly
  displayed. Your messages will be seen by people and organizations
  not related to AARP, and may be used by these third parties to
  contact you. As a result, you should be very careful about the
  information that you include in these messages. Because these
  unrelated parties will also see your "User Name" on any
  postings that you make in the discussion groups, you may not want
  to use your full name. You can use your first name only, or use
  an assumed name, if you like. The www.aarp.org Discussion area is
  offered in conjunction with an approved AARP vendor, and has its
  own terms and conditions of use. Read these terms to learn more

  <b>7. How <a name="7">does</a> www.aarp.org protect security and
  confidentiality?</b>
</p>
<p>
  In order to protect your personal information, we use
  technologies and processes such as encryption, access control
  procedures, network firewalls, physical security, and other
  measures. These measures increase the security and privacy of
  information traveling to, from, and within www.aarp.org. Only our
  authorized employees or agents carrying out permitted business
  functions are allowed to access personal information. Employees
  who violate our privacy access policies may be subject to
  disciplinary actions, including termination when appropriate.
</p>
<p>
  In order to receive some services, we may require you to use a
  password to protect your membership account from unauthorized
  access by others. If you do allow others, including family or
  household members, to access AARP members-only services through
  your personal password or to use your membership account number,
  please understand that you are responsible for the actions of
  those individuals.

<p>
  <b>8. <a name="8">Will</a> this privacy policy ever change?</b>
</p>
<p>
  This privacy policy describes the types of information we
  currently collect, and the ways we use and protect that
  information. If you are uncomfortable with our policies and
  practices, please do not provide any personal information to us
  through www.aarp.org.
</p>
<p>
  From time to time, we may collect different types of information
  and use that information in different ways - for example, when we
  add features or services to www.aarp.org. In these cases, we may
  edit this policy to explain the new practices. Because protecting
  members' privacy is very important to us, we do not expect
  major changes in policy. However, if we do make significant
  changes in our practices, we will include announcements on the
  www.aarp.org home page so that you will know to review the
  revised policy.
