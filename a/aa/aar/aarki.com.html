                        Aarki, Inc. (“Aarki”) is committed to respecting the privacy
                        rights of its customers, visitors, and other users of the website
                        located at www.aarki.com (the “Site”) or of any software or
                        services provided by Aarki (collectively, the “Service”).
                        Aarki created this Privacy Policy (this “Policy”) to give you
                        confidence as you visit and use the Site and/or Services, to
                        demonstrate our commitment to fair information practices and the

                        practices and policies that differ materially from this Policy.
                        This Policy also explains how you can contact us if you have a

                         The Site is a “general audience website”, and Aarki does not
                        knowingly collect or maintain Personal Information from persons

                        any of our content specifically at children under 13 years of age.
                        If you are under 13 years of age, then you may not use or access
                        the Site or the Services at any time or in any manner.  We
                        understand and are committed to respecting the sensitive nature of
                        children’s privacy online.  If we learn or have reason to suspect
                        that a user of the Site or Services is under age 13 or if we learn
                        or have reason to suspect that Personal Information of persons
                        under age 13 has been collected on the Site or through the Services
                        without verifiable parental consent, we will take steps to promptly

                        In operating the Site and providing the Services, Aarki
                        may collect certain information, including without limitation the
                        following:</p>

                                When you sign up for an account at the Site or register for any
                                Services, Aarki may ask you for personally identifiable
                                information including but not limited to your name, mailing
                                address, phone number, e-mail address, contact preferences and
                                credit card or other billing information (“Personal
                                Information”).</p></li>
                                <li><p><u>AUTOMATICALLY COLLECTED INFORMATION</u>.
                                Our servers automatically recognize information
                                that your browser sends whenever you visit a website, which may
                                include information such as the domain names and Internet Protocol
                                (IP) addresses of visitors to the Site, as well as the browser
                                type and the date and time of the browser’s access to the Site.
                                No Personal Information about you is revealed in this process and
                                we generally treat information collected by such process as
                                non-Personal Information.  However, to the extent that Internet
                                Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered
                                Personal Information by local law, we treat these identifiers as
                                Personal Information.  The Site may also gather anonymous “traffic
                                data” that does not personally identify you, but that may be
                                helpful for marketing purposes or for improving the services we
                                offer.</p></li>

                                useful and which areas need improvement.  We do not set any
                                Personal Information in cookies, nor do we employ any data capture
                                mechanisms on the Site other than cookies.  We treat information
                                collected by cookies as non-Personal Information.  You can choose
                                whether to accept cookies by changing the settings on your
                                browser.  However, if you choose to disable this function, your
