## Automatic Data Collection/Use of Cookies

Our website has features that automatically keep track of the pages that you visit, in order to determine which of our website's services are the most popular. This data is used for us to deliver customized content and advertising to customers whose behavior indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area.

Our website automatically collects information about your computer hardware and software. This information can include: your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring website addresses. We use this information to operate our website, to maintain the quality of the service on our website, and to provide general statistics regarding the use of our website.

Our website also uses "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.

One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize our web pages, or register with our website, a cookie helps the website recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the features on our website that you have customized.

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of our services or of the pages of our website that you visit.

## Location Based Services

If you have allowed our mobile application to access your location when you conduct a search, we and our business partners/service providers collect, use, and share your location and search data, including, the approximate location of your device, the time and date of your search, and an unique identifier generated by the application. This information does not personally identify you and will be used by us and our business partners/service providers to provide and improve location-based products and services. 

## Security of your Personal Information

We use commercially reasonable precautions to protect and secure your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to help protect customer information. Appropriate employees are authorized to access customer information for business purposes only. Our policies require employees to maintain the confidentiality of customer information, and employees are subject to disciplinary action if they fail to do so, up to and including termination. Information secured on our computer system is in a controlled, secure environment, aimed at protecting it from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted via the internet, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.

## Email Security

"Phishing" is a scam designed to steal your personal information. If you receive an email that looks like it is from us asking you for your personal information which you suspect may be a scam, please notify us at [legal@aarons.com](mailto:legal@aarons.com).

## Retention and Storage of Your Personal Information

We retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purpose(s) for which it was collected and to comply with applicable laws, and your consent to such purpose(s) remains valid after termination of your relationship with us.

For Canadian Residents: Your personal information may be processed and stored outside of the province in which you reside and/or outside of Canada by us, an affiliate or an unaffiliated service provider for the purposes set out in this Privacy Statement and, under the laws of these other jurisdictions, in certain circumstances foreign courts, law enforcement agencies or regulatory agencies may be entitled to access your personal information.
