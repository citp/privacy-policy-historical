# Our Privacy Policy, Your Privacy Rights

We collect data (some of which may be personal data) by automated means when you interact with us through our websites and apps, and when we communicate with you by email or text message. We use standard technologies, including browser cookies, Web beacons, and third-party analytics services to collect this behavioral and operational data, which may be recorded and retained in web logs and other AARP systems.

The collection of such data is a common practice that supports digital services, and is used to provide customized digital experiences, as well as for market research, marketing, analytics, and system administration purposes. For example, we may use this data to determine whether you’ve previously visited our website, to store your preferences and settings, and to provide authentication processes so you can more easily access your account. We also may use this data to target custom content and ads to you on our websites, in our apps, and through other digital communications, as well as on third-party websites and apps as described in the  _Targeted Advertising  _section below.

Examples of the data we may automatically collect as part of our website, app, and digital communication experiences include:

• Your device and browser type, your operating system version, and your language settings

• Your Internet service provider (ISP)

• Your internet protocol (IP) address, Mobile Advertising ID, media access control (MAC) address, or similar identifiers

• The website that referred you to our website, or that you visit upon leaving our website via a link from our site

• The times and dates that you visit our websites or use our apps, and the duration of such use

• Information about areas of our websites or apps that you visited or used, as well as specific content or advertisements you viewed or links you clicked

• Information that identifies the precise physical location of your mobile device, based on your specific consent (we may use your IP address to generally estimate your location without seeking your specific consent – but such data does not provide a precise location)

• Information collected through cookies, Web beacons, analytics tools, and other similar technologies

º A “cookie” is a small data file that a website sends to and stores on your device that allows the site to recognize your browser or store information or settings. The cookie itself does not contain personal data, but can be read by the entity that placed the cookie and may allow it to associate your device to personal data. We may use “persistent” and/or “session” cookies. Persistent cookies are stored on your computer and used for various purposes by your browser on subsequent website visits (such as to avoid having to reenter your log-on credentials). Session cookies are temporarily held in your computer’s memory and erased after you end a browser session or shut off your computer.

º A Web beacon (sometimes called transparent or single pixel “GIFs”) is an invisible digital object embedded in a webpage or email. Web beacons are typically used to monitor your interaction with the webpage or email. Web beacons can help us count visitors, determine whether emails are opened, how long a webpage is viewed, and perform similar functions. Our webpages may contain Web beacons from third parties, which help us compile aggregated statistics regarding the effectiveness of our ad campaigns and assess website operations.   

º Analytics tools allow us to measure and assess how users interact with our websites, apps, and digital communications. These services are typically provided by third-parties with whom we contract – primarily Adobe and Google Analytics. These providers may use many of the same technologies discussed above (such as cookies and Web beacons) to collect various data points associated with your visits to our websites and use of our apps.

We may also collect data (some of which may be personal data) by automated means when you call our customer service center. For instance, we may record audio of these calls for quality control, training, security, and analytics purposes.

You have choices to limit the collection and use of some of this data as described in the _Your Personal Data Choices_ section of this Privacy Policy.
