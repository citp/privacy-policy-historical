  <li> The AAOS website is not set up to track, collect or distribute personal information about its visitors.  It does recognize the home server of visitors, but not e-mail addresses.  For example, in the non-password protected areas of the AAOS.org web site, AAOS can determine which Internet service provider our visitors use, but not the names, addresses or other information about our visitors that would allow us to identify the particular visitors to our sites.  Once a member or customer logs into the AAOS.org web site, it is possible to determine which areas of the web site they visited.</li></ol>

<p><b>How will this Personal Information Be Used? </b></p>

  <ol type="1" compact=""><li> Personal information may be used for internal AAOS purposes by authorized AAOS staff. </li>

  <li> Personal information will not be released to third parties except as noted below:   </li>

    <ul type="circle" compact=""><li> To ensure that the American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery (ABOS) has accurate contact information for disseminating Maintenance of Certification (MOC) requirements, the AAOS provides, on an annual basis, the ABOS with a list of all current Fellows, Emeritus, and Inactive members that includes their mailing address and their e-mail address of record.</li>

    <li> Upon request, the AAOS may provide the names and postal mailing addresses of its Fellows and Members to orthopaedic specialty societies that are members of the Board of Specialty Societies (BOS) for use in encouraging participation in Continuing Medical Education (CME) programs. Each mailing is subject to the approval of the AAOS and the organization agrees to use the list only once. Use of this information for recruiting, updating a database, or to compile additional mailing lists—for any purpose—is expressly prohibited. </li>

    <li> Upon request, the AAOS may provide the names and postal mailing addresses of its Fellows and Members to state and regional orthopaedic societies for recruitment purposes. The AAOS shall provide a recruiting list once annually and the state or regional orthopaedic society agrees to use it only once.  State or regional orthopaedic societies may also request names and postal mailing addresses for use in encouraging participation in Continuing Medical Education (CME) programs.   Each mailing is subject to the approval of the AAOS and the organization agrees to use the list only once. Use of this information for updating a database or to compile additional mailing lists—for any purpose—is expressly prohibited.</li>

    <li> Upon request, the AAOS may provide the names and postal mailing addresses of its Fellows and Members to other not-for-profit organizations whose missions are consistent with the mission of the AAOS for use in encouraging participation in CME programs. Each mailing is subject to the approval of the AAOS and the organization agrees to use the list only once. Use of this information for updating a database or to compile additional mailing lists—for any purpose—is expressly prohibited.</li>

    <li> The AAOS makes available the AAOS Membership Directory at no charge on the Internet to AAOS Fellows and Members. A hard copy version of the AAOS Membership Directory is available for purchase to AAOS Fellows and Members. This Membership Directory contains the name, postal mailing address, telephone and Fax number, membership status, and year of admittance to the AAOS of Fellows and Members. Associate Resident Members, Associate Candidate Members, International Affiliate Members, and International Resident Members are not included in the AAOS Membership Directory. </li>

    <li> Members of the public, through the AAOS website's Find an Orthopaedist listing, may obtain limited information about an AAOS Fellow or Member, including only the Fellow or Member's name, office postal mailing address, telephone and fax number, and practice demographics. Each member’s status (e.g., resident, candidate member, Fellow, etc.) is also listed. For Fellows, the year they became Fellows accompanies the listing. In addition, AAOS Fellows or Members who have a web site may elect to display its link in the Find an Orthopaedist listing. Use of this information to compile mailing lists—for any purpose—is expressly prohibited.</li>

    <li> The Private Membership Directory, accessible only to AAOS members, displays the same information as Find an Orthopaedist but also includes E-mail addresses if known. A member’s home city, state, country, and postal code are also listed if known, but not his street address. Use of the Private Membership Directory for the use of compiling e-mail distribution lists—for any purpose—by an AAOS member or anyone working on his or her behalf, is expressly prohibited.</li>

    <li> Annual Meeting registration lists, including the medical registrant’s name, postal mailing address, and phone number, are available for sale to exhibitors in advance of and after the Annual Meeting. In addition, certain personal information, including the medical registrant’s name, postal mailing address, phone number, hospital affiliation and practice focus, is available at the Annual Meeting to exhibitors through a "lead retrieval system" mechanism.</li>

    <li> CME course registration lists, including the attendee’s name and postal mailing address, are available at no charge to companies providing educational displays and/or providing equipment (for skills courses) after an AAOS CME course.</li>

    <li> AAOS may provide the names, postal mailing addresses, and telephone and Fax numbers of AAOS Fellows and Members to third party organizations with whom the AAOS has contracted to provide courses, goods or services. </li>

    <li> The National Provider Identifier (NPI) number may be given to exhibitors who are required to report to the government payments they have provided to health care providers, including orthopaedic surgeons.</li>

  </ul><li> At the current time, we are aware of no other circumstances under which AAOS will provide personal information collected online to third parties.</li></ol>

<p><b>Can the Personal Information Be Viewed and/or Corrected?</b></p>

<p>The AAOS encourages its Fellows and Members as well as its Customers to update and correct their personal information regularly online.  A review and update section is included on the AAOS web site under the <i>Member Services</i> (<u><a href="http://www.aaos.org/myprofile" target="_top">www.aaos.org/myprofile</a></u>) section to make these changes.  </p>

<p><b>How Long will the Personal Information Be Retained?</b></p>

<p>The AAOS retains personal information regarding AAOS Fellows and Members indefinitely.  </p>

<p>AAOS retains customer data for at least five years and as dictated by business and legal requirements.</p>

<p><b>Permission to Disseminate the Personal Information/Opt Out of its Being Disseminated?</b></p>

<p>There is currently no mechanism for orthopaedic surgeons, including AAOS Fellows and Members, to opt-out of dissemination to third parties of the personal information described in this policy.  It is possible for orthopaedic surgeons to opt out of <i>all </i>AAOS web site functions.  Members can via the web site separately unsubscribe to <i>Headline News Now</i> and Advocacy <i>Now</i>.  Members can also opt out of the paper version of the Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (JAAOS) by contacting Customer Service.</p>

<p>AAOS generally does not disseminate personal information obtained from non-orthopaedic surgeons to third parties.  </p>

<p><b>Effective Date:  </b></p>

<p>This policy has been in effect since June, 2000, and was most recently revised in July, 2012.  It will continue in effect until further notice from AAOS.  Modifications to this policy shall be posted as the “Privacy Policy” linked to the AAOS homepage.  </p>
