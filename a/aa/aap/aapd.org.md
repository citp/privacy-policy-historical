To gain access to members-only resources and personalization features on the website, members are asked to provide a unique user ID and password.

###### The AAPD uses information voluntarily submitted by AAPD members and others to provide members with personalized service tailored to your needs and to enable us to continually improve the convenience and functionality of this site. For example, we maintain a directory of pediatric dentists that may include information that an AAPD member submitted via our website.
