**AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PROFESSIONAL CODERS  
****PRIVACY POLICY**  


**1\. Privacy Philosophy**

The American Academy of Professional Coders (the Academy) values your privacy and recognizes the sensitivity of your personal information. Our employees share the same concerns. Together, we work towards protecting your privacy. We have carefully crafted our Privacy Policy to address any concerns you might have, and to assure you that your personal information, if provided to us, will be treated carefully and appropriately.

**2\. Collection and Use of Information**

You may view and use the Site generally without providing us with any personal information. However, in order to make purchases on the Site and, in some cases, to fully utilize certain other features and functions of the Site, you must provide us with certain personally identifiable information. By providing such information, you consent to our collection and use of it, as described in this Privacy Policy.

The information you provide may include information provided during the purchasing process, including contact information (such as your name, address and email address) and financial information such as a credit card number. This information will be used to process your order and if necessary, to contact you regarding the status of your order. In addition, the Academy may use your contact information to get in touch with you regarding the status of your membership, if applicable, or other matters.

The Site may provide you with email capabilities for your use. In the event you voluntarily disclose personally identifiable information using such convenience services, that information, along with any substantive information disclosed in your communication or post, can be collected, correlated and used by third parties. This may result in unsolicited messages from third parties. Such activities are beyond our control. The Academy does not monitor or review the contents of any email, bulletin board or chat room.

**3\. Security**

We strive to keep your personal information as secure as possible. To that end, we use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) software to encrypt your information as it is transmitted.

**4\. Cookies**

Like most web sites, the Site uses "cookies" to allow you to move more quickly through the Site. Cookies are small text strings which are stored in your browsers memory. The Academy does not use the personal information collected by cookies except to recognize repeat users and facilitate their ongoing access to and use of the web site.

The Academy reserves the right to perform statistical analyses and profiling of user behavior and characteristics in order to measure interest in and use of the various areas of the Site and to inform third parties of such information.

The Site may provide you with links to the web sites of third parties. In the event you choose to access such web sites, The Academy is not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties. We recommend that you check the applicable privacy policy of such party before providing personally identifiable information to it, as its privacy policy may differ from the Academy's.

**5\. Correcting Your Information**

By following the simple instructions on the Site, you may correct or update any of the information you provide to us at any time.

**6\. Changes in our Privacy Policy**

Any changes to our Privacy Policy will be posted on this page so that you are always aware of our policies. We may also contact you by email with any changes.
