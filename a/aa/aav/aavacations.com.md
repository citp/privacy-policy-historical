**Aggregate information**  
In addition to obtaining your personal information, when you use our site, we may collect tracking information such as your browser type, the type of operating system you use, the name of your Internet service provider, and pages visited on the site.

How Your Information Will Be Used  
---  
American uses personally identifiable information to complete transactions and fulfill requests for our services. American requires you to provide personal information when making a reservation to purchase airline tickets or related products and services such as renting cars or booking hotel rooms through an American Airlines reservations agent, travel agent, the AA.com® website or other travel-related website, or enrolling in the AAdvantage program. In addition to processing, confirming and fulfilling the travel or other services you request, American may use this data for administrative and analytical purposes such as information systems management, accounting, billing and audits, credit card processing and verification, customer-relations correspondence, operation of the AAdvantage program. 

To the extent required by law, we may disclose personally identifiable information to government authorities, or to third parties pursuant to a subpoena or other legal process, and we may also use or disclose your information as permitted by law to protect the rights or property of American, our customers, our website, or its users. 

American does not sell any customer information or share your email address with third parties except in compliance with this policy. However, we may disclose customer information to companies affiliated with American and/or unaffiliated third parties to fulfill the products and services you have requested. We may also disclose this information to third parties, such as employers, who have arranged for discounts, purchased travel or other services on your behalf. 

American also uses customer information to identify, develop and market products and services that we believe you will value. From time to time, you may receive offers from affiliated American companies such as AMR Investments, American Eagle, AAdvantage participants, American Airlines Vacations, and AmericanConnection® or from carefully-selected third party companies with which we have a business relationship. In addition, we may provide information we collect about you to third-parties to distribute promotions, sweepstakes, marketing surveys, focus groups, interviews and other opportunities offered by American. These third-parties are subject to stringent data security and confidentiality requirements and, upon completion of their services, all customer information is returned to American or destroyed. You may choose to restrict these marketing communications and sharing of your information with third parties as outlined in the section below.
