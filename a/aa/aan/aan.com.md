policy, the AAN Executive Committee or the AAN Board of Directors.
There are no restrictions on the disclosure of the following individual member
information to either members or the public:
     • Verification of membership including the start date and status of
         membership
     • Committee appointments
     • Section affiliations

Non-member information will not be disclosed outside of the Academy, the AAN
Foundation, and AAN Enterprises, Inc. (AAN Subsidiaries)
Member and Non-Member Data Collection
The AAN collects both member and non-member information from multiple
sources including but not limited to membership applications, service on AAN
Committees and AAN Sections, product purchases, meeting attendance, CME
activities, surveys, abstract and manuscript submittals, subscription requests,
charitable contributions, and training and certification organizations. The
member and non-member data collected by the Academy, the AAN Foundation,
and AAN Enterprises, Inc. (AAN Subsidiaries) is the intellectual property of the
American Academy of Neurology and covered by the American Academy of
Neurology Confidentiality Policy.
Member Contact Information
Members of the AAN may have access to member contact information. Member
contact information may not be stored, reproduced, or in any other manner
provided to others or used for promotional purposes without the written
permission of the AAN. The mailing addresses of members may be made
available to nonmembers if approved through the AAN Mailing List Request
procedures. However, member telephone numbers, fax numbers, and email
addresses are considered confidential and may not be disclosed to non-
members without the permission of the AAN Executive Director.
                                          1


AAN Executive Director, General Counsel, or appropriate staff may disclose
member information to law enforcement personnel, if deemed appropriate, but
must advise the Executive Committee or Board of Directors prior to doing so.
Member contact information may be used by the AAN or its subsidiaries for
informational and commercial purposes. Members may opt out of receiving
commercial communications by informing the AAN.
Member Demographic Information
All de-identified demographic information collected through survey responses,
seminar attendance, product purchases, or other collection methods may be
disclosed. Individual responses or personal information collected, such as
educational background or practice profile, may be used by the AAN and its
subsidiaries but may not be disclosed to outside entities except as allowed under
the AAN Mailing List Request procedure. Individual information may not be
disclosed to other members unless needed for AAN committee work.
Some survey responses will be maintained only in the aggregate. The response
privacy level will be noted on the survey response form and the Academy will
abide by that privacy statement.
Membership Directory
AAN Membership Directories are distributed to AAN members as a reference
tool. The directory may not be re-sold, stored, reproduced, or in any other
manner provided to others or used for promotional purposes without the express
written permission of the AAN. Directories are available to non-members only for
uses approved by the Executive Director or designated staff but may not be used
for commercial purposes.
Mailing List Requests
Member mailing lists may be provided for approved mailings determined to be of
interest to the membership. The request for a mailing list may be granted at the
discretion of designated AAN staff but only names and postal mailing addresses
may be provided. The mailing piece will be reviewed prior to granting the list.
Members may opt out of receiving non-AAN mailings.
The following member data may be used to create specialized mailing lists:
        a. Geographic location
        b. Practice status based on member type
        c. Subspecialty interest
        d. Section and special interest group affiliations
Non-member mailing lists will not be provided.
                                          2


Use of Member Information for Marketing
The AAN may use any member information to appropriately market products and
services to its membership and customers. The AAN may also disclose this
information to AAN subsidiaries, but the subsidiaries must abide by the American
Academy of Neurology Confidentiality Policy. The AAN will manage marketing
so as not to inundate members with marketing materials.
Disclosure of Member Information to Vendors
It is sometimes necessary for the AAN to partner with outside vendors to best
serve its membership. The AAN may disclose member information to certain
vendors in order to perform the assigned tasks, but the AAN will make every
effort to protect member information. The vendor may not use member
information for any other purpose than that approved by the AAN, and the use of
AAN data will be addressed in the vendor contract.
Web Site & PDA
The Academy may disclose member information in two formats on the web site
and PDA application.
     1. Find a Neurologist
This feature is designed to help patients locate a member in their geographic
location. Only member name and address will appear and only for those
members in the membership categories of Honorary, Fellow, Active, Associate,
Corresponding Fellow, and Corresponding Active. These categories are
considered practicing neurologists. Members in the categories of Senior, Junior,
Affiliate and Medical Student will not be listed in the Find a Neurologist section.
The AAN will only disclose additional contact information if authorized by the
member.
     2. Electronic Membership Directory
This feature is only available to members and provides name, address,
telephone number, fax number and email address. All members are listed unless
they opt out of the listing.
Data Security
The AAN will make reasonable efforts to ensure the security of member data.
This includes a disaster prevention and data recovery plan. The Membership
Directory and all mailing list rentals will include seeded names to ensure uses are
monitored. Data security measures will be audited every 3 years to ensure the
Academy meets security standards.
AAN, AEI and AAN Foundation Employees
A strict standard of confidentiality is necessary from AAN, AEI and AAN
Foundation Employees to protect the confidential and proprietary information of
the Academy, employees and members.                   Any unauthorized access to
confidential and/or proprietary information and/or its dissemination or use for
                                             3


non-work related purposes, purposefully or inadvertently, is prohibited. All
obligations related to confidential information are continuing and must be
adhered to, even after employment ends. Breaches of the duty of confidentiality
may be the subject of legal action. Access to confidential and database records
will be restricted based on job relatedness and a need to know.
Academy employee and organizational information should be held in the strictest
confidence. Academy information considered confidential includes, but is not
limited to, AAN financial data, annual meeting abstracts, press releases prior to
embargo dates, draft practice parameters, technology assessments, position
statements and other legal information. Employee information considered
confidential includes, but is not limited to, employees home addresses, telephone
numbers and information normally maintained in personnel files, including pay
information. All requests from external sources for references or information
related to employee status or work history should be referred to Human
Resources.
Employees who are unsure about the confidential nature of specific information
are required to ask their Supervisor for clarification. Violation of this policy is
considered a serious offense and will result in corrective action, up to or including
termination of employment.
Exceptions to the AAN Confidentiality Policy may be approved by the Executive
Committee or AAN Board of Directors. Interpretations of the policy may be made
by AAN staff, subject to appeal to the Executive Committee or Board of Directors.
Members are given the option to opt out of communications of a commercial
nature, communications from AAN subsidiaries, and from disclosure of contact
information to outside entities.
