<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
<p>The American Astronomical Society (AAS), established 1899, is the major organization of professional astronomers in North America. The basic objective of the AAS is to promote the advancement of astronomy and closely related branches of science. The membership (~6,500) also includes physicists, mathematicians, geologists, engineers and others whose research interests lie within the broad spectrum of subjects now comprising contemporary astronomy.</p>

<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>The American Astronomical Society (AAS) is committed to the value of privacy. As you use our web sites, you may be prompted to enter information when you:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Create a user name and password</li>
	<li>Use personalization features</li>
	<li>Purchase a product or service</li>
	<li>Sign up for a free product or service</li>
	<li>Participate in online forums or discussions</li>
	<li>Provide feedback</li>
</ul>

<p>The data collected online from an AAS user is voluntary, although
some services are only accessible by registering user details.
Information collected may include your name, e-mail address,
street address, job title, society membership, or other related
demographic information. Except as described in this Privacy
Policy, AAS will endeavor to keep your information confidential.
We focus on using the information as part of AAS's service to
you and its mission to advance and diffuse the knowledge of Astronomy
and its application to human welfare.</p>

<p>Notice to EU Users: The server for www.aas.org is located in
the United States. By entering information on this site, you
are consenting to the transfer of that information to the United
States. Your information will be handled in accordance with AAS's
Privacy Policy.</p>

<h2>How collected information is used</h2>
<p>The primary purpose of gathering information is to allow AAS
to link a name and contact information to a user ID or browsing
experience. Once you have provided appropriate information, you
will be enabled to use a variety of products or personalized
services, and to access online help or support. AAS has a policy
to use or sell its customer lists only for the delivery of information
deemed of potential relevance or interest to members of the Astronomical
community.</p>

<h2>How we work to keep information secure</h2>
<p>AAS takes precautions to protect your information. When you
submit sensitive information via the website, we make commercially
reasonable efforts to protect your information both online and
off-line. When our registration/order form asks for sensitive
information (such as a credit card number), we use dedicated
software designed to encrypt the information and protect it.
While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon
on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and
Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked,
or open, when you are just 'surfing'.</p>

<h2>Opt-out for European Union and other users</h2>
<p>In accordance with EU and other guidelines, you may decline
to provide the information requested by AAS. Please be advised,
however, that AAS may be unable to provide certain services unless
such information is provided for security and identification
purposes.</p>

<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive
that sometimes links to personally identifiable information about
the user. AAS uses session cookies which are designed not to
be permanent or persistent. The session cookie is designed so
that, once you close your browser, the cookie will simply terminate.
If you configure your browser to reject cookies, you may still
use some, but not all, portions of our site. For example, accessing
our online journals requires that your browser accept cookies.
We recommend closing browsers on publicly available machines
(such as those in libraries) after use.</p>

<h2>Disclosure of aggregated and other information</h2>
<p>We use IP addresses and other user information to analyze trends,
administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad
demographic information for aggregate use. We may share aggregated
(i.e., non-individual) demographic information with our partners
and advertisers. We use one or more outside credit card processing
companies to bill users for goods and services and we will disclose
your personally identifiable information to these companies as
needed to process your orders and to respond to your requests.</p>

<h2>Links</h2>
<p>AAS sites contain links to other sites, and other sites have links 
to AAS. Please be aware that AAS is not responsible for the privacy 
practices (or other practices, goods, services, or content) of other 
sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and 
to read the privacy statements of each web site that collects personally 
identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely 
to information collected by AAS.</p>

<h2>Discussion forums</h2>
<p>Users who participate in AAS online forums or discussions may have 
their messages or postings edited for size and/or content. Submissions 
to such forums explicitly grant such editorial rights to AAS staff 
who reserve the right to remove inappropriate submissions. By participating 
in an online forum or discussion, you consent to our use or disclosure 
of any content you submit.</p>

<h2>Protection of Children's Personal Information</h2>
<p>AAS sites are general audience sites and do not knowingly collect any personal information from children.</p>

<h2>Notification of changes</h2>
<p>If we make material changes to our privacy policy, these changes will be posted to our privacy policy page. You should review this page regularly for updates.</p>
