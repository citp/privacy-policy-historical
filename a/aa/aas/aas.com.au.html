                <p>This privacy statement provides a succinct overview of how the companies of the Link Group deal with the personal information of individuals.</p>
                <p>The Link Group's complete Privacy Policy can be accessed by calling +61 1800 502 355 (free call within Australia), 9am-5pm (Sydney time), Monday to Friday (excluding public holidays) and requesting a copy. This Privacy Statement takes into account changes made by the Privacy Amendment (Enhancing Privacy Protection) Act 2012 and was last updated in February 2016.</p>


                <h3>Personal Information Handling Practices</h3>
                <p><b>Pseudonymity and Anonymity</b></p>
                <p>When contacting a company of the Link Group, you generally have the right to remain anonymous (nameless) or to use a pseudonym (fictitious name) to protect your identity. However, if you wish to make enquiries about a specific account, we may need to identify you first, before we can lawfully disclose personal information.</p>

                <p><b>Collection of Information</b></p>
                <p>The Link Group often acts as collection agent for our Clients, and we only collect personal information that is reasonably necessary for, or directly related to, one or more of our functions or activities; or because it is required under relevant law or regulation.</p>
                <p>We may sometimes collect sensitive information such as health and medical information, but only when it is necessary to provide you with a service or benefit.</p>
                <p>We normally collect personal information directly from the individual or their authorised representative(s). Sometimes, we collect personal information (including sensitive information) from a third party, a publicly available source or by other lawful means, but only if:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>We have consent from the individual, or the individual would reasonably expect us to collect their personal information; or</li>
                    <li>If it is necessary for a specific purpose such as executing a function or activity in connection with your account; or</li>
                    <li>Where we are permitted, or required to, by lawful authority.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><b>Dealing with Unsolicited Information</b></p>
                <p>
                    The Link Group sometimes receives unsolicited information from individuals or other sources. If we determine that we could not have collected the information for one or more of our functions or activities, we will take reasonably practicable steps to de-identify or destroy the information. Alternatively, we will take reasonable steps to protect the information from misuse or unauthorised disclosure. Disclosure of unsolicited information we hold may be made where required or permitted by law.
                </p>


                <p><b>Notification of Collection</b></p>
                <p>The Link Group often acts as collection agent for our Clients. All reasonable and practicable steps are taken to notify you of certain matters, or to ensure that you are aware of certain matters, at or before the time of collection, or as soon as practicable afterwards.</p>
                <p>Where a form is used to collect personal information, it will generally contain a collection notice (or reference to where a collection notice can be obtained) and individuals may be asked to confirm they have reviewed that notice. Similarly, if you contact a company within the Link Group, individuals may hear a recorded privacy script at the commencement of the call.</p>

                <p><b>Use and Disclosure</b></p>

                <p>We only use or disclose personal information where it is reasonably necessary for, or directly related to, one or more of our functions or activities; or because it is required under relevant law or regulation.</p>

                <p>We do not sell personal information, and we do not give personal information to other organisations unless one or more of the following situations applies:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>We have consent from the individual;</li>
                    <li>The individual would reasonably expect, or has been advised that personal information may be used or disclosed;</li>
                    <li>If the use or disclosure is required by lawful authority; or</li>
