			<h1>AAMC Privacy Statement</h1>
			<p>The AAMC takes extensive measures to ensure the safety and security 
              of its Web site. Portions of our site use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) 
              to encrypt sensitive data.</p>
			<p>Please be assured that the AAMC does not provide or release names 
			  or e-mail addresses of Web site visitors to any third party without 
			  permission. The following principles reflect our commitment to maintain 
			  the confidentiality of personal information and to provide you with 
			  the best possible service. </p>
			<h2>Privacy Principles </h2>
			<h3>Your Personal Information</h3>
			<p>We collect, retain, and use information about individual customers 
			  only where we reasonably believe it would be useful (and allowed 
			  by law) in providing you with products, services, and other opportunities. 
			  We protect your information against unauthorized access or release. 
			  We will not sell or rent e-mail addresses to third parties without 
			  your consent. E-mail addresses, aggregate information about which 
			  pages visitors access, and information volunteered by site visitors 
			  (such as survey information and/or site registrations) are used 
			  to improve the content of the AAMC Web site and are not shared with 
			  other organizations for commercial purposes. We do, however, reserve 
			  the right to use the information to selectively notify visitors 
			  about updates, products, services, activities, or upcoming events. 
			</p>
			<p>A "cookie" is a very small text file that a Web site can send to 
			  your browser, and store on a your hard disk. Some portions of our 
			  site use cookies to improve your experience. For example, cookies 
			  allow you to shop at the Publications site and browse to other areas 
			  without losing the contents of your shopping cart. We also use cookies 
			  to help us learn more about site traffic patterns. You can set your 
			  browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the 
			  chance to decide whether or not to accept it.</p>
			<h3>Editorial and Publishing Direction</h3>
			<p>Editorial and publishing staff use visitor data to help shape and 
			  direct the creation and maintenance of content. </p>
			<h3>E-mail</h3>
			<p>Messages that you send to us by e-mail may not be secure. We recommend 
              that you do not send any confidential information to us by e-mail. 
              If you choose to send any confidential information to us via e-mail, 
              you accept the risk that a third party may intercept this information. 
              We strive to respond to all e-mail requests in a timely manner. 
            </p>
			<h3>Other Sites</h3>
			<p>The AAMC Web site contains links to other sites on the Internet. 
			  These links are provided for your convenience and do not constitute 
			  the AAMC's approval or endorsement of linked sites or their products 
			  or advertisements. </p>
			<h3>Limitation of Liability</h3>
			<p>Neither the AAMC nor any of its subsidiaries or affiliate entities, 
			  agents, employees, or subcontractors shall be liable for any direct, 
			  indirect, special, incidental, consequential, punitive, or exemplary 
			  damages, including lost profits (even if we are advised of the possibility) 
			  arising in any way from the information contained in this Web site 
			  or any information transmitted via this Web site. The AAMC is not 
			  liable for any damages or losses that may be caused to any equipment 
			  and other software due to any viruses, defects or malfunctions in 
			  connection with access or use of this Web site. </p>

			  information by the AAMC detailed in these privacy principles. If 
			  we ever change our privacy policy, we will post any changes on this 
			  page so that you are always aware of the information that we collect 
			  and how we use it. </p>
