# AA Traveller Privacy policy | AA New Zealand

## Collection of information

We may collect personal information from you in a number of ways. This includes when you:

  * agree to take a service from us. This may include your contact details, date of birth, payment method and possibly bank details
  * contact us with an enquiry, or in response to a communication from us, in which case this may tell us something about your preferences.



## Use of information

### What we will do

We may use personal information about you for a number of purposes, including:

  * Assisting to identify you when you telephone us to make an enquiry. We may ask you for your date of birth or telephone number so that we can avoid disclosing information to a person who is not authorised by you to receive it
  * Responses to enquiries from you
  * Administration and contact about improved administration of any accounts, services and products provided by us previously, now or in the future
  * Preventing or detect fraud or loss where we are able
  * Contacting you by any means (including mail, email, telephone or text messages) about other services or products, where we think you would appreciate receiving an offer from us
  * Carrying out marketing analysis and profiling and creating statistical and testing information



It is our practice to search the Marketing Association Do Not Call and Do Not Mail registers before sending any direct marketing material. If you have registered your details through these channels, you will not receive any direct marketing material from us through the specified mediums.

In some circumstances, we may do certain credit checks with licensed credit reference agencies when you apply to take a service or product. If this is applicable, then it will be stated in the terms and conditions applying to that particular service or product.

When you first provide personal information to us, we will normally give you the opportunity to indicate whether you would prefer us not to contact you in this way. However, you can send us an email at any time to change your preferences or use the unsubscribe links at the bottom of any of our direct marketing email communications.

We may monitor and record communications we receive. This may be done for:

  * identifying improvements to the service which we provide
  * ensuring compliance with our practices and procedures
  * situations where, for example, a contract is entered into by that means, to provide evidence of the transaction.



### What we won't do

We will not:

  * Send you communications that are not provided for under this policy
  * Disclose your personal information (unless authorised to do so) except as mentioned below
  * Sell/rent contact information lists to parties who are not part of our business



## Use of information

We may disclose information we hold about you to third parties where AA has contracted those third parties for the purpose of:

  * providing services you have requested;
  * as part of the process of sale of one or more of our businesses;
  * where legitimately requested for legal or regulatory purposes;
  * as part of legal proceedings; or
  * prospective legal proceedings.



We, and other third-party credit organisations, may also access information about you to:

  * Help make decisions on credit, or credit related and insurance proposals and claims for you and other members of your household; and
  * Check your identity to prevent money laundering unless other satisfactory proof of identity is provided.



## Protection of information

We maintain strict security measures in order to protect your personal information. The procedures to protect your privacy include checking your identity when you telephone us, using secure passwords for our computer systems, and encrypting data on our website.

When you provide personal information online it is protected by encryption, so it cannot be read as it is transmitted over the internet between your browser and our server. Our site is secured via an SSL certificate with a 2048 bit RSA key with a SHA256 signed signature.

## Access to personal information

The Privacy Act 1993 gives you the right to access and correct personal information held by us. Your information is held securely and will not be disclosed to any other person or organisation unless authorised by you. To query or access any personal information we hold, email us at [[email protected]](https://www.aa.co.nz/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#deaeacb7a8bfbda7b1b8b8b7bdbbac9ebfbff0bdb1f0b0a4)

When AA Members or non-Members contact us to make changes we will need to verify that you are the person authorised to obtain and update personal information. We will therefore ask you for identifying details such as your Membership number (the 16-digit number found on your AA Membership card) if appropriate, surname and date of birth.

If you are unable to satisfy the identification requirements, you will not be able to access or change the information
