# AAT privacy policy | AAT

AAT carries a firm commitment to the privacy of your personal data.

This privacy policy describes the information we collect through this website ([http://aat.org.uk](http://aat.org.uk/)), and:

  * what we do with it
  * who we share parts of it with
  * the information we collect and how we use it.



We believe it is essential to respect the privacy of all visitors and to make safe and ethical use of the information provided to the website. We aim to give you as much control as possible over the information you give us, and in all cases the disclosure of your personal details is voluntary.

Where we ask for information we do so in order to offer you better services, both on the website and in the rest of our operations.

If you believe that any information we hold about you is inaccurate, please notify us, and we will do our best to correct it as quickly as possible.

Some of the information you give will be held in databases: we will ensure that these are highly secure and can only be accessed by authorised people.

We may also ask you to complete surveys or questionnaires on the website from time to time. These will always be voluntary but we may use anonymised information gathered from surveys and questionnaires to:

  * personalise the website
  * target marketing to relevant users.



Any information from surveys and questionnaires will be completely anonymous and will not link back to you.

We will ask for your email address if you wish to receive:

  * update information
  * newsletters
  * occasional invitations to participate in e-surveys to help us enhance and improve our service.



You can change your email address or choose not to receive further information at any time.

###  Who will have access to the information

Any information you give will be available to AAT. If you choose to add your email address to your membership record, it will not be made available to any third party except select parties we commission to undertake research on our behalf.

Information you give in response to surveys and questionnaires on the website will be used in two ways:

  * by AAT itself to help determine policy and to help improve its services to members
  * by third parties that AAT may make the information available for market research - in this case, the information will be made available only in the form of anonymous qualitative and statistical reports.



We may follow up some survey responses by phone or email, but only where you have given your permission for us to do so as part of the initial research.

###  Technical information

Like most websites, our server gathers limited information about you during a session, including the IP address and domain name from which you are accessing the server and your browser configuration. This information is only used to help us improve the content, design and performance of the site, and is not linked to the identity of any individual user.

[Our site uses cookies.](https://web.archive.org/get-myaat/aat-cookie-policy) Cookies are small pieces of information that are transferred to and stored by your browser on your computer.

In no circumstances do we collect any data that is not directly related to the use of the website (for example, we do not record other sites that you have visited).

The log files or any information they contain about your use of the site will not be made available to any third parties other than as anonymous usage statistics.

Browser information is also collected with your name, email address and, if appropriate, membership number if you complete a 'contact us' feedback form.

###  Other websites

The website contains external links to other sites. The AAT is not responsible for the privacy policies, content or practices of these sites.

###  Data Protection Act
