# Aquasana Water Filters - Privacy Policy

Aquasana® Privacy Policy  
(last revised August 31, 2011) 

Aquasana, Inc. and its affiliates and subsidiaries (collectively, "Aquasana") are committed to the protection and appropriate use of the information you submit to us online. This Privacy Policy (the "Policy") describes how we collect, use and safeguard personal information obtained from individual consumers in the United States through this website (the "Site").

### What personal information do we collect?

Aquasana may collect personal information from visitors to this Site such as names, postal addresses, e-mail addresses, user ID, password and, if you make an online purchase, credit card information. 

Personal information is collected only for specific purposes and with the knowledge of the person providing the personal information. To access the Site you are not required to register or submit any personal information. The content of this Site is not directed to children and Aquasana does not knowingly collect personal information from persons under eighteen years of age. 

### Why do we collect this personal information?

Purposes for which Aquasana may collect personal information online include, but are not limited to:

> ### "Contact Us" features
> 
> Aquasana encourages visitors to the Site to contact us with questions and requests. Aquasana also offers e-mail news updates for visitors who expressly request that service. Personal information of persons using these features may be collected in order to facilitate our responses to those inquiries. 

> ### Product registration.
> 
> Purchasers of certain Aquasana products may want to register their purchases online so that they can take advantage of warranties, product updates and other benefits. Purchasers are asked to submit certain personal information such as names, postal addresses and e-mail addresses as part of the product registration process. 

> ### Water for Life® program registration.
> 
> Aquasana offers the Water for Life® replacement filter program which provides benefits to purchasers of Aquasana Drinking Water Filters and Shower Filters. The Water for Life program online registration process requests personal information concerning the individual who signs up. This information is necessary to fulfill the automatic shipping and billing benefits associated with the Water for Life program. 

### What other information do we collect?

We collect non-personally identifiable information, which does not personally identify you, in the following ways:

> ### Aggregated information.
> 
> We may aggregate personal information in a manner such that the information does not personally identify you or any other user of the Site, for example, by using personal information to calculate the percentage of our users who have a particular telephone area code or follow a particular path through the Site. Such aggregate information is considered non-personally identifiable information for purposes of this Policy. 

> ### "Clickstream" data
> 
> The Site automatically collects certain data concerning its interactions with visitors that facilitate Site operation, management and planning. Such data may include the IP address of your computer, the date and time of an online request, the type of browser and operating system used by your computer, the time required to download information you requested, and error codes generated while your browser is in contact with the Site. 

> ### Cookies and other technologies
> 
> Cookies are small text files, placed on the hard drive of a visitor's computer that facilitate the operation of the Site and visitors' use of the Site. As is standard practice on most corporate websites, the Site uses cookies and other technologies, such as pixel tags and web beacons, to help us understand which websites our visitors are coming from and what websites they go to when they leave our Site, which parts of the Site are the most popular, and how much time they spend on our Site. We also use cookies and other technologies to facilitate participation in our loyalty programs as well as to customize your experience and provide greater convenience each time you interact with us. You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. (Each browser is different, so click the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.) If you reject all cookies, you will not be able to use those enhanced services on the Site. 

> Some uses of cookies in connection with the Site may be under the control of third-party entities that Aquasana retains for the management of certain programs and fulfillment of specific visitor/consumer requests. Aquasana requests these entities to confine their use of cookies and similar technologies, but Aquasana cannot be responsible for third party uses of cookies. 

> The aggregate information, clickstream data, and cookies and other technologies are considered non-personally identifiable information for purposes of this Policy. 

### How do we use the personal information we collect?

Personal information provided by consumers and visitors to our Site is used to fulfill requests and transactions submitted through the Site. For example, if you choose to purchase a product or service through the Site, we may use your personal information to process your transaction and fulfill your order. If you contact us through the Site, we will use your personal information to respond to your queries and requests. If you register a product through the Site, we will use your personal information to fulfill your registration, and if you sign up for the Water for Life program, we will use your personal information to administer the program. 

From time to time, in our sole discretion, we may use your personal information to send to you important information regarding the Site, or changes to our terms, conditions, and policies. Because this information may be important to your use of the Site, we recommend you not opt-out of receiving such communications, but you can opt-out at [www.aquasana.com/unsubscribe.php](https://web.archive.org/unsubscribe.php). 

We may use your personal information to send you marketing-related e-mails from us, but we have never, and do not intend to ever, send you marketing messages from other companies. If you would prefer not to receive such marketing-related e-mails, please opt-out at [www.aquasana.com/unsubscribe.php](https://web.archive.org/unsubscribe.php). 

We may also use your personal information for our internal business purposes, such as for data analysis, for audits, to improve our website, to analyze usage patterns and to improve our services. 

### When Do We Disclose the Personal Information We Collect?

We may provide your personal information to our third party service providers to fulfill requests and transactions submitted through the Site. For example, Aquasana may use third party service providers to conduct consumer surveys. Aquasana may also share certain information with third party organizations for the purpose of processing your credit card transactions. Aquasana seeks to restrict third parties' use of such data to the purposes for which it has been provided and to ensure the third parties do not disclose that information to unauthorized parties. 

If you choose not to opt-out, Aquasana may from time to time send you marketing promotions with discount codes and/or a newsletter with information on upcoming sales, water quality, or news from the Water Filtration Industry, etc.

Aquasana will provide personal information to law enforcement authorities and other entities where Aquasana determines that such disclosure is required by subpoena, warrant, court order or other applicable law or process. Additionally, Aquasana may disclose personal information if we determine that such disclosure is required to enforce our Terms of Use, to protect our operations, to protect the rights, privacy, safety or property of Aquasana, you or others and to permit us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain. 

Although Aquasana seeks to require companies with which it does business, and to which personal information is provided, to protect such personal information, Aquasana cannot be responsible for third parties' violations of this Policy or of any other rights of visitors or consumers that use this Site. 

Aquasana may transfer personal information and other information, collected online from visitors and consumers, to a purchaser or successor entity in connection with the sale of Aquasana, a subsidiary or affiliate or line of business associated with Aquasana, or substantially all of the assets of Aquasana or one of its subsidiaries, affiliates or lines of business. 

### How do we use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect?

Because non-personally identifiable information does not personally identify you, we may use such information for any purpose. In addition, we reserve the right to share such non-personally identifiable information, which does not personally identify you, with third parties, for any purpose. For example, we may share non-personally identifiable information collected in connection with consumer surveys and other activities, with consumer research and marketing firms or U.S. Census Surveys. 

In some instances, we may combine non-personally identifiable information with personal information. If we do combine any non-personally identifiable information with personal information, the combined information will be treated by us as personal information hereunder as long as it is so combined. 

### Third party links

The Site may contain links to third party web sites. These linked sites are not under Aquasana's control and we are not responsible for the privacy practices or the contents of any such linked site, or any link contained in any linked site. We provide such links only as a convenience, and the inclusion of a link on the Site does not imply endorsement of the linked site by Aquasana. If you provide any personal information through any such third party web site, your transaction will occur on such third party's web site (not the Site) and the personal information you provide will be collected by, and controlled by the privacy policy of, that third party. We recommend that you familiarize yourself with the privacy policies and practices of any such third parties. PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS POLICY DOES NOT ADDRESS THE PRIVACY OR INFORMATION PRACTICES OF ANY THIRD PARTIES.

### Security

Aquasana takes measures designed to prevent unauthorized intrusion to the Site and the alteration, acquisition or misuse of personal information. Aquasana cautions consumers and visitors to this Site, however, that no network is entirely secure. Accordingly, Aquasana cannot be responsible for loss, corruption or unauthorized acquisition of personal information furnished to this Site and/or stored by us, or for any damages resulting from such loss, corruption or unauthorized acquisition.
