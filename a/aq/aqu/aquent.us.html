<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p><strong>Please read this Privacy Policy carefully.  When you submit your Personal Data to Aquent via and by using the Websites and Aquent services, you are giving your consent to the use of your Personal Data in the manner described in this Privacy Policy and to the transfer of Personal Data outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”) to a country or territory whose laws may not provide adequate levels of protection to Personal Data.</strong></p>

  <p>Aquent is committed to safeguarding the privacy of its employees, applicants, clients, and users of its website. Aquent adheres to the Safe Harbor Agreement concerning the transfer of Personal Data from the European Union (“EU”) to the United States of America. Accordingly, Aquent follows the Safe Harbor Principles published by the U.S. Department of Commerce (the “Principles”) with respect to all such data. This Policy outlines our general policy and practices for implementing the Principles. To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view Aquent’s certification, please visit <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/" target="_blank">http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/.</a></p>

<p>Aquent collects and uses Personal Data to provide services for its employees, applicants, clients and business partners.  This Privacy Policy is designed to set forth how Aquent will handle Personal Data that it collects in the normal course of business.  The Aquent Privacy Policy applies to:</p>
<ol>
<li>all individuals who provide Personal Data, such as clients, applicants, employees, business partners, registered users of the Aquent website and others;</li>
<li>all locations where Aquent operates, even where local regulations do not exist; and</li>
<li>all methods of contact, including in person, written, via the internet, direct mail, telephone or facsimile.</li>
</ol>

<h2>The Aquent Website</h2>

<p>The Aquent website acts as a venue for 1) individuals currently working with Aquent to interact with Aquent’s database and enter timecards, create and manage their Aquent profiles, check benefits information, view schedules and assignment information, and process other information; 2) Aquent to process orders, send newsletters, perform customer service, and qualify applicants for possible employment; 3) Aquent’s clients to search portfolios, run financial reports, and sign timecards; and, 4) members of the public to receive marketing information, submit inquiries, and generally learn about Aquent.</p>

<p>Aquent may provide links to the websites of a limited number of third parties. This Privacy Policy applies to the Aquent website, not to third party websites. Aquent is not responsible for the content, reliability, security, or privacy practices of these third party websites</p>


<h2>Principles</h2>

<h3>Notice</h3>

<p>In the course of conducting its business and to comply with government regulations, Aquent collects certain Personal Data.  Personal Data is information related to an identified or identifiable person.  Names, home addresses, email addresses, personnel file and benefits information are all examples of Personal Data. </p>

<h3>Use</h3>

<p>Aquent uses this information for the purpose of identifying individuals personally and communicating with them. In the case of Aquent Employees Aquent also uses the information for the purpose of complying with human resource requirements, complying with government regulations, and providing employee benefits.  Aquent may request employees, applicants, customers and registered users of the Aquent website to complete questionnaires or surveys regarding their experience with Aquent or their use of the website. Responses are used by Aquent solely to assist it in improving services or the navigation features and functionality of the website. Participation in such surveys is voluntary.</p> 


<h3>Cookies</h3>

<p>Certain additional information also is collected from users of this website in an aggregate form and used solely in connection with improving the performance and responsiveness of our services and website. This information includes a user's originating domain, time of visit, connection speed, domain names, and Internet service provider. This information is not personally identifiable information and Aquent makes no attempt to correlate such information to an individual user.</p>

<p>Cookies are used to collect these data. Cookies are small sets of bytes that we place on the device you use to access our websites and services. These cookies collect data to help us personalize, secure, and improve the performance of our websites and services. The cookies described as “strictly necessary” are essential in order to enable you to move around the website and use its features, such as accessing secure data. Without these cookies, services you have requested, such as language and filtering preferences, cannot be provided. Click <a href="/common/images/extra/cookieList.pdf" title="Aquent Cookie List">here</a> for more detail on the cookies that we use.</p>

<h3>Onward Transfer</h3>

<p>All information collected by Aquent is collected, stored, and processed in commercial data processing facilities at various locations around the world, including the United States, Ireland and Singapore.  This allows Aquent to provide applicants with access to opportunities around the globe, and to improve Aquent’s ability to withstand individual system failures.  Aquent may from time to time transfer Personal Data within and between its various worldwide locations in the normal course of business; therefore Personal Data may be transferred to any country in the world, subject to this Policy and applicable laws.</p>

<p>Aquent may disclose Personal Data as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Third Party Service Providers:  Aquent may from time to time, outsource some or all of the operations of our business to third-party service providers. Entities with which Aquent partners for special projects or initiatives are provided with the minimum amount of information needed for the purpose of accomplishing their tasks and we restrict how such service providers may access, use and disclose your data.</li>

<li>Agents:  Aquent works with other companies and individuals to perform functions on its behalf. Examples include processing compensation, providing employee benefits, and performing legal and other professional services. These agents have access to Personal Data needed to perform their functions, but they are contractually bound to restrict their use to the purposes for which they have been retained by Aquent.</li>

<li>Business Transfers: In the event that Aquent sells or buys any business or assets, Aquent may disclose Personal Data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets.</li>

<li>Legal Investigations and requests: Aquent may disclose Personal Data to law enforcement agencies or other governmental agencies when required to do so or when Aquent in good faith believes it is necessary in order to comply with legal obligations.</li>

<li>Protection of Aquent and others:  Aquent may release data when we believe release is appropriate to enforce or apply our policies and other agreements, or protect the rights, property or safety of Aquent, our employees, or others.  This does not include selling, renting, sharing or otherwise disclosing Personal Data for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Policy.</li>

<li>In disclosing Personal Data in any of the circumstances described above, Aquent may need to send Personal Data outside the European Economic Area to a country whose laws may not provide adequate levels of protection to Personal Data. <strong>By submitting Personal Data to Aquent via and by using the Websites and Aquent services, individuals submitting such data are giving consent to the use of their Personal Data in the manner described in this Privacy Policy and to the transfer of Personal Data outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”) to a country or territory whose laws may not provide adequate levels of protection to Personal Data.</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3>Choice</h3>

<p>When hiring employees Aquent must collect and transfer Personal Data in order to comply with statutes, rules and regulations pertaining to employment.  It is necessary for Aquent to collect, store and in some cases transfer personal data to third parties such as payroll service companies, health insurance organizations or government agencies as required by law. Any such transfers will be solely for the purposes of fulfilling Aquent’s obligations to its employees, such as payroll and insurance.   Concerned individuals may withhold consent to such transfers and will be informed of the impact such opt-out will have on their employment within Aquent (ex. inability to process benefits or payroll data in a timely or appropriate fashion).</p>

<p>Individuals may “opt out” of having their Personal Data used in Aquent promotions by emailing <a href="mailto:unsubscribe@aquent.com" title="unsubscribe@aquent.com">unsubscribe@aquent.com</a>.</p>

<h3>Data Integrity</h3>

<p>Individuals must immediately update their data when and if it changes so that Aquent can maintain accurate data about them.  Individuals may contact Aquent to update the content and accuracy of their information. Registered users of the Aquent website have access to their individual information and may update or correct it at any time.  Although individuals may change their data, Aquent may retain in backup or inactive files the uncorrected or outdated data. Such data may be retained for several reasons, including backups for disaster recovery planning, dispute resolution purposes, troubleshooting, and enforcement of agreements. Therefore, individuals should not expect that all of their historical data will be removed from our databases at the time they notify us of changes.   Aquent reserves the right to correct Personal Data to make it current and consistent with data directly provided by individuals -- for example, when they update their address on their resume but not elsewhere.</p>

<h3>Security</h3>

<p>Aquent takes reasonable security measures such as password protection, encryption, physical locks, etc. as it deems appropriate to protect the information it collects from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.  Employees authorized to access Personal Data of others are required to take the appropriate safe guards to protect the Personal Data.  Some information gathered on the Aquent website is encrypted and protected with secure socket layer (SSL) encryption. Where Aquent deems encryption unnecessary, website users are so informed.  Only the individual user and Aquent personnel (solely on a need-to-know basis) have access to such information. All information collected from website users by Aquent is stored on servers hosted in a physically secure environment. Questions about the security of the website should be directed to <a href="mailto:questions@aquent.com" title="questions@aquent.com">questions@aquent.com</a>. Notwithstanding the foregoing, users should keep in mind that the website and the Aquent services are run on software, hardware, and networks, any component of which may, from time to time, require maintenance or experience problems or breaches of security. Website users are required to keep their Aquent passwords confidential. Aquent is not responsible for misuse of passwords. Users should advise Aquent immediately if they believe their passwords have been compromised. </p>

<h3>Enforcement</h3>

<p>Aquent regularly reviews its compliance with this privacy policy and periodically verifies that the policy is accurate and comprehensive for the information intended to be covered. Aquent encourages interested individuals to raise any concerns using the contact information provided and Aquent will investigate and attempt to resolve any complaints and disputes regarding use and disclosure of Personal Data.  For complaints that cannot be resolved between Aquent and the complainant, Aquent has agreed to participate in the dispute resolution procedures of the panel established by the European data protection authorities to resolve disputes pursuant to the Safe Harbor Principles.</p>

<h3>Amendments</h3>

<p>This Privacy Policy may be amended from time to time consistent with the requirements of the Safe Harbor. Aquent will post any revised policy on this website. Aquent will not use Personal Data in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Policy under which your Personal Data is collected without your consent.</p>
