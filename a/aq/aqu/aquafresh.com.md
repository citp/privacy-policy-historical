### _GlaxoSmithKline Internet Privacy Statement_

GSK respects the privacy of visitors to our online sites. GSK will only collect personally identifiable information, such as your name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address, when it is voluntarily submitted to us at this website. This statement discloses the privacy practices of GSK. By using the GSK website, the user agrees, without limitation or qualification, to be bound by this Privacy Statement. This Privacy Statement may be updated from time to time so please check back periodically. GSK, your employer, healthcare plan or program sponsor and the companies affiliated with or hired by GSK or your employer, healthcare plan or program sponsor will use this information to comply with your requests for information, services and products; to contact you and to better serve you. We will refer to your information to better understand your needs and how we can improve our products and services. We will not sell or otherwise transfer the personally identifiable information you provide at this website to any third party except as set forth in this Privacy Statement.

This GSK website may also use information in aggregate form to track the total number of visitors to our site, the number of visitors to each page of our site, and the domain names of our visitors' Internet service providers. No personally identifiable information is available in this process. Some GSK websites use a technology called "cookies". A cookie is a token that a server gives to your browser when you access a website. Cookies are capable of storing many types of data. Cookies help provide additional functionality to the site or to help us analyze site usage more accurately. For instance, our server may set a cookie that keeps you from having to enter a password more than once during a visit to one of our sites. In all cases in which cookies are used, the cookie will not collect personally identifiable information except with notice to you.

This GSK website is not intended or designed to attract children under the age of 13. We do not collect personally identifiable information from any person we know to be under the age of 13 and instruct children under 13 not to send us any information.

This site is restricted to users from the United States and those not governed by Privacy Policies of European Union. Users from other countries are advised not to disclose personally identifiable information to GSK, because the protection of their information will be under US law and different from the law of their home country.

As a convenience to our visitors, GSK's sites may contain links to a number of sites that we believe may offer useful information. The privacy policies and procedures described here do not apply to those sites. We suggest contacting those sites directly for information on their data collection and distribution policies. Any changes to this GSK Internet Privacy Statement will be promptly communicated on this page.

If you use a GSK website, you have the following choices: 

  * You can always choose not to provide information, even though it might be needed to take advantage of GSK offers or website features.
  * You can add or update certain information that you send to us. When you update information, we usually keep a copy of the prior version for our records but such prior information will no longer be used.
  * You always have the right to (a) opt out of receiving communications from us; and (b) opt out of further disclosures of your personally identifiable information to third parties. To do so, please complete the Contact Us page on this website or call us toll free at (800) 245-1040 to opt out. Your request will be processd within 10 days.



_Access to Your Information_

In the event that GSK and some of our assets are sold or transferred or used as security, the information collected on our website may be transferred to third parties as part of that transaction. GSK may also provide information or provide access to information to any of our affiliated businesses or to our business partners.

GSK may use contact information provided by the user to reply to the user and send information to the user. GSK does not intend to reveal personally identifiable information to third parties except in the manner stated in the Privacy Statement. GSK will provide aggregated information received from users to third parties. GSK takes commercially reasonable precautions to prevent the aggregated information provided to third parties from including significant personally identifiable information.

If GSK is requested by law enforcement officials or judicial authorities to provide personally identifiable information on individual users, GSK may, without your consent, provide such information. In matters involving claims of personal or public safety, GSK may provide a user's personally identifiable information to appropriate authorities without your consent or court process.

_Will Your Information Be Secure?_

GSK recognizes that visitors to our websites are concerned about the security of their personally identifiable information, and we are committed to employing reasonable technology in order to protect the security of our website. However, even with the best technology, no website is 100% secure. We will take reasonable measures which we believe are appropriate to protect your personally identifiable information from loss, misuse, alteration or destruction.
