## Public Disclosure

In the State of California, laws exist to ensure that government is open and that the public has a right to access appropriate records and information possessed by government agencies. At the same time, there are exceptions to the public's right to access public records. These exceptions serve various needs including maintaining the privacy of individuals.

All information collected at this site becomes public record that may be subject to inspection and copying by the public, unless an exemption in law exists. SCAQMD’s Guidelines for Implementing the California Public Records Act (PDF) explain how records can be exempted. In the event of a conflict between this Privacy Statement and the Public Records Act, the Information Practices Act, or other law governing the disclosure of records, the Public Records Act, the Information Practices Act, or other applicable law will control.
