Children’s Privacy Policy

Artix Entertainment encourages parents and legal guardians to spend time online with their children. We urge parents and legal guardians to instruct their children to never give out their personal information online without permission. We also recognize a special need to protect personal information obtained from children. In compliance with Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ('COPPA'), we have adopted the following policies regarding children under the age of 13 ('Children'):

Types and Use of Information Collected from Children

Artix Entertainment does not collect or require the child to provide any personally identifiable information to create a Free Account if the child is known to Artix Entertainment to be under the age of 13.

Artix Entertainment requires an email address, as well as the parent’s correct billing address, to create a Subscriber Account. 

Your email address may be used:

  1. To send a confirmation notice to the parent of their child's character registration and password information.
  2. Upon the parent's request, to send the user password information when the child has lost or forgotten their password.
  3. In response to any questions, concerns or problems that a subscriber has requested from Artix Entertainment.
  4. To contact the parent concerning any problem with the child's account or conduct in the game.
  5. To send out a newsletter to the subscriber email account



We do not collect or store any additional personal information given by underage users contacting us with questions or issues, and will only use the information while/if it is necessary for us to respond. 

Parent or legal guardians will be required to submit additional reasonable information (such as their real full name or physical address) in order to upgrade their child’s account, as described above under Subscriber Accounts.

**Artix Entertainment does not share, sell, rent or trade, your child's personal information to any third parties for their promotional purposes.**

Parental Consent

Artix Entertainment will only request reasonable personal information in order to enable your child’s participation in regular online activities. 

Giving consent for Artix Entertainment to use your child’s personal information will not automatically grant consent for its disclosure to third parties. To request that we withhold your child’s personal information from third parties, please contact us using the information above.

Whenever Artix Entertainment is aware that a user is under the age of 13, we require that child to submit their parent's email address. We will then provide proper parental notice of the child's use of the site, including their username and password. 

For Subscriber Accounts, the receipt of payment is considered actual, verifiable consent by a parent or legal guardian to the child's use of our website and to any information that was divulged as reasonably necessary to process payments, verify, and maintain the account.
