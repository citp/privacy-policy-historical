##  Basis For Processing 

For ao.com to be allowed to process your personal data, we must have a legal basis for the processing. The data protection legislation sets out what these bases are. We have described below the different bases that we rely on and provided examples of the processing.

**Contractual**

There are some contractual reasons why we have to process your personal data. When you buy a product on our website, it creates a contract between us. We need to process the personal data that you provide in order to fulfil our part of the contract. If you do not provide your details we won’t be able to complete your order.

**Legal**

Sometimes we are required to process the personal data that we hold about you for legal reasons - for example, if you buy a product which is age restricted or if there is a product recall.

**Legitimate Interests**

We also rely on being able to process your personal data on the basis that it is in our legitimate interests. When we do this we will always consider your interests and balance any positive or negative impact relating to such processing and your legal rights relating to data protection. The legitimate interests of ao.com do not automatically override your interests.

If you do not want us to process any of the personal data we have listed as being processed for legitimate purposes, you have the right to object. For more information see the section below relating to **your rights**. Please note that if you object we may still continue to process your personal data in certain circumstances. Please also remember that if we can’t process your personal data for these purposes your customer experience may not be as enjoyable.

Our legitimate interests include:

  * analysing and understanding your customer journey and behaviour to improve efficiencies and interaction
  * sending you email or SMS marketing messages, if you have previously bought something from us
  * calling you to discuss your delivery and any other services that we would like to offer you
  * calling you to offer other means of obtaining products should you be rejected for finance by V12
  * promoting and advertising our products and services both on our website and elsewhere on the internet
  * analysing our website’s performance and solving any problems
  * staff training
  * personalisation of your shopping experience



**Consent**

In some cases, we will ask whether you would like us to process your personal data. For example, when an item is out of stock and you provide your telephone number for us to call to discuss available alternatives or notify you when the out of stock item becomes available. We also ask for your consent to processing if you enter into a competition.

We rely on consent for the purposes of undertaking the checks necessary before entering a rental agreement with you.

If you provide us with consent, you may withdraw it at any time by contacting us.

##  When We'll Contact You 

We may contact you by telephone shortly after your purchase to discuss your delivery and make sure that it all goes smoothly for you. We may also offer you other services which relate to the products that you have purchased. If you decide not to purchase a product protection plan on such call we may contact you around the expiry of the manufacturer’s guarantee to see whether this would then be of interest to you. If you do not wish to receive these calls, please contact us by phone, email or post.

We may also contact you when an item is out of stock and you have requested to discuss available alternatives or notify you when the out of stock item becomes available.

We like to be able to keep you up to date with news, offers and promotions, but you can opt out of receiving email and text messages from us at any time. To do this, you can click the unsubscribe box that appears on the order confirmation page when you place an order, click on the “unsubscribe” link on the bottom of any of our unsolicited marketing emails, or contact our contact centre. It may take a couple of days for all of our systems to update, so bear with us whilst we process your request. Please note, if you submit information but there is an error or delay in processing, we may use the details you've submitted to contact you to complete your order.

If you have asked us to notify you when an out of stock item becomes available, the email will not have an unsubscribe link in it as it is a single email notification. Unsubscribing from marketing will not affect your ability to receive an out of stock notification.

If you fail to make payments in line with the rental agreement, we may contact you via telephone, email and post to ensure the arrears are cleared.

Should you wish to review our products or services, we may contact you after leaving the review.

##  Information We'll Share 

We share your information in very limited circumstances set out below:

  * where we’re obliged to do so (for example a legal request);
  * when we need to work with a third party or core service provider, for example a delivery service, insight companies, marketing communications providers or IT service providers. Each provider is carefully selected, and we’d only pass on the information required for them to perform that service on our behalf; they cannot use your data for any other purpose e.g. their own marketing purposes;
  * with our group companies who may provide us with services;
  * information with V12 Finance for credit applications and fraud prevention purposes;
  * information with Equifax who will act as a credit reference agency (CRA);
  * information required for undertaking anti money laundering checks;

We sometimes share anonymised information and analytics with third parties but not in a way that they could identify you as an individual.

We use third party payment service providers which are integrated into our website. When you pay using one of these methods e.g. PayPal, you are redirected to the provider’s portal. Your use of these services are subject to the terms and conditions (and privacy policies) of the payment providers.

##  Transfers To Third Countries 

ao.com may transfer your personal data outside of the European Economic Area. This will only be as a result of our service providers being based outside of this area e.g. cloud hosting service providers such as Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure. We will always ensure that such providers are in a country that has been assessed to provide adequate protection to personal data by the European Commission, or if the service provider signs a contract with us which contains the relevant protections for you; for example, if a company is based in the United States of America and has signed up to the Privacy Shield we may also send personal data to them for the limited purposes referred to above.

##  How Long Do We Keep Your Information? 

We will only keep your personal data for as long as it remains necessary in line with the reason that we collected it from you and to meet any legal requirements (such as resolving a dispute). The time that the personal data is kept for is called the retention period. We retain your personal data relating to the purchase of your products for a period of 10 years after your purchase. This is in line with certain product liability provisions under the Consumer Protection Act 1987.

Should you choose to rent one of our products we would retain your data for 6 years following the termination of your rental agreement.

If you call or message our contact centre with an enquiry (but do not place an order) we will keep your personal data for one month.

If you ask us to notify you about an out of stock item, we will do so if it becomes available within one month of your request.

If you receive marketing emails and SMS from us and have not unsubscribed from these messages we will continue to process your personal data for this purpose for a maximum period of four years. You may ask us to stop processing for this purpose at any time.

If you are not an existing customer and you sign up to the “AO Fans” feature in the event that we do not decide to introduce this service then your data will be stored for a period of 6 months. 

##  Your Rights 

You have a set of legal rights in relation to your personal data. These rights are to ensure that you are in control of how your personal data is used by organisations. We have provided a summary of your rights below:

  * You have the right to know what personal data we store that relates to you (also known as a subject access request);
