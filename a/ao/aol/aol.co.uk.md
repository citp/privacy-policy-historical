AOL Privacy Policy

Please select the Privacy Policy appropriate to you from the table below. To return to [AOL UK, click here](http://www.aol.co.uk/)

##   
Privacy Policy for visitors to AOL.co.uk

AOL is strongly committed to protecting the privacy of users of its interactive products and services as well as to respecting the Data Protection Acts 1984 and 1998. Throughout the Net we want to contribute to providing a safe and secure environment for consumers, and in particular, to ensure that kids' information is protected. 

While this privacy policy applies to the AOL.co.uk site and all of the other Internet-accessible AOL-branded services, such as AOL Instant Messenger, we will refer here only to AOL.co.uk to make reading this policy easier. The AOL UK online proprietary service has a separate privacy policy for its members. You can view that privacy policy here. The purpose of this AOL.co.uk privacy policy is to inform you, as a welcome visitor to AOL.co.uk, what kinds of information we may gather about you when you visit AOL.co.uk, how we may use that information, whether we disclose it to anyone, and the choices you have regarding our use of, and your ability to correct, the information. Finally, please note that this policy applies only to AOL.co.uk and Web sites that carry the AOL.co.uk brand, and not to the Web sites of other companies or organisations to which we may link. We have clearly marked AOL.co.uk and these branded Web sites with our logo so you know where this policy applies. 

Personal data will be collected, processed and used by AOL (UK) Limited, its affiliates and licensors for the purpose of providing the AOL service and related services. AOL is global, and many of the computer systems that provide it are currently based in the United States. Thus, your personal data will be transferred to, processed and held in the United States and in other countries within the European Union. 

**Information About All AOL.co.uk Visitors**

In general, our service automatically gathers certain usage information like the numbers and frequency of visitors to AOL.co.uk and its areas. This information is very much like television ratings that tell the television networks how many people tuned in to a programme. We only use such data in aggregate form. This collective data helps us determine how much our customers use specific parts of our site, so we can improve our site to assure that it is as appealing as we can make it for as many of you as possible. For example, AOL.co.uk uses a technology nicknamed "cookies" that tells us how and when pages in our site are visited, and by how many people. AOL cookies do not collect personally identifiable information and we do not combine information collected through cookies with other personally identifiable information to tell us who you are or even what your screen name or e-mail address is. We also may provide statistical "ratings" information, but never information which could identify you personally, to our AOL.co.uk partners about how our members, collectively, use AOL.co.uk. We do this so they too can understand how much people use their areas and our site in order for them to provide you with the best possible Web experience as well. 

**Information About You**

Sometimes, we may specifically ask you for information about you when you sign up to use a service, like AOL Instant Messenger, or when you order a product. We will need certain information -- such as your name, Internet address or screen name, billing address, type of computer, credit card number -- in order to provide that service or product to you. We may also use that information to let you know of additional products and services about which you might be interested. You can easily choose not to receive such information if you don't want to by letting us know on the registration screen when you sign up for the product or service. We may ask you for information about your interests so that both you and we can take advantage of the interactivity of the online medium, but the provision of such information is always optional..

**Disclosure**

We do not use or disclose information about your individual visits to AOL.co.uk or information that you may give us, such as your name, address, email address or telephone number, to any outside companies. But as we mention above, we may share with our Web site partners aggregated statistical "ratings" information about the use of AOL.co.uk.

**Special Attention to Kids**

AOL takes special care to protect the safety and privacy of young people using our services. We do not specifically collect information about children and believe that children should get their parents' consent before giving out any personal information. We encourage you to participate in your child's online experience and to review our important safety tips before your child explores the Internet.. AOL also recommends that parents who are AOL members use AOL's Parental Controls or other Web filtering technology to supervise their kids' access to the Web. 

**AOL UK Privacy Policy Changes**

If we decide to change our privacy policy for AOL.co.uk, we will post those changes here so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information and whether we will disclose it to anyone.

## Privacy Policy for registered customers

We regard the privacy of the data we hold about our customers as one of our most important values. We want you to know how we protect your data and what choices you have about its use. We believe this privacy policy should give you confidence whenever you use AOL - 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days of the year. 

We have organised our policy into three parts: 

  1. We outline our Eight Principles of Privacy, our core commitment to protect your privacy. 
  2. We explain how we implement each principle. You can click on any principle to read the policy. 
  3. We provide Helpful Tips on how you can better protect your privacy in cyberspace. 



**AOL'S PRIVACY COMMITMENT: THE EIGHT PRINCIPLES OF PRIVACY**

We are committed to protecting your personal privacy. Our Eight Principles of Privacy summarise and clarify that commitment: how we safeguard your privacy, how we treat personal information, and what choices you have. We understand that for you to take full advantage of the benefits of this interactive medium, we must do everything we can to ensure that your privacy is secure. 

  1. We do not read your private online communications. 
  2. We do not use any information about where you personally go on aol.co.uk and we do not give it out to others. 
  3. We do not give out your telephone number or screen name unless you authorise us to do so. And we give you the opportunity to correct the personal information we hold about you at any time. 
  4. We may use information about the kinds of products you buy through aol.co.uk to make other marketing offers to you, unless you tell us not to. We do not give out this purchase data to others. 
  5. We give you choices about how AOL uses your personal information. 
  6. We take extra steps to protect the safety and privacy of children. 
  7. We use secure technology, privacy protection controls and restrictions on employee access in order to safeguard your personal information. 
  8. We will keep you informed, clearly and prominently, about what we do with your personal information, and we will advise you if we change our policy. 



** (1) We do not read your private online communications **

AOL honours the confidentiality of its members' private communications in private chat rooms, email (including downloads), and Instant Message™ conversations, as well as any profile data you may create, such as a stock portfolio. AOL does not read or disclose private communications without your consent to third parties except where we or an entity processing your data on our behalf is compelled to do so by law, or in response to a valid, legally compliant request by a competent authority, to protect the company's rights and property, or during emergencies when we believe physical safety is at risk. Of course, what you write or post in public or member chat rooms and message boards is available to the public. 

** (2) We do not use any information about where you personally go on aol.co.uk and we do not give it out to others. **

Our system automatically gathers information about the areas you visit on aol.co.uk. 

We do not use any of this navigational data about where you - as an individual member - go on the service. Nor do we share any of this data with outside companies. 

We do use navigational information in the aggregate to understand how our members as a group use aol.co.uk so that we can make AOL better. We may also share this statistical information with our partners or other outside companies, but in doing so, we don't disclose individual names or personal navigational information. 

We do not keep track of where you personally go on the World Wide Web. 

We may use cookies and other analogous technologies to improve your online experience. 

We may use these technologies to personalise and enhance your experience on our service, including to: 

  1. Maintain data that you voluntarily give us about your preferences, such as your personal interests. 
  2. Personalise features of aol.co.uk, like providing you with your local weather forecast or custom news bulletins. 
  3. Validate participation in select online activities, such as making sure that each person only votes in an online poll once. 
  4. Authenticate your access to your personal data for added security. 



AOL and its advertisers may use these technologies to determine on an anonymous basis which advertisements registered customers may have seen and how registered customers responded to them. For example, these cookies may be used to help ensure you don't see the same advertisement too many times, to show the next advertisement in a series, or to tell whether an anonymous registered customers responded to a particular ad. These cookies are not used to collect personally identifiable data unless you give us permission to do so. 

AOL and its advertisers may also use small pieces of code called "web beacons" or "clear gifs" to collect anonymous and aggregated advertising metrics, such as counting page views, promotion views, or advertising responses. These "web beacons" may be used to deliver cookies that conform to our anonymous cookie policy. AOL does not allow advertisers or their advertising networks to use these technologies on registered customers to compile profiles about the different Web sites that a particular member visits. 

**(3) We do not give out your telephone number or screen name unless you authorise us to do so. And we give you the opportunity to correct the personal information we hold about you at any time.**

When you register for a screen name you will provide us with personal information. Here is how we protect that information: 

  * AOL will not give out your telephone number or screen names (email addresses), except where needed to deliver a product or service you ordered. 
  * We will not give out information that would link your screen names with your actual name. 



We make lists of your contact information available to pre-screened companies who have product or service offers we think may be of interest to you. We also sometimes combine these lists with publicly available information or segment them based on other information, such as when you became a registered customer. These lists are never based on your online activities. 

You may choose to remove your name and address from the mailing lists we provide to other companies. For more information about your choices, please see Principle 5. 

We also collect and use other information you give us for internal purposes. For example, we may keep records in your account history of your complaints about other members' online behaviour, your contact with AOL Member Services and any reported violations of our Terms of Service that you may have committed. Finally, we may, if you have provided it to us, sometimes use information about your geographical location to provide localised service. For example, we may use your post code to make sure the weather information or TV listings you see are accurate for you. 

We have two exceptions to these policies: We will release specific information about your account only to comply with valid legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena or court order, or in special cases such as a physical threat to you or others. 

We provide you with the opportunity to update or correct the personal details that we hold about you. 

** (4) We may use information about the kinds of products or services you may buy from AOL to make other marketing offers to you, unless you tell us not to. We do not give out this purchase data to others **

**Your Purchases From AOL**

We will record information about any purchases which you may make from AOL or its affiliates on aol.co.uk. If you buy from us online, our system automatically gathers purchase data, and we also record information about purchases that may be made through our telemarketing, mail order and other marketing operations. 

We may use this information in the following ways: 

  1. We review what kinds of products and services appeal most to our registered customers as a group. This statistical information helps us improve our offerings in the same way that other companies change their catalogue based on what sells best. 
  2. We use information such as the number of purchases members make and the categories of goods and services they buy to make offers to you that we believe will interest you. In addition, we use other information such as when you registered for a screen name and how often you use aol.co.uk. We also use publicly available consumer data to help us decide which marketing offers to make and which advertising they see. 



You may choose not to receive marketing offers from AOL. For more information about your choices, please see Principle 5. 

We do not give out any information about what you, as an individual, may purchase from AOL, except to complete your transactions, or otherwise as set out in this privacy policy. We share with outside companies only statistical information about what AOL products or services our members - as a group - buy. 

**Your Other Online Purchases through aol.co.uk**

For all other online purchases, be sure to review the merchants' privacy policies and contact them directly if you have any questions. They may have privacy terms that differ from AOL's privacy policy, and they may use personal information which you may provide them differently than our policy permits. 

AOL may be involved in facilitating your purchases from these other companies, but this individual data is not used for any other purpose. 

** (5) We give you choices about how AOL uses your personal information **

You have choices about how the information you have provided may be used by us to make special offers to you. And you can direct us to remove your contact details such as your name and address from mailing lists we provide to selected, pre-screened companies. 

  * You may choose not to receive marketing offers from third parties about their products and services by post. 
  * You may choose not to receive marketing offers from AOL by post. 
  * You may choose not to receive marketing offers from AOL by telephone. 
  * You may choose not to receive marketing offers from AOL by email. 
  * You may choose not to receive marketing offers from AOL through online "pop-up screens." 



** (6) We take extra steps to protect the safety and privacy of children **

We recognise that particular concerns exist concerning children and young people and believe it is important to support discussion between children and their parents as to their safety and the content they may access online.  We have special privacy policies to protect children and teens using content on aol.co.uk which is specifically designed for them.  We also provide our access customers with specific additional technical and educational products, content and services to ensure that they have the ability to restrict their children's access and we urge parents to teach their children about protecting their personal information while online. 

In areas designed for children, AOL and its partners will not collect names, addresses, telephone numbers or other personally identifiable information without disclosing how that information will be used and notifying children that they should obtain permission from their parents before providing any information. 

You can learn more about how to ensure a safe and enjoyable online experience for you and your family by visiting our Safety and Security area. 

** (7) We use secure technology, privacy protection controls and restrictions on employee access in order to safeguard your personal information **

We use state-of-the-art technology to keep your personal information - including your billing and account information - as secure as possible. We also have put in place privacy protection control systems designed to ensure that your personal data remain safe and private 

Each and every AOL employee must abide by AOL's privacy policy. Only authorised AOL Group employees are permitted to have access to your personal information and such access is limited by need. For example, if you call our Member Services department with a concern or complaint, the representative is allowed to access only the personal information that he or she needs to address your concern. In addition, any company with which AOL contracts to be our agent in conducting our business is required to adhere to confidentiality agreements to ensure that your information remains safe and secure. 

All AOL employees are required to acknowledge that they understand and will comply with this privacy policy. Employees who violate our privacy policies are subject to disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal. 

We strongly encourage our content, commerce and advertising partners to clearly post their own privacy policies and to have privacy control systems in place to protect your personal information. Be sure to review their privacy policies and contact them directly if you have any questions. 

** (8) We will keep you informed, clearly and prominently, about what we do with your personal information, and we may advise you if we change our policy **

A key part of AOL's commitment to protecting your privacy is explaining to you how we may use your personal information. This privacy policy serves that purpose, and it is accessible through the Privacy Policy link on the footer of aol.co.uk. 

Whenever we materially change our policy, we may give you 30 days' notice of those changes by email. However, you are responsible for regularly reviewing this policy. Your ongoing use of aol.co.uk after any new changes take effect signifies your agreement to the revised privacy policy. 

Business transfers. The online world and our business continue to evolve, and we may purchase or sell business units, take over other companies, (or we may ourselves be taken over) or carry out corporate reorganisations. In such transactions, customer information may form one of the transferred business assets. Any entity receiving such personal data will remain bound to this privacy policy. 

This privacy policy should be should be read subject to the following: We may disclose data about your account if we or an entity processing your data on our behalf is compelled to do so by law or in response to a valid, legally compliant request by a competent authority, or with your consent.

We may also share this statistical information with our partners or other outside companies, but in doing so, we don't disclose individual names or personal navigational information. 

We do not keep track of where you personally go on the World Wide Web.

We may use cookies and other analogous technologies to improve your online experience. You may control your preferences, and find out more detailed information in relation to these technologies at Keyword: Cookies. 

We may use these technologies to personalise and enhance your experience on our service, including to:

  1. Maintain data that you voluntarily give us about your preferences, such as your personal interests.
  2. Personalise features of the AOL service, like providing you with your local weather forecast or custom news bulletins.
  3. Validate participation in select online activities, such as making sure that each person only votes in an online poll once.

AOL does not allow advertisers or their advertising networks to use these technologies on AOL to compile profiles about the different Web sites that a particular member visits. 

The Web sites you visit, including those of AOL's advertisers and partners, should have their own privacy policies. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of Web sites before providing them with any of your personal data.

**(3) We do not give out your telephone number, Billing Account information or screen names, unless you authorise us to do so. And we give you the opportunity to correct your personal contact and billing information at any time** **.**

When you join AOL, we ask you for your name, address, telephone number, and Billing Account information- including the credit card, bank account, or debit card used to pay for your account - and the various screen names you want to use on your account. Here is how we protect that information:

  *   AOL will not give out your telephone number or screen names (email addresses), except where needed to deliver a product or service you ordered. 
  *   We will not give out your Billing Account information unless you authorise it, for example, during an online purchase.
  *   We will not give out information that would link your screen names with your actual name. 



We make lists of members' contact information available to pre-screened companies who have product or service offers we think may be of interest to you. We also sometimes combine these lists with publicly available information or segment them based on other information, such as when a member joined AOL or a member's computer system type. These lists are never based on a member's online activities. 

You may choose to remove your name and address from the mailing lists we provide to other companies. For more information about your choices, please see Principle 5\. 

We also collect and use other information for internal purposes. For example, we keep records in your account history of your complaints about other members' online behaviour, your contact with AOL Member Services and any reported violations of our Conditions of Service (COS) that you or someone on your account may have committed. AOL automatically queries your computer for information about your computer system such as the speed of your modem, error messages you may have received, or whether you use a particular type of software or hardware to access AOL - to help us fit the service to your individual needs and to help us diagnose problems you may be having with your system. Finally, we sometimes use information about your geographical location to provide localised service. For example, we may use your post code to make sure the weather information or TV listings you see are accurate for you.

We have two exceptions to these policies: We will release specific information about your account only to comply with valid legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena or court order, or in special cases such as a physical threat to you or others. 

We provide you with the opportunity to update or correct your contact and billing information that we have on file. Just as you want to make sure that information AOL has about you is accurate, we want to keep only the most up-to-date information about your account. Therefore, whenever you believe that your contact or billing information needs updating, you can go to AOL **Keyword** : Billing and make the necessary changes.

**(4) We may use information about the kinds of products or services you buy from AOL to make other marketing offers to you, unless you tell us not to. We do not give out this purchase data to others.**

**Your Purchases From AOL**

AOL offers our members the opportunity to buy AOL shop direct merchandise, such as computer hardware and software, and other products or services that may carry the AOL brand. Like other retailers and direct marketers, we record information about such purchases. When you buy from us online, our system automatically gathers purchase data, and we also record information about purchases made through our telemarketing, mail order and other marketing operations.

We may use this information in the following ways:

  1. We review what kinds of products and services appeal most to our members as a group. This statistical information helps us improve our offerings in the same way that other companies change their catalog based on what sells best.
  2. We use information such as the number of purchases members make and the categories of goods and services they buy to make offers to you that we believe will interest you. In addition, we use other information such as when members joined AOL, how often they use the service or their type of computer system to make such offers. We also use publicly available consumer data to help us decide which marketing offers to make and which advertising they see.



You may choose not to receive marketing offers from AOL. For more information about your choices, please see Principle 5.

We do not give out any information about what you, as an individual, purchase from AOL, except to complete your transactions, or otherwise as set out in this privacy policy. We share with outside companies only statistical information about what AOL products or services our members - as a group - buy. 

**Your Other Online Purchases Through Our Service**

For all other online purchases, be sure to review the merchants' privacy policies and contact them directly if you have any questions. They may have privacy terms that differ from AOL's privacy policy, and they may use personal information which you may provide them differently than our policy permits.

AOL may be involved in facilitating your purchases from these other companies, but this individual data is not used for any other purpose.

**(5) We give you choices about how AOL uses your personal information**

You have choices about how the information you have provided may be used by us to make special offers to you. And you can direct us to remove your contact details such as your name and address from mailing lists we provide to selected, pre-screened companies. To activate any of these marketing preferences, go to Keyword: Marketing Preferences. 

  *   You may choose not to receive marketing offers from third parties about their products and services by post.
  *   You may choose not to receive marketing offers from AOL by post.
  *   You may choose not to receive marketing offers from AOL by telephone.
  *   You may choose not to receive marketing offers from AOL by email. 
  *   You may choose not to receive marketing offers from AOL through online "pop-up screens." 



**(6) We take extra steps to protect the safety and privacy of children**

Young people need special safeguards and privacy protection. We realise they may not understand all the provisions of our policy or be able to make thoughtful decisions about the choices available to adult members. So we have special privacy policies to protect kids and teens using areas on the service specifically designed for them, including our Kids Only Channel. And we urge all parents to teach their children about protecting their personal information while online. 

  *   In areas on the service designed for children 12 and under, AOL and its partners require prior parental consent (for example, by sending in a permission form by regular mail or by fax) before collecting or using names, addresses, telephone numbers or other information that identifies a child offline. In addition, prior to children using screen names on the AOL service, we require parental (master account) consent at the time the subaccount screen name is created. We do this so that parents are aware of and consent to how their children may use their screen names; for example, using the screen name to request an online newsletter, to post a message on a message board or to participate in a chat room. Please read our important note to parents to learn more about AOL's practices regarding children's online privacy.
  *   In areas designed for teens 13 through 15, AOL and its partners may not collect names, addresses, telephone numbers or other personally identifiable information without disclosing how that information will be used and notifying teens that they should obtain permission from their parents before providing any information. 
  *   Another way parents can control their child's experience online is AOL's Parental Controls (Keyword: Parental Controls). These simple, flexible tools allow parents to customise content and functionality to their child's maturity level. 



Since one master account may have up to seven screen names, we encourage all parents to use their master account to create separate screen names for each child. This allows the parent to customise AOL to their child's maturity level and content needs: Kids Only (recommended for children 12 and under); Young Teen (recommended for ages 13-15); or Mature Teen (recommended for ages 16-17).

  * Unsolicited email is a problem for everyone, but it is particularly a problem for children. This includes mail that could contain content you may not want your children to see, or mail that may ask for information you would not want your children to give out.



If you want to minimise the unsolicited email your children receive, you can use Mail Controls (Keyword: Mail Controls) to block all email from the Internet or to select the email addresses from which you wish to allow your children to receive email. Remember that screen names and information voluntarily given by children and teens in public chat rooms, email exchanges, message boards, the Member Directory, and other online communications are publicly available and may be used by other parties to generate unsolicited email. 

You can learn more about how to ensure a safe and enjoyable online experience for you and your family at Keyword: Safety. 

**(7) We use secure technology, privacy protection controls and restrictions on employee access in order to safeguard your personal information**

We use state-of-the-art technology to keep your personal information-including your billing and account information - as secure as possible. We also have put in place privacy protection control systems designed to ensure that your personal data remain safe and private 

Each and every AOL employee must abide by AOL's privacy policy. Only authorised AOL Group employees are permitted to have access to your personal information and such access is limited by need. For example, if you call our Member Services department with a concern or complaint, the representative is allowed to access only the personal information that he or she needs to address your concern. In addition, any company with which AOL contracts to be our agent in conducting our business is required to adhere to confidentiality agreements to ensure that your information remains safe and secure.

All AOL employees are required to acknowledge that they understand and will comply with this privacy policy. Employees who violate our privacy policies are subject to disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal. 

We strongly encourage our content, commerce and advertising partners to post clearly their own privacy policies and to have privacy control systems in place to protect your personal information. Be sure to review their privacy policies and contact them directly if you have any questions.

**(8) We will keep you informed, clearly and prominently, about what we do with your personal information, and we will advise you if we change our policy**

A key part of AOL's commitment to protecting your privacy is explaining to you how we may use your personal information. This privacy policy serves that purpose, and it is accessible through several means within our service. When you register for our service, you are presented with the main terms of our privacy policy and should familiarise yourself with this and all other AOL policies at that time. In addition, this policy is easily located in our Conditions of Service area Keyword: COS. 

Whenever we change our policy, we will give you 30 days' notice of those changes through prominent disclosures, including notification on our front screen. If policy changes are substantial, we will notify each of our members individually through pop-up screens or emails. Since pop-ups last only for a limited time, however, you should sign on to your account regularly for these and other important announcements.

Business transfers. The online world and our business continue to evolve, and we may purchase or sell business units, take over other companies, (or we may ourselves be taken over) or carry out corporate reorganisations.

**TEN TIPS TO HELP YOU PROTECT YOUR PRIVACY AND SECURITY ONLINE**

You can take the responsibility to protect your personal privacy online. Here is a checklist that will help safeguard your privacy and protect the integrity of your computer and AOL account. We urge you to print these tips and post them near your computer for you and your children.

  1. Never give your password to anyone online. Never give your billing information except to facilitate a purchase.
  2. Make your password at least 6 characters in length. Create a password that includes a combination of numbers and letters (such as sun8ray or bel3jar2 or 12hat93). Be sure to use different passwords for each screen name on your account.
  3. If you have fallen for an online scam and given out your password, change your password right away. Before you sign off, go to Keyword: Password and create a new password for your screen name. Also, change the passwords for any other screen names on your account.
  4. Setting up a Member Profile about yourself can be a good way of connecting with communities of AOL members. But be aware that Member Profiles are public. It's a good idea to avoid including information that could allow people to find you offline, such as your phone number or exact street address.
  5. Use AOL's Mail Controls™ feature at AOL Keyword: Mail Controls to control the email you and your children receive. You can block email from the Internet, entire domain names and specific email addresses. You can even block the exchange of attached files or pictures in email.
  6. Your computer can catch a virus by simply opening an email, so exercise caution if opening an email from someone you don't know and consider installing virus detecting software. If an email asks for a password or billing information, or contains a suspicious file attachment from someone you don't know, go to Keyword: Notify AOL to learn how to report it.
  7. Never download files unless you know what they are and who sent them to you. Computer viruses and destructive programs that could cause your computer to divulge personal information are often transferred in cleverly disguised files.
  8. When you leave the AOL environment to go on the Web, you may want to check the sites you visit to see if they have a privacy policy. Take special care to protect your personal information and your screen name, since the operators of Web sites are not bound by AOL's privacy policy.
  9. Explain to your children that some non-AOL contests could ask them for personal information, and make very clear what information they may or may not provide, under any circumstances.
  10. You can get instructions to report any violation by going to Keyword: Notify AOL.
