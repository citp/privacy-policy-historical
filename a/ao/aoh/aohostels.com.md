The access data are also temporarily stored in internal log files for the aforementioned purposes in order to create statistical data about the use of our website, to further develop our website regarding the usage habits of our visitors (for example, when the share of mobile devices being used to access the website increases) and to maintain our website in the general administrative sense. The legal basis is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b and f of the GDPR. The information stored in the log files does not allow any direct conclusion to your person – in particular, we only store the IP addresses in a shortened, anonymized form. The log files are stored for 30 days and will be archived after subsequent anonymization.

**3.2. Contact**

You have several different options for contacting us. These include our contact form, our WhatsApp chat and our hotline. In this context, we process data exclusively for the purpose of communicating with you. The legal basis is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b of the GDPR. The data we collect through the contact form will be automatically deleted after the complete processing of your request, unless we require your request to be able to fulfill our contractual or legal obligations (see the section “Storage duration”). Additionally, we evaluate guests’ opinions about our hostels and hotels in anonymized form and display these on our websites. When doing so, we collaborate with Customer Alliance, an independent rating service provider that operates intelligent feedback systems.

**3.3. Bookings**

During an order process, we collect necessary data for the execution of the contractual agreement (booking information):

  * first and last name,
  * e-mail address,
  * address,
  * information on whether guest is a minor,

Optional information necessary for booking additional services is possible (for example: breakfast, early arrival, late departure, parking, pets, public transport tickets, lunch offer). The legal basis for the aforementioned processing is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b of the GDPR.

As an alternative to entering your booking data with us, you can also register directly into our booking system through specific payment service providers.

Any information you provide the aforementioned service providers with will not be forwarded to us by them. The only information we receive is that the payment has been completed. In the case of payment by direct debit or credit card, you enter the required payment information (credit card details or bank details) directly on our website. We will in this case forward you to the following service payment provider:

  * Concardis GmbH, Helfmann-Park 7, 65760 Eschborn, Germany.



The processing of data by the aforementioned payment service providers is based on our legitimate interest, according to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b and f of the GDPR, in providing our guests with comfortable and secure payment with a service provider of their choice.

**3.5. Additional data collection on site**

Our hotels and hostels may collect additional information from you on site. This includes registration forms in which the personal details of our guests are collected. Here we, in particular, collect the date of arrival and expected departure, first and last names, date of birth, nationality, address, number of travelers and their nationality as well as the passport number or number of the passport equivalent for foreigners.

We are legally obligated to collect and temporarily store these data by the Federal Registration Act (Bundesmeldegesetz). The registration forms are generally stored for one year from the day of arrival and will be destroyed within three months of expiry of the retention period. Longer retention periods may however apply for forms that also serve to collect tourism and spa fees. In our accommodation establishments in Italy and the Czech Republic, we must also make copies of identity cards or passports. Data collected in Italy are stored for one year and in the Czech Republic for six years. We are obligated to this data collection on site by different regional laws and official requirements. The data processing is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c of the GDPR in conjunction with the respective statutory obligations (such as the Federal Registration Act).

**3.6. Login area for regular customers and cooperation partners**

You have the possibility to register for our login area so that you are able to enjoy the full functionality of our website. We have highlighted the data you are required to provide. Without these data, registration is not possible. Legal basis for processing is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b of the GDPR.

**3.7. Newsletter and advertising mailings**

You have the possibility to sign up for our newsletter, in which we regularly inform you about news regarding our offers and promotions. For signing up to our newsletter, we use the so-called double opt-in procedure, which means that we will only send you newsletters by e-mail after you, by clicking a link in our notification e-mail, have confirmed that you are the owner of the given e-mail address. If you confirm your e-mail address, we will save your e-mail address, the time of registration and the IP address used for registration until you unsubscribe from the newsletter. The sole purpose of storing this information is to provide you with the newsletter and to prove your registration. You have the possibility to unsubscribe from our newsletter at any time by sending an e-mail to unsubscribe@reply.aohostels.de or by clicking on this [Link](https://www.aohostels.com/de/newsletter/unsubscribe/). A corresponding unsubscribe link can also be found in every newsletter. The legal basis for the processing is your consent in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a of the GDPR.

In addition, we also send out advertising mailings in connection with our services to you. The legal basis for this data processing is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f of the GDPR, based on our interest in existing customer advertising.

For the dispatch of our newsletter and our advertising mailings, we work together with service providers to whom we, among other things, send your e-mail address and the circumstances of your newsletter registration in order to be able to send you the newsletter and advertising mailings (for example, MailChimp of The Rocket Science Group LLC, 675 Ponce de Leon Ave NE, Suite 5000, Atlanta, GA 30308 USA). Additionally, our newsletter and advertising mailings will to a small extent adapt to the individual needs of our customers. For this, we use the services of Emarsys eMarketing Systems AG, Märzstraße 1, 1150 Vienna, Austria. On the basis of the booking data collected from you, we adapt, for example, the language settings in our mailings or indicate bookable additional services. The disclosure of data to our service providers in connection with newsletter distribution and advertising mailings is based on our legitimate interest in advertising our services to our customers in an interest-based manner. In our newsletters, we use commercially common technologies that measure the interaction with the newsletters (for example, the opening of e-mails, clicked links). We use this data in pseudonymous form for the purpose of general statistical evaluations as well as for the optimization and further development of our content and customer communication. This is done with the help of small graphics that are embedded in the newsletter (so-called pixels). These data are collected exclusively in pseudonymous form and are also not linked with your other personal information. Legal basis for this is our aforementioned legitimate interest in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f of the GDPR. Through our newsletter, we aim to share content relevant to our customers and to better understand what readers are actually interested in. If you do not want to have your usage behavior analyzed, you can unsubscribe from the newsletter or deactivate graphics in your e-mail program. The data for the interaction with our newsletters are stored in pseudonymous form for 30 days and subsequently completely anonymized.

If you visit the Google Maps service on our website while logged in to your Google profile, Google may also link this event to your Google profile.

In the case of public posts on our social media presences, we decide whether and when to delete them in individual cases, taking your and our interests into account.

If the purpose is to use our customer service or to request services, the legal basis is Article 6 paragraph 1 letter b of the GDPR. Otherwise, the legal basis is Article 6 paragraph 1 letter f of the GDPR (weighing the interests based on our legitimate interest in processing your message). Insofar as you have consented to the processing of the above data, the legal basis is Article 6 paragraph 1 letter a of the GDPR.

**5\. Cooperation with cooperation partners**

Principally, we only process data that we receive directly from you. We, however, also work together with various cooperation partners that provide us with interested parties for our products. These include, in particular, travel agencies and tour operators as well as tourism offices. We will only process personal data that we receive legitimately (for example, on the basis of contracts or your consent) from our cooperation partners

**6\. Disclosure of data**

The data collected by us will only be passed on if:

  * you have given your explicit consent in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1. lit. a of the GDPR,
  * the disclosure in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f of the GDPR is necessary in order to assert, exercise or defend legal claims and there is no reason to assume that you have an overriding interest worthy of protection in not disclosing your data,

**8\. Data processing by app stores**

Before you can install our a&o app, you may need to conclude a user agreement with an app store operator (e.g. Google, Apple) to be able to access their portal (e.g. Google Play, App Store). The app store operator is the data controller which collects and processes data related to the use of the app store, including your user name, email address, and individual device identification number. We are not a party to the user agreement with the app store operator and have no influence on their data processing. To this extent, the privacy policy of the respective app store operator applies. 

**9\. Storage duration**

Principally, we only store personal information for as long as it is necessary to fulfill the contractual or statutory obligations for which we have collected the data. Thereafter, we immediately delete the information, unless we need the data for purposes of proof for civil law claims or due to statutory retention obligations.

For evidence purposes, we must keep contractual data for another three years starting from the end of the year in which the business relationship with you ends. Any claims become statute-barred after the legal limitation period, earliest at this point in time.

Even after this period, we still need to store some of your data for accounting purposes. We are required to do so by legal requirements on documentation that may arise from the German Commercial Code, the Fiscal Code, the Banking Act, the Money Laundering Act and the Securities Trading Act. The time periods specified there for retention of documents are two to ten years.

Furthermore, you have the right to request the deletion of your data. Should the deletion in exceptional cases not be possible due to other legal provisions, the data will be blocked so that they are only available for this legal purpose. Furthermore, you may also have the processing of your data restricted, for example, if you believe the data we have stored are incorrect.
