### Privacy Policy

Ego Cogito, S.L. ("Ego Cogito") owns and operates a number of different websites. Ego Cogito is firmly committed to protecting the privacy of its user community. This privacy policy sets out to detail the information which Ego Cogito may collect about visitors to its websites, explain how this information is used and describe the disclosure practices of Ego Cogito. Please note that this policy applies only to Ego Cogito websites, and not to websites of other companies or organizations to which we provide links, or other software which may be downloaded from Ego Cogito websites.

#### Anonymous user information.

Ego Cogito collects anonymous information each time you visit an Ego Cogito website for us to improve the overall quality of your online experience. We do not collect your IP address and you do not have to register with Ego Cogito before we can collect this anonymous information. Ego Cogito websites do not require you to share personally identifiable information, such as your name or email address, for you to use Ego Cogito websites. Ego Cogito websites allocate an anonymous identification number to your requests and link the following information to that number: the date and time at which you visited the Ego Cogito website, the search terms, and the links which you clicked through. 

#### Cookies Policy

A cookie is a file that is downloaded to a user's computer/smartphone/tablet upon accessing certain websites in order to store and retrieve information regarding the browsing habits found on said device.

Ego Cogito uses the following cookies on this website:

  * **cookies strictly necessary** for the provision of certain services specifically requested by the user: if these cookies are disabled, you may not properly receive our content and services; 
  * **analytical cookies** (used for monitoring and statistical analysis of the behavior of all users);
  * **advertising cookies** (for the management of advertising spaces based on criteria such as how often ads are displayed): if these cookies are disabled, the website may continue to operate notwithstanding the fact that the information collected by these cookies on the use of our website and the success of the ads shown thereon allows us to improve our services and obtain revenue so that we can offer a lot of content for free.



**Type of cookie: Strictly necessary cookies**

  * Information: Session, registration.

  * Purpose: Provision of information society services requested by the user and subject to the applicable terms and conditions




**Type of analytical cookie**

***Google Analytics: ***

  * Information: Device and resolution, operating system, browser, URL and pages visited, country, date and time of access, length of visit, language. At no time do we use the user's IP address or any other information which allows us to identify or profile the user.

  * Purpose: Google Analytics principally uses its own cookies to collect information about user interactions on the websites of customers of the service.

  * How to opt out: If you do not want website activity information to be made available for Google Analytics, please install the [Google Analytics opt-out add-on] (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google- analytics-opt-out/fllaojicojecljbmefodhfapmkghcbnh?hl=en). This add-on prevents the Google Analytics JavaScript code (ga.js, analytics.js and dc.js) that runs on websites from sharing information about the activity of the users who visit them.




**Type of advertising cookie**

**_Google:_**

  * Information: Google uses cookies to make advertising more attractive to users and more valuable to publishers and advertisers. Cookies are often used to select ads based on content that is relevant to a user, enhance the performance reports of the campaign and avoid showing ads that the user has already seen.

  * Purpose: Google uses cookies like NID and SID to customize the ads that are displayed on Google properties (e.g. Google Search). For example, it uses such cookies to remember your most recent searches, your previous interactions with an advertiser’s adverts or search results and your visits to an advertiser’s website. This helps it to show you customized adverts on Google.




It also uses one or more cookies for advertising that it serves across the web. One of the main advertising cookies on non-Google sites is named ‘IDE‘and is stored in browsers under the domain doubleclick.net. Another is stored in google.com and is called ANID. It uses other cookies with names such as DSID, FLC, AID, TAID and exchange_uid. Other Google properties, such as YouTube, may also use these cookies to show you more relevant adverts.

Sometimes, advertising cookies may be set on the domain of the site that you're visiting. In the case of advertising we serve across the web, cookies named ‘ **gads’ or ‘** gac’ may be set on the domain of the site that you're visiting. Unlike cookies that are set on Google's own domains, these cookies can't be read by Google when you're on a site other than the one on which they were set. Google cannot read this cookie when you're on another website. They serve purposes such as measuring interactions with the ads on that domain and preventing the same ads from being shown to you too many times.

Google also uses conversion cookies whose main purpose is to help advertisers determine how many times the people who click on their adverts end up purchasing their products. These cookies allow Google and the advertiser to determine that you clicked on the advert and later visited the advertiser site. Conversion cookies are not used by Google for personalized ad targeting and persist for a limited time only. A cookie named ‘Conversion’ is dedicated to this purpose. It's generally set in the googleadservices.com domain or the google.com domain (you can find a list of domains that we use for advertising cookies at the foot of this page). Some of its other cookies may be used to measure conversion events as well, such as DoubleClick or Google Analytics.

Google also uses cookies named 'AID', 'DSID' and 'TAID', which are used to link your activity across devices if you’ve previously signed in to your Google Account on another device. It does this to coordinate the ads you see across devices and to measure conversion events. These cookies may be set on the domains google.com/ads, google.com/ads/measurement or googleadservices.com.

  * How to opt out.
