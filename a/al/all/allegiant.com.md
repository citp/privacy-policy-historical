Allegiant Air is concerned about your right to privacy. When you visit the Allegiant Air website, you can be assured that any information you share with us will be treated confidentially.

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) requires you to provide your full name, date of birth, and gender for the purpose of watch list screening, under the authority of 49 U.S.C. section 114, the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 and 49 C.F.R parts 1540 and 1560. You may also provide your Redress Number or Known Traveler Number, if available. Failure to provide your full name, date of birth, and gender may result in denial of transport or denial of authority to enter the boarding area. TSA may share information you provide with law enforcement or intelligence agencies or others under its published system of records notice. For more on TSA privacy policies, or to review the system of records notice and the privacy policy impact assessment, please see the TSA website at [www.tsa.gov](https://www.tsa.gov/).

**Use of Cookies & How We Use Your Information**

A cookie is a small data file that websites often store on your computer's hard drive when you visit. Allegiant Air uses cookies, but we do not store personally identifiable information in your cookie.

We use cookies to monitor and maintain information about your use of our website in a manner that does not identify you. This information helps us to serve you better by improving our site design, as well as our products, services, contests, and promotions.

We allow certain third-party companies to serve ads and/or collect certain anonymous information when you visit our website. These companies may use information (not including your name, e-mail address, telephone number or any other personally identifiable information) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. Such third parties do not collect personally identifiable information.

In order to provide you with certain services, we may share relevant customer information (for example: name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, etc.) with our affiliates, as well as with unaffiliated third parties who perform services for Allegiant Air (e.g., rental car, lodging and travel accommodation companies, information systems maintenance and development providers, data archiving, customer communication, marketing and similar services). Please refer to the websites of such third parties and suppliers for their privacy policies and other information. Otherwise, the only instances that would require us to disclose customer information is to verify billing information with the customer's financial institution, to monitor for credit card fraud detection, under legal subpoena or other valid law enforcement requests

We use Transport Layer Security (TLS) 256 bit encryption to protect your personal information. This keeps the data that you send to Allegiant Air private and secure. This technology ensures the safety of transmitting personal information over the internet.
