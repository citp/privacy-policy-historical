# About - Privacy

## Privacy

This Privacy Policy sets out how Allianz* collects, stores, uses and discloses personal information.

Where required by law, we will provide you privacy information (in the form of a Privacy Notice or other privacy disclosure documentation) specific to the products or services you want to obtain from us or specific to your dealings with us.

## What is ʻpersonal informationʼ?

Personal information is information or an opinion about an identified individual, or an individual who is reasonably identifiable:

  * whether the information or opinion is true or not; and
  * whether the information or opinion is recorded in a material form or not.



## What kinds of personal information do we collect and hold?

The personal information collected and maintained by Allianz generally includes your name, date of birth, gender, address, contact details and information specific to the product or service you decide to purchase from us, such as details of any property being insured, or your dealings with the specific Allianz business.

For some policies, we also collect and maintain your sensitive information. This includes information about your health, genetics, membership of any trade unions or professional associations and any criminal convictions you may have.

For employment applications, we collect your name, address, contact details, current and past employment information, educational qualifications and professional associations. We also collect information about and proof of your residency status, the name and contact details of your referees and other information required for recruitment purposes. Where we seek your consent to conduct a background check, we also collect details of your proof of identity from you.

In the recruitment process, we may ask you to answer optional questions about your personal attributes such as age, gender, ethnic background and language spoken. This personal (including sensitive) information is collected only for the purpose of understanding the diversity profile of applicants and employees and for internal reporting purposes within Allianz Australia and the Allianz Group.

## How do we collect your personal information?

Where it is possible, we collect your personal information directly from you in person, in writing, over the telephone, by facsimile, through our online services (including our virtual online assistant and any online chat functions) and/or by electronic messages. In some circumstances, we may also collect it from:

  * your agents or representatives, for example your insurance broker, your legal advisers, your family member who applies for a policy that covers you or is instructed by you to deal with us;
  * third parties who you have asked to provide your personal information to us, including your referees and your insurer;
  * our agents and service providers;
  * other insurers and insurance reference bureaus;
  * people who are involved in a claim or assist us in assessing, investigating, processing or settling claims, including third parties claiming under your policy, witnesses, medical service providers, external claims data collectors and verifiers, and your employer;
  * third parties who may be arranging insurance cover for a group that you are a part of;
  * law enforcement, dispute resolution, statutory and regulatory bodies;
  * marketing organisations, including through the use of purchased lists;
  * industry databases;
  * publicly available sources such as the Internet and telephone directories; and/or
  * the general public when it is unsolicited and may be relevant to a particular policy or fraud investigation.



Unless we are required or permitted by law to collect sensitive information about you, we will only do so by obtaining your consent.

If you nominate individuals to be covered by your insurance policy, you should direct them to this Privacy Policy and make them aware of the content of any privacy notice we provide you.

If you decide to complete an online application form, the information that you enter into the online form will only be collected by us if you submit your online application. If at any stage you cancel your application prior to submitting your application, the information you have entered up to that point will be automatically deleted.
