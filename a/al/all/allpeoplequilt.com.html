            <p>Meredith cares about protecting the privacy of children. We won't knowingly 
              allow anyone under 13 to provide us any personally identifying information. 
              Children should always get permission from their parents before sending any 
              information about themselves (such as their names, email addresses, and phone 
              numbers) over the Internet, to us or to anyone else. We encourage you to become 
              involved in your children's online experience, and to share your interest in our 
              sites with your young ones. If you're under 13, please do not register with any 
              of our sites or provide us with any personally identifying information (such as 
              your name, your email address or your phone number). </p>

            <p>The information we gather on our sites falls into two categories: (1) 
              information you supply when you register or initiate transactions, and (2) 
              tracking information collected as you navigate through our sites. Third-party 
              providers featured on, or linked to from, our sites, such as vendors of products 
              and services offered through our sites, may gather information, as well.</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p><strong>Registration Information.</strong> To use certain features on our 
                sites, we ask you to register. When you register, we collect personally 
                identifying information about you, including your name, mailing address, email 
                address, user name and password. We may also ask for some additional 
                information, such as, hobbies, age, browser type, and the like, but you're free 
                to register without providing this information if you prefer. In addition, at 
                various other points on our sites, we may ask you for personally identifying 
                information, including when you: place an order for products, complete a survey, 
                or report a problem with one of our sites. We use this information to process 
                your orders, to tailor our sites to your interests and to make them more useful 
                to you, and to help improve our sites generally.</p>
              <p><strong>Contests and Other Promotions.</strong> From time to time, we may 
                offer contests or other promotions involving marketing or advertising partners. 
                If you choose to participate in one of these contests or promotions, you'll have 
                to provide some information about yourself (such as your name, address, and 
                email address). We may share this information with sponsors of the contest or 
                other promotional partners, but we will always identify the other parties 
                involved (for example, in the contest rules) and provide notice that your 
                registration may be disclosed to these parties. We don't control these third 
                parties' privacy practices, and our Privacy Policy does not apply to their 
                collection and use of your information. We urge you to review their privacy 
                policies and learn how they will use your information before participating. If 
                you don't want us to collect the information requested in connection with a 
                promotion, or to provide it to our co-sponsors or partners, please do not 
                participate in the promotion.</p>

                         <p><strong>Cookies.</strong> To help us serve your needs better, we use 
                           "cookies" to store and sometimes to track user information. A cookie is a small 
                           amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your 
                           computer's hard drive. A cookie contains a unique number that allows our sites 
                           to identify your computer. For example, cookies allow us to keep track of your 
                           user name and password (if you are a registered visitor) so you don't have to 
                           re-enter that information each time you visit one of our sites. We also use 
                           cookies to make sure you don't see the same ads repeatedly when you visit our 
                           sites. The help function on most browsers contains information on how to set 
                           your browser to notify you before accepting cookies or to disable cookies 
                           entirely. However, if you don't accept cookies, you may not be able to take 
                           advantage of various features on our sites that are available to other visitors. 
                           In addition, our advertising and marketing partners may use their own cookies. </p>
                         <p><strong>Third-Party Advertising Services.</strong> We use the services of 
                           DoubleClick, a third-party advertising and email delivery company to serve and 
                           target advertisements that you see on the pages of our sites, to serve and 
                           target promotions or other marketing messages, and to send e-mails from us. 
                           DoubleClick also collects "clickstream data," information about your visit to 
                           our sites and to third-party sites that can be aggregated and used to target 
                           advertising on this and other sites, and used for marketing research and other 
                           similar purposes. This clickstream data does not include personally identifying 
                           information such as your name, address, email address or telephone number. 
                           DoubleClick uses cookies for many of the same reasons we do, and collects 
                           information directly from our users. We share website usage information about 
                           visitors to our sites who have received a targeted promotional campaign with 
                           DoubleClick to facilitate targeting future campaigns and upgrading visitor 
                           information used in reporting statistics. For this purpose, we and DoubleClick 
                           note some of the pages you visit on our website through the use of pixel tags 
                           (also called "clear gifs" or "web beacons"). If you would like to know more 
                           about DoubleClick information gathering practices and "opt-out" procedures, 
                           please see the privacy statement on the <a href="http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy/default.asp?asp_object_1=&amp;" target="_blank">DoubleClick website</a>.</p>
                         <p><strong>Browser Level Information and IP Addresses.</strong> When you use our 
                           sites, we may also collect information about your access time and your computer 
                           configuration, including the type of browser software you use, the operating 
                           system that you're running, the resolution of your computer monitor and your 
                           Internet Protocol ("IP") address. Your IP address is a number that is used by 
                           computers connected to the Internet to identify your computer so that data (such 
                           as the web pages you request) can be sent to you. Your IP address does not tell 
                           us who you are. Like the IP address, none of the other information described in 
                           this paragraph identifies you personally. We collect this information for 
                           purposes of aggregated reporting on site activity that we, and our advertisers, 
                           may use. For example, we may want to know how long the average user spends on 
                           our site, which pages or features get the most attention, and the like. The 
                           aggregated information helps to understand our audience and confirm the value of 
                           advertising on our websites.</p>

              RIGHTS</span></h2>
            <p><strong>(As provided by California Civil Code Section 1798.83)</strong></p>
            <p>Under California Civil Code Section 1798.83 – also known as the “Shine the 
              Light” law – California residents have a right to request certain information 
              from each business they patronize regarding that business’s disclosures of 
              personal information to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing 
              purposes. Generally, if a business has disclosed personal information regarding 
              its California customers to third parties for direct marketing purposes in the 
              preceding calendar year, the business is required to provide, upon request and 
              free of charge, a list of the names and addresses of all such third parties, 
              together with a list of the categories of personal information that was 
              disclosed.</p>
            <p>The “Shine The Light” law creates an exception for businesses that adopt and 
              disclose to the public (in their privacy policies) a policy of not sharing 
              personal information for direct marketing purposes without offering their 
              customers choices to prevent such disclosures. These businesses are not 
              obligated to provide the lists described above and may respond to requests from 
              California customers by notifying them of their rights to prevent disclosures of 
              personal information for direct marketing purposes and providing a cost-free 
              means of exercising those rights. </p>
            <p>Meredith Corporation qualifies for this latter exception. As further 
              explained in our <a href="#Online_Privacy_Policy">Online 
                Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="https://secure.meredith.com/privacy/policy.html">Offline Privacy 
                  Policy</a>, we offer our customers choices to prevent the disclosure of their 
              personal information to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing 
              purposes. To prevent such disclosures of your information, please follow the 
              instructions in our “Shine The Light” Customer Notice, which is included below 
              for your convenience. You can also request a copy of this Notice by emailing us 
              at <a href="mailto:privacy@meredith.com">privacy@meredith.com</a>. Please note 
              that we are only required to respond to one request for per California customer 
              during the course of any calendar year and we reserve the right not to respond 
              to requests made by means other than through this email address.</p>
