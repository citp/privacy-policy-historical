### Definitions

#### Cookies

Data created by a web server that is stored on a user's computer. It provides a way for the website to keep track of a user's patterns and preferences and, with the cooperation of the web browser, to store them on the user's own hard disk. The cookies contain a range of URLs (web addresses) for which they are valid. When the browser encounters those URLs again, it sends those specific cookies to the web server. For example, if a user's ID were stored as a cookie, it would save that person from typing in the same information all over again when accessing that service for the second and subsequent times during the same browser session. You can opt out of the use of cookies by having your browser disable cookies or warn you before accepting a cookie. Look for the cookie options in your browser in the options or preferences menu. NOTE: If you disable cookies in your browser, you will not be able to access any secure areas of our website.

#### IP (Internet Protocol) Address

This is the address of a computer attached to a TCP/IP network. Every client and server station must have a unique IP address. Client workstations have either a permanent address or one that is dynamically assigned for each dial-up session. IP addresses are written as four sets of numbers separated by periods; for example, 204.171.64.2.

#### Browser Session

A browser session is defined as the period of time a browser is in consecutive use. The session begins when you open the browser and ends when you close it. When you reopen the browser, you begin a new session.

#### SSL Encryption (Secure Sockets Layer)

This is the leading security protocol on the Internet. When an SSL session is started, the browser sends its public key to the server so that the server can securely send a secret key to the browser. The browser and server exchange data via secret key encryption during that session.

#### URL (Uniform Resource Locator)

This is an Internet address. URLs are used to locate sites on the Internet and to navigate between sites and pages within sites. The URL for All Property Management is [http://www.AllPropertyManagement.com/](http://www.allpropertymanagement.com/).
