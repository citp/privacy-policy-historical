Allegiant Air is concerned about your right to privacy. When you visit the Allegiant Air website, you can be assured that any information you share with us will be treated confidentially. In order to provide you with certain services, we may share relevant Customer Information (for example: name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, etc.) with our contracted third-party partners, such as hotel and rental car suppliers, or online travel agents. Please refer to the websites of such third parties and suppliers for their Privacy Policies and other information. Otherwise, the only instances that would require us to disclose Customer Information is to verify billing information with the Customer's financial institution, to monitor for credit card fraud detection, under legal subpoena or other valid law enforcement requests.

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) requires you to provide your full name, date of birth, and gender for the purpose of watch list screening, under the authority of 49 U.S.C. section 114, the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 and 49 C.F.R parts 1540 and 1560. You may also provide your Redress Number or Known Traveler Number, if available. Failure to provide your full name, date of birth, and gender may result in denial of transport or denial of authority to enter the boarding area. TSA may share information you provide with law enforcement or intelligence agencies or others under its published system of records notice. For more on TSA privacy policies, or to review the system of records notice and the privacy policy impact assessment, please see the TSA website at [www.tsa.gov](http://www.tsa.gov/).
