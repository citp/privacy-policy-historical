This contact information is stored on our servers to provide schools with inquiry management features. It is also passed onto the schools you identify (sometimes through a vendor that is under contract to the school), so that they may contact you with more information. We may share this information with our email service provider who uses the data for the sole purpose of delivering a transaction confirmation to you. We will never share your email address with anyone other than the schools you request or our email service provider. Other Personally identifiable Contact Information may be shared as required to fulfill your information request or when a business partner provides a product or service that we feel may be of interest to you. Contact Information is aggregated to create reports on overall education industry trends, which may be sold to third parties. Please note that use of your Contact Information by a school or third party is governed by such school's or third party's privacy policy.</p><h2>  Email Newsletter</h2><p>  Visitors may subscribe to receive email newsletters from us.

By using our service to request information from schools, you are giving permission to schools (or their partners or vendors) to contact you using the method of their choice, to fulfill your information request, notwithstanding your possible listing in the National Do-Not-Call Registry.</p><h2>  Privacy Policy Changes</h2><p>  We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time.
