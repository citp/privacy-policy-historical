  1. All World does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or with nonaffiliated companies except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:


    1. When, in our sole judgment, we are obliged to respond to subpoenas, court orders, legal process or receive what we believe to be a legitimate law enforcement inquiry, 
    2. In order to establish or exercise our legal rights, or to defend against legal claims made against us by any person or entity;
    3. When, in our sole judgment, we believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of All World's Terms of Service, or as otherwise required by law.
    4. When a third party (including an automotive manufacturer) submits a written claim to us that your listing(s) violate their intellectual property or other rights under our Intellectual Property Notification Process or, in our sole discretion, otherwise demonstrates to our satisfaction that you or your listing violates their intellectual property rights.. 
    5. In the event All World is acquired by or merged with another company.

    **Cookies**

  1. All World may set and access All World cookies on your computer.
  2. All World lets other companies that show advertisements on some of our pages set and access their cookies on your computer. Other companies' use of their cookies (for example, by Google as part of the Google Analytics product that All World may use from time to time) is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one. Advertisers or other companies do not have access to All World cookies.
