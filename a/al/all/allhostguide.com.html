Article available for reprint:  godfreyh@irieisle-online.com  ==================================================== Hosting of web sites has essentially become a commodity.  There is very little distinguishing one hosting company from the next. Core plans and features are the same and  price is no longer a true determining feature. In fact,  choosing a host based on the cheapest price can be more  expensive in the long term with respect to reliability  issues and possible loss of sales as a result of website downtime.<br></p><p>
Selecting a host from the thousands of providers and resellers can be a very daunting task, which may result in a hit and miss approach. But although hosting may have become a commodity, one distinguishing feature that you must always look out for is reliability.<br></p><p>

</a></h4><br>
<div class="ArticleText"> Okay, so you understand webfarms now. What's the magic that actually distributes the load, and how does it determine how the distribution is handled?<br><p>
At ORCS Web we use the Foundry Server Iron products to perform our webfarm load-balancing. If one of them fails, the other instantly takes over (In our testing, it had sub-second fail-over!)<br></p><p>
So what is this "Server Iron" thing? In simplest terms, it's a layer 4-7 switch. It has multiple network ports on it and can be used literally like other types of switches. But, it can also load-balancing and traffic distribution. A VIP (virtual IP) can be assigned to the SI (Server Iron) and it then handles all traffic sent to that address/VIP. Further configuration is done to tell the SI what to actually do with the traffic sent to the VIP address.<br></p><p>
The traffic that hits the VIP on the Server Iron is of course redistributed to a number of server nodes so the client request can be satisfied - that's the whole point of a webfarm. If one or more server nodes are not responding, the switches are able to detect this and send all new requests to servers that are still online - making the failure of a server node almost transparent to the client.<br></p><p>
