# Privacy Policy | PetSmart Charities

**General and Donor Privacy Policy**

PetSmart Charities® wants you to know how we collect, use, share and protect information about you.  By interacting with us, you consent to our use of information that is collected or submitted as we describe in this privacy policy.  We may change or add to this privacy policy, so we urge you to review it periodically. This policy applies only to residents of the United States. If you are a resident of Canada, please click [here](https://www.petsmartcharities.ca/privacy-policy) for applicable information.

## What Information is Collected

## Types of personal information we collect include:

  * Your name
  * Your mailing address
  * Your e-mail address
  * Your phone (or mobile) number
  * Your credit/debit card number
  * Your donation information
  * Your date of birth or age
  * Your location
  * Your pet’s information (name, breed, date of birth, gender, veterinary information, photographs, etc.)



## If you choose not to provide personal information, we may not be able to provide you with requested services or information.  

### Automated Information Collection

We may connect information collected automatically with information we may already have about you.  If we are able to identify you as a PetSmart Charities supporter, we may, for example, link your activity on our website to your activity in one of our Adoptions Centers.  This allows us to provide you with a personalized experience regardless of how you interact with us – online, in-person, mobile, etc.

### PetSmart Charities Automated Information Collection

We and our Service Providers use cookies, web beacons, and other technologies to receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us through your computer or mobile device.  This information, which includes the pages you visit on our site, which web address you came from, the type of device you are using, donation information, search terms and geographic location, helps us recognize you, customize your website experience and make our outreach efforts more relevant.  These technologies also enable us to provide features such as text (SMS/MMS) messages you have chosen to receive.  We also use Flash cookies for fraud prevention and other purposes.

In order to provide the best online experience possible, we also use these technologies for reporting and analysis purposes, such as how you are using our website, performance of our outreach efforts, and your response to those outreach efforts.

### Third-Party Automated Information Collection

In certain instances, we allow third-party organizations to collect certain information from you when you visit our website and to use that information to provide requested services and information to you.  These parties typically use a cookie or a third party web beacon to collect this information.

### Mobile App and Mobile Website

If you access the PetSmart Charities website through a mobile device, the same type of information outlined throughout this policy may be collected.

### User Experience Information

In order to improve your online experience, help with fraud identification, and to assist our representatives in resolving issues you may experience in completing online donations or other online activities on our site, we use tools to monitor certain user experience information; including login information, IP address, data regarding pages visited and specific actions taken on pages visited (e.g., information entered during donation process), and browser information.

### Social Media Widgets

PetsmartCharities.org includes social media features, such as the Facebook interactive buttons, Google Plus, YouTube, Instagram and Twitter widgets.  These features may collect information about your IP address and which page you’re visiting on our site, and they may set a cookie to make sure the feature functions properly.  Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our site.  Your interactions with those features are governed by the privacy policies of the companies that provide them.

### Information from Other Sources

We may collect data that’s publicly available.  For example, information you submit in a public forum (e.g., a blog, chat room, or social media) can be read, collected, or used by us and others, and could be used to personalize your experience.  You are responsible for the information you choose to submit in these instances.

We also may obtain information provided by third parties.  For instance, we may obtain information from organizations that can enhance our existing supporter information to improve the accuracy and add to the information we have about our supporters (for example, adding address information).  This improves our ability to contact you and increases the relevance of our outreach efforts by providing better information that may interest you.

### Facility Cameras

PetSmart Charities’ Adoption Centers sometimes occupy space within PetSmart stores.  In-store cameras are used for security and operational purposes such as measuring and observing customer traffic patterns.

## How Your Information is Shared

When you make a donation to PetSmart Charities we will collect your name, mailing address, phone number, e-mail address and billing information, as well as credit/debit card information. This information enables us to contact you in the event of payment processing difficulties, verify or respond to your donation, and deliver services and information about PetSmart Charities to you. If you authorize us to do so, we will retain your credit/debit card information to process recurring payment transactions.

PetSmart Charities will not sell, trade or share a donor’s personal information with anyone else nor send donor mailings on behalf of other organizations, unless a donor has given PetSmart Charities specific permission to do so.  We may share information in limited circumstances as described in this Policy, including the following:

  * When necessary for Legal Requirements as described in this Policy
  * When applicable for regulatory purposes (such as annual IRS filings on Form 990)
  * With Service Providers who we engage to support our own internal operations and administration – in these cases, the Service Providers are required to maintain confidentiality of donor information, and they are prohibited from selling, trading or sharing such information with anyone else



### PetSmart Charities and Associated Organizations

We share the information we collect within PetSmart Charities.  We also share information with organizations that are closely associated with PetSmart Charities, such as PetSmart, Inc., PetSmart Store Support Group, Inc., PetSmart Puerto Rico, PetSmart Charities of Canada and PETM Canada Corporation (“Associate Organizations”). PetSmart Charities and these entities may use this information to contact you about information and charitable opportunities that may be of interest to you or for other outreach purposes.

### Service Providers

We may share the information we collect with organizations that provide internal operations and administrative support services to us (such as printers, e-mail marketers, mobile marketers, analytics providers, web hosting providers, call center service providers, sweepstakes vendors, payment processors, or data enhancement providers) (“Service Providers”) or help us with our outreach efforts.  These organizations may need information about you in order to perform their functions. If we share your personal information with these organizations, it is on a confidential basis and the Service Providers are not authorized to use the personal information we share with them for any purpose other than providing services for PetSmart Charities.

### Legal Requirements

We may disclose information we collect when we believe disclosure is appropriate to comply with the law; to enforce or apply applicable terms and conditions and other agreements; or to protect the rights, property or safety of our organization, our supporters, pets in the care of organizations that we work with, the public or others.

### Elsewhere at Your Direction

At your direction or request, we may share your information. 

### Sharing with Other Organizations (for their outreach purposes)

We may communicate to you information from other organizations.  In such cases, we do not provide your personal information to them and they will not know your identity unless you choose to transact with them, in which case their privacy policies will govern your relationship.  With your consent, we may share your personal information with other organizations that are not part of PetSmart Charities.  These organizations may use the information we share to provide special opportunities to you.

### Sharing Aggregate Information with Third Parties

We may share aggregate non-personally identifiable information (information that does not directly identify an individual) with third parties for any lawful purpose.

### Asset Transfers

If some or all of our assets are sold or transferred, we may transfer the corresponding information regarding our supporters.  We also may retain a copy of that supporter information.

### Security Methods

We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect your personal information.  When we collect or transmit sensitive information such as a credit or debit card number, we use encryption, access controls, physical security, and other industry standard methods to protect that information.  However, no e-commerce solution, website, database or system is completely secure or “hacker proof.”  You are also responsible for taking reasonable steps to protect your personal information against unauthorized disclosure or misuse.

### E-mail Security

"Phishing" is a scam designed to steal your personal information.  If you receive an e-mail that looks like it is from us asking you for your personal information, do not respond.  We will never request your password, user name, credit card information or other personal information through e-mail.
