	<b>Savings Club</b><br>
	The Allrecipes Savings Club provides access to coupons and other offers

	<a name="ordering"><b>II.  Ordering from the Allrecipes Store</b></a>
	<br>
	Allrecipes and our e-commerce partner, KitchenEtc., 
	are committed to respecting and protecting your privacy. When ordering 
	products from one of our partner sites, information about you is requested 
	on an order form. The information that is collected from you is used to 
	process orders and provide a more personalized shopping experience. Allrecipes 
	does not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties. 
	</p><p>
	To find out more detailed information regarding our commerce partner's 
	privacy policies, please click on the links provided below:
	</p><p>
	<a href="http://www.kitchenetc.com/">KitchenEtc. Privacy Policy</a>
	</p><p>
	<a name="security"><b>Security &amp; Safety</b></a><br>
	To take the worry out of using your credit card to order through the web, Kitchen 
	Etc. and Electricfood.com both use a Secure Server Technology (SSL), which encrypts 
	your credit card information so that it cannot be read as it travels over the 
	Internet. Which means - the characters are scrambled, making it impossible for 
	a third party to intercept your personal information.
	</p><p>
	You can verify that the encryption is working by locating the lock icon at the 
	bottom of the web page. While on a secure page, the lock icon on the bottom of 
	Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes 
	locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, as when you are just 'surfing.' All 
	pages within the Marketplace will show the locked icon on the bottom of each 
	page. To learn more about SSL, follow this link to our encryption software 
	authenticator: www.versign.com. 
	</p><p>
	<a name="cookies"><b>III. Cookies</b></a>
	<br>
	Like most web sites, we use "cookie" technology on our web site. 
	We may place a "cookie" in the browser file of your computer, however 
	the "cookie" itself does not contain any personally identifying 
	information about you. The "cookie" does not track your personal 
	information or provide us with any way to contact you, and the 
	"cookie" does not extract any information off your computer. We
	use the "cookie" to provide functional information about your 
	browser, allowing us to provide you a better experience. We also 
	use "cookies" to gather broad demographic information and general 
	usage patterns about you and other users of our sites.  
	</p><p>
	If your browser rejects cookies, you may still use our site.  The 
	only drawback to this is that you will be limited from accessing 
	certain areas of our site, such as contests, coupons, recipe box, 
	shopping list feature, etc. 
	</p><p>
	Some of our business partners also use cookies on our site.  See next reference:

	<a name="third"><b>Third Party Advertising</b></a>
	<br>
	We use 24/7 Real Media and other third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you 
	visit our Web site.  These companies may use information (not including your name, 
	address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web 
	sites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods 
	and services that might be of interest to you.  If you would like more information

	In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertiser may

	<b>IV. Web Beacons</b><br>
	Certain of the pages of our site contain "web beacons" (also known as Internet 
	tags, pixel tags, single-pixel GIFs, clear GIFs, invisible GIFs, 1-by-1 GIFs, 
	and web bugs).  These web beacons do not affect the appearance of a page but 
	allow third parties to obtain the following information: the IP address of the 
	computer that downloaded the page on which the beacon appears, the URL of the 
	page on which the beacon appears, the time the page containing the beacon was 
	viewed, the type of browser used to view the page, and the information in 
	cookies set by the third party. Allrecipes does not control or monitor the 
	use of the information collected by third parties through the web beacons 
	placed on the Allrecipes.com Web site.
	</p><p align="right"><a href="#top">TOP</a></p>
	<b>VII. Log Files</b>
	<br> 
	Each time an Allrecipes.com page is requested from your browser, we log your 
	computer's IP address into our log files. Your computer has been pre-assigned 
	a 12-digit number. This number is the IP address. We use your IP addresses to 
	analyze trends, administer the site, track your movements on the site, and 
	gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not 
	linked to any other personally identifiable information by Allrecipes.com. 
	Allrecipes.com does not control or monitor whether third parties with web 
	beacons on the Allrecipes.com Web site have the same policy.

	To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use 
	of your information, Allrecipes.com has put into place physical, electronic, and
