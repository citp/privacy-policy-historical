<p>All-Hotels regards the privacy and security of our customer's information as a critical component of the service that we offer. When you make a new reservation or make changes to an existing reservation, we offer the use of a secure server. The Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology encrypts all information you input before it is sent to our server and when it is sent from our server to the hotel. </p>
<p><b>What information this site gathers/tracks about you </b> <br>You have the option to join all-hotels.com where you can choose to receive the monthly newsletter "All-Abroad" and the Special Offers and Discounted Hotels newsletter. You will also have the option to store your contact information, hotel preferences, room preferences, currency preferences and destination preferences. At any time, you may opt out from receiving All-Abroad and the Special Offers Newsletter, or update your preferences and contact information. Please see the section below titled "Our policy on correcting and updating personally identifiable information" </p>
<p><b>What this site does with the information it gathers/tracks. </b> <br>All the information that you submit for membership makes booking on all-hotels.com easier for you. Contact information allows your booking form to be completed automatically; Hotel Preferences allow you to match hotels with your specific requirements; Currency Preferences will display hotel rates in the currency of your choice; Room Preferences will be forwarded to the hotel with every booking; and Destination Preferences will sign you in to the location that you prefer. </p>
<p>When you enter a contest or other promotional feature, we ask for information such as your name, mailing address, daytime phone number and e-mail address so we can administer the contest. To help us better understand who our users are, we may also ask for some broad demographic questions such as travel interests, web surfing preferences, age, gender etc. If you are a contest winner, we will contact you via e-mail or telephone to notify you that you've won and get your permission to post your name on the website. </p>
<p><b>With whom this site shares the information it gathers/tracks. </b> <br>We share aggregate statistics about our customer's traffic patterns and reservations with our suppliers and partners, but these statistics do not include any personally identifying information. </p>
<p>Like most Web sites, there is certain information we automatically track, including the URL that you just came from, which URL you go to next, the browser you are using and your IP address. </p>
<p>We use cookies to help users navigate efficiently between secure and non-secure pages of our site. Cookies are pieces of information that a Web site transfers to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. Cookies can make the Web more useful by storing information about your preferences. The use of cookies is an industry standard, and many major web sites use them to provide useful features for their customers. We only use cookies to store information about hotels. Cookies in and of themselves do not personally identify users, although they do identify a user's computer. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you prefer, you can set yours to refuse cookies. However, you may not be able to take full advantage of a Web site if you do so. </p>
<p>Business Transfers: As we continue to develop our business, we might

sell or buy stores or assets. In such transactions, customer information

generally is one of the transferred business assets. Also, in the

unlikely event that All-Hotels, Ltd., or substantially all of its assets

are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the

transferred assets. </p>
