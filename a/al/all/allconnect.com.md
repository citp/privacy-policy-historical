**What Are The Important Terms Used Throughout This Privacy Policy?**

Throughout this privacy policy we use several specialized terms. "Personally Identifiable Information" is information that tells us specifically who you are, like your name, street address, birth date, email address, billing address, social security number, and credit card number. "User Information" means all Personally Identifiable Information and any other forms of information discussed in this privacy policy, including the Internet Protocol (IP) address of a user's computer. We use the term "aggregate" when we combine information from various persons or users. Information is said to be "anonymized" if it does not identify individual persons or entities or associate a particular person or entity with such information.

We employ [or our third party analytics partner employs] a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us provide a better user experience by continually learning and adjusting to what our visitors find useful. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. This allows us to see which pages are most visited on our site, so we can continue to provide useful content to our visitors.

Clear gifs are strictly a means to learn more about which pages our customers find effective and which pages are not offering a good user experience.
