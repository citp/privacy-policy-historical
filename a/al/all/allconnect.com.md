**What Are The Important Terms Used Throughout This Privacy Policy?**

Throughout this privacy policy we use several specialized terms. "Personally Identifiable Information" is information that tells us specifically who you are, like your name, street address, birth date, email address, billing address, user ID number (including, if applicable, customer ID number and account number), social security number, credit card number, and other non-public information that is associated with the foregoing. "User Information" means all Personally Identifiable Information and any other forms of information discussed in this privacy policy, including the Internet Protocol (IP) address of a user's computer. We use the term "aggregate" when we combine information from various persons or users. Information is said to be "anonymized" if it does not identify individual persons or entities or associate a particular person or entity with such information.

**What Types Of Information Do We Collect, How Do We Use it and To Whom Do We Disclose It?**

Visiting Our Site. When you visit our website to browse, we may collect and store the domain name and host from which you access the Internet (e.g., google.com), the IP address of your computer, your browser software and operating system and your entity identification. We may use this information to organize and analyze IP addresses so that we can provide items such as efficient service, enhance security, monitor appropriate usage and produce traffic volume statistics. This type of non-Personally Identifiable information may be shared with third parties, such as when we aggregate and disclose site traffic information for marketing and commercial purposes. When you visit our website, you may also choose certain options such as (i) Your Account, (ii) About Allconnect, (iii) Bundles, Phone, TV, Internet, Utilities and Home Service, (iv) Customer Service and (v) Contact Us to obtain more information about us, our business associates and our Services. Through these options, you may provide us with Personally Identifiable Information. We will collect, use and disclose such Personally Identifiable Information as further described below in Using Our Services.

Using Our Services. When you use our Services, you must through our initial checkout process or subsequent order placements provide Personally Identifiable Information, including your name, address, e-mail address, phone number, and billing information for you to properly and fully receive the offered Services. We collect and store this Personally Identifiable Information and any modifications that either we or you make to that information. Except as set forth in this policy, we will not reveal any such Personally Identifiable Information to any third party without the consent of the provider of such information, except that we may share User Information with our business associates who assist us in administering the Services. In such cases, the business associates are permitted to use this information only in order to carry out the services Allconnect has contracted for. Furthermore, we may use, disclose or transfer certain User Information (i) to provide you the Services or information you request; (ii) to send you additional information about your ordered services such as a confirmation, reminder, problem status or change order; (iii) to send you a newsletter or other marketing materials; (iv) to protect the confidentiality or security of your records; (v) to comply with government requests if appropriate for your protection or in connection with an investigation or prosecution, court order, or subpoena or similar legal process; (vi) in connection with a sale or merger of Allconnect or other change in corporate control (and you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your Personally Identifiable Information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your Personally Identifiable Information), or (vii) for other legally permissible purposes. We may also share aggregate anonymized data relating to the transactions on the site and use of the Services for marketing, research and other purposes.

From time to time, we may send you survey forms or include survey forms on our site asking you for information regarding your use of our Services. For the most part, we will only disclose your survey responses that contain anonymized data to our business associates who assist us in administering the Services. However, we may share email addresses with business associates who assist us in administering the Services.

**Blog / Forum**

Our website offers publicly accessible blogs or community forums. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your Personally Identifiable Information from our blog or community forum, contact us at [customercare@allconnect.com](mailto:customercare@allconnect.com). In some cases, we may not be able to remove your Personally Identifiable Information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.

**Surveys**

We may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our site. If you participate, we will request certain Personally Identifiable Information from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code).

We use this information to send surveys; and we may use this information notify contest winners and award prizes, to monitor site traffic or personalize the site (in the case of anonymous information collected in surveys), and to send participants an email newsletter. We use a third party service provider to conduct these surveys or contests; that company is prohibited from using our users’ Personally Identifiable Information for any other purpose. 

**What Information May Be Collected By Third Parties?**

When accessing our website or Services, you may have the option to obtain a coupon or purchase products and services from a third party through our website. For example, when you sign up to initiate service to your home by a utility or other service provider under Your Account, Allconnect passes the Personally Identifiable Information needed for that service on to the third party utility or service provider that provide services to help us with our business activities such as shipping your order or offering customer service. These companies are authorized to use your Personally Identifiable Information only as necessary to provide these services to us. Please pay close attention when you obtain a coupon or are purchasing products and services from a third party because different rules may apply to those parties' use or disclosure of such information regardless of their affiliation or relationship with us. This privacy policy only addresses the use and disclosure of User Information collected by us and not third parties from whom you may obtain a coupon or purchase products and services.

Our website includes Social Media Features, such as the Facebook Like button, and Widgets, such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our website. These Features may collect your Internet protocol address, which page you are visiting on our website, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our website. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy statement of the company providing it.

Finally, our website may provide links to third party websites. If you enter a third party website, the owners of that website may use and disclose your information in accordance with their own privacy policy, and you may begin receiving emails from such third party. We have no responsibility or liability for the independent actions or policies of these independent sites, and are not responsible for the content, terms or privacy practices of such sites. In order to protect your Personally Identifiable Information, you may wish to first review the privacy policies of any third party from whom you obtain coupons, products or services on our website, or before providing any information on a third party website.

**Website Tracking**

We may employ third party analytics partners to help us provide a better user experience by continually learning and adjusting to what our visitors find useful. Unique identifiers (such as web beacons or tags) are used to track the online movements of Web users. This allows us to see which pages are most visited on our site, so we can continue to provide useful content to our visitors. The collected information is used to learn more about which aspects of our site customers find useful and effective.

**What Are Cookies and How Do We Use Them?**

We use cookies for our shopping cart, to remember users’ settings (e.g. language preference), for authentication, and as further described below. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some features or areas of our site may be limited.

**Tracking Technologies**

Technologies such as: cookies, beacons, tags and scripts are used by Allconnect and our partners e.g. marketing partners, affiliates, or analytics.

We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis.

**Analytics / Log Files**

As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information may include Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data. We do link this automatically collected data to other information we collect about you.

**Behavioral Targeting**

We partner with third parties to either display advertising on our Web site or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third party partners may use technologies such as cookies and/or tags to gather information about your activities on this site and other sites in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt-out by visiting [www.allconnect.com/corporate/enable-and-disable-cookies.html](http://www.allconnect.com/corporate/enable-and-disable-cookies.html). Please note this does not opt you out of being served ads. You will continue to receive generic ads.

**Google AdSense/Adwords**

We may use Google AdSense to publish ads on this site. When you view or click on an ad a cookie will be set to help better provide advertisements that may be of interest to you on this and other Web sites.

**Local Storage**

We use Local Storage (LSs) such as HTML5 to store content information and preferences.

**How Do You Safeguard Your Passwords?**

When you initially register for our Services, you will choose a member ID and a password. To subsequently sign-in as a member, you will need to enter your correct member ID and password. We designed this password-protected system to help safeguard your User Information.
