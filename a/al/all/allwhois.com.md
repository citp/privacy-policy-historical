#### WHAT SOURCES DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM?

When you visit our Web Site or use our products and services, we collect information about you. Typically, we collect or obtain your personal data because you provide it to us, or we observe or infer that information about you from the way you interact with us.

_In some cases, if you choose not to provide us with requested information, you may not be able to access all of our Website’s content or our products or services._

We use [WHOIS](https://www.markmonitor.com/legal/privacy-policy#dns) domain name registration information and publicly available information to provide our products and services.

We collect personal data **from you** :

  * **when you interact with us,** e.g., when you contact us, purchase or use our services, and request content. We may retain a record of users who have contacted us in order to respond properly to questions or concerns and for purposes of future communications.
  * **when you use our Web Site,** e.g. when you fill in online forms, we collect the information that you include in those forms.
  * **through cookies and similar technologies included on our Services** , e.g. when you access the Website, we collect device and usage information as described in more detail [here](https://www.markmonitor.com/legal/privacy-policy#cookies).



We also collect personal data about you from third parties such as:

  * **the organisation(s) or person(s) who have arranged your access to our products and services** (e.g. your employer may provide us with contact information so that we can set up your login)
  * [WHOIS](https://www.markmonitor.com/legal/privacy-policy#dns) registrars in order to enable us to carry out brand protection activities. For example, if a website registered in your name contains potentially infringing material, we look up your contact details so that we can ask you to remove that material [Hyperlink to “How Do We Treat WHOIS Domain Name Registration Information?”]
  * **clients** who instruct us in connection with our brand enforcement services
  * **from internet searches.** Where intellectual property infringement may be taking place, we collect personal data relating to web locations (such as IP addresses, social media content, and domain names)
  * **other public or paid-for sources** in connection with brand protection investigations.



#### WHAT TYPES OF PERSONAL DATA DO WE COLLECT? 

How you interact with us, and the different products and services you access or use or are identified in connection with, determines what personal data we collect about you. We generally process non-sensitive personal data. However, in the course of our brand protection activities, we may identify conduct that is a criminal offense in some jurisdictions. You can learn more about this in this section.

The personal data we collect consists of the following:

  * **Name and contact details,** e.g., name, e-mail address, postal address, telephone number
  * **Login Credentials,** e.g., security and credentialing information required to access our services
  * **User inputted content,** e.g. content you provide to us when you use our products and services (e.g. if you use notes areas of our products to record your findings or contact our customer service team)
  * **Device information,** e.g., information about your computer or other device, such as IP address, location or provider
  * **Usage information,** e.g., information about your use of our Web Site, such as date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at our Web Site
  * **Billing information,** e.g. credit card number and payment details
  * **Purchase history,** e.g. purchases you have made, when your subscriptions expire or renew



In the course of identifying IP infringements or fraudulent activity and in pursuing related enforcement action, we also record data relating to **alleged or actual criminal offenses**.

#### HOW DO WE TREAT WHOIS DOMAIN NAME REGISTRATION INFORMATION?

WHOIS is a list of all registered domains, which is maintained by registrars in accordance with the procedures set out by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN).

If you register a domain your personal data is shared with registries and selected organisations for important lawful purposes, such as brand protection, facilitating cyber security, combatting fraud and SPAM, and confirming domain name ownership and availability.

If you register a domain with MarkMonitor Inc. (as data controller) or any other ICANN-accredited registrar, you are required to provide your name and contact details ( **“Registrant Information”** ). This personal data is shared with registries and with third parties who have a reasonable need to view it (e.g. brand protection, cyber security, fraud prevention).

**How WHOIS information is used**

MarkMonitor relies on legitimate interests to process Registrant Information. We process Registrant Information for the following purposes:

  * **Registrar Administration:** we administer and maintain a register of domain names managed by MarkMonitor
  * **Brand Protection:** to prevent, detect and investigate fraud and intellectual property infringements on behalf of our clients
  * **Update the Public WHOIS Database:** to support cyber-security and IP infringement activities (amongst other things), members of the public who search to see who owns your domain will be able to see your organisation, state/province and country.
  * **Update WHOIS registries:** we disclose Registrant Information to a Registry and an Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms of our Registrar Accreditation Agreement with ICANN. The personal data they hold may be searched by third parties who have demonstrated to the registrars that they have a need to see it (e.g. to support cyber security and IP infringement activities). We may search Registrant Information collected by other registrars for brand protection purposes.
  * **Contact:** we may use Registrant Information to contact you if there is a query relating to your domain name



MarkMonitor has carried out legitimate interests assessments to confirm that the public interest in processing Registrant Data as described above is not outweighed by the rights and freedoms of registrants. For further information, please contact data.privacy@clarivate.com.

**Your Consent to Additional Disclosure**

You may wish us to make your name and contact details public on WHOIS registries, to make it easier for others to contact you in relation to your domain name. You will need to provide your explicit consent (strictly optional) in order for us to do this. Contact data.privacy@clarivate.com for further information.

**Access and Correction of WHOIS Information**

You may access and correct WHOIS information in accordance with data protection laws by contacting data.privacy@clarivate.com. You should also be aware of your other [rights](https://www.markmonitor.com/legal/privacy-policy#your-rights) in relation to personal data.

**Other Information**

We transfer your information [internationally](https://www.markmonitor.com/legal/privacy-policy#international) and [retain it](https://www.markmonitor.com/legal/privacy-policy#personal-data) as further described in this Privacy Statement.

#### HOW DO WE USE PERSONAL DATA?

This section sets out the purposes for which we use personal data and the legal grounds for processing that personal data.

We use your personal data to provide you with the information or content that you have requested, and, in some cases, to contact you about our programs, products, features or for other purposes that are in our [legitimate interests](https://www.markmonitor.com/legal/privacy-policy#interest), as well for compliance purposes. Further information is set out below.

We are required by law in Europe to explain in this Privacy Statement the legal grounds on which we rely to process your personal data. We process personal data about you when:

  * **it is necessary for our or a third parties’ legitimate interests:** details of those [legitimate interests](https://www.markmonitor.com/legal/privacy-policy#interest) are set out below and, specifically for WHOIS domain name registrant information, also [here](https://www.markmonitor.com/legal/privacy-policy#dns).
  * **where you give us your consent:** we collect consent in only limited circumstances, e.g. for marketing or, if you choose it, for the publication of your name and contact details on the WHOIS database as part of your domain name registration. If we do ask for your consent, we will make it clear that we are asking for consent and collect it separately.
  * **it is necessary to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation** (e.g., to respond to a court order or a regulator)



Where we process data relating to actual or alleged criminal offenses, we do so because the processing is authorised by law providing for appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of data subjects.

For further information on the legal grounds that we rely on in relation to any particular processing of your personal data, please contact data.privacy@clarivate.com.

#### WHAT ARE OUR LEGITIMATE INTERESTS IN USING INFORMATION?

Our legitimate interests in processing personal data are mainly customer and product administration, provision and improvement of our services, domain name registration, protection of legal rights, and marketing. More detailed information about these legitimate interests is set out below for all information and, specifically for WHOIS data, in the [WHOIS section above](https://www.markmonitor.com/legal/privacy-policy#dns).
