 **Cookies and Analytics**

Like many other website operators, we may use 'cookies' on NZR websites including Team All Blacks. Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive and are used to record how you navigate the NZR website on each visit, including providing us with information about pages and advertisements (including click through from emails) which have been viewed, how frequently particular pages are visited and the most popular areas of NZR websites.

We may use cookies to enrich your experience of using NZR websites by allowing us to develop and improve NZR websites to reflect your interests by tailoring what you see to reflect what we have learned about your preferences during your visits to NZR websites. This will mean some of your stored browsing history can be accessed by us.

In addition to cookies, we may use Google Analytics and other tracking software including, but not limited to, Google, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter retargeting throughout NZR websites to understand and optimise user experience and to improve NZR advertising. This tracking software collects and analyses certain types of information, including cookies, IP addresses, device and software identifiers, referring and exit URLs, onsite behaviour and usage information, and other similar information.

We and any of our third party analytics service providers may:

  * use cookies to anonymously track and target advertising based on your browsing behaviour; and
  * use the cookies of that analytics service provider together with the cookies of another analytics provider to inform, optimise, and serve ads based on a user's past visits to this website.



NZR websites may also detect and use your IP address or domain name for internal web traffic monitoring and capacity purposes, or to otherwise administer the relevant NZR websites, but no personal information is collected.

Patterns of use by visitors to Team All Blacks website may be tracked for the purposes of providing improved service and content based on review of user’s website traffic patterns.

 **Turning off cookies and opting out of analytics**

You do not have to accept cookies and can change your browser settings to prevent cookies being stored on your computer. But, if you do turn cookies off this will limit the service that we are able to provide to you and may affect your visitor experience.

We will only hold your personal information for as long as necessary for the purposes for which it was collected (unless otherwise required by law).

We will take reasonable steps to safely and securely store your personal information against loss, unauthorised access, disclosure, use, modification or other misuse. However, we cannot guarantee the security of information you provide to us via electronic means as information sent over the internet may be unsecure.

 **Overseas disclosures**

 ** _Requesting Erasure of Your Personal Information_**

You can ask us to delete or remove your personal information in some circumstances, such as where we no longer need it, if you withdraw your consent (where applicable) or you validly object to the processing.  If you are entitled to erasure we will comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable.  Note, even after our reasonable efforts to erase, there may be some residual information that could remain within our databases and other records which is not removed. We may also need to retain certain information for recordkeeping purposes, for compliance with our legal obligations, for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims and/or to complete any transactions started before your request is received.  If we have shared your personal information with others, we will let them know about your request where reasonably possible.

 **Data portability**

You have the right, in certain circumstances, to obtain personal information you've provided us with (in a structured, commonly used and machine readable format) and to reuse it elsewhere. You may also ask us to transfer this data to a third party of your choice where this is technically practicable.

 **Right to lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority**

If you are based in the European Economic Area (EAA) and have a concern about any aspect of our privacy practices, including the way we've handled your personal information, you can report it to the relevant Supervisory Authority in the EEA.

If you ask us, where it is reasonably possible and lawful for us to do so, we will tell you who we have shared your personal information with so that you can contact them directly.

Please be aware that some of these rights may be limited or unavailable, for example where we have an overriding interest or legal obligation to continue to process the data.
