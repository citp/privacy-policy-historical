Such devices are used to help analyze our web page flow, customize our services, optimize our user interfaces, measure promotional effectiveness, and promote trust and safety. With these devices, we collect data such as the identity of the applicable internet service provider, the user's IP address of his or her terminal device, the type of browser software and operating system in use, the date and time of Resource access, the website address, if any, from which the user linked to the Resource, and other similar traffic-related information.

<p>
<strong>Password</strong></p>
<p>
<br>
Your password deserves careful thought and protection. Use unique numbers, letters, and special characters and do not disclose your password to anyone. If you do share your password or your personal information with others, remember that you are responsible for all actions taken in the name of your account. If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your personal information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. If your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately access your profile on the Resource to change your password and notify us immediately at <a href="mailto:abuse@all.biz">abuse@all.biz</a></p>
<p>
<strong>Your Rights</strong></p>
<p>
You can see, review and change most of your personal information by logging into the Resource. You must promptly update your personal information if it changes or is inaccurate. If you deactivate your account, your profile page will not be visible but all your posted content will still be accessible. In addition to the foregoing, we retain personal information from closed accounts, if and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, including in order to comply with law, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our Resource-related agreements, and take other actions otherwise permitted by law or as specified elsewhere in this Policy.</p>
<p>
If at any time you choose to opt out from allowing us to share with or disclose to non-agent third parties your personal information in the future, or if you wish to request access to, or deletion or modification of, any personal information that we have about you that we do not already make available to you for your review and deletion or modification, contact us directly via email to <a href="mailto:abuse@all.biz">abuse@all.biz</a>. Upon receipt and process of a reasonable opt-out request, we will comply with such request to the reasonable extent within a commercially reasonable period of time. Note that requests to terminate disclosure to third parties may frustrate or render impossible our ability to maintain the Resource or conduct transactions initiated by you.</p>
<p>
<br>
<strong>Applicability</strong><br>
<br>
Except as otherwise expressly included in this Policy, this document addresses only the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. If you disclose your information to others, whether they are users on the Resource or other resources throughout the Internet, different rules may apply.</p>
<p>
<strong>Children</strong><br>

The Resource is not directed to children. If you are younger than eighteen, please do not provide any personal information to us. If a person under 18 years has provided personal information to us, a parent or guardian of such person should contact us at <a href="mailto:abuse@all.biz">abuse@all.biz</a><u></u> so that we can remove such information from our database.</p>
<p>

We use commercially reasonable physical, managerial and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your information and implement your privacy settings. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Allbiz or guarantee that your information on our Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.
