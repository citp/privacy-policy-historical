                <p>
                    The Security and Privacy of your data is a core part of Allsec's business. This
                    statement provides our clients, the assurance &amp; our commitment to information &amp;

                    Data Security programs that evolve from the changing needs of our client's data
                    security requirements.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    At Allsec, establishing appropriate security programs that our clients can rely
                    upon, has been primal since inception. Our privacy programs are developed, tested
                    and established fulfilling the requirements of Internationally recognized standards,
                    industry best practices and clients' expectations.

                    Our Privacy Operations Philosophy</h4>
                <div class="privacy-policy">
                    <p>
                        Primarily, Allsec's Privacy philosophy is to move beyond Compliance into a Business
                        Assurance approach centered around not just Compliance but also continuous monitoring
                        meeting every data privacy &amp; security requirement so as to ensure privacy of Clients'
                        data. We also focus to accomplish continual improvement in our privacy landscape.
                        Transition from compliance to business assurance is the key in having efficient
                        security practices and what we need is additional security models focused on IT
                        systems and Technology enhancements with an essence of dynamism. At Allsec, it is
                        the way to apply current industry best practices and create an appropriate Service
                        Management System that can adopt newer dimensions of security structures and remain
                        sensitive to evolving privacy diktats. We use our management systems as an effective
                        tool to meet the dynamic needs of our Clients' business to ensure the information
                        is processed with quality and at the same time it is protected retaining the evidences
                        of such quality and security practices needed for review and continuous improvement.</p>

                    Payment Card Industry Data Security Compliance (PCI DSS)</h4>
                <p>
                    The Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standard is a worldwide standard for
                    payment card and consumer financial data protection. It incorporates the requirements
                    of the Visa USA Cardholder Information Security Program (CISP) and the Visa International
                    Account Information Security (AIS) program, the MasterCard International Site Data
                    Protection (SDP) program, as well as the security requirements of American Express
                    DSS, DiscoverCard DISC etc., VISA and MasterCard now require all merchants to adhere
                    to the PCI security standard. Our compliance with PCI standards is certified by
                    a certified PCI compliance services provider.</p>

                        <br>
                        Allsec's information and data security programs ensure compliance with the network
                        perimeter security criteria mandated in regulations such as: the Health Insurance
                        Portability &amp; Accountability Act (HIPAA), the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), the

                        With an array of certifications related to Information Security in our kitty, we
                        understand that being HIPAA compliant will take our data security management towards
                        next paradigm. In line with this philosophy, apart from being PCI DSS complaint,
                        Allsec's expertise in data security management has extended to being HIPAA compliant.
                        HIPAA exclusively defines the security requirements for the service industry required
                        for protecting the electronic personal health information (EPHI). Customized controls

                    SAS 70 Type II</h4>
                <p>
                    The SAS 70 audit is one of the most demanding certifications that a data center
                    operator can undergo because it examines all aspects of the internal control system.
                    Not only must the controls be present, they must also be documented and verified.
                    Allsec is a SAS 70 Type II Certified organization since 2007 consistently maintaining
                    the effectiveness and efficiency of the controls periodically evaluated bi-annually
                    after they were placed in operation. This assures our clients that the control system
                    is functioning properly and there is a review of controls applicable for the Clients'
                    programs from time to time which is one of the key process steps of SAS 70 Type
                    II audit.</p>

                    While PCI DSS and SAS 70 caters to strategic management of information &amp; data security,
                    at an operational level an information security program that can act as a solid
                    foundation for all the Compliance programs is required. ISO 27001:2005 is an International
                    standard that provides a model for establishing, implementing, operating, monitoring,
                    reviewing, maintaining and improving an Information Security Management System (ISMS)
                    and provides a healthy foundation. We are ISO 27001 certified. Healthy sustenance
                    requires combination of Quality Management System also to control its environment.
                    Realizing this fact, Allsec has implemented ISO :27001 as an integrated management
                    system of both Information security and Quality. Our environment of internal controls,
                    across all of our accreditations undergoes not only the tight scrutiny through internal
