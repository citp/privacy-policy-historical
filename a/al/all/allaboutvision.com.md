# AllAboutVision.com Privacy Policy

## Privacy Statement

All About Vision’s policy is to respect the privacy of visitors to our website. This policy describes how we gather information from our site’s visitors and what we do with it.

### How We Collect Information

Our web server automatically recognizes each visitor’s domain name and we collect the domain name of visitors to our website for the purposes of system administration. A domain name does not provide us with personally identifiable information.

You can visit our website without revealing any information about yourself. Our site is not set up to track, collect, or distribute personal information about you (such as name, address, e-mail address, telephone number and product preferences) unless you voluntarily input this information, such as when you sign up to receive our e-mail newsletter, when you ask us to e-mail a friend about this site or when you otherwise voluntarily input this information. Any information you input will be used by us only as described in the "How we use information" section of this statement.

We use electronic records to compile statistics about how collectively our visitors interact with our website. These statistics contain no personal information. **By voluntarily providing us with information about yourself, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this policy.**

### How We Use Information

We use the personally identifiable information we collect for internal purposes such as improving our products and services, sending you e-mail (at your request only) about topics you have specified, to show you the categories of banner ads in which you are most likely to be interested and learning about our users’ needs.

We may share this information in aggregate form with our advertisers. For example, while we would never say “Jen Jones wears contact lenses,” we might tell our advertisers "29% of our newsletter readers wear contact lenses."

Unless otherwise required by law or if pertinent to a judicial or governmental investigation, personally identifiable information is not shared with other organizations or persons. Should we ever need to make an exception, we will say so at the point where you are giving the information.

Information submitted or provided to us by a website user or any person or entity regarding us or our products or services, including but not limited to ideas for new products or services or modifications to existing products or services, shall be deemed to be non-confidential and we shall be free to reproduce, use, disclose and distribute such information to others without limitation or attribution.

**Cookies**  
Cookies are small text files that websites store on your computer's hard drive. When they are supplied from our site, they contain information you have given us and are intended to be a convenience to you. They eliminate the need to enter your name and e-mail address in certain forms on our site. They may also record how often you visit our website, or what pages you looked at, so that we may provide more of the types of editorial content that you enjoy or tailor advertising to your interests.

AllAboutVision.com uses cookies only to store personally identifying information that you have provided to us. They are not capable of obtaining additional personally identifying information.

**Children**  
We are very concerned about protecting the children who use our site. We never share with outside companies the personally identifying information that children provide, and use it only for the stated purpose (for example: contacting the winner of a children's contest).

In some cases, such as our e-mail newsletter sign-up, we require a parent's written permission for children under 13 to participate. In cases where we would normally post a person's first name on our site (such as a contest winner), we will choose a false name for any child under 18, if a parent asks us to do so.

### Other Sites

You have the opportunity to access other sites from AllAboutVision.com, by either clicking on a site's link or on an advertisement. Please be aware these sites are outside the control of All About Vision, LLC, and that their privacy policies are likely to differ from ours. We suggest contacting these sites for relevant information about their data collection.
