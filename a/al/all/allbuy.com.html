    <h4>Privacy Policy</h4>
    <p>We are glad that you (referred to herein as
"the customer", "you" "your(s)" or
"user") have chosen to shop at AllBuy.com. We are committed to
protecting your privacy online. This page explains how we collect, use and
protect the information that you provide to us. We respect your privacy and

information from customers of AllBuy: </p>

<p>Personally Identifiable Information</p>

<p>Device Information</p>

<p>Aggregate Information</p>

<p><i>Personally
identifiable information</i> is any piece of

<p><u>CHOICE/OPT OUT</u></p>

<p>You make the decision whether to proceed
with activities that request personally identifiable information, such as
online contact us and order forms. If you do not provide requested information,
you may not be able to complete certain transactions.</p>

<p>Customers who use the personally identifiable
information of other customers agree to use such information only for:</p>

<p> 
Using services offered through AllBuy;</p>

<p style="text-indent:20.25pt">Site
transaction-related purposes and not for unsolicited commercial messages; </p>

<p style="text-indent:20.25pt">Or other
purposes that the other customer expressly chooses.</p>

<p>AllBuy encourages customers to evaluate
privacy and security policies of any of our transaction partners before
entering into transactions or choosing to disclose personally identifiable
information.</p>

<p><u>Email</u></p>

<p>AllBuy will not use the personally
identifiable information provided to it online in ways unrelated to the
purposes identified in the "How AllBuy Uses Personal Information"
section above without first letting you know and offering you a choice. If you
no longer wish to receive direct marketing materials, AllBuy will provide
instructions in its marketing email messages on how to be removed from any
lists. AllBuy will make commercially reasonable efforts to honor such requests.
For information about how AllBuy may share personally identifiable information,
please see the Onward Transfer section below.</p>

<p><u>Profile Display</u></p>

<p>Your personally identifiable information
may be publicly available through your profile display. You have the option to
opt out of publicly displaying your real name by changing your display name
under the Sites' customer preferences. Profile Display may allow other customers
to see your activities, including purchase and sales content, ratings, and
comments.</p>

<p><u>Photographs</u></p>

<p>Customers may have the opportunity to
submit photographs to AllBuy for product sharing, contests, and other purposes
to be disclosed at the time of request. In these circumstances, AllBuy is
designed to allow the public to view, download, save, and otherwise access the
photographs posted. By submitting a photograph, you waive any privacy
expectations you have with respect to the security of such photographs, and
AllBuy's use or exploitation of your likeness. All photographs submitted to
AllBuy become the property of AllBuy and will not be returned.</p>

<p><u>ONWARD TRANSFER</u></p>

<p>With whom may AllBuy share information</p>

<p>Unless AllBuy has your permission, as
otherwise described in this Privacy Statement, or as required by law, such as
to comply with a subpoena, AllBuy will only share the personally identifiable
information you provide online with other entities that are part of the AllBuy
corporate family and/or outside service providers who may be used to ship
products, process credit cards, provide technical support, handle order
processing, or otherwise act on AllBuy's behalf. These service providers, which
may include our affiliates, are prohibited from using your information for any
other purpose, including their own marketing.</p>

<p>When AllBuy uses third parties to assist in
processing your personally identifiable information, AllBuy requires that these
third parties establish safeguards to protect the confidentiality of the
information that we provide them. </p>

<p>AllBuy may share personally identifiable
information with third parties for marketing purposes, but will provide you
with choices about disclosures of personally identifiable information for
marketing purposes.</p>

<p>Please be advised that in certain instances,
it may be necessary for AllBuy to disclose your personally identifiable
information without your permission to government officials or otherwise as
required by legal obligations. AllBuy may disclose such personally identifiable
information when responding to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to
establish or exercise legal rights or defend against claims, including fraud or
infringement investigations.</p>

<p>Data collected online may be combined with
information you provide through other means of communication, such as postal
mail or third parties to further carry out the purposes described above under
the heading "NOTICE, How AllBuy uses the information collected regarding customers".</p>

<p>In addition, AllBuy reserves the right to
share aggregate information collected from you of AllBuy, without prior notice,
with entities that are part of the AllBuy corporate family and unrelated third
parties. As stated earlier, aggregate information is used in a collective
manner and no single person can be identified by such compiled information.</p>

<p>If you choose to make information available
to other people through instant messages, status updates, group forum
discussions or lists, electronic mail messages, bulletin boards, blog postings,
or by joining groups or using other networking functions that we may offer on
the Sites (either our own or through third party applications such as Facebook,
Twitter or YouTuBe), this information will be visible to these third parties.
Please take care in deciding what information you choose to make available
through these mechanisms, as we do not control the manner in which recipients
or persons who may see the information may use, retain, or re-disclose the
information that you choose to provide. In addition, if you use third party
social networking sites to interact with AllBuy, we may exchange information
with those social networking sites. Whether to use social networking sites to
interact with AllBuy, when that capability is offered, is your choice. In
addition, you may restrict the sharing of information from your social
networking accounts to the extent permitted by your social networking site's
privacy settings.</p>

<p><u>Service Orders</u></p>

<p>To purchase services, you may be asked to
be directed to a third party site, like PayPal, to pay for their purchases. If
applicable, the third party site may collect payment information directly to
facilitate a transaction. None of this information will be captured or stored
by AllBuy.</p>

<p><u>Links to third party web sites</u></p>

<p>Links to third party web sites or widgets
to enable sharing of information through social networks on AllBuy.com are
provided solely as a convenience to you. When you use these links, you leave
the Sites. AllBuy has not reviewed all of these third party sites, does not
control, and is not responsible for, any of the third party sites, their
content or privacy practices. AllBuy does not endorse or make any
representations about the third party sites, or any information, services, or
products found on the sites. If you decide to access any of the linked sites,
AllBuy encourages you to read their privacy statements. The customer accesses
such sites at his/her own risk.</p>

<p><u>Bankruptcy or Sale of business</u></p>

<p>AllBuy reserves the right to share or
transfer personally identifiable information and aggregate information to a
third party should AllBuy ever file for bankruptcy or in the event of a sale,
merger or acquisition of AllBuy, provided such third party agrees to adhere to
the terms of this Privacy Statement.</p>

<p><u>DATA INTEGRITY AND ACCESS</u></p>

<p>Should you find inaccuracies in such customers’
information, or desire to close an account or view or remove the personally
identifiable information AllBuy may have regarding you, you may contact AllBuy
through the communication methods described below, or when technically
feasible, directly on a Site. AllBuy will make commercially reasonable efforts
to respond to requests for access, updating or removal within thirty (30) days
of receiving requests. AllBuy may decline to process customers’ access,
updating or removal requests concerning their personally identifiable
information if the requests require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize
the privacy of other customers, are inconsistent with our legal obligations, or
are impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on
backup tapes).</p>

<p><u>SECURITY</u></p>

<p>To prevent unauthorized access or
disclosure, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of
information, AllBuy implements physical, electronic, and managerial procedures
to safeguard and secure the information AllBuy collects. AllBuy uses encryption
when using the Internet to transfer or receive requested sensitive personally
identifiable information. However, AllBuy does not guarantee that unauthorized
third parties will never defeat measures taken to prevent improper use of
personally identifiable information.</p>

<p>Internal AllBuy access to customers’
nonpublic personally identifiable information is restricted to AllBuy's
administrators and individuals on a need-to-know basis. These individuals are
bound by confidentiality agreements.</p>

<p>Your passwords are keys to accounts. Use
unique numbers, letters, and special characters for passwords and do not
disclose passwords to other people in order to prevent loss of account control.
You are responsible for all actions taken in their accounts. Notify AllBuy of
any password compromises, and change passwords periodically to maintain account
protection.</p>

<p><u>Data Retention</u></p>

<p>We will retain your information for as long
as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. If you wish to
cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to
provide you services contact us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:cs@allbuy.com">cs@allbuy.com</a> and we will deactivate your
account and will retain and use your information only as necessary to comply
with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>

<p><u>ENFORCEMENT</u></p>

<p>In the event AllBuy becomes aware that the
security of a Site has been compromised or your personally identifiable
information has been disclosed to unrelated third parties as a result of
external activity, including but not limited to security attacks or fraud,
AllBuy reserves the right to take reasonable appropriate measures, including
but not limited to, investigation and reporting, and notification to and
cooperation with law enforcement authorities. In the event of a data breach,
AllBuy will make reasonable efforts to notify affected individuals if AllBuy believes
that there is a reasonable risk of harm to you as a result of the breach or if
notice is otherwise required by law.</p>

<p>If a user has comments or questions about
AllBuy's privacy statement, please contact:<a href="mailto:cs@allbuy.com">cs@allbuy.com</a> </p>
