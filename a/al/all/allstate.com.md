  * We do not share your information with persons, companies, or organizations outside of Allstate that would use that information to contact you about their products and services.              
  * We expect persons or organizations that provide services on our behalf to keep your information confidential.  We also expect those persons or organizations to use your information only to provide the services we have asked them to perform.

We communicate the need to protect your information to all employees and agents.  We especially communicate this need to people who have access to it.

You may also perform some transactions on the web site.  This Privacy Statement applies to users of Allstate.com, regardless of whether the user is an Allstate customer.  In addition, as an Internet user, you should be aware of the following . . . . 

 **What are cookies and how are they used?     
Do you log my activity on your site?  
Will I receive promotional e-mails from Allstate?  
**During the period you are logged in our site, we log IP addresses (a number assigned to your computer when you use the Internet), browser and platform types, domain names, access times, referral data (the last site or URL you visited before logging into our site and the first site or URL you visit after leaving our site), and your activity while using or reviewing our site.

As part of our services, we also use cookies. A cookie is a message sent to your browser from a Web server that is stored on your computer’s hard drive. The message is sent back to the Web server whenever the browser requests a page from that server. Many commercial Internet sites use cookies. While a code in the cookie file enables the site to label you as a particular user, it does not identify you by name or address unless you have provided us with such information (over the Internet or otherwise) or set up preferences in your browser to do so automatically, in which case it may identify you by name, address or other personal information. You may opt out of accepting cookies by changing the settings on your browser. However, rejecting cookies may prevent you from using certain functions and you may have to repeatedly enter information to take advantage of services or promotions.

In general, cookies allow us to identify you as a particular user and thus provide you with a more customized service. We may also use cookies to track and measure customer or user requests, inquiries, preferences, interests, demographics, traffic patterns and Web site usage, and to determine audience size and repeated usage.  This information may also be used to manage and customize our Web site’s content, layout, and services in order to improve our site, enhance customer service, and provide tailored messages.

As indicated above, we may also use customer information to send you promotional communications about products, features, and options that we believe may be of interest to you.  If we have your e-mail address, we may do this by e-mail.  If you do not wish to receive promotional e-mails from us, you can inform us of your desire to be removed from our mailing lists by writing us at Allstate Insurance Company, Customer Privacy Inquiries, P.O.

 **Who Should Use Our Web Site?  
** Our Web site is for insurance and financial products and services and is not intended for children. We offer insurance and financial products and services and thus do not market any products or services to children under the age of thirteen or knowingly collect any information from children under the age of thirteen. If we become aware that information is or has been submitted by or collected from a child under the age of thirteen, we will delete this information.

 **What security procedures do we use to guard against the loss, misuse, alteration, or theft of information while that information is being submitted to Allstate over the Internet?  
** We use the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol, secure servers and security protocol to safeguard the information you submit.

To help ensure the security of your personal and financial information that you submit to us (other than via an e-mail message), we use security software to encrypt the information before and during its transmission through the Internet. We only allow information to be submitted for transmission if your browser is compatible with our security software. If your browser is not compatible, you will receive a message indicating your transaction can be completed but at a lower level of security.

E-mail messages are not secure. Our security software does not encrypt e-mail messages. E-mail messages traveling through the Internet are subject to viewing, alteration, and copying by potentially anyone on the Internet.

We take seriously the issue of safeguarding your privacy online. However, please note that you should exercise discretion with respect to the submission of any personal or financial information via e-mail. Please keep in mind that transmitting information via e-mail over the Internet is never completely secure and thus any information submitted may be intercepted, collected, used or disclosed by others. If you are concerned about the security of your communication, we encourage you to send your correspondence through the postal service or use the telephone to speak directly to us.  We are not responsible for the security or confidentiality of communications you send to us through the Internet using e-mail messages.

 **What can you do as a customer to help maintain the security of information when accessing Allstate over the Internet?**  
Some steps you can take to maintain the security of your information include:

  * Utilize the latest, generally proven version of the Netscape, Microsoft Explorer or the America Online browser. Our site is most secure when using one of these browsers.             
  * Keep your User ID and PIN or password confidential. Utilize a PIN or password unique to you and, if possible, change it frequently.             
  * Make sure others are not watching you enter your User ID, PIN or password on your keyboard when using the Customer Care Center or when using other protected areas of Allstate.com.             
  * Do not leave your computer unattended while logged onto our Customer Care Center or other protected areas of Allstate.com.
