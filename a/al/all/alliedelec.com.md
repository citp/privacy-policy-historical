# Allied Electronics - Privacy Policy

General  
You can access our web site home page and browse our site without disclosing your personal data. However, while visiting the Allied Electronics site, we may ask you to register and/or provide information that personally identifies you ("Personal Information") for purposes of interacting with our site, including, for example, when you ask for information, enter a contest, order subscriptions, or download material. Allied Electronics intends to give you as much control as possible over your Personal Information. If you choose to provide Allied Electronics with your Personal Information, it is our intent to let you know how we will use your Personal Information. Allied Electronics uses your Personal Information to help you quickly find goods, services or information on the site. We track the domains from which this site is visited and use that data to analyze for trends and statistics, and then discard it. If you choose not to have your Personal Information used as a basis for further contact with you by Allied Electronics or one of its business partners, you may "opt out". If you choose not to give us your Personal Information, you can still use most of this site. You merely will not be able to access areas that require registration. Additionally, if you do not want Allied Electronics to send you e-mail or postal mail regarding Allied Electronics or its services, you may "opt out" at the time you give us your Personal Information. 

Children's Privacy  
Allied Electronics does not knowingly collect personal data from children. Nor does Allied Electronics take specific steps to protect the privacy of children who disclose their personal data to us. 

What personal information does www.alliedelec.com collect from me?

www.alliedelec.com collects information in several ways. Some personal information is gathered when you register. During registration, www.alliedelec.com asks you for a user name, password, your name, telephone number, fax number, e-mail address, company name, and addresses. This information is a mandatory requirement during registration. Once you register you are no longer anonymous to www.alliedelec.com and are able to take full advantage of the site. 

In addition, we keep copies of information you submit when you send e-mail feedback to the site, ask a technical question, or report a problem. If you contact www.alliedelec.com in writing we may keep a record of that correspondence. www.alliedelec.com also occasionally asks users to complete surveys that we use for research purposes. 

What are cookies and how does www.alliedelec.com use them?  
A cookie is an element of data that a Web site can send to your browser, which may then store it on your system. Some Allied Electronics pages may use cookies so that we may better serve you when you return to our site. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it. 

This Web site uses a session cookie to enable e-commerce functionality. When you enter the Allied Electronics Web site, a cookie is sent to your browser. The cookie is stored by your browser, but is not written to your hard disk. This cookie contains a number generated by the Allied Electronics web server. It is used to uniquely identify your browser for the duration of your visit to the Allied Electronics site. This cookie is not used to gather information about your visit to the Allied Electronics site. The cookie is simply used to link you to your unique order.

This cookie is similar to a locker key in that, as you interact with our site (add an item to your shopping cart), information is stored for you in a locker on the Allied Electronics server. The cookie is the key to this locker and the information contained within. Because this key is unique to you, it ensures that your information is secured and cannot be accessed by anyone else. 

When you quit your browser or after 30 minutes of inactivity, the cookie within your browser and the corresponding data will be deleted and your session ended.   
How does www.alliedelec.com use my information? 

www.alliedelec.com's primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you with customized and relevant information when you visit the site. www.alliedelec.com also does research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior based on the information provided to us through registration, during a promotion, from our server log files or from surveys. We do this to better understand and serve our users. This research is compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis. We also use your information for the purposes of order fulfillment and occasional direct marketing activities.
