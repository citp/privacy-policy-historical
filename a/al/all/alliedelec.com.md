# Allied Electronics - Privacy Policy

General

This privacy policy covers alliedelec.com and all of its subdomains. You can access our website home page and browse our site without disclosing your personal data. However, while visiting the Allied Electronics site, we may ask you to register and/or provide information that personally identifies you ("Personal Information") for purposes of interacting with our site, including, for example, when you ask for information, enter a contest, order subscriptions, or download material. Allied Electronics intends to give you as much control as possible over your Personal Information. If you choose to provide Allied Electronics with your Personal Information, it is our intent to let you know how we will use your Personal Information. Allied Electronics uses your Personal Information to help you quickly find goods, services or information on the site. We track the domains from which this site is visited and use that data to analyze for trends and statistics, and then discard it. If you choose not to have your Personal Information used as a basis for further contact with you by Allied Electronics or one of its business partners, you may "opt out". If you choose not to give us your Personal Information, you can still use most of this site. You merely will not be able to access areas that require registration.

Children's Privacy

Allied Electronics does not knowingly collect personal data from children. Nor does Allied Electronics take specific steps to protect the privacy of children who disclose their personal data to us.

What personal information do alliedelec.com and its subdomains collect from me?

Our website collects information in several ways. Some personal information is gathered when you register. During registration, our site asks you for a user name, password, your name, telephone number, fax number, email address, company name, and addresses. This information is a mandatory requirement during registration. Once you register you are no longer anonymous to alliedelec.com or its subdomains and are able to take full advantage of the site.

In addition, we keep copies of information you submit when you send email feedback to the site, ask a technical question, or report a problem. If you contact us in writing through our site we may keep a record of that correspondence. We also occasionally ask users to complete surveys that we use for research purposes.

What are cookies and how do alliedelec.com and its subdomains use them?

A cookie is an element of data that a Website can send to your browser, which may then store it on your system. Some Allied Electronics pages may use cookies so that we may better serve you when you return to our site. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it.

Our website uses a session cookie to enable e-commerce functionality. When you enter the Allied Electronics website, a cookie is sent to your browser. The cookie is stored by your browser and written to your hard disk. This cookie contains a number generated by the Allied Electronics web server. It is used to uniquely identify your browser for the duration of your visit to the Allied Electronics site. This cookie is used to gather information about your username, cart ID, persistent login information and your preferred website country and language. The cookie is used to link you to your unique order, help you remain logged in and route you to your preferred alliedelec.com website. 

alliedelec.com also uses a third-party Google cookie to track general user behavior, which is used to provide a better overall customer experience. No personally identifiable information is stored or tracked through the use of this cookie. 

These cookies are similar to locker keys in that, as you interact with our site (add an item to your shopping cart), information is stored for you in a locker on the Allied Electronics server. A cookie is the key to this locker and the information contained within. Because these keys are unique to you, they ensure that your information is secured and cannot be accessed by anyone else.

After 90 days, or when you clear your cookies, the cookie within your browser and the corresponding data will be deleted and your session ended.

How do alliedelec.com and its subdomains use my information?

Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you with customized and relevant information when you visit the site. We also research our users' demographics, interests, and behavior based on the information provided to us through registration, during a promotion, from our server log files or from surveys. We do this to better understand and serve our users. This research is compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis. We also use your information for the purposes of order fulfillment and occasional direct marketing activities.

Who is collecting information?

When you are on our website and are asked for personal information, you are providing that information to Allied Electronics or its parent company, Electrocomponents plc, alone, unless it is specifically stated otherwise. Please be aware that our site has links to other sites which may collect personally identifiable information about you. The information practices of those websites linked to alliedelec.com, other than any alliedelec.com subdomains, are not covered by this privacy statement.

If any link is offered connecting to a third party website, it is as an accommodation to the respective third party site owner and without charge. Sites linked to and from this site are not necessarily under the control of Allied Electronics and Allied Electronics shall have no responsibilities or liabilities whatsoever for the content or privacy practices of any such linked site or any link or linking program at any time. Allied Electronics does not necessarily endorse companies (or related products or services) to or from which this site is linked. If you decide to access any of the third party sites linked to this site, you do so entirely at your own risk.

With whom does alliedelec.com and its subdomains share my information?

Any information collected about you via our website will only ever be used within Allied Electronics or its parent company, Electrocomponents plc. Allied Electronics never sells, rents, or gives away information that personally identifies customers to third parties except in the case where one or more of our businesses may be outsourced and the provision of such information is an essential part of the service requirement. Under such circumstances, the security and confidentiality of personal information would form a part of the legal agreement between us and the supplier. From time to time, we may release aggregated marketing statistics to business partners, or may use these in press releases, advertising, or published reports. We would only personally identify you or any other customer in such press releases, advertising, or reports, with prior consent. Allied Electronics may also disclose user information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) Allied Electronics rights or property, other alliedelec.com users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. In addition, Allied Electronics may disclose user information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.

What are my choices regarding collection, use, and distribution of my information?

We may, from time to time, send you email regarding our products and services that we believe may be of interest to you. Only alliedelec.com or its subdomains (or agents working on behalf of alliedelec.com and its subdomains under confidentiality agreements) will send you these direct mailings. If you do not want to receive email messages from us, you can easily edit your subscription preferences or opt out of our emails using our Email Preference Center or the “Unsubscribe” link in the footer of our marketing emails. If you do not wish to receive other forms of direct mail promotions from us, then please contact Allied Electronics by calling 1-866-433-5722.

What is alliedelec.com and its subdomains’ policy on allowing me to update, correct, or delete my personally identifiable information?

You may edit your online account information at any time by clicking on the “My Account” link located in the top right corner of every page on the Allied Electronics site.

Your website Account Information and online Registry Profile are password-protected so that you and only you have access to this personal information.
