**BY USING ALLMUSIC.COM, ALLMOVIE.COM, OR ALLGAME.COM, YOU SIGNIFY YOUR CONSENT WITH THE ALL MEDIA GUIDE ONLINE PRIVACY POLICY AS SET FORTH BELOW**

All Music Guide is committed to protecting the privacy of our customers and the users of our Web sites. 

This page gives you the details of our privacy policy, including: what information we collect about you when you use the All Media Guide sites; what organization is collecting the information; how the information will be used or disclosed; what choices are available to you regarding collection and use of the information; what security measures are in place to protect your personal information; and how you can correct any inaccuracies in the information. 

This policy applies to all All Media Guide websites, including allmusic.com, allmovie.com, allgame.com. and allmediaguide.com. The All Media Guide sites contain links to other third party sites, including ecommerce partners. All Media Guide is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such third party Web sites. You should carefully review the privacy policies of those Web sites in order to determine how they treat your personal information.

**_YOUR INFORMATION: WHAT WE COLLECT, HOW WE COLLECT IT, AND HOW IT IS USED_**

Much of the information on our sites is offered without All Media Guide collecting any personally identifiable information from you. To use the allmovie.com and allgame.com sites, you are not required to provide any personally identifiable information whatsoever. You can navigate many features of allmusic.com and view some of our content anonymously. Accessing enhanced content features available on allmusic.com requires registration.

Any information we do gather on our site falls into two categories: (1) personal information that you supply when you register, complete a survey, enter a contest, or provide your e-mail address in order to receive newsletters and announcements, and (2) tracking information collected as you navigate through our sites. 

**Personally identifiable information**  
To use certain features of the allmusic.com site, we ask you to register. When you do this, we collect personally identifiable information about you such as your name, location, e-mail address, telephone number, and password. We use this information to process your registration, your request to receive newsletters and email announcements, or to voluntarily participate in surveys or contests. We also collect this data in aggregate form to better understand our user base in order to be able to improve our site features and functionality. When personally identifiable information is collected, you will know because you will have to fill out a form. All Media Guide does not sell, trade or rent your personal information to others.

**Aggregate information**  
When you use any of the All Media Guide sites, we may collect tracking information such as your browser type, the type of operating system you use, the domain name of your Internet service provider, and pages visited on the site. None of this information identifies you personally; we collect it for aggregate reporting of on site activity. For example, we may want to know how long the average user spends on our site, or which features get the most attention. We use this information to make the site more useful to you.

All Media Guide may provide aggregate statistics about our users, traffic patterns and related site information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics do not include personally-identifiable information. 

**Tracking information -- cookies, Web bugs, and IP addresses**  
To store and track user information, we use "cookies" and “clear GIFs,” which are also sometimes called “Web bugs” or “Web beacons.” Cookies alone do not tell us your e-mail address or other personally identifiable information unless you opt to provide this information to us by, for example, registering to use enhanced content features on the allmusic.com site. A cookie is data sent to your browser from a Web server. It is stored on your computer's hard drive, and contains a unique identifier that allows our sites to recognize your computer. If you are a Registered Member, a cookie on your computer lets us remember your user name and password so you don't have to re-enter that information each time you visit the site. It also helps us to ensure that a Registered Member’s account is only accessed and used by the account owner. 

The use of cookies is standard on the Internet, and you will find they are currently used by many major Web sites. You can set your Web browser preferences to alert you when a cookie is sent to your hard drive, or to refuse cookies altogether. We do not require you to use cookies, but please keep in mind that certain features and services will not function properly if you set your browser to refuse cookies. 

“Clear GIFs” are very small image files that we sometimes place on Web pages and within Web-based email newsletters or other communication we send. Together with cookies, Clear GIFs let us accurately count the number of unique users who have visited specific pages and the number of times those pages are accessed. Clear GIFs also let us know how many people opened a Web-based email newsletter. This information is only collected in aggregate form, and All Media Guide does not link this information to any personally identifiable information you provide us. 

**Third party advertiser cookies** We use third-party advertising companies to serve our ads on the Internet. These third-party advertising companies employ cookie and Clear GIFs to measure and improve the effectiveness of ads for their clients. To do so, these companies may use anonymous information about your visits to our sites and other Web sites. This information can include: date and time of ad shown, the banner ad that was shown, their cookie, and the IP address. This information can also be used for online preference marketing purposes. All Media Guide does not use or have access to this information. 

In order to make allmusic.com a more valuable site for our Registered Members and visitors, All Media Guide also collects and analyze statistical information. From time to time, we will share this information in aggregate with third parties. This data is reported only in aggregate and reveals no personal details about individual visitors to our site. 

If you want to prevent a third-party advertiser from setting or reading cookies on your computer, you can either visit each ad network's Web site individually and opt out, or go to the National Advertising Initiative ("NAI") Web site and opt-out of all network advertising cookies. [Click here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp) for the NAI opt-out site. This site will also allow you to review the privacy policies of third-party advertising companies. 

**_SECURITY_**

All Media Guide uses commercially reasonable efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your personally identifiable information. However, due to the design of the Internet, ever-changing technology and other factors outside of our control, we cannot guarantee that communications between you and our servers will be free from unauthorized access by third parties. All Media Guide will have no liability for disclosure of personally identifiable information due to errors in transmission or unauthorized or unlawful acts of third parties. 

**_COMMITMENT TO CHILDREN’S PRIVACY_**

Protecting the privacy of children is important to All Media Guide. For that reason, none of our Web sites are structured specifically to attract anyone under 13, nor do we collect or maintain personally identifiable information at our sites from those who we actually know are under 13. Should we learn or be notified that we have collected information from users under the age of 13, we will immediately delete such personally identifiable information. 

**_CHANGING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION & PREFERENCES_**

**Your Right to Choose**  
When you register to access enhanced allmusic.com content features, you can let us know that you do not wish to receive announcements from us by opting out at the time you give us your personally identifiable information. You may also later opt out of receiving such information by changing your Account Preferences in the [Help Center](https://web.archive.org/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=32:amg/info_pages/a_help_center.html). All newsletters and email announcements from All Media Guide will contain an “unsubscribe” link that also allows you to opt out at any time.

**Review and Correction**  
You may review and update the personally identifiable information that you have provided us by visiting the Member Center and updating your Account Profile. 

**_OTHER DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION_**

All Media Guide will not otherwise use or disclose your personal information without your consent except as described in this privacy policy, or as required by court order or other government or law enforcement authorities in order to comply with legal process or law; in order to protect against the misuse or unauthorized use of All Media Guide sites on the Web; in order to protect and defend our rights and property; or in order to protect the personal safety or property of our users or the public.

**_YOUR CONSENT_**

**BY USING ALLMUSIC.COM, ALLMOVIE.COM, OR ALLGAME.COM, YOU SIGNIFY YOUR CONSENT WITH THE ALL MEDIA GUIDE ONLINE PRIVACY POLICY.**

**_CHANGES_**

All Media Guide will occasionally update this Privacy Policy in response to changing business circumstances and legal developments. Any revisions to the Policy will be reflected by a change in the date in the “Last Updated” line at the top of this page. If there are material changes to this Policy or in how we treat your personally identifiable information, All Media Guide will prominently post such changes thirty (30) days prior to implementing the change, and will notify all Registered Members by email. All Media Guide encourages you to periodically review this Policy to be informed of how we are protecting your information.
