## Your Information: What We Collect, How We Collect It, and How It Is Used

In common with most other websites and on-line services, we collect certain data about your visit to the AMN Properties. Any data we gather through your use of AMN Property falls into three categories: (1) personal information that you supply to us, such as information you provide when you register (including your e-mail address), create an account, create a user name, register your device, complete a survey, enter a contest, or purchase products or services; (2) information that is collected as you use AMN Property that becomes identified with your personal information; and (3) information that does not directly identify you and is collected as you use AMN Property, including your IP address, and information gathered with the use of a “cookie” (cookies are discussed further below), and information related to searches or recommendations on AMN Property. Such information collected includes, without limitation, which pages and content are browsed, interactions with advertising and content, and other data related to preferences and usage. We use this information to better provide products and services, including, without limitation, to better target advertising and content, (on our and our Partner's websites) and to generate statistics and reports. 

You may use certain AMN Property without registering or creating an account. We may nonetheless build a history of your interactions with the AMN Property even though we don't know who you are. 

In respect of certain AMN Properties which are products, AMN may also employ update management software to collect installation and registry information from your computer, including product, version, build, language and original equipment manufacturer. Where you use multiple AMN Properties, AMN may combine or link information collected from various AMN Properties and use it for the purposes outlined in this privacy policy.

## Personal information

As is common across websites, to use certain features of AMN Property we ask you to register, create an account, provide your full name and email address and create a password. Once you have created an account, you will have the option to fill out a form (all or portions of which may be included in your profile). When you create your profile, we collect personal information about you, such as name, address, location, e-mail address, favourite actors, music, etc. which will be stored in order to provide services to you and to conduct activities including, without limitation, using it to process your registration, maintain a profile about you, process your request to receive newsletters and email announcements, or to voluntarily participate in surveys or contests and/or to communicate with you about services and products we think may be of interest to you. 

AMN may allow you to set up profiles that may be viewed by other users of the AMN Properties. To enrich your profile you may chose to include some personal information in your public profile so that other users can identify you. You should only include information in your public profile that you do not mind making publicly available without restriction. 

To process your purchase orders we require your name, billing address, phone number, email address, shipping address, credit card information and credit card security codes. We use this information to process your order and, if any questions arise, to contact you about your order. We may also use it to contact you about other products and services we feel may be of interest to you. In general AMN will try to email you first but may phone or send an electronic message to you if you have provided these details and you consent to our so doing. 

Personal information is also used to provide personalised services to you, such as show tracking and recommendations.
