# Privacy Policy

RYI Enterprises, LLC, (RYI) owns and operates **AllEars.net®** , which comprises **the Unofficial Walt Disney World Information Guide** , the **ALL EARS®** weekly newsletter and its companion promotional newsletter **Ears the Deal™** , and the **Ears to Ears™** moderated forum on Yahoo.

RYI has created this **privacy statement** in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to the users' privacy. The following discloses the information gathering and dissemination practices for **AllEars.net** **®.**

**AllEars.net® is committed to your privacy, and does not sell, exchange, or release any of your individual personal information to a third party.**

### SCOPE OF POLICY

This Privacy Policy applies only to **AllEars.net** **®**. This privacy policy does not apply to other companies' or organizations' websites that you may link to. You should carefully review the Privacy Policy of other websites to determine how they treat personal information. 

### INFORMATION AUTOMATICALLY COLLECTED AND STORED

When you browse through any web site, certain personal information about you can be collected. Like most standard web site servers we use log files. We automatically collect and temporarily store information about your visit. We use this information for statistical purposes and to help us make our site more useful to visitors. The data collected may include Internet protocol (IP) addresses, domain name, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks. This data is used to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. Your IP number is visible to most of the websites that you visit. **AllEars.net** **®** may use IP numbers to help diagnose problems with our servers and to administer our Web site. 

**AllEars.net®** utilizes **a number of outside vendors to operate portions of the website and/or newsletter. For instance,[mailermailer.com](http://mailermailer.com/)** is used for newsletter ( **ALL EARS®** and **Ears the Deal** ™) distribution, and **[adspeed.com](http://adspeed.com/)** for banner ad programs. Please see those sites for their privacy information.

### PERSONALLY PROVIDED INFORMATION

The only personally identifiable information about you that is collected is that which you provide on a voluntary basis. We make every effort to ensure that whatever information you provide is maintained in a secure environment. 

RYI will not knowingly or intentionally disclose, give, sell or transfer any personal information about our visitors, unless required for law enforcement or statute. 

If you choose to subscribe to our weekly newsletter, **ALL EARS®** , you will have to provide an e-mail address. **ALL EARS®** is only delivered electronically.

RYI utilizes Ad-rotator.com for banner rotation and statistics. Ad-rotator.com maintains information on each visitor and all associated data for the last 7 days. Other information is kept in compact forms. Ad-rotator also tracks how many people are currently active on the site, where they are and came from, which ads were viewed at what time. AllEarsNet® webmasters have access to this information. 

### INFORMATION USE

We reserve the right to perform statistical analysis of user behavior and characteristics while visiting this site. We do this in order to measure interest in and use of the site.

We will use information to let advertisers know how many visitors have seen their banners and how many have clicked on them. We provide only aggregate data from these analyses to third parties. Advertisers will not be able to identify any individual from the data provided.

### COOKIES

A cookie is a mechanism that allows a website to record your comings and goings, usually without your knowledge or consent. **ALL EARS® does not request cookies of its visitors.** However, our banner rotation program is administered by a third party and may contain cookies.
