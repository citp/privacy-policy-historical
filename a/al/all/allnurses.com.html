These  are voluntary submissions to receive our electronic newsletters, to participate  in our message boards or forums, to email a friend, and from participation  in polls and surveys: </p> <p>Information ALLNURSES.COM, INC.  gathers  through aggregated tracking information derived mainly by tallying page views  throughout our sites. This information allows us to better tailor our content  to readers' needs and to help our advertisers and sponsors better understand  the demographics of our audience. Because ALLNURSES.COM, INC.  derives  its revenue mainly from sponsorships, advertisement and / or donations, providing  such aggregated demographic data is essential to keeping our service free to  users. Under no circumstances does ALLNURSES.COM, INC.  divulge  any information about an individual user to a third party. </p> <p>ALLNURSES.COM, INC.  Gathers  User Information In The Following Processes: </p> <p><strong>Optional Voluntary Information</strong></p> <p>We offer the following free services, which require some type of voluntary  submission of personal information by users: </p> <p>1. Electronic newsletters (Dispatches) </p> <p>We will offer a free electronic newsletter to users. ALLNURSES.COM, INC.  gathers  the email addresses of users who voluntarily subscribe. Users may remove themselves  from this mailing list by following the link provided in every newsletter that  points users to the subscription management page. Users can also subscribe  to the newsletters at the time of registration. </p> <p>2. Message boards</p> <p>Users of the site's Message Boards and Forums must register separately for  these services (both are free of charge) in order to post messages, although  they needn't register to visit the site. During registration the user is required  to supply a username, password, and email address. </p> <p>3. "E-mail this to a friend" Service </p> <p>Our site users can choose to electronically forward a link, page, or documents  to someone else by clicking "e-mail this to a friend". The user must provide  their email address, as well as that of the recipient. This information is  used only in the case of transmission errors and, of course, to let the recipient  know who sent the email. The information is not used for any other purpose. </p> <p>4. Polling </p> <p>We may offer interactive polls to users so they can easily share their opinions  with other users and see what our audience thinks about important issues. Opinions  or other responses to polls are aggregated and are not identifiable to any  particular user. ALLNURSES.COM, INC.  may  use a system to "tag" users after they have voted, so they can vote only once  on a particular question. This tag is not correlated with information about  individual users. </p> <p>5. Surveys </p> <p>ALLNURSES.COM, INC.  may  occasionally conduct user surveys to better target our content to our audience.  We sometimes share the aggregated demographic information in these surveys  with our sponsors, advertisers and partners. We never share any of this information  about specific individuals with any third party. </p> <p><strong>Children</strong></p> <p>Consistent with the Federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998  (COPPA), we will never knowingly request personally identifiable information  from anyone under the age of 13 without requesting parental consent. </p> <h2 class="title">Use Of Information</h2> <p>ALLNURSES.COM, INC.  uses  any information voluntarily given by our users to enhance their experience  in our network of sites, whether to provide interactive or personalized elements  on the sites or to better prepare future content based on the interests of  our users. </p> <p>As stated above, we use information that users voluntarily provide in order  to send out electronic newsletters and to enable users to participate in polls,  surveys, message boards, and forums. We send out newsletters to subscribers  on a regular schedule (depending on the newsletter), and occasionally send  out special editions when we think subscribers might be particularly interested  in something we are doing. ALLNURSES.COM, INC.  never  shares newsletter mailing lists with any third parties, including advertisers,  sponsors or partners. </p> <p>When we use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users  like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual  users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue  to build a better service for you. We track search terms entered in Search  function as one of many measures of what interests our users. But we don't  track which terms a particular user enters. </p> <p>ALLNURSES.COM, INC.  creates  aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns for advertisers,  sponsors and partners. This allows our advertisers to advertise more effectively,  and allows our users to receive advertisements that are pertinent to their  needs.
