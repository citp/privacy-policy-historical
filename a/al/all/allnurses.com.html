Your privacy on the Internet is of the utmost importance to us. We want to  make your online experience satisfying and safe. </p> <p>Because we gather certain types of information about our users, we feel you  should fully understand the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and  use of that information.

These  are voluntary submissions to receive our electronic newsletters, to participate  in our message boards or forums, to email a friend, and from participation  in polls and surveys: </p> <p>Information NURSING gathers  through aggregated tracking information derived mainly by tallying page views  throughout our sites. This information allows us to better tailor our content  to readers' needs and to help our advertisers and sponsors better understand  the demographics of our audience. Because NURSING derives  its revenue mainly from sponsorships, advertisement and / or donations, providing  such aggregated demographic data is essential to keeping our service free to  users. Under no circumstances does NURSING divulge  any information about an individual user to a third party. </p> <p>NURSING Gathers  User Information In The Following Processes: </p> <p><strong>Optional Voluntary Information</strong></p> <p>We offer the following free services, which require some type of voluntary  submission of personal information by users: </p> <p>1. Electronic newsletters (Dispatches) </p> <p>We will offer a free electronic newsletter to users. NURSING gathers  the email addresses of users who voluntarily subscribe. Users may remove themselves  from this mailing list by following the link provided in every newsletter that  points users to the subscription management page. Users can also subscribe  to the newsletters at the time of registration. </p> <p>2. Message boards</p> <p>Users of the site's Message Boards and Forums must register separately for  these services (both are free of charge) in order to post messages, although  they needn't register to visit the site. During registration the user is required  to supply a username, password, and email address. </p> <p>3. "E-mail this to a friend" Service </p> <p>Our site users can choose to electronically forward a link, page, or documents  to someone else by clicking "e-mail this to a friend". The user must provide  their email address, as well as that of the recipient. This information is  used only in the case of transmission errors and, of course, to let the recipient  know who sent the email. The information is not used for any other purpose. </p> <p>4. Polling </p> <p>We may offer interactive polls to users so they can easily share their opinions  with other users and see what our audience thinks about important issues. Opinions  or other responses to polls are aggregated and are not identifiable to any  particular user. NURSING may  use a system to "tag" users after they have voted, so they can vote only once  on a particular question. This tag is not correlated with information about  individual users. </p> <p>5. Surveys </p> <p>NURSING may  occasionally conduct user surveys to better target our content to our audience.  We sometimes share the aggregated demographic information in these surveys  with our sponsors, advertisers and partners. We never share any of this information  about specific individuals with any third party. </p> <p><strong>Children</strong></p> <p>Consistent with the Federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998  (COPPA), we will never knowingly request personally identifiable information  from anyone under the age of 13 without requesting parental consent. </p> <p><strong>Usage tracking</strong></p> <p>NURSING tracks  user traffic patterns throughout all of our sites. However, we do not correlate  this information with data about individual users. NURSING does  break down overall usage statistics according to a user's domain name, browser  type, and MIME type by reading this information from the browser string (information  contained in every user's browser). </p> <p>NURSING sometimes  tracks and catalogs the search terms that users enter in our Search function,  but this tracking is never associated with individual users. We use tracking  information to determine which areas of our sites users like and don't like  based on traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual users read,  but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build  a better service for you. </p> <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p> <p>We may place a text file called a "cookie" in the browser files of your computer.  The cookie itself does not contain Personal Information although it will enable  us to relate your use of this site to information that you have specifically  and knowingly provided. But the only personal information a cookie can contain  is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard  disk or read cookie files created by other sites. NURSING uses  cookies to track user traffic patterns (as described above). Our advertising  system delivers a one-time cookie to better track ad impressions and click  rates. </p> <p>You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. If you've set  your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will receive the warning  message with each cookie. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use  this site. However, you do need cookies to participate actively in message  boards, forums, polling and surveys. </p> <h2 class="title">Use Of Information</h2> <p>NURSING uses  any information voluntarily given by our users to enhance their experience  in our network of sites, whether to provide interactive or personalized elements  on the sites or to better prepare future content based on the interests of  our users. </p> <p>As stated above, we use information that users voluntarily provide in order  to send out electronic newsletters and to enable users to participate in polls,  surveys, message boards, and forums. We send out newsletters to subscribers  on a regular schedule (depending on the newsletter), and occasionally send  out special editions when we think subscribers might be particularly interested  in something we are doing. NURSING never  shares newsletter mailing lists with any third parties, including advertisers,  sponsors or partners. </p> <p>When we use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users  like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual  users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue  to build a better service for you. We track search terms entered in Search  function as one of many measures of what interests our users. But we don't  track which terms a particular user enters. </p> <p>NURSING creates  aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns for advertisers,  sponsors and partners. This allows our advertisers to advertise more effectively,  and allows our users to receive advertisements that are pertinent to their  needs. Because we don't track the usage patterns of individual users, an advertiser  or sponsor will never know that a specific user clicked their ad. We will not  disclose any information about any individual user except to comply with applicable  law or valid legal process or to protect the personal safety of our users or  the public. </p> <h2 class="title">Sharing Of The Information</h2> <p>NURSING uses  the above-described information to tailor our content to suit your needs and help our advertisers better understand our audience's demographics. This is  essential to keeping our service free. We will not share information about  individual users with any third party, except to comply with applicable law  or valid legal process or to protect the personal safety of our users or the  public. </p> <h2 class="title">Security</h2> <p>NURSING operates  secure data networks protected by industry standard firewall and password protection systems. Our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced  as necessary and only authorized individuals have access to the information  provided by our customers. </p> <h2 class="title">Opt-out Policy</h2> <p>We give users options wherever necessary and practical. Such choices include: </p> <p>Opting not to register to receive our electronic newsletters. </p> <p>Opting not to participate in certain interactive areas, which completely alleviates the need to gather any personally identifiable information from our users </p> <h2 class="title">Your Consent</h2> <p> By using this site, you consent to the collection and use of this information by NURSING. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on    this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.</p> <p>We collect the following information: </p> <ol> <li>Click-stream data </li> <li>HTTP protocol elements </li> <li>Search terms </li> <li>User's Name </li> <li>Computer information </li> </ol> <p>At the user's option, we may also collect the following data: </p> <ol> <li> Birth Date </li> <li>Email Address</li> <li>Telephone</li> <li>Business Address </li> </ol> <p>This data will be used for the following purposes: </p> <ol> <li>Completion and support of the current activity. </li> <li>Web site and system administration. </li> <li>Research and development. </li> </ol> <p>This data will be used by ourselves and our agents. </p> <p>The following explanation is provided for why this data is collected: </p>
