# All Nursing Schools - Privacy Policy

### Privacy Policy

At the All Nursing Schools web site, operated by All Star Directories, we care about your privacy. This policy details what information we collect and how we use it. 

### Surfing Data

When you browse through our site, we collect information on the efficiency and working of our Web site. This information includes the number of times a web page is accessed, the browser used, and paths taken when moving through the Web site, and search terms entered by users. We keep this information for an indefinite time to improve the operation of our site.

We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our site. These companies may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs or web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness. Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and action tags is completely anonymous. If you would like more information about this practice and your choices, click [here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp).

### Contact Information

We also collect personal contact information if you enter it when requesting information from a school. This contact information is stored on our servers to provide schools with inquiry management features. It is also passed onto the schools you identify (sometimes through a vendor that is under contract to the school), so that they may contact you with more information. Personally identifiable Contact Information is not sold to third parties except as explicitly required to fulfill your information request. Contact Information is aggregated to create reports on overall education industry trends, which may be sold to third parties. 

### Cookies

All Nursing Schools uses cookies (small files on your computer) to provide us with usage statistics about our web site, to understand where visitors find out about our Web site, and to assist in entering data when requesting school information. 

### Schools Contacting You

Different schools have different methods of following up with student information requests. Some will send you brochures in the mail, others will reply via email or try to contact you by telephone. By using our service to request information from schools, you are giving permission to schools (or their partners or vendors) to contact you using the method of their choice, to fulfill your information request, notwithstanding your possible listing in the National Do-Not-Call Registry. 

### All Star Directories

Finally, All Star Directories reserves the right to contact you in the future to help improve our operations or to introduce new services, such as surveys to ensure that schools have followed up with your information requests in a timely manner.
