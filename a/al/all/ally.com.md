Once you become a customer of Ally, and once a year while you remain a customer of Ally, we will provide you with a Privacy Notice describing our privacy practices. It will describe and provide any updates to the collection and sharing of personal information about our customers, as required by law.

### Does Ally use cookies or other online technologies to collect information?

When you browse or visit one of our websites, we may store certain information on your computer.

For example, cookies may be used to remember your bank or auto login preference. Where our websites support it, to save you time we may offer you the option to save your username and/or remember your computer by putting a cookie on your machine. Other online technologies we use may include Flash® objects (sometimes called "Local Shared Objects") as part of our online authentication measures if you ask us to remember your computer. Flash objects help us recognize your computer when you come back to our site. We do not use Flash objects for any online behavioral advertising purpose.

_Does Ally track your online activity on our websites?_   
We may use online tracking technologies, such as cookies, to gather anonymous, aggregate information about your visit to our websites. This information allows us to measure site activity and to create ideas for improving our sites and may include the time and length of your visit, the pages you look at on our sites, the website you visited just before coming to ours and your internet service provider. If we provide you with a link from an Ally site to another site, we may track the fact that you clicked the link. This will help us understand which links are helpful to you when you visit our site, and will help us provide you with links that may be of interest to you, when you visit our site again.

_Does Ally use online behavioral advertising (OBA) on third party sites?_   
Yes, we utilize OBA on third party websites and mobile apps that are not affiliated with Ally. The third parties with which Ally contracts may use cookies or other technologies for OBA.

Anyone receiving an online behavioral ad may opt-out by clicking the third party site’s Advertising Option icon (Ad Choices) associated with the ad or visiting the third party website's privacy policy for an opt-out mechanism, if any.
