We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site, to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by www.all-berlin-apartments.com .

## Security

This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users` information. When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, their information is protected both online and off-line. 

When our booking form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected by the best encryption software in the industry - SSL (128 bit encryption). While on a secure page, such as our booking form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when users are just `surfing`. To learn more about SSL, follow this link: www.webopedia.com/TERM/S/SSL.html 

Furthermore all payment information submitted in our forms is password encrypted with PGP. Pretty Good Privacy or PGP was written by Phil Zimmermann in 1991 and has since become an industry standard to store and transmit sensitive data using 1024 bit passphrase encryption. For more information about PGP please visit: http://www.openpgp.org/about_openpgp/history.shtml 

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users` information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Our employees must use password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desk. When they return, they must re-enter their password to re-gain access to user information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our users` information is protected. 

If users have any questions about the security at our Web site, users can send an email to it@oh-barcelona.com. 

## Notification of Changes

If we decide to make a material change to our privacy policy, we will notify users by posting a prominent notice on our Web site for 30 days. Our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances if any, we disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
