<h4>How We Use and Disclose IP Addresses?</h4>

<p>We use IP Addresses for purposes such as calculating Site usage levels, helping diagnose server problems, geographic mapping and administering the Site.  We may also use and disclose IP Addresses for all the purposes for which we use and disclose Personal Information.
