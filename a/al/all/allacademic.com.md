**Collected Information**

User names and email addresses (" _User Information_ ") are collected and maintained in the All Academic application for purposes of managing the login authentication process, and to allow the application to send notifications to the end user. An example of an application notification would be an email notice informing the user that a submission has been accepted or rejected.

All Academic will not give any User Information to a third party, unless we are required to do so in order to comply with the law.

Institutional affiliations, areas of expertise and other fields collected during the sign-up period for a conference website or other website hosted by All Academic (“ _Profile Information_ ”) are collected for the purposes of submitting one’s work to a conference, to facilitate the assignment of reviews, and to link a person to their scholarly work. All Academic works to minimize the amount of Profile Information displayed to the public to fields necessary to give submitters credit for their scholarly work. This information is distributed to third parties only for the purposes of displaying information necessary for the running of a conference such as conference programs, schedules, and archives.

All Academic may provide minimal profile information to a third party for the purpose of a conference mobile app, archiving, or other purposes requested by All Academic’s clients (the data controller).

Our software is configured to enable you to access end-users’ personal information, and to correct or delete it if requested. In most cases, users can access their own personal data to make corrections – unless the data controller (client) have prevented them from doing so (e.g. during the review process, during scheduling, or after a site has been archived).

One of the ways in which we demonstrate this commitment is through the care we take to protect the privacy of information which we collect when we host your data on our servers.
