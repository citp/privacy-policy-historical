                      methods. For example, ZPRO sites collects IP addresses. 
                      An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned 
                      to your computer whenever you're surfing the Web. Web servers, 
                      the computers that "serve up" Web pages, automatically identify 
                      your computer by its IP address, and when you request a 
                      page from ZPRO sites, our servers may log your IP address. 
                      ZPRO does not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, 
                      so although your session may be logged, you will remain 
                      anonymous to us. Should ZPRO collect IP addresses, it is 
                      only for the purposes of system administration and to gather 
                      aggregate data about the volume of use on ZPRO. </font></p>

                      to be fully familiar with the sites visited by their children. 
                      At various places on ZPRO sites, ZPRO will ask whether users 
                      are under the age of 18, for example when requesting personal 
                      information from users, or ZPRO may ask for parental consent. 
                      However, while ZPRO requests this information or permission, 
                      ZPRO relies on users to be truthful in responding to these
