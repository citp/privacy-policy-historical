# Allegretto Publishing - Privacy Policy

We believe very strongly in the right of all individuals to keep information about themselves to themselves.  Increasingly we seem to be giving away more and more of our privacy of our own accord!  Big brother is already watching us – but it is because we invited him to!

For example, every time you use your credit card you give away information about where you were, at what time, what shop you were in, and what you bought.  From this the credit card company, or anyone they sell or give that information to, can build up a whole profile of your lifestyle.  It may seem insignificant, but add that to all the other information that people are collecting about you and you quickly realise your life is no longer only your affair!

This may or may not be of concern to you.  In either case, we can assure you that we will not be adding to the problem.  Our formal Privacy Policy is written out below.  Here are some additional points that will probably be of interest to you:

#### Email Security

Emails that you send are like postcards – anything you write in them can be viewed by anyone who cares to look.  Obviously it takes a bit of programming know how to intercept people’s emails, but it can, and is, being done.   Of course, with billions of emails whizzing around it is unlikely that someone will pick on yours – unless you are including obvious info like credit card numbers.  But be especially careful if you are emailing from work – the chances are that you are going through their server and all your emails will be saved somewhere on the system.  They may well be read to make sure that you are working at work, instead of doing private correspondence!

#### Javascript

The website does use Javascript in order to make it easier to use.  These scripts do not take over your computer – all they do is to control the way the web pages are displayed to you.  Javascript can do things like reading your computer’s clock to display today’s date, and determining the type of browser you are using, and the screen size.  But it cannot read your hard drive and send me, or anyone else, information from your files.

If you are concerned about people getting access to your hard drive, the one to watch out for is “Active-X”.  In the wrong hands that can be truly malicious.  My site does not use Active-X.

#### Cookies

There is even more misinformation about cookies.   Cookies are simply small text files that are sent from the web server to your computer.  They carry the identity of the web server from whence they came (e.g. us) and can be read by Javascript.   This means that the Javascript can tell if you already have a cookie from us, which would indicate that you have been to this site before.  They don’t carry viruses, and they can’t run any programmes – they are just simple text files.  To see which cookies you have at present, simply do a search (Find Files) on your computer, looking for “cookies”.  Any that you find can be read with Notepad or any other text editor.

My site does use cookies to make it more user friendly, and to process shopping orders.   For more details see the Privacy Policy below.

**ABOUT THE PERSONAL INFORMATION THIS WEBSITE COLLECTS AND HOW IT IS USED  **

This website routinely collects information about its visitors, subscribers, members, and customers.  This information is obtained in various ways, such as:

**VISITOR, SUBSCRIBER, MEMBER, OR CUSTOMER INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM ‘REGISTRATION’  **

Registration means that the Visitor, Subscriber, Member or Customer takes active, positive steps to communicate information to this website.  This can include pages or ‘pop ups’ where you register for a newsletter or subscribe to a mailing list; it can include your participation in visitor surveys; it can include requesting information from the website via email, mail, or courier; it may be from joining an affiliate program or other membership organization, paid or unpaid; it may be from ordering a product.

Occasionally complete credit card information may be provided to the website via fax or a fill-in form rather than regular secure merchant service processing.  This information is kept at the highest level of security and is never divulged to anyone except the merchant service provider or for the purpose of communication with the customer.

**ONLINE ORDERING**

** ** Online ordering via SSL encrypted communication provided by shopping cart services supporting merchant service companies like Visa and Master Card provides information to the website but does not provide complete credit card numbers.  In the process of online ordering, the customer provides, name, address, city, state, email address, phone number, CVV2 (back of card) number, and, occasionally a member password.  You should consider all this information available to the website.  This information is used to deliver the product, but under the Purchase Agreement you also approve its use for general solicitation purposes.

**VISITOR EMAIL ENQUIRIES  **

Website visitors who wish to communicate with the website do so under two conditions:  one, they give their permission for contact by the website; two, they are subject to any ‘submission’ provisions of the Terms of Use, Purchase Agreement, or this Privacy Policy.  While your email address may or may not be used to solicit you, it is added to the website’s general solicitation database.

**CUSTOMER EMAIL OR TESTIMONIALS  **

If you are a customer and send an email to the website, or if you communicate with the site by phone or mail, the website collects information about your communication and by communicating with the site you give your permission to collect, archive, retrieve, and otherwise use any information collected as the site sees fit.

Any communication which, in its sole discretion, the site deems to be a testimonial, may be publicized for commercial purposes.

“Cookies” is web jargon for bits of computer code placed on your hard drive.  Websites use this to keep you ‘logged in’, to keep track of search criteria, to monitor use, to password protect use of the site or use of products sold by the site.  Cookies can also be used to obtain information about your computer configuration or your use of your computer.
