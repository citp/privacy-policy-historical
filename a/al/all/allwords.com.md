English Dictionary - With Multi-Lingual Search 

Privacy on the internet has been a front page story in the USA for the last few months and we think it's an important issue. Here at AllWords.com and other sites created by AllSites LLC, we take your privacy very seriously. We offer you the details of our policy: 

First, because we are an advertising supported publisher, we do need to know something about our website visitors. Information like your gender, age, income or where you live helps us to find advertisers who want to show you their products. In reality, this information is grouped with that from other visitors, so that advertisers can understand what kind of people visit our site. Not who each person is. 

We gather this information in several ways, all of which involve you typing that information into a form on our site. If you don't want to share this information, then don't sign our guest book, or register for our services, or contests. This will ensure that your information will remain private. 

We do want you to register with us, so here's why it's O.K. We will never sell you name, address or email address to any other companies. In most cases we don't even ask your name or address, so don't worry. We promise not to email you, unless you indicate that you want us to. When we do emailings, to willing receipients, it will be handled by Allsites LLC. No outside companies will be given your address!' 

So, feel free to sign our guest book, or register for our products, we value your privacy as much as our own. And in case that big company comes to buy us out: They must agree to uphold our privacy policy. 

Please note that many advertiser networks use cookies to help track the effectiveness of advertisements and to better match ads with visitors to our site. These cookies will not contain personal information, unless you have provided that information. If you are concerned, you can set your browser to refuse cookies, or to give you the option to refuse a cookie that is being sent to you. 

If you have any questions or comments, [contact us](https://web.archive.org/web/20080913044301id_/http%3A//www.allwords.com/%3C?$linkDomain%3E13gtfagt.php).
