                        personally identifiable information. We use a tracking

                        of the business transition, the users' personally identifiable

                      <p>Users of AllYouCanRead.com are always notified when their 
                        information is being collected by any outside parties. 
                        We do this so our users can make an informed choice as 
                        to whether or not they should proceed with services that 
                        require an outside party.</p>

                        This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be 
                        aware that we, AMIXIMA, are not responsible for the privacy 
                        practices of such other sites. We encourage our users 
                        to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy 
                        statements of each and every Web site that collects personally 
                        identifiable information. This privacy statement applies 
                        solely to information collected by this Web site. </p>
                      <p><b>Surveys &amp; Contests </b><br>
                        From time-to-time our site requests information from users 
                        via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys 
                        or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore 
                        has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. 
                        The requested information typically includes contact information 
                        (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information 
                        (such as gender and postal code). Contact information 
                        will be used (or shared with the contest or survey sponsors) 
                        to notify the winners and award prizes. Anonymous survey 
                        information will be used for purposes of monitoring or 
                        improving the use and satisfaction of this site. Users' 
                        personally identifiable information is not shared with 
                        third parties unless we give prior notice and choice. 
                        Though we may use an intermediary to conduct these surveys 
                        or contests, they may not use users' personally identifiable 
                        information for any secondary purposes. </p>

                        <b>Security</b></p>
                      <p><br>
                        AMIXIMA takes every precaution to protect our users' information. 
                        When users submit sensitive information via the web site, 
                        their information is protected both online and off-line.</p>
                      <p>When our registration/order form asks users to enter 
                        sensitive information (such as credit card number), that 
                        information is encrypted and is protected with the best 
                        encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a 
                        secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on 
                        the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator 
                        and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed 
                        to un-locked, or open, when users are just 'surfing'. 
                      </p>
                      <p>While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information 
                        online, we also do everything in our power to protect 
                        user-information off-line. All of our users' information, 
                        not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is 
                        restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the 
                        information to perform a specific job (for example, our 
                        billing clerk or a customer service representative) are 
                        granted access to personally identifiable information. 
                        Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our 
                        security and privacy practices. Every time new policies 
                        are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded 
                        about the importance we place on privacy, and what they 
                        can do to ensure our users' information is protected. 
                        <br>
                        If users have any questions about the security at our 
                        Web site, users can send an email to <a class="blue2" href="mailto:privacy@allyoucanread.com">privacy@allyoucanread.com</a>.</p>
                      <p>Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal Information<br>
                        If a user's personally identifiable information changes 
                        (such as , email or country), or if a user no longer desires 
                        our service, we provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate 
                        users' personally identifiable information. This can usually 
                        be done at the member information page or by emailing 
                        our Customer Support at <a class="blue2" href="mailto:help@allyoucanread.com">help@allyoucanread.com.</a></p>
                      <p align="center"><b>Notification of Changes</b></p>
                      <p><br>
                        If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post 
                        those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, 
                        and other places we deem appropriate so our users are 
                        always aware of what information we collect, how we use 
                        it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose 
                        it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy 
                        policy under which the information was collected. </p>
                      <p>If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable 
                        information in a manner different from that stated at 
                        the time of collection we will notify users via email. 
                        Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their 
                        information in this different manner. However, if users 
                        have opted out of all communication with the site, or 
                        deleted/deactivated their account, then they will not 
                        be contacted, nor will their personal information be used 
                        in this new manner. In addition, if we make any material 
                        changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user 
                        information already stored in our database, we will post 
                        a prominent notice on our Web site notifying users of 
                        the change. In some cases where we post a notice we will 
                        also email users, who have opted to receive communications 
                        from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy 
                        practices. </p>
