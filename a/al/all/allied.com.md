# Privacy Policy

**Allied applies the Global Privacy Policy of the parent company, SIRVA, Inc. SIRVA respects your privacy. We have developed this Privacy Policy to inform you of how we protect your information.**

###  One Policy

SIRVA has one global Privacy Policy for consumers applying to the entire SIRVA family of companies ("SIRVA"). SIRVA is committed to complying with all local and worldwide privacy laws.

###  Information Covered by this Policy

Our Policy covers all non-public, personal information received by us that may be used to identify you ("Personal Information").

### How We Obtain Personal Information

We rely on many sources of information to understand and meet your needs. We may receive personal information about you from:

  * You directly, when you complete an application or when you visit us in person, over the phone, through the mail or through our websites;

###  Information Sharing within the SIRVA family of companies

To provide you with the full range of financial, relocation, and moving services you may need, SIRVA takes an integrated approach to the services we provide. In order to be able to provide a full range of services for your needs and make recommendations about a variety of the services offered by SIRVA, we may share Personal Information among the SIRVA family of companies.

### Information Sharing with non-SIRVA Family Companies

Depending on the type of services you are to receive, SIRVA may work with and provide your information to companies or persons outside of the SIRVA family to provide those services to you. For example, SIRVA may share personal information to:

  * service and support our operations generally and to support your account and services that we provide to you, including proposed or actual financing, securitization, secondary market sale, or similar transactions.
  * process or administer a transaction or product in connection with a product or transaction that you have requested;
  * data storage and processing;
  * those you have authorized us to disclose the information;
  * other suppliers with whom we have agreements to offer services to you through or with SIRVA;other suppliers with which we jointly market or provide products or services.
  * other suppliers with which we jointly market or provide products or services.



We may also share your Personal Information with these other organizations outside of the SIRVA family when required by law. For example, we may share personal information to:

  * protect against fraud;
  * respond to a subpoena or summons; or
  * respond to law enforcement or regulatory authorities.



We will not disclose your Personal Information to anyone outside of SIRVA unless you have authorized us to do so or as otherwise indicated in this Policy or as required by law.

We maintain agreements with our external suppliers limiting the use of your Personal Information only for the purposes you have intended in providing the information. These suppliers are bound to uphold our standards and procedures regarding privacy under the terms of our agreements with them.

###  Access & Choice

SIRVA provides you with a reasonable opportunity to access your own Personal Information, to correct that information if inaccurate, or to have it deleted as appropriate--subject to the exceptions stated below. Reasonable access means, for example, that requests for access are made during normal business hours; that you provide requested identification; and that requests are not excessive in number. If, at any time, SIRVA denies you access to any Personal Information, we will provide you with reasons for denying access and information about how you may make further inquiries. For instance, SIRVA reserves the right to deny access to information related to investigations or potential or actual litigation where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the individual's privacy, or where the rights of other individuals would be violated.

SIRVA will make every reasonable effort to keep Personal Information accurate while we are using that information to serve you. SIRVA appreciates your cooperation in maintaining complete and up-to-date Personal Information and will facilitate your efforts in this regard. SIRVA retains Personal Information for as long as we have determined it is needed for the purposes for which it was received or as required by contractual, record keeping or other legal requirements.

We limit access to personal information about you to those employees who need to know that information to provide products and services to you. We do not sell your personal information.

We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect your Personal Information. We regularly assess security standards and procedures to protect against unauthorized access to Personal Information.
