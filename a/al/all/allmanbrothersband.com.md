# Hittin' The Web with The Allman Brothers Band :: Where Music Plus Friends Equals Family

  
Your privacy is critically important to us. At **Hittin' The Web Group** we have a few fundamental principles: 

We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights. We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services. We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what’s visible to the public, seen by search engines, kept private, and permanently deleted. Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals. 

If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please contact us at webmaster at hittintheweb dot com.

**Hittin' The Web Group** operates several websites including [allmanbrothersband.com](http://www.allmanbrothersband.com/), [greggallman.com](http://www.greggallman.com/), [dickeybetts.com](http://www.dickeybetts.com/), [duaneallman.com](http://www.duaneallman.com/), and [winediningfun.com](http://www.winediningfun.com/). It is **Hittin' The Web Group** ’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.

### Website Visitors

Like most website operators, **Hittin' The Web Group** collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. **Hittin' The Web Group** ’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how **Hittin' The Web Group** ’s visitors use its website. From time to time, **Hittin' The Web Group** may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

**Hittin' The Web Group** also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on our websites, forums, discussion groups, guest books, and any other website feature that allows commenting. **Hittin' The Web Group** only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that website commenter IP addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the website where the comment was left.

### Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

For example, we ask visitors who register at our websites to provide a username and email address.

In each case, **Hittin' The Web Group** collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with **Hittin' The Web Group**. **Hittin' The Web Group** does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
