<a name="#MyChart"><h2>Section 9. MyChart records</h2></a><p>
As we provide your health care, we maintain documentation of your medical history, current conditions, treatment plan and all treatments given, including the results of all tests, procedures and therapies. <a href="/ahs/customerservice.nsf/page/mychart">MyChart</a> is an internet application that enables a patient to have secure web-based access to selected medical information about the patient.  
</p><p>
MyChart also allows secure electronic messaging with Allina Health. A message you send via MyChart may be made part of your permanent medical record at the discretion of the physician. Once it is made part of your record, it will be accessible to current and future Allina Health personnel who participate in your care.
</p><p>
Individuals who are enrolled to use MyChart agree to use MyChart as their primary means to obtain the results of laboratory test performed for such patients at participating Allina Health facilities.
</p>
<h3>Your security responsibilities</h3><p>
When you initially enroll to use <a href="/ahs/customerservice.nsf/page/mychart">MyChart</a>, you will be given an access code. With that code, you will be able to create a MyChart ID and password. This ID and password will allow you, or anyone else who has the ID and password, to view your medical information, submit comments that may become part of your record, and communicate with your health care team as if that person were you.  
</p><p>
For this reason, it is important that you keep your access code, MyChart ID and password completely confidential. You should prevent disclosure of your access code, ID or password, and you should change your password if you believe that your security may have been compromised. In addition, you should change your password regularly to help maintain the security of your account. You can change your password online at any time by logging into MyChart and choosing the “Change Password” option. 
</p><p>
<b>If you have any questions about the security of your password, please call 1-888-4ALLINA (4255462) right away.</b>
</p>
<h3>MyChart messaging</h3><p>
<a href="/ahs/customerservice.nsf/page/mychart">MyChart</a> messaging should never be used for urgent matters. The anticipated turnaround time for response to electronic messages is two business days. Therefore,<b> for all urgent medical matters, contact your physician’s office by phone, go to an emergency room, or dial 911</b>.
</p><p>
All communications between you and your Allina Health health care team using MyChart are carried over a secure, encrypted connection. While you may receive internet email messages notifying you of new messages in your MyChart Inbox, these emails will not contain any confidential medical information.  However, any person with access to the email account to which such messages are sent will be able to see the notifications.
</p>
<h3>Restrictions</h3><p> 
<a href="/ahs/customerservice.nsf/page/mychart">MyChart</a> does not reproduce a patient's entire medical record online, but instead provides access to selected information such as prescriptions, basic laboratory results, summary medical history, appointments, and other such information.  Even within categories of information that are generally made available through MyChart, posting of information is strictly at the discretion of the individual physician.
</p><p>
To comply with applicable laws and regulations, Allina Health provides parents and legal guardians with limited proxy access to minors' health information through MyChart. The scope of such access will vary depending on the age and legal status of the minor.
</p><p>
Allina Health reserves the right to terminate access to MyChart at any time, for any reason or no reason. In addition, a user's access to MyChart will be terminated of Allina Health determines that the user has misused or abused the system, violated any applicable terms of use, or used the system for purposes other than those for which it is intended to be used.
