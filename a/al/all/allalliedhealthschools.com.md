We also collect personal contact information ("Contact Information") if you enter it when requesting information from a school.

It is also passed onto the schools you identify (sometimes through a vendor that is under contract to the school), so that they may contact you with more information. We may share this information with our email service provider who uses the data for the sole purpose of delivering a transaction confirmation to you. We will never share your email address with anyone other than the schools you request or our email service provider. Other Personally identifiable Contact Information may be shared as required to fulfill your information request or when a business partner provides a product or service that we feel may be of interest to you. Contact Information is aggregated to create reports on overall education industry trends, which may be sold to third parties. Please note that use of your Contact Information by a school or third party is governed by such school's or third party's privacy policy.
