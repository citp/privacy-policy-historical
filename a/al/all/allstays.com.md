**What this Privacy Policy Covers**  


  * Our Privacy Policy is about AllStays' handling of personally identifiable information that AllStays collects when you are on the AllStays site, and when you use AllStays' services. This policy also covers AllStays treatment of any personally identifiable information that AllStays business partners share with AllStays.
  * This policy does not apply to the practices of companies and establishments that AllStays does not own or control, or to any persons that AllStays does not employ or manage.

**Information Collection and Use**  


  * AllStays does not collect any information at all from users of our directory service. The only information that is collected is information that may be requested for entry into sweepstakes, contests or promotions. You have to manually opt-in for this information to be collected. AllStays may possibly receive personally identifiable information from our business partners but that is not in review or practice. 
  * AllStays does automatically receive and record information on server logs from your browser including your IP Address. AllStays does not employ the use of cookies to garner information. We only track a referrer (the site or search engine you came from before AllStays.com) in order to aid in our marketing study for future efforts. 
  * Any information that AllStays does gather is used for traffic study, customizing advertising, and evaluating what features you like to view on the site.

**Information Sharing and Disclosure**  


  * AllStays will not sell, rent or disclose personally identifiable information. 
  * AllStays may send personally identifiable information to other companies or people when: 
    * We only have your consent to share the information; 
    * We need to share your information to provide the product or service you have requested or contracted; 
    * We respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal process; or 
    * We find that your actions on our web site violate our [AllStays Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/web/20021205222355id_/http%3A//www.allstays.com/Services/termsservice.htm) or any of our usage guidelines for specific products or services found on AllStays. 

**Cookies And AllStays**  


  * AllStays may set and access cookies on your computer in the future but is not currently in our practices. 
  * Other companies' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not AllStays policy. We do try to avoid other companies cookies.
