# Privacy Policy

Allied Market Research is committed to protecting client’s personal information and credentials. With due regard, the company introduces new and updated policy statements occasionally as and when new products & services are developed and new technologies are deployed. On 25th May 2018, the new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) launched by EU replaced the existing 1995 European Data Protection Directive. Owing to advancements in digital era and the introduction of GDPR, we have come up with a more comprehensive version of our privacy laws, modernized to resonate with today’s fast-paced data-driven world.
