6.1 

**What is a cookie?**  
A cookie is a small text file, which often includes a unique identifier that is sent to your computer or mobile phone (referred to here as a "device") browser from a website's computer and is stored on your device's hard drive. Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other websites. Many web sites do this whenever a user visits their website in order to track online traffic flows. 

The last of these means that certain personalised features cannot then be provided to that user and accordingly they may not be able to take full advantage of all of the website's features. Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences. 

During the course of any visit to our website, the pages you see, along with a cookie, are downloaded to your device. Many websites do this, because cookies enable website publishers to do useful things like find out whether the device (and probably its user) has visited the website before. This is done on a repeat visit by checking to see, and finding, the cookie left there on the last visit. 

6.2. 

**How does Carmony.co.uk use cookies?**

6.3. 

**Third Party Cookies on Carmony.co.uk**  
Please note that during your visits to Carmony.co.uk you may notice some cookies that are not related to Carmony.co.uk contractors. When you visit a page with content embedded from, for example, YouTube or Flickr, you may be presented with cookies from these websites. Carmony.co.uk does not control the dissemination of these cookies. You should check the third party websites for more information about these. 

All third party cookie providers are strictly required not to use any information for their own business or other purposes. 

6.4. 

**Carmony.co.uk cookies and how to reject cookies?**  
Carmony.co.uk cookies and how to reject cookies? A list of the main cookies that the Carmony.co.uk set (and what each is used for) together with ways to minimise the number of cookies you receive can be found within the Carmony.co.uk Cookie List and How To Reject Cookies.
