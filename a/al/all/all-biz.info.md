IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY, "WE," "US," "ITS" AND "OUR" REFER TO All Biz Limited ("Allbiz"), AND "YOU" AND "YOUR" REFER TO YOU. Before using the Allbiz website and all associated sites linked to [all.biz](https://all.biz/) (collectively, the “Resource”) containing the link to this policy, please read carefully this Privacy Policy ("Policy") relating to your use of the Resource.

**Introduction**

This Policy covers only information and data that is collected through this Resource and no other web Resources that may be linked to this Resource; nor does this Policy apply to practices of companies that we do not control or to people we do not employ or manage.

It may be possible for you to browse certain parts of the Resource without identification or revealing any information that enables us to directly identify you as an individual. However, you may lose anonymity once you give us information about you, and by doing so, you agree to the collection, transfer and storage of that information to our servers and to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

  2. provide custom, personalized content and information;
  3. monitor the effectiveness of our Service;

We may provide data to our advertising partners or customers after we have removed your name or any other personally identifying information from it, or have combined it with other people's data in a way that it is no longer associated with you. Similarly, when we receive data about you from our partners or customers, we keep the data and subsequently combine it with other people's data in a way that it is no longer associated with you. Queries, replies and comments you post on the Resource and related data may be exposed to public search engines and publicly available search results, or other research services, for purposes of inviting broader engagement within the business community.

  
**Sharing Information**

Except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, we will not disclose personal information to any third party.

We may share your personal information with:

(i) our subsidiaries to help detect and prevent potentially illegal actions and provide joint services to requesting users;

(ii) service providers, consultants or similar contractors or agents to support or enhance the Resource or our business operations, or with whom we contract in order to carry out transactions initiated by you, such as credit card processing organizations, and companies providing services available on the Resource (including authentication and/or spell check services);

(iii) other third parties to whom you explicitly ask us to send your information (or about whom you are otherwise explicitly notified and solicited consent when using a specific service);

(iv) law enforcement or other governmental officials, in response to a verified request relating to a criminal investigation or alleged illegal activity;

(v) persons as we in our sole discretion believe necessary or appropriate in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringement, piracy, or other unlawful activity; and

(vi) other business entities, should we plan to merge with, or be acquired by that business entity.

Following termination or deactivation of your User account, We may retain your profile information and User Content for a commercially reasonable time for backup, archival, or audit purposes. Furthermore, Allbiz may retain and continue to use indefinitely all information (including User Content) contained in your communications to other Users or posted to public or semi-public areas of the Service after termination or deactivation of your User account.

**Your Use of the Resource**

Your name will necessarily be displayed throughout the Resource and to the public in order to offer the services of the Resource. You can change or delete your Information in your personal account “My All.biz” at any time.

**Cookie Policy**

The Resource may utilize "cookies", which are small text files placed on your computer or device. We also use pixel tags, web beacons and other similar technologies. Such devices are used to help analyze our web page flow, customize our services, optimize our user interfaces, measure promotional effectiveness, and promote trust and safety. With these devices, we collect data such as the identity of the applicable internet service provider, the user's IP address of his or her terminal device, the type of browser software and operating system in use, the date and time of Resource access, the website address, if any, from which the user linked to the Resource, and other similar traffic-related information. We may also aggregate such information with similar data collected from other users and disclose such aggregate information to third parties. Certain features are only available through the use of cookies, and generally we need to use cookies to help identify you and maintain your signed-in status. You are always free to decline Resource cookies via your browser settings, although, doing so may interfere with your use of the Resource. We may use the third party’s services which may contain cookies due to their cookies policy.

**Password**

  
Your password deserves careful thought and protection. Use unique numbers, letters, and special characters and do not disclose your password to anyone. If you do share your password or your personal information with others, remember that you are responsible for all actions taken in the name of your account. If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your personal information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. If your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately access your profile on the Resource to change your password and notify us immediately at [abuse@all.biz](mailto:abuse@all.biz)

**Your Rights**

You can see, review and change most of your personal information by logging into the Resource. You must promptly update your personal information if it changes or is inaccurate. If you deactivate your account, your profile page will not be visible but all your posted content will still be accessible. In addition to the foregoing, we retain personal information from closed accounts, if and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, including in order to comply with law, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our Resource-related agreements, and take other actions otherwise permitted by law or as specified elsewhere in this Policy.

If at any time you choose to opt out from allowing us to share with or disclose to non-agent third parties your personal information in the future, or if you wish to request access to, or deletion or modification of, any personal information that we have about you that we do not already make available to you for your review and deletion or modification, contact us directly via email to [abuse@all.biz](mailto:abuse@all.biz). Upon receipt and process of a reasonable opt-out request, we will comply with such request to the reasonable extent within a commercially reasonable period of time. Note that requests to terminate disclosure to third parties may frustrate or render impossible our ability to maintain the Resource or conduct transactions initiated by you.

**Applicability**

Except as otherwise expressly included in this Policy, this document addresses only the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. If you disclose your information to others, whether they are users on the Resource or other resources throughout the Internet, different rules may apply.

**Children**

The Resource is not directed to children. If you are younger than eighteen, please do not provide any personal information to us. If a person under 18 years has provided personal information to us, a parent or guardian of such person should contact us at [abuse@all.biz](mailto:abuse@all.biz)

**Data Security**

We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Allbiz or guarantee that your information on our Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.
