				<h2>What information do we collect?</h2>
			  <p>We collect information from you when you register on the site, sign up for
			  specials, enter a contest or sweepstakes, respond to a survey or
			  communication such as e-mail, or participate in another site feature.</p>
			  <p>When registering, we may ask you for your name, e-mail address, mailing
			  address, phone number, credit card information or other information. You may,
			  however, visit our site anonymously.</p>
			  <p>Like many websites, we use "cookies" to enhance your experience and gather
			  information about visitors and visits to our websites. Please refer to the
			  "Do we use 'cookies'?" section below for information about cookies and how we
			  use them.</p>
			  <h2>How do we use your information?</h2>
			  <p>We may use the information we collect from you when you register for email
			  subscriptions, enter a contest or promotion, respond to a survey or marketing
			  communication, surf the website, or use certain other site features in the
			  following ways:</p>
			  <p>To personalize your site experience and to allow us to deliver the type of
			  content and product offerings in which you are most interested.</p>
			  <p>To allow us to better service you in responding to your customer service
			  requests.</p>
			  <p>To administer a contest, promotion, survey or other site feature.</p>
			  <p>If you have opted-in to receive any of our e-mail newsletters, we may send
			  you periodic e-mails. If you would no longer like to receive promotional
			  e-mail from us, please refer to the "How can you opt-out, remove or modify
			  information you have provided to us?" section below. If you have not opted-in
			  to receive e-mail newsletters, you will not receive these e-mails. Visitors
			  who register or participate in other site features such as marketing programs
			  and 'members-only' content will be given a choice whether they would like to
			  be on our e-mail list and receive e-mail communications from us.</p>
			  <h2>How do we protect visitor information?</h2>
			  <p>We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your
			  personal information. Your personal information is contained behind secured
			  networks and is only accessible by a limited number of persons who have
			  special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the
			  information confidential. All sensitive/credit information you supply is
			  transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into
			  our databases to be only accessed as stated above.</p>
			  <h2>Do we use "cookies"?</h2>
			  <p>Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers
			  to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that
			  enables the site's or service provider's systems to recognize your browser
			  and capture and remember certain information. For instance, we use cookies to
			  help us remember and process the items in your shopping cart. They are also
			  used to help us understand your preferences based on previous or current site
			  activity, which enables us to provide you with improved services. We also use
			  cookies to help us compile aggregate data about site traffic and site
			  interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the
			  future.</p>
			  <p>We may contract with third-party service providers to assist us in better
			  understanding our site visitors. These service providers are not permitted to
			  use the information collected on our behalf except to help us conduct and
			  improve our business.</p>
			  <p>You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being
			  sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your
			  browser (like Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer) settings. Each browser
			  is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct
			  way to modify your cookies. If you turn cookies off, you won't have access to
			  many features that make your site experience more efficient and some of our
			  services will not function properly. However, you can still place orders over
			  the telephone by contacting customer service.</p>
			  <h2>Do we disclose the information we collect to outside parties?</h2>
			  <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your
			  personally identifiable information unless we provide you with advance
			  notice, except as described below. The term "outside parties" does not
			  include Jackson Hole Net, Inc dba Vertical Media and dba Alltrips.com. It
			  also does not include website hosting partners and other parties who assist
			  us in operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you, so
			  long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may
			  also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to
			  comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others'
			  rights, property, or safety.</p>
			  <p>However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided
			  to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.</p>
			  <h2>How can you opt-out, remove or modify information you have provided to
			  us?</h2>
			  <p>To modify your e-mail subscriptions, please let us know by modifying your
			  preferences subscription management pages. Please note that due to email
			  production schedules you may receive any emails already in production.</p>
			  <h2>Third party links</h2>
			  <p>In an attempt to provide you with increased value, we may include third
			  party links on our site. These linked sites have separate and independent
			  privacy policies. We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the
			  content and activities of these linked sites. Nonetheless, we seek to protect
			  the integrity of our site and welcome any feedback about these linked sites

			  this page. Policy changes will apply only to information collected after the
			  date of the change. This policy was last modified on October 22nd, 2007.</p>
