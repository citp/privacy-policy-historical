# Privacy Policy

We realize that gambling is a specific activity which is adopted differently in various countries and cultures. In spite of there being no prohibition of gambling activities in many countries around the world, gambling is not tolerated by many of these countries. In accordance to that, discretion and strict confidentiality are of great importance to all people who gamble. Realizing this importance, we are trying to collect the least possible information about the users of our website.

While you are reading materials on our website, we are not collecting any information about your visits. Only when you sign up for our newsletter, we require your e-mail address to send you the information you want. We do not require that you give us your name or any other personal data which could lead to your identification.

We hope that you will bear in mind that the mails we send cannot be personalized since we only have your e-mail and we also do not have information about your geographical location. Concerning this, it is possible that you receive e-mails with offers which do not concern you, or such with promotions which are during holidays not typical for your culture. Please, do not accept this as anything else than our wish to keep you up to date with as little personal information as possible.
