Cookies are small pieces of text that Internet sites store in your computer through your web browser. Their use started in the mid 90s, and at the moment Cookies represent one of the most globally used Internet technologies.  They cannot spread viruses or grant access to your hard disk though. Therefore, we cannot read any information stored in your hard disk even if it stores cookies as well.

The basic website functions rely on Cookies. Thanks to them, information and online ads are received which you will most probably find interesting or appropriate. On the other hand, with no Cookies you cannot shop online because Cookies are used for storing the items you select in your shopping cart.

The cookies used in Allcatalogues.co.za do not collect any of your personal information or any other kind of personal details, and they cannot cause any harm to your personal computer, tablet or mobile phone. We use Cookies to grant you optimal Internet use and, on the other hand, to enhance the efficiency and functionality of the website. This section of our privacy policy provides clear and comprehensive information on the Cookies we use as well as on the purposes we use them for.

**What information will be stored by a Cookie?**

  * The URL of the website it comes from;
  * Expiry of the Cookie or the period of time it will stay on your personal computer or phone;
  * Value – usually a randomly generated unique number.



How long do Cookies stay on your computer?
