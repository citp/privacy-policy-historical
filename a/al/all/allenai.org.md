By accessing and/or using the Site, you, the user ("you") are consenting to the collection, storage, and disclosure of data as described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Site.

AI2 reserves the right, at any time, to modify, alter, update, or remove portions of this Privacy Policy. We will post any changes to this Policy on this page so you can readily review the most current version. We will alert you that changes have been made by indicating on the bottom of this Privacy Policy the date it was last updated.

Your continued use of this Site constitutes your agreement to this Privacy Policy and any updates.

**Your IP Address**  
An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer every time you browse the Internet. When a user requests a page from the Site, our servers will log the user's current IP address. AI2 uses IP addresses to help diagnose problems with its servers and to administer the Site.

**Cookies**  
The Site is developed using Active Server Pages (ASP), and AI2 uses per-session "cookies" (pieces of data your browser stores in your computer's memory at AI2's request) to establish user sessions on our server. AI2 uses the cookies to carry information about usage from page to page through the Site. AI2 does not use cookies to retrieve personal information about you from your computer. Most browsers are set up to accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser settings to refuse them. If you disable cookies, your browser may experience some erratic behavior on some portions of the Site.

**Personal Information Collected**  
The Site does not automatically collect any personally identifiable information about its users. If at any time AI2 allows you to sign up to receive updates or newsletters from us via the Site or if you choose to send a submission to us through the Site, AI2 will ask you to provide personal information about yourself, including, without limitation your name and email address.
