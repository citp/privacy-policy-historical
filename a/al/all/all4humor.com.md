We do not sell, distribute or otherwise disseminate any information collected to any person or company.

We do collect standard web server log file information such as IP address, referring page data and files accessed.  
This information is for internal use only and used to gauge performance.

All4Humor.com uses cookies on some pages for the pop-up voting page. We did this so the pop-up doesn't show up EVERY time you visit the page, which would be very annoying.
