In assessing your application for credit, to prevent fraud, to check your identity and to prevent money laundering, the Company may search the files of credit reference agencies who will record any credit searches on your file.

The information will be used by other credit grantors for making credit decisions about you and the people with whom you are financially associated, for fraud prevention, money laundering prevention and occasionally for tracing debtors. Information used for these purposes will include publicly available information such as electoral roll, county court judgments, bankruptcy orders or repossessions.
