**Email AFD to a friend**  
'Email AFD to a friend' is a referral service, allowing customers to recommend AllFancyDress.com to a friend, and is a two-step process. First, a customer sends us the friend's name and email address, and secondly, we contact the friend, telling them who we are, and inviting them to visit our website. When we contact your friend, we always advise them of the name and email address of the friend who made the original referral. None of the information provided for this service is stored by us and we will not use you or your friends details for any other purpose. 

We may occasionally modify this Privacy Policy, such variations becoming effective immediately upon posting to the site and by continuing to use the site, you will be deemed to accept any such variations.
