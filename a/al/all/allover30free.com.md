**VIII.**     **Our Commitment to Data Security.**  

We take measures, including data encryption, to protect the transmission of all sensitive end-user information.  We make every effort to ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems.  Nevertheless, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent third-party ‘hackers’ from illegally obtaining this information.  We take all reasonable measures to prevent such breaches of security, but given the resourcefulness of cyber-criminals we are unable to guarantee that our security is 100% breach-proof.  You assume the risk of such breaches to the extent that they occur despite our reasonable security measures.

Further, we do not provide user information to third parties; nor will we sell, rent or provide any of your information to other entities such as advertisers, or other companies selling services similar to this COMPANY’s services
