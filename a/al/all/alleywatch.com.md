# Privacy Policy - AlleyWatch

Last modified December 3, 2012

The AlleyWatch name and reputation were built on a foundation of trust. This privacy policy describes the information AlleyWatch collects through the services available on our website (AlleyWatch.com) and other AlleyWatch owned or operated websites that link to this policy (collectively, the “Site”), and how we use that information. Our policy also describes the choices you can make about how we collect and use your information.

By using our services and viewing this Site, you are consenting to the information collection, use and disclosure practices described in this privacy policy.

### Privacy Policy Updates

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. When we do so, we will post the new privacy policy on this page and change the date at the top of the policy. Therefore, we encourage you to check the date of our privacy policy whenever you visit this Site for any updates or changes. If you have provided personal information to us, we will email you any modified versions of the privacy policy that might substantially affect the way we use or disclose your personal information. By providing such information, you agree to receive updates to the privacy policy via email.

If you have any questions about this privacy policy or have concerns that are not addressed here, please contact AlleyWatch Customer Relations.

 **Please note:** This site includes links to other websites, such as AlleyWriters.com  and other AlleyWatch websites. We provide these links as a courtesy to you and we do not have control over the operation of the websites, even though they may use the AlleyWatch name or logo. In addition, you may sign up for accounts on some of these websites. These websites have their own privacy and information security policy and terms and conditions and do not necessarily follow our privacy policy. Their policies will control their collection and use of your personal information. Visitors should consult the other websites’ privacy notices as we have no control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties. In addition, when you browse, they may place their own cookies on your computer and we do not control cookies placed on your computer by third parties whose advertising or links appear on our Site.

### International Users

If you are located outside of the United States, please note that this Site is hosted on our computer servers in the United States. Any personal information collected through this Site may be transferred to the United States and other countries that might not provide an equivalent level of protection as the data protection laws in your home country. Your use of this Site or submission of any personal information will therefore constitute your consent to the transfer of your personal information outside of your home country.

### Collection of Information

The provision of personal information to AlleyWatch means that you agree and consent that we may collect, use and share your personal information in accordance with this privacy policy.

In addition, where appropriate, specific authorizations or consents may be obtained from time to time. For example, we may seek consent to use and share personal information after it has been collected in those cases where AlleyWatch wishes to use the information for a purpose not previously identified or for which the individual concerned has not previously provided consent.

In most cases, and subject to legal and contractual restrictions, an individual is free to refuse or withdraw his or her consent at any time upon reasonable, advance notice. It should be noted that in some circumstances, certain AlleyWatch products and services can only be offered if a person provides personal information to AlleyWatch. If you choose not provide us with any required personal information, we may not be able to offer the products or services requested. We will inform you of the consequences of the withdrawal of consent.

### What Type of Information Does AlleyWatch Collect?

  * Employment-related information, such as may be found on resumes, applications, background verification information, or in employment references.



### Non-personal Information

Business contact information (e.g. office address, telephone number) is not considered personal information in certain jurisdictions.

We collect website use information which includes information about your internet service provider, browser type, domain name, IP address, the website that referred you to us, the webpages you request, the date and time of those requests, and entry and exit points.

Also, if you participate in any blog or other online forum on our Site, any personal information that you post on the website may be shared with other participants in the forum. In any of these situations, the recipient of the personal information may be located in the United States or another jurisdiction that may not provide an equivalent level of data protection to the laws in your home country.

In the event of a sale of some or all of our business, AlleyWatch may disclose personal information to those involved in a transfer of all or part of the assets or business. If such an event were to occur, AlleyWatch would strive to ensure that the recipient treat your personal information as described in this policy.
