# Privacy Policy - ALLKPOP.COM | Sizzlin' K-Pop Gossip and News

This statement covers the site allkpop.com (ALLKPOP). Please read this statement carefully before proceeding to access ALLKPOP. Your use of ALLKPOP indicates your agreement to abide by the Terms in effect. The Website is owned and operated by 6Theory Media. You can view our [Terms of Service (TOS) here](http://www.allkpop.com/index.php/tos).

**Website Visitors**

Like most website operators, AllKpop.com collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. AllKpop's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how AllKpop's visitors use its website. From time to time, AllKpop may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

AllKpop also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. AllKpop does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.

**Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information**

Certain visitors to 6theory Media websites choose to interact with AllKpop in ways that require AllKpop to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that AllKpop gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a account at AllKpop.com to provide a username and email address. In each case, AllKpop collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with AllKpop. AllKpop does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

**Aggregated Statistics**

AllKpop may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, AllKpop may monitor the comments / forum posts on the site or use spam screeners to help identify spam. AllKpop may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, AllKpop does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

**Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information**

AllKpop discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on AllKpop's behalf or to provide services available at 6theory's websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using 6theory's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. AllKpop will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, AllKpop discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when AllKpop believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of AllKpop, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an 6theory website and have supplied your email address, AllKpop may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with 6theory / AllKpop and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. AllKpop takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

AllKpop visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using 6theory's websites, with the drawback that certain features of 6theory's websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.
