On certain Sites, we may also collect from you information about your contacts, such as their email address, to share an article or other content.</p>
<p><em>Information from Third Parties</em>: We may also collect information about you from third parties, like credit reporting agencies or a social media site or a plug-in you use to log into or connect to this Site, and authorize to send us information from that social media account (e.g., name, age, photo).
