                        SIRVA provides you with a reasonable opportunity to access your Personal Information
                        we have collected, correct it if inaccurate, or delete it as appropriate, subject
                        to the exceptions stated below. Reasonable access means, for example, that requests
                        for access are made during normal business hours, that you provide requested identification,
                        and that requests are not excessive in number. If, at any time, SIRVA denies you
                        access to any Personal Information, we will provide you with reasons for denying
                        access and information about how you may make further inquiries. For instance, SIRVA
                        reserves the right to deny access to information related to investigations or potential
                        or actual litigation where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate
                        to the risks to the individual's privacy, or where the rights of other individuals
                        would be violated. In order to update your information, please send your request
