#### SAS 70 Type II

The SAS 70 audit is one of the most demanding certifications that a data center operator can undergo because it examines all aspects of the internal control system. Not only must the controls be present, they must also be documented and verified. Allsec is a SAS 70 Type II Certified organization since 2007 consistently maintaining the effectiveness and efficiency of the controls periodically evaluated bi-annually after they were placed in operation. This assures our clients that the control system is functioning properly and which tests, controls, or processes can be improved.

#### ISO 27001:2005

While PCI DSS and SAS 70 caters to strategic management of information & data security, at an operational level an information security additionally requires a hint of quality management to its control environment. Allsec, in realization of this fact, has implemented ISO 27001:2005 as an integrated management system of both quality and information security. Our environment of internal controls, across all of our accreditations undergoes not only the tight scrutiny through internal security audits but also quality process audits.
