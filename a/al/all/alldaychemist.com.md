**Information We Collect**

We recognize your right to confidentiality and are committed to protecting your privacy. We use the information that we collect on our site to provide you with a superior shopping experience.

**Your Personal Information**

When you place an order, we will ask you to set up "your account," which includes your name, e-mail address, mailing address, credit card number and expiration date, as well as certain other information when you order prescriptions. In addition, we ask that you indicate whether you would like to receive e-mail from alldaychemistt.com keeping you informed of new products or features. If you would like to review or revise the information we have in your account, you may access such information by clicking on the "your account" tab on any screen.

**Security**

When you place an order online at AllDayChemist.com, your personal information and credit card information are encrypted using SSL encryption technology before being sent over the Internet, making it virtually impossible for your information to be stolen or intercepted while being transferred to AllDayChemist.com. Your credit card information is always stored in encrypted form in a database that is away from our Web site database so it isn't connected to the Internet, and is therefore safe from hackers. 

**Your Comments**

We welcome your feedback. If you have questions or comments about our privacy policies, feel free to drop us an e-mail at [info@alldaychemist.com](mailto:info@alldaychemist.com)
