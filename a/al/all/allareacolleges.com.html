Please read this policy carefully before   sharing any of your personally identifiable information with us.</strong>        
          </p><p>Dual City Media goes   to great lengths to respect and protect your privacy. We promise that   we will not share your contact information to a college, university,   sponsor or advertiser without your express permission. We also promise   that we will take all reasonable precautions to prevent your personal   data from being accessed by unauthorized individuals.</p>
          <p>Because our services   require us to collect some fairly detailed personal and/or financial   information, we want you to have the information you need to make an   informed decision about sharing information with us. This Privacy Policy   will outline our practices and procedures we follow when handling information   input through our web site.</p>
          <h3><strong>1. Information   We Collect</strong></h3>
          <p>Information is collected   from our users at several different points during visits to AllAreaColleges.com.</p>
          <p><strong>Registration</strong> - A user must register in order to use this site. During the registration   process, a user is required to provide certain information, such as   name, address, e-mail address, date of birth, gender, country of citizenship,   educational background, grades, and extracurricular activities. In addition,   a user may choose to provide other information, such as intended major,   career objectives, hobbies and other interests. This information may   be updated and amended at any time after the initial registration. Dual   City Media encourages its users to provide these fields of information   so that users may maximize the effectiveness of our college search and   matching services. If the user will be applying for financial assistance,   certain financial and other information regarding the user's family   will also need to be provided.</p>
          <p><strong>Collection of Information   from Children</strong> - Dual City Media abides by federal law and the guidelines   set up by the Federal Trade Commission regarding youth privacy. As such,   Dual City Media will not knowingly collect any personal information   from or allow the registration of young people under the age of thirteen   (13) years.</p>
          <p><strong>Cookies and Web   Site Information</strong> - We use "cookie" technology and web   server logs to collect information about how our web site is used by   you. Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored by your web browser   on your hard drive. The cookies allow our web servers to recognize the   computer used by you to access our websites. Cookies allow you to move   from page to page on the website, by remembering the information about   the entire session.</p>
          <p>Information gathered   through cookies and by our web server logs may include the date and   time of visits, your IP address, the pages viewed, time spent at our   Web site, and the Web sites visited just before and just after our Web   site. This information may be appended to your personal information   provided by you to us to help us provide you with better service and   information. It also may be collected on an aggregate basis, and shared   with or collected by third-party Web analytics services to help Dual   City Media understand our users' aggregated Web site usage patterns   and related trends.</p>
          <p><strong>User Communications</strong> - When you send email or other communications to Dual City Media, we   may retain those communications in order to process, respond or improve   our services.</p>
          <p><strong>Chat Rooms and   Public Postings</strong> - The Dual City Media site may initially and/or   in the future contain chat rooms, public posting forums or one-to-one   communication forums permitting direct communications with other users.   Any information provided by you in these rooms or forum is deemed to   be information available to public viewing, not subject to any disclosure   restrictions or representations. We are not responsible for any information   posted and/or viewed in such portions of our website.</p>
          <h3><strong>2. Use of Information</strong></h3>
          <p>The information you   supply to Dual City Media enables us to provide the college search and   matching services which you select by matching your background to the   admission requirements and/or preferred student backgrounds of colleges   and universities. Participating colleges and universities may search   the non-personally identifiable information of users (such as grade   point averages or class standing, but not names or addresses) in order   to decide which users they are interested in having apply for admission.   Dual City Media will also recommend certain colleges and universities   to students, and we will use a similar methodology to select which students   should be informed of those opportunities. Under no circumstances will   we share any of your personally identifiable information with colleges   or universities without your consent. When a student appears to be a   viable candidate for admission, a notice will be placed in your message   in-box in the college center on our website, and we will send you an   email that may contain a link to your message in-box. Once you have   reviewed the notice in your message in-box, you may give us permission   to release your contact information to such college or university so   that they may directly contact you.</p>
          <p>In addition, Dual   City Media uses your information in order to customize our site to your   interests and enhance your overall experience. Dual City Media uses   various methods to recognize you, including requesting your e-mail address   and password before accessing our site. Once Dual City Media recognizes   you, pages, advertisements, including advertisements and offers in your   college center, and other content is customized for you so that you   can see what interests you the most. In addition, as described above,   Dual City Media utilizes passive information to learn more about how   you interact with our site. This passive information may be combined   with your other information for purposes such as testing and improving   your experience at our site and the compilation of broad aggregate demographic   data and related usage information for internal purposes and for disclosure   to third parties such as advertisers and content and Web analytics partners.   This aggregate passive information does not contain any personal information   which can identify any individual user.</p>
          <p><strong>Contacting You   by E-Mail</strong> - Dual City Media may use your contact information periodically   in order to send you e-mail regarding updates at the Dual City Media   site, such as new Dual City Media opportunities and additional listings   which may be of interest to you. The frequency of these messages will   vary depending upon your profile, including the types of colleges and   other activities you indicated having an interest in. Please note that   e-mail messages from third parties are not governed by the opt-out provisions   of this Privacy Policy.</p>
          <p><strong>Special Offers</strong> - We send all new users a welcoming email. Registered users will occasionally   receive information on products, services, special deals, or a newsletter.   Out of respect for the privacy, you may opt out of receiving these types   of communications such as these offers at any time by reaching us via   email, phone or standard mail at the contact information provided at   the bottom of this privacy policy.</p>
          <p><strong>Optional Information</strong> - At various other points during your visit to Dual City Media, you   may be asked to provide information about yourself. For example, you   may wish to participate in a survey or a contest, or apply to a scholarship.   Participation in surveys, contests or scholarships or the use of other   services which require the input of additional information is completely   voluntary on your part, and you have the choice about whether to disclose   the information necessary to use these features of our site. Contact   information will be used to process entries, send promotional material,   notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used   for purposes of monitoring or improving use of and satisfaction with   the Dual City Media site. Dual City Media may also conduct surveys on   behalf of colleges, universities and other parties in order to provide   them marketing and business information; provided however, none of your   personally identifiable information will be shared as part of such surveys   without your consent.</p>
          <p>Please be sure to   consult the official rules of any contest or sweepstakes you enter on   Dual City Media as specific data collection and usage practices may   vary by contest or sweepstakes.</p>
          <h3><strong>3. Sharing of Information</strong></h3>
          <p>Dual City Media will   not knowingly sell, share, rent or otherwise transfer your information   other than in accordance with the terms set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>
          <p><strong>Sharing Information   with Colleges and Universities</strong> - During the registration process,   and at certain points thereafter in connection with specific offers,   Dual City Media asks you whether information about you may be sent to   third parties, including colleges, universities and sponsors who have   products, services and opportunities which may be useful to you. Because   Dual City Media understands how important your information is to you,   we do not share any information that can identify you without your permission.   If you give your permission to allow third parties to contact you, personal   information about you (such as your contact information and other information   collected during your visit to Dual City Media) may be shared with colleges,   universities and other organizations. Regardless of your decision regarding   the sharing of your personal information, we reserve the right to share   aggregate demographic data and related usage information with our business   partners and university and college users. Such aggregate information   will not contain any personal information which can identify any individual   user.</p>
          <p><strong>Third Party Service   Providers</strong> - From time to time, Dual City Media may decide that it   is more efficient to use third parties to perform specific services,   such as sending newsletters to Dual City Media's users. If we use a   third party to provide specific services (such as sending newsletters   to our users on our behalf), then personally identifiable information   (such as contact information) may be shared with that party to the extent   necessary for such third party service provider to provide these services.   These third party service providers are only allowed to use personally   identifiable information only for the purpose of providing the specific   services requested by Dual City Media. These third party service providers   have agreed to hold and use your confidential information in accordance   with this Privacy Policy. The third party services covered by this paragraph   do not include links to third party sites found on our sites, which   are governed by a more specific provision (Links to Other Sites) below.</p>
          <p><strong>Links to Other   Sites</strong> - Dual City Media may present links to third party websites   in a format that enables us to keep track of where those links have   been followed. This Privacy Policy applies only to web sites and services   that are owned and operated by Dual City Media, LLC. As we do not control   other sites to which we may link, they are not subject to our Privacy   Policy. Please realize that we do not control the information provided   by you to any other third party site to which you may link from the   Dual City Media site.</p>
          <p><strong>Disclosure to Law   Enforcement and Similar Disclosures</strong> - Dual City Media reserves the   right to release personal information if required by law or in the good-faith   belief that such action is necessary or appropriate.</p>
          <p><strong>Sale or Merger</strong> - In the event that Dual City Media sells, assigns or transfers some   or all of its business to a successor or acquirer, Dual City Media may   sell, assign or transfer all of your information, regardless of your   opt status, to such successor or acquirer.</p>
          <h3><strong>4. Security</strong></h3>
          <p>Dual City Media has   security measures in place to help protect against the loss, misuse   and/or unauthorized alteration of the information you provide to us   or that we collect. You are the only user authorized to update your   profile, unless you provide your password information to another party.   We will assume that anyone who has the required login information and   password for your account is you, so please keep this information confidential.   Parents, guardians and counselors with whom you permit to have access   to your account will have their own login information and password,   and will not be permitted to alter your information or authorize the   release of your information.</p>
          <p>Dual City Media helps   protect personally identifiable information by utilizing both online   and offline security methods, including firewalls, passwords and restricted   physical access to the servers where your information is stored.
