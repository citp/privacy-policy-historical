> Privacy Policy**
> 
> Your privacy and safety on the Internet are important to us. As part of the operation of Allamericanguys.com or any sites operated by Z Productions Inc. of Florida ("ZPRO"), we gather certain types of information about ZPRO users, and we would like to explain the types of information we gather, what we do with it and how to correct or change the information.
> 
> INFORMATION COLLECTED BY ZPRO 
> 
> ZPRO collects two types of personally identifying information from users: personal data (such as names and e-mail addresses); and aggregated data (such as information about traffic patterns on ZPRO sites, for example how many users log into ZPRO sites on a daily basis).
> 
> PERSONAL DATA
> 
> Personal data is collected when users provide personal data to ZPRO, for example in registering for electronic newsletters or other membership services, in registering for online bulletin boards, in applying for online modeling opportunities, in answering surveys, purchasing items from ZPRO, and registering for contests and other promotional opportunities provided by ZPRO. Also, we collect the e-mail addresses of users who post messages to our message boards and chat areas.
> 
> AGGREGATED INFORMATION 
> 
> Aggregated information, such as which pages users access or visit and information volunteered by users, such as survey information and/or site registrations, is collected through various methods. For example, ZPRO sites collects IP addresses. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the Web. Web servers, the computers that "serve up" Web pages, automatically identify your computer by its IP address, and when you request a page from ZPRO sites, our servers may log your IP address. ZPRO does not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, so although your session may be logged, you will remain anonymous to us. Should ZPRO collect IP addresses, it is only for the purposes of system administration and to gather aggregate data about the volume of use on ZPRO. 
> 
> USE OF COOKIES
> 
> ZPRO sites also uses "cookies" to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that most major Web sites write to your hard drive for record keeping purposes when you visit them. Cookies allow ZPRO to measure activity on a particular ZPRO Site and to improve your user experience, for example by remembering your passwords and viewing preferences, thus allowing you to visit various member-only parts of the Site without re-registering. Cookies are used by ZPRO to measure activity on a particular ZPRO Site and make improvements and updates based on which areas are popular and which are not. ZPRO does not use cookies to retrieve information from your computer that was not originally sent in a cookie. Except for personal information voluntarily provided by you (i.e., during membership registration or a contest), ZPRO does not use information transferred through cookies for any promotional or marketing purposes, nor is that information shared with any third parties whatsoever. 
> 
> Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you'd prefer, you can set yours to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. However, it is possible that some parts of ZPRO Sites, such as member-only areas and shopping, will not function properly if you do so. 
> 
> USE OF INFORMATION COLLECTED BY ZPRO 
> 
> ZPRO uses both the personal and aggregated information we collect for multiple purposes. The information is used to improve the content of ZPRO Sites, to customize the content and/or layout of ZPRO Sites for each individual user and to notify users about updates to ZPRO Sites or promotional offers or opportunities that we believe will be of interest to you. 
> 
> Z Productions Inc. may also share information with consultants and affiliates for internal business purposes and may divulge personal information if such information is subpoenaed, or if ZPRO believes that any user has committed unlawful acts, to acts that endanger the health or safety of another user or of the general public. In some situations, we will share your personal information, on a confidential basis, with third parties who perform a particular service on our behalf, such as sending e-mails. Also, ZPRO may be sold or transferred to another entity. Should such an event occur, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets. 
> 
> In addition, in the event ZPRO plans to post any personal information on the Site, ZPRO will either notify you of this possibility when you provide the information and/or, if possible, when the information is posted. Occasionally, we may post the name of a user (for example a contest winner) on one of our sites. ZPRO will notify you of this possibility when you provide your information or, if possible, will notify you when the information is posted. 
> 
> MESSAGE BOARDS AND CHAT ROOMS
> 
> Please remember that information posted to message boards and chat areas becomes public information. Use caution when posting. Users under the age of 18 should be especially careful not to provide any personally identifying information while using chat rooms or message boards. Users of ZPRO chat rooms and message boards must follow acceptable standards of behavior when posting messages online. ZPRO encourages parents and guardians to spend time with their children online, and to be fully familiar with the sites visited by their children. At various places on ZPRO sites, ZPRO will ask whether users are under the age of 18, for example when requesting personal information from users, or ZPRO may ask for parental consent. However, while ZPRO requests this information or permission, ZPRO relies on users to be truthful in responding to these questions.
