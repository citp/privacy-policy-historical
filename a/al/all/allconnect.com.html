				<p><a name="a" id="a"></a><b>What Are The Important Terms Used
				Throughout This Privacy Policy?</b></p>
				<p>Throughout this privacy policy we use several specialized terms. 
				"Personally Identifiable Information" is information that tells us 
				specifically who you are, like your name, street address, birth date, 
				email address, billing address, social security number, and credit 
				card number. "User Information" means all Personally Identifiable 
				Information and any other forms of information discussed in this privacy 
				policy, including the Internet Protocol (IP) address of a user's computer. 
				We use the term "aggregate" when we combine information from various 
				persons or users. Information is said to be "anonymized" if it does not 
				identify individual persons or entities or associate a particular person 
				or entity with such information.</p>
			
				<p><a name="b" id="b"></a><b>What Types Of Information Do We
				Collect, How Do We Use it and To Whom Do We Disclose It?</b></p>
			
				<p>Visiting Our Site. When you visit our website to browse, we may 
				collect and store the domain name and host from which you access the 
				Internet (e.g., aol.com), the IP address of your computer, your browser 
				software and operating system and your entity identification. We may 
				use this information to organize and analyze IP addresses so that we 
				can provide items such as efficient service, enhance security, monitor 
				appropriate usage and produce traffic volume statistics. This type of 
				non-Personally Identifiable information may be shared with third parties, 
				such as when we aggregate and disclose site traffic information for 
				marketing and commercial purposes. When you visit our website, you may 
				also choose certain options such as (i) Your Account, (ii) About 
				Allconnect, (iii) Bundles, Phone, TV, Internet, Utilities and Home 
				Service, (iv) Customer Service and (v) Contact Us to obtain more 
				information about us, our business associates and our Services. Through 
				these options, you may provide us with Personally Identifiable 
				Information. We will collect, use and disclose such Personally 
				Identifiable Information as further described below in Using Our Services.</p>
			
				<p>Using Our Services. When you use our Services, you must through our 
				initial registration process or subsequent order placements provide 
				Personally Identifiable Information, including your name, address, e-mail 
				address, and billing information for you to properly and fully receive 
				the offered Services. We collect and store this Personally Identifiable 
				Information and any modifications that either we or you make to that information, 
				except that we do not permanently retain your social security number, credit 
				card number or other payment information needed solely for the processing of your 
				order. Except as set forth in this policy, we will not reveal any such Personally 
				Identifiable Information to any third party without the consent of the provider of 
				such information, except that we may share User Information with our business 
				associates who assist us in administering the Services. In such cases, the business 
				associates are permitted to use this information only in order to carry out the 
				services Allconnect has contracted for. Furthermore, we may use, disclose or 
				transfer certain User Information (i) to provide you the Services or information 
				you request; (ii) to send you additional information about your ordered services 
				such as a confirmation, reminder, problem status or change order; (iii) to send you 
				a newsletter or other marketing materials; (iv) to protect the confidentiality or 
				security of your records; (v) to comply with government requests if appropriate for 
				your protection or in connection with an investigation or prosecution of possible 
				unlawful activity; (vi) in connection with a sale or merger of Allconnect, or (vii) 
				for other legally permissible purposes. We may also share aggregate anonymized data 
				relating to the transactions on the site and use of the Services for marketing, 
				research and other purposes.</p>
			
				<p>From time to time, we may send you survey forms or include survey forms on our 
				site asking you for information regarding your use of our Services. For the most 
				part, we will only disclose your survey responses that contain anonymized data to 
				our business associates who assist us in administering the Services. However, we 
				may share email addresses with business associates who assist us in administering 
				the Services.</p>
			
				<p><a name="c" id="c"></a><b>What Information May Be Collected By Third Parties?</b></p>
				<p>When accessing our website or Services, you may have the option to obtain a 
				coupon or purchase products and services from a third party through our website. 
				For example, when you sign up to initiate service to your home by a utility or other 
				service provider under Your Account, Allconnect passes the Personally Identifiable 
				Information needed for that service on to the third party utility or service provider. 
				Please pay close attention when you obtain a coupon or are purchasing products and 
				services from a third party because different rules may apply to those parties' use or 
				disclosure of such information regardless of their affiliation or relationship with us. 
				This privacy policy only addresses the use and disclosure of User Information collected 
				by us and not third parties from whom you may obtain a coupon or purchase products and 
				services.</p>

				third party website, the owners of that website may use and disclose your information 
				in accordance with their own privacy policy, and you may begin receiving emails from such 
				third party. We have no responsibility or liability for the independent actions or policies 
				of these independent sites, and are not responsible for the content, terms or privacy 
				practices of such sites. In order to protect your Personally Identifiable Information, you 
				may wish to first review the privacy policies of any third party from whom you obtain 
				coupons, products or services on our website, or before providing any information on a 
				third party website.</p>

Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us provide a better user experience by continually learning and adjusting to what our visitors find useful.  Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.  This allows us to see which pages are most visited on our site, so we can continue to provide useful content to our visitors.

We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information.  Clear gifs are strictly a means to learn more about which pages our customers find effective and which pages are not offering a good user experience.</p>

				collection and use of your Personally Identifiable Information as described 
				in this privacy policy and other written documentation provided to you

				communications from such third parties.</p>
				
				<p><a name="f" id="f"></a><b>How Do We Protect Your Information?</b></p>
				<p>We employ and maintain technology and security measures designed to protect User 
				Information. When you submit sensitive information via our site, that information is subject

				transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed as 100% secure. As a result, while we strive

				you transmit to us or receive from us.</p>

				To subsequently sign-in as a member, you will need to enter your correct member ID and password.

				any member ID or passwords to any unauthorized person, or permit any unauthorized person to use 
				your accounts or related member ID or passwords except as specifically permitted by this privacy 
				policy or other instructions regarding the Services. Moreover, we will never ask for your member 
				ID or password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited email.</p>

				notify us so that we may issue you a new member ID or password. Any loss of control of your member 
				ID or password may result in the loss of control over Personally Identifiable Information. If you 
				fail to protect your member ID or password, then you will be responsible for any actions taken on 
				your behalf or by any person using your member ID or password.</p>
