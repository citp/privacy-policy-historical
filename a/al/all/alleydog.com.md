### User-Provided Information  
  
We may collect Personal Information from users, for example, through such user's activities, transactions and completion of surveys and other online forms on our Web Site.

Security  
AlleyDog.com will take steps to protect the security and integrity of all sensitive Personal Information provided to us. However, due to the inherent nature of the Internet as an open global communications vehicle, we cannot guarantee that information, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our system or otherwise in our care, will be safe from intrusion by others, such as hackers.  
If you contact us by e-mail or a "contact us" or similar feature on our Web Site, your transmission might not be secure. A third party could view information you send by these methods in transit.  
You may be able to create an account on our Web Site with a username and password. If so, you are responsible for protecting your account password, and you are responsible for any access to or use of the Web Site by you or any person or entity using your password, whether or not such access or use has been authorized by or on behalf of you.  
In the unlikely event that we believe that the security of your Personal Information in our possession or control may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you of that development. If a notification is appropriate, we would endeavor to do so as promptly as possible under the circumstances, and, to the extent we have your e-mail address, we may notify you by e-mail. You consent to our use of e-mail as a means of such notification. If you prefer for us to use another method to notify you in this situation, please e-mail us at support@alleydog.com.
