In addition, Alljobsfilled.com may indirectly collect information about you when you use certain third party services on our Web site. Such information may be used for the purpose of determining your potential interest in additional services offered by our third party partners.

Alljobsfilled.com may sometimes afford you the opportunity to provide descriptive, cultural, behavioral, preferential and/or life style information about yourself, but it is solely up to you whether you furnish such information. For example, such information may be used for the purpose of determining your potential interest in receiving email or other communications about particular products or services.

Disclosure of Information to Others

We do not disclose to third parties your personal information, combined personal and demographic information or information about your use of the Alljobsfilled.com Web site (such as the areas you visit or the services you access), except as set forth in the following four subparagraphs.

  * We may disclose such information to third parties if you consent to such disclosure. For example, if you indicate that you would like to receive information about the products or services of third parties at the time you register for an AutomotiveJobFinder account, we may supply your contact information to third parties such as employers, recruiters, data aggregators, marketers or others for the purpose of sending you e-mail or otherwise communicating with you. We may use data we have about you (such as the interests and preferences you have expressed) to determine whether you might be interested in the products or services of a particular third-party.
  * We may disclose such information to companies and individuals we employ to perform functions on our behalf. Examples may include hosting our Web servers, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. These companies and individuals will have access to your personal information as necessary to perform their functions, but they may not share that information with any other third party.
  * We may disclose such information if legally required to do so, if requested to do so by a governmental entity or if we believe in good faith that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process; (b) protect the rights or property of Alljobsfilled.com or its affiliated companies; (c) prevent a crime or protect national security; or (d) protect the personal safety of users or the public.
  * We may disclose and transfer such information to a third party who acquires all or a substantial portion of Alljobsfilled.com's business, whether such acquisition is by way of merger, consolidation or purchase of all or a substantial portion of our assets. In addition, in the event Alljobsfilled.com becomes the subject of a bankruptcy proceeding, whether voluntary or involuntary, Alljobsfilled.com or its trustee in bankruptcy may sell, license or otherwise dispose of such information in a transaction approved by the bankruptcy court.



Alljobsfilled.com may also share aggregated anonymous information about visitors to its Web site with its clients, partners and other third parties so that they may understand the kinds of visitors that visit Alljobsfilled.com's site and how those visitors use the site. 

Information gathered on a page in a career site hosting recruitment area, or on a co-branded page (such as that of a contest co-sponsored by Alljobsfilled.com and another company), may become the property of the other company or of both Alljobsfilled.com and the other company. In that instance, the use of such information by the other company may be subject to the privacy policy of that company and, in any event, Alljobsfilled.com is not responsible for that company's use of your personal or demographic information.

resumes

Since Alljobsfilled.com is a career site, we give you the option of putting your resume in our database. There are two ways of doing this:

  * You can store your resume in our database, but not allow it to be searchable by potential employers. Not allowing your resume to be searchable means that you can use it to apply for a job online, but employers and recruiters will not have access to search it through our resume database product.
  * If you allow your resume to be searchable, then all parties with access to our searchable resume database (or copies thereof) will have access to your resume. 



In addition, you can also elect to make your resume confidential which means that your contact info and current employer will be not be displayed to all parties with access to our searchable resume database.

We attempt to limit access to our searchable resume database (or copies thereof) only to paying employers, recruiters, hiring managers, headhunters, and human resource professionals, as well as law enforcement and national security agencies, but cannot guarantee that other parties will not gain access to this database. We are not responsible for the use made of resumes by third parties who access such resumes while they are in our searchable database. You may remove your resume from our database at any time. However, employers, recruiters and others who have paid for access to that database or to obtain a copy of that database, as well as parties who have otherwise gained access to the database, may have retained a copy of your resume in their own files or databases. We are not responsible for the retention, use or privacy of resumes in these instances.
