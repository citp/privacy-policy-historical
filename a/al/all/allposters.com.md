### What personal information do we collect

### What personal information do we collect

_Information you provide to us_

Our online services may ask you to provide personal information voluntarily: for example, we ask you to provide your name, contact details and payment details in order to purchase a printed product from us or to set up an online account, or your email address to sign up to receive a newsletter and/or to submit enquiries to us.

The personal information that you are asked to provide, and the reasons why you are asked to provide it, will be made clear to you at the point we ask you to provide your personal information.

_Information that we collect automatically_

When you use our online services, we may collect certain information automatically from your device. Specifically, the information we collect automatically may include information like your IP address, browser-type, the URL of the previous web site you visited, your ISP, operating system and other technical information. We may also collect information about how your device has interacted with our online services, including the pages accessed and links clicked.

Collecting this information enables us to better diagnose problems with our server and to administer our online services, as well as understand the visitors who use our online services, where they come from, and what content is of interest to them. This information aids us in merchandising and in developing the design, layout and functionality of the online services. Some of this information may be collected using cookies and similar tracking technology, as explained further on our 'Cookies and similar tracking technology' page.

### What we do with your personal information

Under no circumstances do we rent, trade or share your e-mail address with any other company for their marketing purposes without your consent. We may use the information we collect through our online services for a number of reasons, including to:

  * provide, operate, optimize and maintain the online services and our products and services;
  * process, fulfill and provide updates on orders;
  * set up online accounts;
  * where it is in accordance with your preferences send you marketing communications we think you'll find valuable, and if you take advantage of special offers made by our marketing partners, send your details to our marketing partners (with your consent);
  * provide customer support, deal with your online enquiries and requests, and to provide you with information and access to resources or services that you have requested from us;
  * to improve our ability to serve you relevant ads across the Internet for products that will be more interesting to you, we may provide your personal information to our advertising agents that use your information solely for our advertising purposes. You may, from time to time, receive information (including by email or postal mail) from us about new features, new services and special offers we think you'll find valuable;
  * improve the layout, navigation and content of our Website;
  * identify any server problems or other IT or network issues;
  * compile aggregated statistics about customer traffic patterns and site usage to better understand the preferences of our visitors; and
  * carry out other legitimate business purposes, such as to improve our products and services, as well as other lawful purposes about which we will notify our users and clients.



We will only process personal information in ways that are compatible with the purpose we collected it for, or for the purposes you later authorize. Before we use your personal information for a purpose that is materially different than the purpose we collected it for or that you later authorized, we will provide you with the opportunity to opt-out.

### Who we share information with

We may share and disclose your personal information to other third parties in the following circumstances:

  * Within the Allposters.com group of companies for the purposes outlined in this Notice
  * To vendors and other third-party service providers who require access to your personal information to assist in the provision of the online services, our products and services, and other business-related functions. For example, we partner with one or more credit card processing companies to assist us in processing your payment. We partner with third parties that offer credit checks services that review credit worthiness of certain users to manage our risk and help us to avoid sending out orders to users that cannot afford to pay. We may also work with third party service providers to assist us providing targeted email campaigns, assemble and prepare personalized offers and/or make particular product or purchase recommendations. However, those companies do not retain, share, store, or use personal information for any secondary purposes.
  * We may also disclose your personal information to third parties: (a) where required by law or regulatory requirement, court order or other judicial authorization, (b) in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including for the purposes of meeting national security and law enforcement requirements; (c) in connection with the sale, transfer, merger, bankruptcy, restructuring or other reorganization of a business; (d) to protect or defend our rights, interests or property, or that of third parties; (e) to investigate any wrongdoing in connection with the online services or our services; (f) to protect the vital interests of an individual.
  * To an actual or potential buyer (and its agents and advisers) in connection with any actual or proposed purchase, merger or acquisition of any part of our business, provided that we inform the buyer it must use your personal information only for the purposes disclosed in this Privacy Notice;
  * To any other person with your consent.



### Cookies and similar tracking technology

Like all e-commerce web sites, we use 'cookies'. Cookies are bits of information that are stored on your computer by your web browser. Although our cookies don't store any of your personal information, they do allow us to do things like keep items in your shopping cart between visits or during the same visit or provide you with a more personalized user experience.

Whether you want your web browser to accept cookies or not is up to you. The 'Help' portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to be notified when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. You can also disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-ons settings or visiting the website of its manufacturer.

However, because cookies allow you to take advantage of some of features and services, we recommend that you leave them turned on. For instance, if you block our cookies, you will not be able to add items to your cart, proceed to checkout, or use any services that require you to sign in. If you have not changed your computer's settings, most likely your browser already accepts cookies.

We use a third-party service provider to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet and sometimes on our online services. They may collect anonymous information about your use of our online services, and your interaction with our products and services. They may also use information about your visits to this and other Web sites to target advertisements for goods and services.

This anonymous information is collected by a pixel tag, which is industry standard technology used by most major web sites. No personal information is collected or used in this process. They do not know your name, phone number, address, email address, or any personally identifying information about the user. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this anonymous information used by our third party service provider, please visit our '[About our Ads](https://web.archive.org/help/ads.html)' page. You can also read more about online marketing practices and the technologies that support them by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative's website by clicking [here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/).

### International data transfers

Your personal information may be stored and processed by us in any country where we have facilities or where we engage service providers, and your personal information may therefore be transferred to countries outside of your country of residence, including the U.S., which may have different data protection rules to those of your country. Where we do so, our collection, storage and use of your personal information will be in accordance with the purposes set out in this Notice.

Specifically, we may transfer your personal and non-personal information to Allposters.com, Inc. for processing and storage in the U.S.

### How we protect your information

The security of your personal information is very important to us.

When you enter sensitive information such as a credit card number on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). For purchases made online with credit cards, we store your credit card number in encrypted form for a limited amount of time, and our employees do not have access to this information. We do not store PIN data or 3-digit security codes.

We use appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect your personal information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

### Your data protection rights & choices

You have the following rights:

  * If you wish to **access, correct, update or request deletion** of your personal information, you can do so at any time by contacting us using the contact details provided under 'How to contact us' heading below. You can correct many of the details in your account by logging in to your account.
  * You have the **right to complain to a data protection authority** we send you at any time. You can exercise this right by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link in the marketing e-mails we send you. Alternatively, please contact us at [privacy@art.com](mailto:privacy@art.com). Please include your complete name, e-mail address and mailing address. Note that it may take up to three business days to remove you from our marketing lists and after this point you may still receive customer service related communications from us.



We respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws. For additional information regarding your choices, please visit our [About our Ads](https://web.archive.org/help/ads.html) page.

### How we link to other websites

Our online services contain links to websites, third party plug-ins (such as social media sharing buttons) operated by other companies. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other websites. We encourage you to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy notices of such other websites. This Notice applies solely to information collected by our online services and through your other interactions with Allposters.com.

### Data retention

We will retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this Notice unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law, for legal, tax or regulatory reasons, or other lawful purposes.

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

### Children's privacy

Our services are intended for users ages 18 and older. Accordingly, we will not knowingly collect or use any personal information from persons that we know to be under the age of 18. In addition, we will delete any information in our database that we know originates from a child under the age of 18.

### Changes to our Privacy Policy

If we change our Privacy Policy, we will post a new version on our Website, which will become effective when posted. The new policy will apply to all current and past users of the online services and will replace any prior policies that are inconsistent with it. We encourage you to check this page regularly to ensure you are up to date with any changes.
