# SparkCityWorld.com - Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy was last updated on June **2014**.

This Privacy Policy is designed to provide transparency into our privacy practices and principles. We are dedicated to treating your personal information with care and respect. 

This Privacy Policy applies to our Sites (defined below) and to our Mobile Apps or Apps (defined below) provided by Fuel Industries, Inc. and its subsidiaries in the U.S. ( **collectively** , **"Fuel Industries"** , **"we"** , **"our"** , or **"us"** ). This Privacy Policy governs your use of our Sites and Apps, regardless of how you access or use them. By "Sites", we mean www.sparkcityworld.com, www.allgirlarcade.com, and any affiliated website on which this Privacy Policy is posted, and including all services, features, applications, content, and downloads that are offered and operated by us, and that are available through our websites. By "Mobile Apps" and "Apps", we mean our products and services that we make available via mobile telecommunication platforms and/or through social networking platforms or App stores, and on which this Privacy Policy is posted. Each time you access and/or use the Sites or Apps, you agree to be bound by and comply with all of the terms of this Privacy Policy. Therefore, do not use the Sites or Apps if you do not agree to all of the terms of this Privacy Policy. 

This Privacy Policy explains what personal information we collect about you when you use the Sites or Apps, how the information will be used, with whom we share your information, and how you can control the collection, use and sharing of your information or update your information. This Privacy Policy does not apply to information we collect by other means (including offline) or from other sources. 

Your use of the Sites and Apps are also governed by our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/web/20141122141344id_/http://www.allgirlarcade.com/privacypolicy/%3C?=URL_TERMS?%3E) into which this Privacy Policy is incorporated by reference. 

**Notice to Parents and Legal Guardians**

Fuel Industries and this Privacy Policy adhere to the requirements of the U.S. Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 ("COPPA") and the guidelines of the Children's Advertising Review Unit ("CARU") of the Council of Better Business Bureaus, Inc. in our Sites, online services and Apps directed to children under 13. Wherever we refer to "children" or a "child" in this Privacy Policy, we mean children under 13. Whenever we refer to "kids," we mean generally users who are underage minors. 

Our Sites and Apps offer various services directed at kids and their families, and therefore may involve the collection of children’s personal information. Upon registration, we ask users to provide a username and password, age, and a parent’s email address. We will use a parent’s email address for the purpose of providing a user’s parent with notice of information relating to this Privacy Policy and to obtain consent where required; and we will not use the parent’s email address for marketing purposes, unless the parent has consented to receiving marketing information (such as newsletters) from us. 

Consent from a child’s parent or legal guardian is required for the collection, use and disclosure of personal information about a child, and we describe below how and when we will seek parental consent. We also explain below the type of information we collect, how we use and share the information we collect, and your ability to review, edit and delete personal information collected by us. In any instance that we collect personal information from a child, we will retain that information only so long as reasonably necessary to allow the child the ability to participate in an activity or to use our services offered through the Sites or Apps, and to ensure the security of our users and our services, or as required by law. In the event we discover we have collected information from a child in a manner inconsistent with COPPA, we will either delete the information or immediately seek the parent’s or legal guardian’s consent for that collection. Please also help us protect your children's privacy by instructing them never to provide personal information (like their full name, email address, home address, telephone number, etc.) without your permission. 

**Notice to Kids**

We strongly encourage all kids to get parental permission to access or use our Sites and Apps. If you are under 13, you are required to get your parent's or legal guardian's permission before giving out your contact information, like email address or phone number, or any other personal information, to us or to anyone else.

### Children Under the Age of 13

We take many special precautions to protect the privacy of children under 13. Through our Sites and Apps intended for use by children, we do not collect personal information (like first and last name, email address, phone number or home address, and persistent identifiers such as an IP address) from children without verifiable consent of a parent or legal guardian, except in limited circumstances authorized by law. We also take steps to prevent children from posting or publicly disclosing personal contact information. 

When a child seeks to register with us through our Sites or Apps, we collect the following information: age, username, password and parent's email address (to be used for obtaining consent, as set forth above in the section "Notice to Parents and Legal Guardians"). 

In addition, we may ask all users to voluntarily provide personal information and we may collect other information (like IP address, mobile device UDID/device identifier, operating system, etc.) automatically and use technology like cookies to provide functionality and support our operations. Please refer to the section "What Information is Collected?" below for a further explanation of the type of information we collect from all users, including children. In instances where we collect information from a child, we do not ask for more personal information than is necessary for a child to participate in an activity. 

**Verifiable Parental Consent**

In circumstances where we seek parental consent, we will send an email to the parent or legal guardian of a child to and provide the applicable parent or legal guardian with a "Direct Notice" as required under COPPA, notifying the type of personal information that may be collected from the child and how such information may be used and/or disclosed by us, and obtain verifiable consent from the parent or legal guardian. The Direct Notice will provide directions that the parent is required to follow in order to provide us with consent to the collection, use and/or disclosure of the child’s personal information, and instructions on how the parent can revoke such consent. 

Specifically, Direct Notice to the parent or legal guardian will contain a link to this Privacy Policy and explain the following: (i) that we have obtained the parent’s email address in order to obtain the parent’s consent; (ii) the purposes for which we are seeking to collect personal information from the parent’s child; (iii) that the parent’s consent is required for the child’s use of our Sites or Apps, and that we will not collect, use or disclose any personal information from the child if the parent does not provide such consent; (iv) the potential items of personal information we intend to collect from the child if the parent provides consent; (v) how the parent can provide verifiable consent to collection, use, and disclosure of the child’s personal information; and (vi) that we will delete the parent’s email address from our records if the parent does not provide consent within a reasonable time from the date the notice was sent. 

A parent or legal guardian may consent to our use of a child’s personal information without also consenting to the disclosure of the child’s personal information to third parties other than our Service Providers. You may contact us at _[customersupport@fuelindustries.com](mailto:customersupport@fuelindustries.com)_ to request that we do not disclose the use of your child’s personal information to these third parties, or to update or delete your child’s information. 

In the event that we change our policy with respect to the collection of personal information from children, or if new features, contests or sweepstakes which a child wishes to use or participate in require the provision of personal information, their parent or guardian will be notified and will be required to give their consent to the collection and use of this information and/or be given the option to opt out of participation.

### What Information is Collected

We collect two basic types of information - personal information and anonymous information - and we may use personal and anonymous information to create a third type of information, aggregate information. We collect the following categories of information from all users: 

  * Information you provide when you create an account, including your first name and surname, country of residence, gender, date of birth, email address, username and password. We also collect a parent’s email address but do not collect the child’s own email address. Users may also have the opportunity to upload a profile picture or personal video. 
  * Transaction information you provide when you request information or purchase a product or service from us, whether on our Sites or through our Apps, including your postal address, telephone number and payment information. However, we do not store credit card or debit card account numbers or other billing information, which are stored by our third party payment partners, including iTunes and Playspam, and we encourage you to visit their websites and review their privacy policies.
  * Information you provide in public forums on our Sites or Apps.
  * Information and communications sent either one-to-one or within a limited group using our message, chat, post or similar functionality, where we are permitted by law to collect this information.

  * Location information when you visit our Sites or use our Apps, including location information either provided by a mobile device (such as geolocation data) interacting with one of our Sites or Apps, or associated with your IP address, where we are permitted by law to process this information. We will not collect geolocation data or any other location information from children without first obtaining verifiable parental consent.
  * Usage, viewing and technical data when you open emails we send, visit our Sites, and use our online services and Apps including on third-party sites or platforms. We also collect persistent identifiers such as unique device identifiers (UIDs), cookies that identify your computer or network, and IP address.

### How is Information Collected?

We collect information about you that you provide voluntarily (such as by registering and creating an account with us, or by communicating with us through any means), and information that is automatically collected through the use of tracking mechanisms and other technology. We may also acquire information from third party sources to update or supplement the information you provided or we collected automatically. You may be required to authorize the third party to share your information with us before we can acquire it. 

**Cookies and Technology**

Cookies and web beacons: Our Sites and Apps use technology, such as cookies, Flash cookies (also known as local shared objects), and web beacons that track information about you, including when you visit our Sites and Apps or use our applications on third-party websites or platforms, to manage registrations or access to certain features, store your settings and preferences, conduct age-screening, offer you personalized content, shop, help us understand the features that appeal to visitors, and manage advertising, among other things. 

Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies but visitors always have the option of disabling cookies and you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, if you refuse cookies, you may be limited in your ability to access and/or use our services, content, and features. 

The use of cookies and web beacons by third parties is not covered by this Privacy Policy. We do not have access or control over tracking technologies used by third parties. 

Do Not Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms: Certain web browsers enable users to transmit "do-not-track" signals to websites. We adhere to the standards set out in this Privacy Policy but we do not take any specific action in response to these signals. We may reassess how we respond to these signals as industry standards evolve.

Our Sites and Apps may link to third party websites, whose privacy and data collection practices may differ from ours. We also work with third parties who offer analytics or deliver targeted ads through our Sites and Apps. These third party websites, advertisers, or companies working on their behalf may use cookies, web beacons and other tracking mechanisms to collect certain information about you and/or your computer network (such as your IP address, mobile UDID or other device identifier, and information about your activities) over time and across different websites, to provide targeted or personalized content or advertising (also referred to sometimes as online behavioral advertising or interest-based advertising). We do not have access or control over the tracking mechanisms used by these third parties. You are encouraged to review the privacy policies of the different websites you visit. 

Our partners include Tapjoy, Inc. (http://home.tapjoy.com) and AdColony/Jirbo, Inc. (http://adcolony.com).
