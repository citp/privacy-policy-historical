 <h1 class="infotitL">Privacy Policy</h1>
 <p class="titilesub greylight">Last Updated: April 2014</p>
 </div>
 <div class="acell">
 <p>
 <strong>General Scope</strong>
 </p>
 <p>This policy covers personally identifiable information
 collected or stored by Readable on its servers in relation to the
 Projects and their communities. Consistent with its Data
 Retention Policy, Readable collects and retains the least amount
 of personally identifiable information needed to fulfill the
 Projects' operational needs.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="acell">
 <h3 class="apage">The public and collaborative nature of the
 projects</h3>
 <p>All Readable Services are collaboratively developed by its
 users using the Readable software. Anyone with Internet access
 (and not otherwise restricted from doing so) may edit the
 publicly editable transcript pages of these sites after logging
 in as a registered user using their Facebook or Google+ login
 credentials. By doing this, editors create a published document,
 and a public record of every word added, subtracted, or changed.
 This is a public act, and editors are identified publicly as the
 author of such changes. All contributions made to a Project, and
 all publicly available information about those contributions, are
 irrevocably licensed and may be freely copied, quoted, reused and
 adapted by third parties with few restrictions. &nbsp;</p>
 </div>
 <div class="acell">
 <h3 class="apage">Activities on Readable projects</h3>
 <p>In general, this Policy only applies to private information
 stored or held by Readable which is not publicly available.</p>
 <p>Interactions with the Projects not covered by this Policy
 include, but are not limited to, aspects of browsing and editing
 pages. These interactions may reveal a contributor's IP address,
 and possibly other personal information, indiscriminately to the
 general public, or to specific groups of volunteers acting
 independently of Readable.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="acell">
 <h3 class="apage">User accounts and authorship</h3>
 <p>Readable does not require editors to create a Readable
 account in order to edit a project. Anyone can edit a page by
 logging in using their Facebook or Google+ login credentials.
 Users that login are identified by their Facebook or Google+
 username, and by their network IP address.&nbsp;</p>
 </div>
 <div class="acell">
 <h3 class="apage">Purpose of the collection of private
 information</h3>
 <p>Readable limits the collection of personally identifiable
 user data to purposes which serve the well-being of its projects,
 including but not limited to the following:</p>
 <ul class="alist1">
<li>To enhance the public accountability of the projects.
 Readable recognizes that any system that is open enough to allow
 the greatest possible participation of the general public will
 also be vulnerable to certain kinds of abuse and
 counterproductive behavior. Readable and the project communities
 have established a number of mechanisms to prevent or remedy
 abusive activities. For example, when investigating abuse on a
 project, including the suspected use of malicious “sockpuppets”
 (duplicate accounts), vandalism, harassment of other users, or
 disruptive behavior, the IP addresses of users (derived either
 from those logs or from records in the database) may be used to
 identify the source(s) of the abusive behavior. This information
 may be shared by users with administrative authority who are
 charged by their communities with protecting the projects.</li>
 <li>To provide site statistics. Readable statistically
 samples raw log data from users' visits. These logs are used to
 produce the site statistics pages; the raw log data is not made
 public.</li>
 <li>To solve technical problems. Log data may be examined by
 developers in the course of solving technical problems and in
 tracking down badly-behaved web spiders that overwhelm the site.</li>
 </ul>
</div>
 <div class="acell">
 <h4 class="atitin">Details of data retention</h4>
 <h4 class="atitin">General expectations</h4>
 <h4 class="atitin">IP and other technical information</h4>
 <p>When a visitor requests or reads a page, or sends email to
 a Readable server, no more information is collected than is
 typically collected by web sites. The Readable may keep raw logs
 of such transactions, but these will not be published or used to
 track legitimate users. When a page is edited by a logged-in
 editor, the server confidentially stores related IP information
 for a limited period of time. This information is automatically
 deleted after a set period.</p>
 <h4 class="atitin">Cookies</h4>
 <p>The sites set a temporary session cookie on a visitor's
 computer whenever a Project page is visited. Readers who do not
 intend to log in or edit may deny this cookie; it will be deleted
 at the end of the browser's session. More cookies may be set when
 one logs in to maintain logged-in status.&nbsp;</p>
 <h4 class="atitin">Page history</h4>
 <p>Edits or other contributions to a Project on its
 transcripts are generally retained forever. Removing text from a
 project does not permanently delete it. Normally, in projects,
 anyone can look at a previous version of a transcript and see
 what was there. Even if a transcript is "deleted", a user
 entrusted with higher level of access may still see what was
 removed from public view. Information can be permanently deleted
 by individuals with access to Readable servers, but aside from
 the rare circumstance when Readable is required to delete
 editing-history material in response to a court order or
 equivalent legal process, there is no guarantee any permanent
 deletion will happen.</p>
 <h4 class="atitin">Reading projects</h4>
 <p>No more information on users and other visitors reading
 pages is collected than is typically collected in server logs by
 web sites. Aside from the above raw log data collected for
 general purposes, page visits do not expose a visitor's identity
 publicly. Sampled raw log data may include the IP address of any
 user, but it is not reproduced publicly.</p>
 <h4 class="atitin">Editing projects</h4>
 <p>Edits to Project pages are identified with the
 Facebook/Google+ username and network IP address of the editor,
 and editing history is aggregated by author in a contribution
 list. Such information will be available permanently on the
 projects.</p>
 <h4 class="atitin">Logged in registered users:</h4>
 <p>Logged in users do not expose their IP address to the
 public except in cases of abuse, including vandalism of a
 transcript page by the user or by another user with the same IP
 address. A user's IP address is stored on the Readable servers
 for a period of time, during which it can be seen by server
 administrators and by users who have been granted CheckUser
 access.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="acell">
 <h3 class="apage">Release: Policy on Release of Data</h3>
 <p>It is the policy of Readable that personally identifiable
 data collected in the server logs, or through records in the
 database via the CheckUser feature, or through other
 non-publicly-available methods, may be released by Readable
 staff, in any of the following situations:</p>
 <ul class="alist1">
<li>In response to a valid subpoena or other compulsory
 request from law enforcement</li>
 <li>With permission of the affected user</li>
 <li>When necessary for investigation of abuse complaints</li>
 <li>Where the information pertains to page views generated
 by a spider or bot and its dissemination is necessary to
 illustrate or resolve technical issues</li>
 <li>Where the user has been vandalizing transcripts or
 persistently behaving in a disruptive way, data may be released
 to a service provider, carrier, or other third-party entity to
 assist in the targeting of IP blocks, or to assist in the
 formulation of a complaint to relevant Internet Service
 Providers</li>
 <li>Where it is reasonably necessary to protect the rights,
 property or safety of Readable, its users or the public</li>
 </ul>
<p>Except as described above, Readable policy does not permit
 distribution of personally identifiable information under any
 circumstances.</p>
 <p>Third-party access and notifying registered users when
 receiving legal process:</p>
 <p>As a general principle, the access to, and retention of,
 personally identifiable data in all projects should be minimal
 and should be used only internally to serve the well-being of the
 projects. Occasionally, however, Readable may receive a subpoena
 or other compulsory request from a law-enforcement agency or a
 court or equivalent government body that requests the disclosure
 of information about a registered user, and may be compelled by
 law to comply with the request. In the event of such a legally
 compulsory request, Readable will attempt to notify the affected
 user within three business days after the arrival of such
 subpoena by sending a notice by email to the email address (if
 any) that the affected user has listed in connection to their
 Google+/Facebook account.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="acell">
 <h3 class="apage">Disclaimer</h3>
 <p>Readable believes that maintaining and preserving the
 privacy of user data is an important value. This Privacy Policy,
 together with other policies, resolutions, and actions by
 Readable, represents a committed effort to safeguard the security
 of the limited user information that is collected and retained on
 our servers. Nevertheless, Readable cannot guarantee that user
 information will remain private. We acknowledge that, in spite of
 our committed effort to protect private user information,
 determined individuals may still develop data-mining and other
 methods to uncover such information and disclose it. For this
 reason, Readable can make no guarantee against unauthorized
 access to information provided in the course of participating in
 Readable Projects or related communities.</p>
