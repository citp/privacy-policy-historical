**Alcoa protects your privacy on alcoa.com through these basic principles:**

  1. You will be advised when Alcoa is collecting information about you or your online preferences and expectations and it will be made clear how that information is to be used.

  3. Any information collected about you will be secure and not shared with any third parties, unless you give prior permission for that information to be shared. However, Alcoa may have to disclose personally identifiable information it considers necessary in order to comply with court orders, subpoenas, governmental or law enforcement requests, or to a third party to which ownership of Alcoa is transferred via an acquisition, merger, sale of assets, etc. Information may be shared with and transferred to Alcoa affiliates, subsidiaries or service providers, but only when necessary to fulfill your request.

  4. When providing personal information to us in order to initiate a credit card transaction, we use 18-bit Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to protect your online order information. When you enter this information on one of our websites, your personal information and credit card information is encrypted and sent directly to a credit card processor for verification and processing. You will need to provide us with your credit card information at the time of each credit card transaction you initiate, as Alcoa does not receive nor retain this information.
