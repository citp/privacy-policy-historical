In order to conduct a successful business in an increasingly global and digital economy, the processing of personal data, which includes, but is not limited to, collecting, using, storing, retaining, accessing and/or disclosing, by Alcatel-Lucent is often necessary.

Alcatel-Lucent recognizes in addition the legal rights and expectations of its customers, suppliers, partners and other third parties submitting personal data to Alcatel-Lucent or conducting business with or on behalf of Alcatel-Lucent, and of its employees and other personnel, (hereafter collectively referred to as “individuals” or “data subjects” or “you”) as they relate to the privacy and protection of the individual’s personal data.

It is our goal to balance the benefits of processing personal data with your right, as an individual, to control the use of your personal data. Meeting this commitment is a primary management objective and the individual and collective responsibility of all Alcatel-Lucent entities and employees as well as third parties conducting business with or on behalf of Alcatel-Lucent.

### What Is Personal Data?
