### 7\. How does Algolia keep my information secure?

_Section 9 of this Privacy Policy separately covers and applies to personal information submitted by our subscribers to our Services, or collected through our Services on behalf of or at the direction of our subscribers._

Algolia will maintain appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect your personal information from accidental loss, unauthorized use, alteration, or disclosure.

You may review the most up to date version of our security measures at <https://www.algolia.com/security>.

By using our Websites, Services, and Marketing Activities you expressly give your consent for the collection and use of your personal information in compliance with this Privacy Policy. This does not affect lawful processing under applicable laws based on other legal basis such as contractual obligation, compliance with applicable laws, and legitimate purposes.

**Right to Access or Correct Personal Information**

If Algolia processes your personal information on behalf of or at the direction of one of our subscribers, you should first look to that subscriber for assistance regarding the modification or correction of your personal information as described in Section 9 of this Privacy Policy.

You have the right to access and correct your personal information.

**Right to Delete Personal Information (“Right to be Forgotten”)**

If Algolia processes your personal information on behalf of or at the direction of one of our subscribers, you should first look to that subscriber for assistance regarding the removal of your personal information as described in Section 9 of this Privacy Policy.

You have the right to request deletion of personal information we hold about you and we have the obligation to erase your personal information, where:

  * the personal information is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which it was collected or otherwise processed,
  * you withdraw consent on which the processing is based and where there is no other legal ground for the processing,
  * you object to the processing and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing,
  * the personal information has been unlawfully processed, or
  * the personal information has to be erased for compliance with a legal obligation in the European Union or a Member State law to which Algolia is subject.



If you want to request removal of your personal information from our Websites or Services, you can login to the appropriate Website or Service and contact us through the Support Center, or you may send us an email at the address noted in the Contact Information section above. You can also request closure of your account. We will respond to your request within 30 days.

In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know that we are unable to do so and why.

**Right to Data Portability**

_If Algolia processes your personal information on behalf of or at the direction of one of our subscribers, you should first look to that subscriber for assistance regarding the data portability of your personal information as described in Section 9 of this Privacy Policy._

You have the right to receive or transfer a copy of your personal information, where:

  * we are relying upon your consent or the fact that the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are party as the legal basis for the processing, and
  * personal information is processed by automatic means.



This copy will be provided to you in a common machine-readable format. You may also require us to transmit it to another party where this is technically feasible.

If you want to request a copy of your personal information, you can login to the appropriate Website or Service and contact us through the Support Center, or you may send us an email at the address noted in the Contact Information section above.

**Right to Restrict Personal Information Processing**

_If Algolia processes your personal information on behalf of or at the direction of one of our subscribers, you should first look to that subscriber for assistance regarding the restriction of processing of your personal information as described in Section 9 of this Privacy Policy._

You have the right to request the restriction of processing of your personal information, where:

  * you contest the accuracy of the personal information until we take sufficient steps to correct or verify its accuracy,
  * where the processing is unlawful but you do not want us to erase the personal information,
  * where we no longer need the personal information for the purposes of the processing, but you require the information for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims, or
  * where you have objected to processing justified on legitimate interest grounds (see below) pending verification as to whether Algolia has compelling legitimate grounds to continue processing.



Where personal information is subjected to restriction in this way we will only process it with your consent or for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims. This right includes restricting the processing of your personal information to only include storage of your personal information (e.g. during the time when Algolia assesses whether you are entitled to have personal information erased).

If you want to request restriction of processing of your personal information, you can login to the appropriate Website or Service and contact us through the Support Center, or you may send us an email at the address noted in the Contact Information section above.

**Right to object to processing justified on legitimate interest grounds**

_If Algolia processes your personal information on behalf of or at the direction of one of our subscribers, you should first look to that subscriber for assistance regarding objections to processing your personal information as described in Section 9 of this Privacy Policy._

Where we are relying upon legitimate interest to process personal information, you have the right to object to that processing. If you object, we must stop that processing unless we can either demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing that override your interests, rights and freedoms or where we need to process the personal information for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims. Where we rely upon legitimate interest as a basis for processing we believe that we can demonstrate such compelling legitimate grounds, but we will consider each case on an individual basis.

If you want to object to the processing of your personal information, you can login to the appropriate Website or Service and contact us through the Support Center, or you may send us an email at the address noted in the Contact Information section above.

For transfers to countries without an adequacy decision by the European Commission, Algolia puts appropriate safeguards through contractual obligations.

**Right to Withdraw Consent**

_If Algolia processes your personal information on behalf of or at the direction of one of our subscribers, you should first look to that subscriber for assistance regarding withdrawing consent for processing your personal information as described in Section 9 of this Privacy Policy._

Where you have provided us with your consent to process personal information, you have the right to withdraw such consent at any time, without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.

If you are a data subject for whom a subscriber has submitted personal information to the Services and would like your information not to be disclosed to a third-party or to be used for a purpose that is materially different from the purpose(s) for which the personal information was originally collected, then you should contact the subscriber directly.

Algolia maintains contracts with these third-parties restricting their access, use, and disclosure of personal information.

**Security Measures**

Algolia maintains administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect data submitted to the Services, including personal information. These security measures are set forth in our security and compliance documentation available at <https://www.algolia.com/security>.

If the subscriber requests that Algolia remove the personal information, we will refer your request to the applicable subscriber and we will respond to the request within 30 days.

**Subscriber Data Retention**

Algolia retains the personal information we process on behalf of our subscribers for as long as needed to provide the Services to our subscribers and in accordance with our subscription agreements.
