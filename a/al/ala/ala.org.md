Accordingly, any information you transfer to or from Services is provided at your own risk.

Please do your part to help us keep your information secure. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and ALA Account, and are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your password or ALA Account. ALA specifically reserves the right to terminate your access to the Services and any contract you have with ALA related to the Services in the event it learns or suspects you have disclosed your ALA Account or password information to an unauthorized third party.
