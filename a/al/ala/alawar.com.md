We will use your e-mail address to send a confirmation and, if necessary, might use the other information to contact you for help to process the purchase or service you have selected. If you subscribe to a service or register a product, for example, the information is used to register your rights, if any, to technical support or other benefits that may be made available to registered users. Your Personal information is also used to keep you informed about product upgrades, patches, special offers, features on our Website and other products and services of Alawar and selected third parties if you have so opted to receive such communications.

Alawar uses the information required for our detection, investigation and prevention of cheating in the products or Website and end user license agreement violations only for the purposes of detection, investigation and prevention of such cheating. If the data can be used to prove that cheating or another fraud or end user license agreement violation has occurred, we will further store the data for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims during the applicable statute of limitations.

Alawar recognizes and appreciates the importance of responsible use of information collected on this Website. Without your consent, Alawar will not communicate any information to you regarding products, services, and special offers available from Alawar or its affiliates, although we may find it necessary to communicate with you regarding your use of the services on this Website. Except in the particular circumstances described in this Privacy Policy, Alawar will also not provide your Personal information to other companies or organizations without your consent.

**Securing the Transmission and Storage of Information**

Alawar operates secure data networks protected by industry standard firewall and password protection systems. Our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary, and only authorized individuals have access to the information provided by our users. Even your registration account password is encrypted before it is sent to our computers. Any other particularly sensitive information, such as a customer's credit card number collected for a commerce transaction, is also encrypted prior to transmission.

Alawar takes steps to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with our Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your Personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you use these services at your own risk.

We treat the information you provide to us as confidential information; it is, accordingly, subject to our company's security procedures and corporate policies regarding protection and use of confidential information. After Personal information reaches Alawar it is stored on a server with physical and electronic security features as customary in the industry, including utilization of login/password procedures and electronic firewalls designed to block unauthorized access from outside of Alawar. Because laws applicable to Personal information vary by country, our offices or other business operations may put in place additional measures that vary depending on the applicable legal requirements. Information collected on the Website covered by this Privacy Policy is processed and stored in the United States and also in other countries where Alawar and its service providers conduct business. By providing information to Alawar you consent to the storage of your Personal information in these locations. All Alawar employees are aware of our privacy and security policies. Your information is only accessible to those employees who need it in order to perform their jobs.

**Disclosure of Information to Third Parties**

Alawar does use the services of third parties, such as e-mail service providers, purchase and order processing merchants, web hosting, data management and storage service providers, marketing, advertising companies for delivery targeted advertisements, business partners providing services, products that you have requested or may be of interest to you that act as independent contractors on behalf of Alawar. These parties are contractually prohibited from processing Personal information for any purpose other than for performing legitimate contractual obligations or to comply with applicable legal requirements.

We do provide non-personal information to certain service providers for their use on an aggregated, anonymized basis for the purpose of performing their contractual obligations to us. We prohibit the sale or transfer of Personal information to entities outside of the Alawar's affiliates for their use without your approval.

Alawar may disclose your Personal information if we believe in good faith that we are required to do so in order to comply with applicable law, a subpoena, or other legal process. Alawar may also disclose Personal information when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our Terms of use, this Privacy Policy or to protect the safety of our users and the public or under confidentiality and licensing agreements with certain third parties which assist us in developing, operating and maintaining the Website and its content.

In the event that all or substantially all of Alawar's stock and/or assets are transferred or sold to another entity, Alawar may transfer Personal information to the acquiring entity. If, as a result of such a business transition, your Personal information will be used in a materially different manner, you will be given choice consistent with our policy regarding notification of changes.

**Choices and Rights available to you**

You can always choose whether or not to disclose Personal information and that choice will not prevent you from using the Alawar Website. Please note, however, if you should choose to withhold requested information, we may not be able to provide you with some of the services dependent upon the collection of this information.

You control which name, date of birth, email, photo, phone number we associate with your account. If they change, please modify the data in your personal account directly. Please inform us if any of the personal data we retain about you is inaccurate.

You can choose at anytime to opt out of receiving emails from Alawar or from having your Personal information shared with selected companies. If you want to opt out, you can do so by editing your preferences with respect to email or the sharing of information. If you elect to "opt out" we will not, as applicable, share your Personal information with third parties or send you emails.

We reserve the right to send a one-time registration confirmation email, and infrequent Service Alert messages to users to inform them of specific changes that may impact their ability to use a service they have previously signed up for, regardless of email contact opt-in status. We also reserve the right to contact you if compelled to do so as part of a legal proceeding or if there has been a violation of our Terms of Use or applicable licensing agreements.

You have the right to obtain deletion by Alawar of Personal information concerning you by deleting your account on the Website. If you request us to erasure your Personal information we will delete all Personal information about you, except for the data that are required for our compliance with the requirements of applicable laws (e.g. tax and accounting requirements) or for our detection, investigation and prevention of cheating in the products, Website and end user license agreement violations. We will retain anonymous information after your account has been closed.

Alawar is retaining these rights because in limited cases we feel that we may need the right to contact you as a matter of law or regarding matters that will be important to you. These rights do not allow us to contact you to market a new or existing service if you have asked us not to do so, and issuance of these types of communications are rare.

You may access and correct your Personal information and privacy preferences, opt out of receiving emails, newsletters, the sharing or retention of any Personal information, by writing at [privacy@alawar.com](mailto:privacy@alawar.com) or regular mail at Alawar Entertainment, Inc 901 N.

To ensure that your request is honored, you must provide Alawar with information sufficient for us to accurately identify and access your records. The information we require is your full name, date of birth and the email address you provided to Alawar when you requested services or products. Alawar reserves the right to contact you to verify that we have accurately identified your record.

Where processing of your Personal information is based on legitimate interests according to Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR, you can use your right to object at any time. If you object we will no longer process your Personal information unless there are compelling and prevailing legitimate grounds for the processing or the data is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.

You also have the right to lodge a complaint at a supervisory authority.
