  * We may disclose your PII to other companies (e.g., data processors or fulfillment companies) that work on behalf of Alacra (including, if you provide us with your credit card information, credit card companies). These companies may also use your PII to help Alacra communicate with you about offers in which you may have expressed an interest. However, these companies do not have any right to use any of your PII that they receive from Alacra on their own behalf and they will be under an obligation to keep your personal information confidential. 
  * We may disclose your PII in response to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.

Alacra currently operates from offices in the United States and the United Kingdom, but may operate from additional offices worldwide in the future. Steps have been taken to ensure that consistently high standards of data protection are adhered to in all Alacra offices for all the forms of processing mentioned above.
