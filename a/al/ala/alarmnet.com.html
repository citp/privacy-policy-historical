Services and transactions. We use your personal information to deliver services or carry out transactions you have requested, such as providing information on Honeywell products, registering purchased products, processing product orders, handling warranty claims, replacing product manuals, answering customer service requests, facilitating use of our websites, and so forth. In order to offer you a more consistent experience in your interactions with Honeywell, information collected by our websites may be combined with information we collect by other means.
<br>
<br>
Website improvement. We may use your personal information to improve our websites and related Honeywell products or services, or to make our websites easier to use by eliminating the need for you to repeatedly enter the same information or by customizing our websites to your particular preference or interests.
<br>
<br>

When collecting information that might be used to contact you about our products and services, we will always give you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving such communications. Moreover, each e-mail communication we send includes an unsubscribe link allowing you to stop delivery of that type of communication.

<br>
<span class="H6link">Our use of cookies and web beacons</span><br>
Cookies are small files that websites save to your hard disk or to your browser's memory. We may use them to track the number of times you have visited the site, to track the number of visitors to the site, to determine and analyze visitors' use of our sites (including the effectiveness of online advertising), to store information that you provide such as your preferences, and to store technical information useful for your interactions with our websites. We may use session cookies (cookies that are deleted when your browser session ends) to store your user ID, elements of your user profile, to facilitate your movement around our websites (particularly in connection with information searches and order placement) and other information useful in administering the session. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser settings to decline cookies or to notify you when a cookie is being placed on your computer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the features of Honeywell's websites or other websites that you visit. Our sites also may contain electronic images known as web beacons - sometimes called single-pixel gifs - that allow us to count the number of users who have visited those pages.

<br>
<span class="H6link">Disclosure of your personal information</span><br>
Except as described below, personal information you provide to Honeywell through our websites will not be shared outside of Honeywell and its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates without your permission.<br>
<br>
Disclosure to service providers. Honeywell contracts with other companies to provide services on our behalf, such as hosting websites, sending out information, processing transactions, and analyzing our websites. We provide these companies with only those elements of your personal information they need to deliver those services. These companies and their employees are prohibited from using that personal information for any other purpose.
<br>
<br>
Disclosure to distributors. In responding to a request made by you, we may share your personal information with companies that distribute our products. In those cases, we provide these companies with only those elements of your personal information they need to respond to your request, and these companies and their employees are prohibited from using that personal information for any other purpose. In some cases, we may seek your permission to share your information with distributors for marketing purposes other than responding to a request from you. However, we will not share your information for such marketing purposes unless we have obtained your express consent to do so.<br>
<br>
Disclosure in connection with transactions. In connection with certain transactions, we may disclose some or all of your personal information to financial institutions, government entities, and shipping companies or postal services involved in fulfillment.<br>
<br>
Disclosures in connection with acquisitions or divestitures. Circumstances may arise where for strategic or other business reasons Honeywell decides to sell, buy, merge or otherwise reorganize businesses in some countries. Such a transaction may involve the disclosure of personal information to prospective or actual purchasers, or receiving it from sellers. It is Honeywell's practice to seek appropriate protection for information in these types of transactions.<br>
<br>
Disclosure for other reasons. We may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with legal requirements or with legal process served on us, to protect and defend our rights or property, or in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of any individual.
<br>
<br>
<span class="H6link">Security</span><br>
Honeywell is committed to protecting the security of your personal information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, we store the personal information you provide on computer systems with limited access that are located in facilities to which access is limited. For sites to which you login, it is your responsibility to ensure the security of your password and not to reveal this information to others. When you move around a site to which you have logged in, or from one site to another that uses the same login mechanism, we verify your identity by means of an encrypted cookie placed on your machine.<br>
<br>
<span class="H6link">Reviewing your personal information</span><br>
In some cases, you can review and correct personal information provided through our websites by going to the page on which you provided the information.

We also link to third-party providers that host, maintain and operate on-line training curricula. While we try to link only to sites that share our high standards and respect for privacy, we are not responsible for the content, security, or privacy practices employed by other sites.<br>
