**Alarm.com's Privacy Policy**

We are sensitive to the private nature of the information you, our service providers, partners, end-users and prospective end-user customers provide to us. Our Privacy Policy is designed to maximize your ability to protect your personal, private data while at the same time allowing us to provide you with the best interactive security, home automation and video services possible. This Privacy Policy states our privacy practices for your use of (i) this website and any mobile sites or applications operated by Alarm.com (the “User Interfaces”); and (ii) any combination of products and services we provide or which can be purchased or accessed via any User Interface (the “Services”). Please read the Privacy Policy carefully.

  


Alarm.com collects and stores certain information from or about you that can be used to uniquely contact, identify, or locate you (“Personal Information”). When using the User Interfaces, you may provide us with Personal Information including, but not limited to, your name, home or business address, phone number, email address, payment information, location, or zip code. When you use our Services, you may provide us with certain additional information (e.g., unit description, home or business size, home or business system configuration, sensor names, appliances or other devices monitored by Alarm.com, account information, schedule, mode, automation settings, and device settings) in order for us to personalize your Services. Alarm.com may also receive Personal Information that you have provided to our partners, including emergency contact information and user profile information, to enable Alarm.com to provide our Services. 

Alarm.com may collect information regarding your use of the Alarm.com User Interfaces and Services, including but not limited to: performance of any security or other device monitored by Alarm.com, electrical usage or consumption, heating and cooling information, light or other fixture settings, and usage and alert logs. We receive this type of information from your devices that are monitored or controlled by Alarm.com and your computer or other electronic device through which you may access, browse, download, receive, or otherwise use the Alarm.com User Interfaces or Services (each a “Personal Device”), and we may also receive and collect such information from third parties.

Some features of our Services, such as location-activated arming reminders, thermostat adjustments, and other location-based Services (collectively, “GeoServices”), use location information. Before GeoServices information can be used or collected, you must first opt-in to activate these Services. If you enable these features, we will automatically collect and store location information from your Personal Device or vehicle you designate which is capable of producing location data (e.g., mobile device, GPS device, or vehicle). This location information may include your current location or places you have recently visited. We also may aggregate this information, but this information will only be used for Alarm.com's internal purposes and to provide information requested by you. If you do not wish for us to collect and store this information, do not enable these features.

  


When you subscribe to Alarm.com’s video monitoring Service, use a connected doorbell, camera, or other connected device or wearable, you may enable us to record, store and process video and/or audio recordings from your monitoring equipment, subject to your configuration and settings. This may include capturing and emailing to you portions of this data as part of a notification or analyzing the data to identify motion or other events. We may process information from your monitoring equipment so that we can send you alerts. In addition, if you have the recording features enabled, we will capture, process and store video and audio data recordings from your device and you may be able to access those recordings. 

Data protection and privacy laws in your country may impose certain responsibilities on you and your use of security cameras, connected doorbells and other devices with recording capabilities. You (not Alarm.com) are responsible for ensuring that you comply with any applicable laws. For example, you may need to display a notice that alerts visitors to your home or office that they may be recorded using security cameras and other devices with recording capabilities. Alarm.com takes no responsibility for your compliance with applicable law.

Alarm.com will not disclose your Personal Information to any other entity except:

  * as is necessary to provide the Alarm.com User Interfaces and Services to you;
  * to your service provider (also referred to as your Alarm.com Dealer), the company through which you subscribed to our Services;
  * when you have opted in to share the information;
  * when we need to share the information with an entity who works on our behalf to provide the Services (these entities do not have any right to use the Personal Information we provide to them beyond what is necessary to assist us);
  * if you are an existing customer, to promote additional Alarm.com-supported products and Services to you, either directly or through a third party;
  * as necessary in connection with other business purposes; and
  * as it is otherwise necessary to disclose as required or permitted by law.



In addition, we may disclose your information when the information has been converted to a form that cannot be used to identify you. It may also be necessary for us to disclose your Personal Information in case of a merger or combination with, or acquisition of a portion of its business by, another company or entity, in which case Personal Information collected by Alarm.com would be expected to be one of the transferred business assets.

Alarm.com has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of your information. For example, we protect your information through a unique username and password, and we protect certain sensitive communications with our website through server authentication and secure connections. However, no method of data transmission is completely secure.

You may view, update, or delete your Personal Information at any time by following the links at www.alarm.com to your profile and address book pages. These changes will be immediately made to our records. If you wish to stop notifications, you may do so through the User Interfaces.

Customers of Alarm.com Dealers: Changes to your user profile on the Alarm.com User Interfaces may not affect the records of your Alarm.com Dealer. You should contact your Alarm.com Dealer directly to make changes to its records.

We employ “cookie” technology and “web beacons” to help you move faster through the User Interfaces, to help improve the functionality of the User Interfaces, to collect information for advertising of our Services and to optimize your use of our User Interfaces. A cookie is a string of information sent by a User Interface and stored on your hard drive or temporarily in your Personal Device’s memory. A “web beacon” is an electronic image placed in the code of a web page. Our third party service providers may employ cookies and web beacons to tailor Alarm.com's advertising to your interests, monitor the traffic patterns of users from one Alarm.com page to another or to improve site performance. We also use cookies to identify you on future visits to our site and to other sites. When you access the Alarm.com User Interfaces, we place a cookie on your computer. This allows the user interfaces to recognize you as you navigate through the User Interfaces. At your discretion, Alarm.com may store and access cookies on your Personal Device to allow you to bypass the process of re-entering certain information each time you access the Alarm.com website. You can also delete cookies from your website browser at any time.

We may collect information relating to customer trends and patterns and use cookies and software tools to measure site usage and related information.

We may also permit third parties to place or modify cookies on your Personal Device on our behalf. The third parties can use these “tracking cookies” (also known as “third party cookies”) to determine if you have visited certain pages on our site or other sites and may use tracking cookies to present targeted advertisements to you as you visit other sites. These tracking cookies do not contain personally identifiable information (though they do identify the Personal Device that you use to visit the site) and you can configure your browser to reject tracking cookies.

If you access our Services or the User Interfaces through your Personal Device, we may automatically collect certain information about your Personal Device that could include usage information and statistics, an IP address, Personal Device type and model, browser type, Personal Device ID, domain names, access times, referring website addresses, Personal Device settings and history, and other information collected about your access of the User Interfaces or receipt of communications or notification from Alarm.com.

For your convenience, some hyperlinks may be posted on the Alarm.com website that link to other websites not under Alarm.com’s control. Alarm.com is not responsible for, and this Privacy Policy does not apply to, the privacy practices of those sites or of any companies that Alarm.com does not own or control. Alarm.com does not endorse any of these websites or pages, the services or products described or offered on such sites or pages, or any of the content contained on those sites or pages. Alarm.com encourages you to seek out and read the privacy policy of each website that you visit. In addition, should you happen to initiate a transaction on a website linked to the Alarm.com website, even if you reached that site through the Alarm.com User Interfaces, the information that you submit to complete that transaction becomes subject to the privacy practices of the operator of that linked website. You should read that website's privacy policies to understand how Personal Information that is collected about you is used and protected.

If you are utilizing our User Interfaces from outside the United States, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored or processed in the United States, where our servers are located and our central database is operated. The data protection and other laws of the United States and other countries might not be as comprehensive as those in your country, but please be assured that we take steps to protect your privacy. By using our Services, you understand and consent to the transfer of your information to our facilities in the United States and sharing of your information with the third parties described in this Privacy Policy.

We may change this Policy at any time and from time to time. Any changes to this Policy will be posted on our User Interfaces. The most recent version of this Privacy Policy is reflected by the version date located below. This Privacy Policy is not intended to and does not create any contractual or other legal right in or on behalf of any party.

California and Delaware law require Alarm.com to indicate whether it honors “Do Not Track” settings in your browser concerning targeted advertising. “Do Not Track” is a standard that is currently under development. As it is not yet finalized, Alarm.com adheres to the standards set out in this Privacy Policy and does not monitor or follow any Do Not Track browser requests.
