**BURDA interactive communities (BURDA:ic) Privacy Policy**

We are deeply concerned with the protection of personal data. We would like you to know when we are saving which data and how we use them. As a company of civil law, we are subject to the Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG) and the Treaty for Telemedia (TMG) of the Federal Republic of Germany. We took technical and organisational measures to ensure that the regulations on data protection are followed by us, as well as external service providers who are working for us.

 **Personal Data**

Personal data is information used to learn about your identity. Among it is information like your real name, your adress, zipcode, phone number. Information not associated with your real identity (for example your favourite website or number of users on a page) are not covered.

Parts of our online service (website) are usable without revealing your identity. As soon as you want to participate in games and the portal itself, you will be asked for your name and other private information. These are the following:

  * date of birth
  * country of your residence
  * your email adress



  
Your information will be saved on specially protected servers in Germany. Only a few, specially athorized people who are involved with technical, commercial or editorial care of the servers and the portal are able to access them.  


When you access, data which allows an identification (for example IP adress, date, time and pages looked at on our website) will be saved to our servers for the purpose of backup. There will be no personal-related processing. The statistical evaluation of anonymous data is reserved.

IP adresses will be saved for a period of 28 days when using our service anonymous. They are saved for purposes of data security and to ensure the stability and the operational safety of our system. Excepted from this limited saving is data necessary for accounting.

Should we provide third parties with information, they gain no access to the saved personal data. The administration of these is exclusive subject to BURDA:ic.

 **Passing of Personal Data to Third Parties**

Your data is not passed to third parties without your explicit approval. If your data is passed to other service providers due to processing of data, these providers are bound to the BDSG, other statutory provisions and contractually to the Privacy Policy of BURDA:ic. As far as we are obliged via laws or judicial decree, your data can be passed to units entitled to receive information.

Articles posted in our forums are open to the public. Before posting you should check your posts whether they contain information not intended for the public. You need to face the possibility, that your posts are collected by search engines and become accessible worldwide, without using our service. Foreign service providers oftentimes cannot be brought to erase or revise these kinds of entries.

You can delete your personal data left to us anytime. Data used for accounting and clearance purposes are not affected by cancelation and deletion.
