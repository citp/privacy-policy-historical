                browser
                and capture and remember certain information. For instance, we use cookies to help us remember and
                process
                the
                items in your shopping cart. They are also used to help us understand your preferences based on previous

                    behalf.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>We use Google AdSense Advertising on our website.</p>

            <p>
                Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on our site. Google's use of the DART cookie

            <h4><b>California Online Privacy Protection Act</b></h4>

            <p>
                CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post
                a
                privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the
                United
                States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information
                from
                California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information
                being
                collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. - See more

            <h4><b>How does our site handle do not track signals?</b></h4>

            <p>
                We don't honor do not track signals and do not track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not
                Track
                (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.
            </p>

            <h4><b>Does our site allow third party behavioral tracking?</b></h4>
            <p>It's also important to note that we allow third party behavioral tracking</p>

            <h4><b>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</b></h4>

            <p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 13, the Children's Online
                Privacy
                Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, the nation's consumer
                protection
                agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do
                to
                protect children's privacy and safety online.</p>

            <p>We do not specifically market to children under 13.</p>

            <h4><b>Fair Information Practices</b></h4>

            <p>
                The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the
                concepts
                they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe.
                Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to
                comply
                with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.
            </p>

            <p>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action,
                should
                a data breach occur:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We will notify the users via email within 7 business days</li>
                <li>We will notify the users via in site notification within 7 business days</li>
            </ul>

           <p>
               We also agree to the individual redress principle, which requires that individuals have a right to pursue
               legally enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This
               principle
               requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals
               have
               recourse to courts or a government agency to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.
           </p>

            <h4><b>CAN SPAM Act</b></h4>

            <p>
                The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial
                messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough
                penalties for violations.
            </p>

            <p>
                If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, you can email us at
                and we will promptly remove you from ALL correspondence.
