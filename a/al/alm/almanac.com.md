# Privacy Policy - The Old Farmer's Almanac

## For Web Visitors

Yankee Publishing Inc. respects your right to privacy. 

We use the information you supply us in different ways. We use your survey responses and feedback e-mail to help us improve the content and experience offered to Almanac.com users. And we use your contact information to interact with you (if that was your intention). 

We will only save your contact information if you indicate that you would like to be updated on new offerings from Almanac.com. In this case we will add your name to the subscription list for the Almanac.com e-mail newsletter, which we send out periodically. You can remove your name from this list by following the instructions in the newsletter text. 

We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and for internal reporting. If you are visiting our store, we also use cookies to maintain your order in our shopping cart. 

For information you provide to us, we will not rent or share your contact information outside of Yankee Publishing Inc. without your permission -- with one exception: when you enter a sweepstakes on Almanac.com, we offer it to the establishment(s) that provides the sweepstakes prize. 

Yankee Publishing Inc. is composed of different operating groups. Any information we save about you will be shared among these operating groups. Occasionally, you may receive offers from these operating groups; to remove your name from those lists, follow the instructions within the communication. 

Yankee Publishing is currently contracted with Tacoda, Inc., a third party, to track and analyze anonymous usage and browsing patterns of our visitors and customers. All data collected by Tacoda on behalf of our Web sites is owned by Yankee Publishing. This information is used to help provide advertisers with more targeted advertising opportunities, which means that our users see advertising that is most likely to interest them, and advertisers send their messages to people who are most likely to be receptive, improving both the viewer's experience and the effectiveness of the ads. For more information about Tacoda's privacy policy, including how to opt out, go to [www.tacoda.com/notice](http://www.tacoda.com/notice/).
