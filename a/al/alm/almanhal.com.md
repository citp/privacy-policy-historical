Under limited circumstances, we also collect limited business contact information from legitimate third parties.

In order to use some of the unique functions within our Services, a user must first complete a registration form or provide an email address that will require the user’s disclosure of limited Personal Information. Such disclosure is strictly voluntary. In addition, and in order to contact us by email, however, you must provide an email address.

**C.    How Do We Use the Information?**

We use the Personal Information we collect for the limited purposes of processing your transactions, establishing the identity of account holders, customer service, authorization, customer support, content processing, content classification, and providing you with information concerning our Services. We will retain this information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you Services, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. 

For example, our Bookshelf service employs a personalization feature that requires completion of a registration form before a user can use that feature. The personalization feature of the Bookshelf is a powerful tool that provides users with the means to create and save histories of searches they have conducted. We believe the personalization feature is a useful tool that will enhance the user's experience at the site, but it does require the user to provide Personal Information to us.

We use the non-Personal Information we collect to administer the Services, perform diagnostics, collect content-specific usage statistics, protect the Services and their content from inappropriate use, and improve the user's experience.

We may use the Personal Information and non-Personal Information we collect by sharing it with third-party agents,vendors, contractors, partners, or content providers of Al Manhal (collectively, "Contractors") for purposes of managing purchases of our products and services, servicing our systems, and obtaining support services for our businesses. We are not in the business of selling Personal Information to third-parties or Contractors, and will share it with Contractors only as we describe in this Privacy Policy. In situations where we provide Personal Information to Contractors, we ensure access is granted to the Contractors only upon the condition that the Personal Information is kept confidential and is used only for carrying out the services these Contractors are performing for Al Manhal. As part of making that determination whether we will provide Personal Information to Contractors, we will obtain assurances that they will appropriately safeguard Personal Information consistent with this Privacy Policy.

The Personal Information we collect from you may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you live. These countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country. Specifically, the servers we use to provide our Services are located in the United States. This means that when we collect your Personal Information, we may process it in the United States or the country where you live. However, when we process your Personal Information,irrelevant of its processing location, we take appropriate safeguards, as discussed below, to require that your Personal Information remains protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

We may share your usage data related to our Services with our affiliates for purposes of providing or improving our Services. We will not disclose any information about your usage data related to our Services to unaffiliated third-parties, except as necessary to enhance the product experience, service the legal agreement between us and your employer or affiliated institution under which you are provided access to our Services, to enforce the terms of use, to meet our contractual obligations to report aggregated usage data to content providers, or as required by law.

We also reserve the right to disclose your Personal Information if we are required to do so by law, or in the good faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process, and to the extent permitted by applicable local law, to respond to claims, or to protect or advance the rights, property, safety, or well-being of our company, our employees, customers, or the public.

We will not use your Personal Information for automated-decision making.

In the unlikely event that all or substantially all of the assets of Al Manhal are acquired, customer information, which may include Personal Information, maybe one of the transferred assets unless restricted by applicable local law.

**D.    What is our legal basis for collecting and using your Personal Information? (EEA Only)**

Our legal basis for collecting and using the Personal Information described above will depend on the Personal Information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.

However, we will normally collect Personal Information from you only (i) where we need the Personal Information to perform a contract with you or your organization, (ii) where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms, or (iii) where we have your consent to do so.In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect Personal Information from you or may otherwise need the Personal Information to protect your vital interests or those of another person.

If we ask you to provide Personal Information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with your institution, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your Personal Information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible impact if you do not provide your Personal Information).

Similarly, if we collect and use your Personal Information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.
