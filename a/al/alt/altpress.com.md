 **AP MAGAZINE PRIVACY POLICY**

Alternative Press Magazine, Inc. (the “AP Magazine” or “we”) are committed to respecting your privacy. For purposes of this privacy policy, the term “personal information” or “personally identifiable information” will mean any information by which you can be identified, such as your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, etc. Earning and keeping the trust of the users of this web site and of any AP Magazine mobile application is important to AP Magazine. We want you to understand what types of information are gathered from you, how this information is used and protected, and how you can control its use. This particular statement discloses the privacy practices of AP Magazine regarding this web site and regarding any mobile application that may be affiliated with AP Magazine. By using this web site and any mobile application with which AP Magazine may be affiliated, you agree to be bound by this policy.

We will not sell, rent or disclose your personal information to outside parties (aside from entities that perform services for us, such as fulfilling orders, and those parties are bound to comply with our privacy policy or have privacy policies that protect your information in at least as stringent a manner as we do) without your consent except to (1) comply with the law or with legal process served on AP Magazine; (2) protect and defend the rights or property of AP Magazine; or (3) act in an emergency to protect someone’s safety; _provided, however_ , that we will be permitted to sell or disclose your personally identifiable information to a third party in the event of an actual or potential sale or other disposition of our business, including, but not limited to, by merger.

Any information provided by you or collected by AP Magazine through this web site or in connection with a mobile application is used by AP Magazine to record the number of users currently using this web site or the particular application, as the case may be. AP Magazine or its affiliates reserves the right to contact users to offer them information about software or other products or services.

There may be occasions when we need to collect information from you through our web site. This generally involves filling out forms, sending emails or registering to download our products from our or an affiliate’s web site. In addition, we maintain logs of files downloaded, but this information is stored in aggregated, non-personally identifiable form.

Neither AP Magazine nor any mobile application partner, if applicable, will collect your personally identifiable information without prior notification or consent. Non-personal information, such as browser type, what operating system you are using (e.g., Macintosh, Windows), and the domain name of your Internet Service Provider is recorded and is used to improve the presentation of pages on our site. This information may also be aggregated to provide general industry guidance.

We may use IP addresses of visitors to our site to analyze trends, administer the site, track a user’s movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. These IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. Information about what software is used by visitors and users may be shared with our partners in the aggregate to provide general industry guidance. Other than as specifically set forth above, we do not share any information gathered on any AP Magazine registration form with our partners or other third parties that would identify users personally without consent.

We use email links located on the “contact” page to allow you to contact us directly with any questions or comments you may have, including, but not limited to, questions or comments concerning what kind of information we are collecting from you and how we are using it. We will read every message sent in and try to reply promptly to every one. Any information you provide is used to respond directly to your questions or comments. We may also file your comments to improve the site and product, or review and discard the information. Other than as expressly set forth in this privacy statement, your personal comments are not shared with third parties. This web site takes every reasonable precaution to protect our users’ information the best that we can. When you submit sensitive information via the web site, your information is protected to the fullest extent possible both online and off-line. However, please be advised that no data transmission over the Internet or through the air can be 100% secure.

Though this web site is a general audience web site, it is not intended or designed to attract visitors under the age of 13. Children under the age of 13 should always ask permission from a parent or a guardian before sending personal information to anyone. We encourage parents and guardians to supervise their children’s online activity.

 **CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF 13 SHOULD NOT PROVIDE ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION TO AP MAGAZINE, EITHER THROUGH THE MOSH PIT OR IN RESPONSE TO ANY OTHER QUERY THROUGH THIS WEB SITE.
