#### Privacy Policy

We are committed to ensuring that all the details you provide to us remain reasonably secure.

**The information you provide**

When you open an account you are required to provide us with your name and address and other information. 

We will not collect sensitive information about you without your express consent.

You can check the information we hold by accessing your account at our website. If you find any inaccuracies please let us know. You can e-mail our Data Quality Team.

**How we use the information**

Altium only uses the information you give us for the purposes of processing your orders, delivering the goods to you and providing you with any support you may require. Altium uses your e-mail address to send you e-mails about your order and optional e-mails about our service and other (including future) products.

We may use the information for internal reviews and analysis and may also use it to produce certain consolidated statistics about sales and use of our website, products and services. For example, this information may be used to encourage more engineers to use our products and services. However, we will not disclose your individual information to any third party except insofar as it is necessary to fulfil your order and will not sell, trade or rent that information for marketing purposes.

If we need to disclose any information to conform to any laws or legal process we will do so in a manner so as to provide the maximum amount of protection legally possible for such information.

**Consent**

By giving your personal information when you open an account or at any other time, you are consenting to our use of this information in accordance with the principles outlined in this Privacy Policy. If at any time we change the Privacy Policy we will post those changes on the website so that you are kept fully informed.
