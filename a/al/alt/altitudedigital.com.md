We collect any information you enter on the WEBSITE or via or Services or give us in any other way (such as through an email, survey, or letter). The information that we collect varies depending upon how you use our WEBSITE or the Services.

**2\. AUTOMATIC INFORMATION COLLECTION.**

**A. Cookies.**

Like many websites, we use “cookies.” Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser. We use persistent, identifying cookies to remember your information and to link your activities to you. While you can take steps to warn off, block or disable cookies, if you do, the WEBSITE or SERVICES may not function and appear as we have designed it. Nonetheless, if you want to take these steps, you can do so by following the instructions associated with your browser. Our cookies collection information such as:

  * The domain name and host from which you access the Internet and the Internet address of the site from which you direct linked to ours;
  * The date and time you access the WEBSITE and pages you visit;
  * Your computer’s IP address and information about its operating system, platform and the Web browser type and version you use;
  * Demographic and other non-personally identifiable profile information about you; and
  * Information to combat fraud or misuse.



**B. Pixel Tags.**

If we email you, our emails may use “pixel tags” to determine if your email software or site can display html formatted email (this helps us optimize the size of our email messages and conserve bandwidth).

**C. Collection of Information by Third Parties.**

Some of the advertisers and other businesses that advertise or place other content on our WEBSITE or via our Services use cookies and may place such cookies on your computer. The content posted by these businesses will be reasonably identifiable as coming from a third party. In addition, we may use third party advertising companies to serve ads. These companies (1) use information obtained from your visits to this WEBSITE and other sites to serve ads to you and (2) place unique third party cookies on your browser. Also, we use web beacons provided by third party advertising companies to help optimize our advertising. Web beacons enable us to recognize your browser when a cookie has been placed on your computer. Some but not all third party advertising companies provide a mechanism to optout of their technology. For more information and an identification of advertisers that provide an optout mechanism, please click the following: [https://preferences-mgr.truste.com](https://preferences-mgr.truste.com/). The information collected by third party cookies is subject to the privacy policy of the third party, not this Policy.

**D. Promotions, Sweepstakes, and Contests.**

From time to time, we may host a promotion, sweepstake, or contest on the WEBSITE. You may be asked to provide personal information or permit the transfer to a third party of your personal infor- mation in connection with such promotion, sweepstake or contest. It will be disclosed at the point of collection or transfer who is collecting or transferring the information and whose privacy statement applies, and it will be your choice whether or not you wish to permit such transfer to our collection of personal information by a third party.

**3\. OUR USE AND RETENTION OF YOUR INFORMATION.**

**A. Use of Personal Information.**

We use personal information that you submit to us for such purposes as responding to your requests monitoring and providing the WEBSITE enforcing our rights and the rights of third parties, and investigating and ensuring compliance with the Terms.

We use other information about our users for purposes such as measuring the number of visitors to sections of our WEBSITE or our Services, making the WEBSITE or our Services more useful to visitors and delivering targeted advertising and nonadvertising content. We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the WEBSITE, track a user’s movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate, nonpersonally identifiable use.

**C. Retention of Information.**

We retain information for as long as required, allowed or we believe it useful, but do not undertake retention obligations. We may dispose of information in our discretion without notice, subject to applicable law that specifically requires the handling or retention of information.

**3\. OUR SHARING OF INFORMATION.**

GM shares information with third parties, but only as described in this Section 4.

**A. Advertisers and Others.**

We share nonpersonally identifiable information with advertisers, site providers, and other persons with whom we conduct business. Conversely, these advertisers, site providers, and other persons may share with us information about you that they have independently developed or acquired.

**B. WEBSITE Third Parties.**

We contract with affiliated and nonaffiliated third parties to provide sites to us or to you on our behalf. Examples include providing marketing assistance and analyzing data. These third parties have access to personal information needed to perform their functions.

**C. Business Transfer.**

As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or their assets, or engage in acquisitions, mergers, restructurings, changes of control, or similar transactions. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets. Also, in the unlikely event of a bankruptcy, customer information may be transferred to a bankruptcy trustee or debtor in possession and then to a subsequent purchaser.

**D. Affiliates.**

We may share user information with our corporate affiliates. Corporate affiliates are those entities that we control, are controlled by us, or are under common control with us and any joint venture in which any of the controlled entities may participate from time to time. Conversely, we may obtain information about you from our corporate affiliates or from your visits to other websites that we or our corporate affiliates control.

Third party companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements on the Website and other sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you.

  * Make disclosures under programs intended to prevent potential crimes or investigate persons;
  * Enforce or apply agreements, including the Terms; or
  * Protect the rights, property, or safety of the WEBSITE and Services, our users, or others, including exchanging information with other companies for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
