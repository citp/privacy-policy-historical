**What Information Does AltaVista Collect From You?**  
  
You can visit our site and use most of our services without having to tell us who you are or reveal any personally identifiable information to us. There are, however, a few instances where we do collect personally identifiable information in order to fulfill your request. [Click here](https://web.archive.org/web/20101231034019id_/http%3A//www.altavista.com/about/priv_details#3f) for examples of these instances.  
Whenever you visit AltaVista, our web server logs automatically receive and record [anonymous information](https://web.archive.org/web/20101231034019id_/http%3A//www.altavista.com/about/priv_details#3a) from your web browser including your [IP Address](https://web.archive.org/web/20101231034019id_/http%3A//www.altavista.com/about/priv_details#3d), AltaVista [cookie](https://web.archive.org/web/20101231034019id_/http%3A//www.altavista.com/about/priv_details#3e) information, the AltaVista page(s) you request, the time spent on each web page and any search terms you query.  
AltaVista uses this anonymous information to customize your experience on our site, to show you more relevant advertising messages, and to improve our services in general. For example, when you use AltaVista's Toolbar, AltaVista can collect aggregate information such as the web pages visited and the time spent on each page. This information allows other users to benefit from the quality searches you perform, ultimately receiving the most relevant, pertinent information. We ordinarily do not attempt to link this information to a specific person.
