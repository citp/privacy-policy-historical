### **1\. INFORMATION COLLECTION**

**Personal Information We May Collect**

  * Intel Account ID
  * Profile picture
  * Social media postings and information
  * Payment card, digital wallet, or other payment service information
  * Depending on the service we are providing to you we may also need to collect more sensitive personal information (such as location, government-issued identification, photographs, audio/video recordings, images, and biometrics) directly from you



If you submit any personal information about other people to us or to our service providers, you represent that you have the authority to do so and to permit us to use their personal information in accordance with this Privacy Notice.

We and our service providers may collect personal information from a variety of sources, including:

  * **From you or someone acting on your behalf** : We may collect personal information you or someone acting on your behalf shares with us such as your name and contact details.

  * **Through Third Parties’ Services** : We may collect personal information about you when you use third party services that utilize the Intel Services.
  * **Offline** : We may collect personal information you provide to us offline, such as when you visit our stores, attend one of our trade shows or events, place a verbal order over the phone or contact customer services. 
  * **From Other Sources** : We may collect your personal information from other sources, such as public databases, joint marketing partners, and social media platforms. We may also receive your personal information from people with whom you are "friends" or otherwise connected on social media platforms. For example, if you elect to connect your social media account to your Intel Services account, certain personal information from your social media account will be shared with us. Such information may include personal information that is part of your social media profile or your friends’ profiles. Similarly, if your social media "friends" connect their social media account to their Intel Services account, information about you may be shared with us via this “friend” connection.



**Other Information We May Collect**

Intel may also collect other information from your app, browser, or device that does not reveal your (or anyone else's) real world identity, for example:

  * IP address
  * Location data
  * Aggregated, anonymized, or de-identified information
  * Demographic information and other information provided by you (i.e., language, occupation, postal code).



We and our third-party service providers may collect this information in a variety of ways, including:

  * **Through your browser or device** : Most browsers and devices collect certain information automatically, for example, type and version of operating system, screen resolution, device manufacturer and model, language, Internet browser type and version, and the name and version of the Intel Services (such as the app) you are using. We use this information, for example, to make sure that the Intel Services function properly, analyze the performance of our products, and improve and maintain the Intel Services.
  * **Through your use of an Intel app** : When you download and use an Intel app, we and our service providers may track and collect usage data, such as the date and time the Intel app on your device accesses our servers and what information and files have been downloaded to the Intel app.

  * **IP Address** : IP addresses are automatically transmitted as part of any Internet communication, and collecting IP addresses is a common practice; many web sites, applications and other Intel Services collect IP addresses automatically. We use IP addresses for purposes such as communicating with your device, calculating usage levels of the Intel Services, helping diagnose server problems, security, and administering the Intel Services.  

  * **Location Data:**  We may collect the physical location of a connected device, for example, using satellite, cell phone tower, and WiFi signals. We may use your device’s physical location to provide you with personalized location-based Intel Services, content, and advertising. We may also share your device’s physical location, combined with information about what advertisements you viewed and other information we collect, with our marketing partners to enable them to provide you with more personalized content and to study the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. You can choose whether to allow or deny uses and/or sharing of your device’s location by changing your device settings, but if you choose to deny such uses and/or sharing, we and/or our marketing partners may not be able to provide you with the applicable personalized Intel Services, content, and advertising.
