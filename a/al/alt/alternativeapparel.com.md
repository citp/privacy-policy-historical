Alternative may use the personal information collected online to process and fulfill your order.  We also collect e-mail addresses at various locations within the site (including when you place an order) so that we can send you any necessary e-mail messages related to your purchase such as an order confirmation and Alternative marketing promotions. You can unsubscribe from these at any time by clicking the unsubscribe link at the bottom of the email.

In addition, we maintain a record of your product interests, purchases and additional information that might enable us to enhance and personalize your shopping experience.  We also monitor site use and traffic patterns to improve our web site design and the products and services we offer.  Alternative recognizes that it must maintain and use customer information responsibly.

Alternative will not rent or sell your e-mail address to any third party for any reason.  We also do not share credit card information with third parties except for the purpose of processing payment through your card provider for products you have ordered from us, as required by law.
