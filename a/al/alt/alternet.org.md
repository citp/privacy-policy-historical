After signing up online, users will receive weekly headlines and other occasional announcements from AlterNet.org.

Users can choose to [unsubscribe](http://email.alternet.org/?p=unsubscribe) from AlterNet.org headlines at any time.

AlterNet.org offers a "send this story to a friend" feature, which allows our users to inform others about an article they might be interested in. For this feature to function, we ask for email addresses from the sender and for the recipient. We do not store or save these addresses and you will not receive any communication from AlterNet.org or its partners as a result of having used this feature.

**Discussion Forums**

AlterNet.org makes [discussion forums](https://web.archive.org/discuss) available to its users. Please remember any information disclosed in these areas becomes publicly available, and therefore you should exercise caution when disclosing personal information.
