AlterNet and our parent organization, AlterNet Media, respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it through our compliance with this policy. This policy describes the types of information we may collect from you or that you may provide when you visit our website, and our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting, and disclosing that information.

When you visit AlterNet, our systems collect basic information about your computer, including: IP address (your computer’s unique signature), operating system, browser software (e.g. Chrome, Firefox, Safari), and internet service provider (e.g., Comcast, AT&T, etc.). We also collect information about what you view on the site to help us optimize content.

**Advertising**

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use aggregated information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.

**Email Newsletters and “Send a Friend” Feature**

After signing up online, users will receive email newsletters and other occasional announcements from AlterNet. In order to distribute our email, we collect subscribers’ email addresses. We do not share addresses with other companies or partners. Users can unsubscribe from email newsletters at any time.

AlterNet offers a “send this story to a friend” feature, which allows our users to inform others about an article they might be interested in. For this feature to function, we ask for email addresses from the sender and for the recipient. We do not store or save these addresses and you will not receive any communication from AlterNet or its partners as a result of having used this feature.

**Discussion Forums**

AlterNet makes comment [feedback forums](https://disqus.com/home/forum/alternet/) available to its users. Please remember any information disclosed in these areas becomes publicly available, and therefore you should exercise caution when disclosing personal information.

If you have any concerns about this, send email to [discuss@alternet.org](mailto:discuss@alternet.org).
