**AlterNet.org Privacy Policy**

AlterNet.org, and our parent organization, the [Independent Media Institute](https://web.archive.org/imi.html), guarantee that we will never, under any circumstances, sell, trade or make public your personal information, unless you designate otherwise. All personal information you provide will remain confidential. In addition, you always will have the option to edit the information provided to us or to have your personal information removed from our records. 

**Traffic Data**  
When you visit AlterNet.org, our systems collect basic information about your computer, including: IP address (your computer's unique signature), operating system (e.g., Windows 95), browser software (e.g., Microsoft Internet Explorer, Netscape), Internet Service Provider (e.g., AOL). We also collect information about what you view on the site. This information reflects our readership as a whole and is used to help us better understand the AlterNet.org community. 

**Use of Cookies**  
AlterNet.org employs cookies -- small text files placed on your computer's hard drive -- to track the type of content and sites to which our users link, the length of time they spend at any particular site and the AlterNet.org services they use. Cookies also help us diagnose problems with our server.

**Weekly Headlines and "Send a Friend" Feature**  
After signing up online, users will receive weekly headlines and other occasional announcements from AlterNet.org. In order to distribute our weekly headlines, we collect subscribers' email addresses. We do not share addresses with other companies or partners. Users can choose to [unsubscribe](https://web.archive.org/signup.html) from AlterNet.org headlines at any time. 

AlterNet.org offers a "send this story to a friend" feature, which allows our users to inform others about an article they might be interested in. For this feature to function, we ask for email addresses from the sender and for the recipient. We do not store or save these addresses and you will not receive any communication from AlterNet.org or its partners as a result of having used this feature. 

**Discussion Forums**  
AlterNet.org makes [discussion forums](https://web.archive.org/discuss) available to its users. Please remember any information disclosed in these areas becomes publicly available, and therefore you should exercise caution when disclosing personal information. 

If you have any concerns about the discussion forums, send email to [discuss@alternet.org](mailto:discuss@alternet.org). 

**Surveys**  
From time to time AlterNet.org will conduct voluntary surveys of site visitors to obtain aggregate demographic information about them. This information may be compiled and shared in the aggregate with third parties, but no personal details will be traceable or associated with specific individuals. 

**Linking to Other Sites**  
AlterNet.org contains links to other sites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites. 

**Children's Guidelines**  
Protecting the rights of children is important to us. As a result, we do not collect or maintain any information from individuals we know to be under 13 years old, and no part of AlterNet.org is intended to attract anyone under 13.
