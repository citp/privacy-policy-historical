  1. the internal use of Alt-N Technologies, including, without limitation:

To be able to serve you, your personal information may be collected, stored and/or processed, or otherwise used by or on our behalf both inside and outside of the United States of America and Canada by third party service providers or by Alt-N Technologies, to perform functions on our behalf. As a result, that country's courts, governments, or law enforcement agencies could obtain disclosure of such information under that country's laws.

## Security of Your Personal Information

Our site has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and unauthorized alteration of the information under our control. More specifically, we use SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption when collecting or transferring sensitive personal information such as credit card information.

## Fraud

**WARNING** : We take fraud seriously. It is a crime to purchase products with a false name or with the use of an invalid credit card - one that is created for the sole purpose of purchasing items illegally or using a credit card or its information, via theft or unauthorized use. It is also illegal to misuse the charge back process to take advantage of merchants. If you are a perpetrator of fraud, be aware that we will actively pursue and prosecute fraud offenders to the fullest extent of the law.

Although most fraud offenders use free email services and false names, many are not aware that their web browser transmits a unique Internet address to us which can be used by law enforcement officials to identify and locate them. We will work with cardholders, credit card companies, and enforcement authorities to pursue fraud offenders.

We will submit all fraudulent orders sent to us to The United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL) for prosecution to the fullest extent of the law.

## Changes to this Privacy Policy

Alt-N Technologies will occasionally update this Privacy Policy to reflect company and customer feedback or changes to privacy legislation. We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy to be informed of how Alt-N Technologies is protecting your personal information.

## Withdrawal of Consent

Except as required by law, we will not use or disclose your personal information for any purpose for which you refuse us consent or later withdraw your consent. If you withdraw consent, you agree that in spite of this withdrawal we may continue to use the personal information previously provided to us to the extent that we are contractually obligated to do so and to the extent necessary to enforce any contractual obligations you may have to Alt-N Technologies. You also understand that although you can use our site for some purposes without providing us with any personal information, we need personal information about you for some services, including those that require payment or involve an ongoing relationship with Alt-N Technologies or our partners. If you refuse to provide us with the information we require or later withdraw your consent to use and disclose this information, we may no longer be able to provide you with these services.
