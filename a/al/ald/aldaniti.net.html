Aldaniti is not responsible for any loss or damage you or others may suffer as a result of the loss of confidentiality of such information.</p>
<p><strong>Use of Cookies:</strong></p>
<p>Aldaniti uses Sitestat, a Nedstat product, to measure and analyse information with respect to your visits to the Aldanitisite. To that effect we use your IP address to collect, among other things, internet traffic data and data regarding your browser type and computer.</p>
<p>Aldaniti also uses cookies to improve your login experience. A cookie is a small file that is stored on your computer when you visit a website. If you visit the website again, it is recognized as a repeat visit by means of the cookie. The cookie contains merely a unique number and therefore no personal data, and the cookie cannot be used to identify you when you visit any other web sites including web sites of third parties such as Nedstat. Aldaniti also separately uses session cookies to store data on our server that are individually identifiable. When you log out of the site, these session cookies are deleted from your computer.</p>
<p>In addition Aldaniti permits carefully selected third parties to:</p>
<ol>
<li>use cookies at the Aldaniti site. Aldaniti has no access to or control over these cookies;</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the full stop at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information. Other websites that you visit may store their own cookies on your computer. Aldaniti recommends that you read each site’s privacy statement to understand their policies and practices regarding the use of cookies.</li>
</ol>
<p>You have the ability to accept or decline any of the cookies located at the Aldaniti site whether or not the cookies are provided by Aldaniti or a carefully selected third party using the settings on your browser. If you have cookies disabled in your browser you are still able to use the Aldaniti site but you will not have the benefit of an automatic login.</p>
<p>The functionality of the Aldaniti site depends upon your browser accepting session cookies. Aldaniti tracks visitors to and on the Aldaniti site by using referrer tracking. Aldaniti uses click thru and open mail tracking when sending emails. This process allows Aldaniti and carefully selected third parties the ability to profile the recipients of their communications.</p>
<p><strong>Changes to this Privacy Statement:</strong></p>
<p>Aldaniti may update this Privacy Statement from time to time. Aldaniti will also obtain your opt-in consent for any updates to this Privacy Statement that materially expand the sharing or use of your personal information in ways not disclosed in this Privacy Statement at the time of collection.</p>
