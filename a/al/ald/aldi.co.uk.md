# Customer Services - Privacy Notice - ALDI UK

**ALDI STORES LIMITED CUSTOMER PRIVACY NOTICE**

 **KEY PRINCIPLES**

Your personal data is important. So important that there are a range of laws in place to safeguard it (the most important of which is the General Data Protection Regulation or “GDPR”). ALDI is committed to doing its part to protect your personal data and comply with those laws.

In practice, this means that all personal data which we hold about you will be:

  * Used lawfully, fairly and in a transparent way.


  * Collected only for valid purposes that we have clearly explained to you and not used in any way that is incompatible with those purposes.


  * Relevant to the purposes we have told you about and limited only to those purposes.


  * Accurate and kept up to date.


  * Kept only as long as necessary for the purposes we have told you about.


  * Kept securely.



This Privacy Notice is broken down into a number of layers to allow you to more easily find out more about how we use your personal data and the steps we take to protect it.

## 2\. THE DATA WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU

  * The data we collect about you

“ **Personal data** ” means any information about an individual from which that person can be identified. It does not include data where the identity of the person concerned has been removed (which is called “ **Anonymised Data** ”).

We may collect, use, store and transfer different kinds of personal data about you. This can be broken down into the following categories:

    *  **Identity Data** includes your name, username or similar identifier, marital status, title, date of birth and gender (this will primarily be text based, but could also include audio, photos, videos and other forms of media).
    *  **Contact Data** includes billing address, delivery address, email address and telephone numbers.
    *  **Financial Data** includes bank account and payment card details.
    *  **Transaction Data** includes details about payments to and from you and other details of products and services you have purchased from us.
    *  **Technical Data** includes the internet protocol (IP) address of your device, details of the cookies on your device, your login data, browser type and version, time zone setting and location, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system and platform and other technology on the devices you use to access our Site / App.

We also collect, use and share “ **Aggregated Data** ”. Aggregated Data may be derived from your personal data but is not considered personal data in law as this data does **not** reveal your identity. For example, we may aggregate our users’ Usage Data to calculate the percentage of those users accessing a specific Site / App feature. However, if we combine or connect Aggregated Data with your personal data so that it can directly or indirectly identify you, we treat the combined data as personal data which will be used in accordance with this Privacy Notice.

We do not collect any “ **Special Category Data** ” about you. Special Category Data includes details about your race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union membership and information about your health, genetic or biometric data. Nor do we collect any information about criminal convictions and offences.

Close

  * If you fail to provide personal data

Where we need to collect personal data by law, or under the terms of a contract we have with you, and you fail to provide that data when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have or are trying to enter into with you (for example, to provide you with our products or services). In this case, we may have to cancel a product delivery or service you have with us (but we will notify you if this is the case at the time). Close

We require all third-parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. Unless specifically stated in this Privacy Notice, we do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.

Close

We will never share your personal data with any company outside the ALDI Group (as defined above) for non-ALDI related marketing purposes. Close




## 8\. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS

  * International Transfers

The data that we collect from you will be stored on secure servers within the European Economic Area (" **EEA** "). The majority of such data is held within the UK.

Certain information may be accessed and processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff maybe engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services (such as content moderation or the maintenance of our data storage facilities).

We may also share your personal data within the ALDI Group (as defined above). This may also involve transferring your data outside the EEA.

Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:

    * the transfer will be to a country that has been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission;
    * we will use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe; or
    * where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the “Privacy Shield” scheme. This scheme requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the USA.

Close




  * Data Security

We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In particular:

    * we are independently checked each year to confirm that we meet payment card industry data security standards; and
    * we use ‘Transport Layer Security’ (“TLS”) technology. TLS technology helps prevent you from inadvertently revealing personal details using an unsecured connection.

We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.

Please note that, notwithstanding the steps we take, the transmission of information via the internet can never be completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our Site / App.

Close




  * Data Retention

We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.

By law we have to keep basic information about our customers (including Contact, Identity, Financial and Transaction Data) for six years after they cease being customers for tax purposes. We typically retain this information for a further six to twelve months to ensure that no relevant claim has been made within that six year period before we dispose of it.

In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.

Close




  * Your Legal Rights

Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us using the details set out in the “Contact Details” section in Section 1 (Overview of this Notice and who we are). A summary of the rights you have is set out below:

    *  **Opting-out of Marketing** : You can ask us or third-parties to stop sending you marketing communications at any time by: (a) visiting our unsubscribe page ([www.aldi.co.uk/unsubscribe-me](http://www.aldi.co.uk/unsubscribe-me)) and following the instructions provided; (b) by using the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of any marketing communications which we send to you; or (c) by contacting us at any time using the details set out in the “Contact Details” section Section 1 (Overview of this Notice and who we are).
    *  **Data Subject Access Requests** : You have the right to request access to your personal data. This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
    *  **Correction** : You have the right to request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
    *  **Erasure** : You have the right to request we erase your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. Please note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
    *  **Processing Objection** : You have the right to object to us processing your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third-party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.
    *  **Processing Restriction** : You have the right to request we restrict the processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
    *  **Data Transfer** : You have the right to request we transfer your personal data to you or to a third-party. We will provide to you, or a third-party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
    *  **Withdrawing consent** : You have the right to withdraw your consent to processing where we are relying on that consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.

Close

  * No fee usually required

You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.Close

  * What we may need from you

We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.Close

  * Time limit to respond

We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated. Close
