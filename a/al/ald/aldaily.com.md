# Arts & Letters Daily - ideas, criticism, debate

  
Arts & Letters Daily (ALDaily) is committed to maintaining your confidence and trust, and accordingly maintains the following privacy policy to protect personal information which you provide online. 

**Personal Information**

Currently we do not ask for registration on the site, nor do we keep track of any personal information (name, address, e-mail address) of any visitors to the site. 

It is the policy of Academic Partners LLC, the parent company of Arts & Letters Daily, that personal information, such as your name, postal and e-mail address or telephone number, is private and confidential. Accordingly, any personal information you might provide is stored in a secure location, is accessible only by designated staff, and is used only for the purposes for which you provide the information (such as to reply to your request or to handle your complaint). The following policy is intended to explain how your personal information will be treated as you make use of our sites and their features. This policy may change from time to time, so please check back periodically. 

**Traffic data**

Each time a visitor comes to an Academic Partners Web site, our servers -- like most on the Web -- collect some basic technical information, including, for example, the visitor's domain name (e.g., whether the user is logged on from aol.com or whitehouse.gov), referral data (e.g., we record the address of the last URL a user visited prior to clicking through to an Academic Partners Web site) and browser and platform type (e.g., a Netscape browser on a Macintosh platform). 

We also count, track and aggregate the visitor's activity into our analysis of general traffic flows at our sites (e.g. tracking where traffic comes from, how traffic flows within the sites, etc.). To these ends, we may merge information about visitors and visits into group data, which may then be shared on an aggregated basis with our advertisers; but we will not disclose your individual identity or personally identifiable data without your permission. When we do present aggregated information to outside companies, no one will be able to identify you or contact you. 

**Advertising**

ALDaily has a contract with an outside company, DoubleClick Inc., to use its technology to deliver ads on our site. This allows us to deliver ads to users according to such factors as domain name, geographic location, and editorial content. 

ALDaily is not a member of the DoubleClick Network. Our agreement with DoubleClick specifies that information about our users may only be used to deliver ads on our site and may not be aggregated with other information collected by DoubleClick. We do not provide any personal information, such as names, postal addresses, phone numbers, or e-mail addresses, to DoubleClick. The only information DoubleClick receives is what is automatically passed by a Web browser, such as an Internet Protocol number, domain name, and browser type. 

ALDaily also works with BURST! Media to deliver ads to the site. All users who receive an ad served by BURST! retain complete anonymity where BURST! is concerned. As ads are delivered, BURST! does not acquire or collect any personal information about you. Your name, address, phone number, and email address all remain your private properties. BURST! does, however, collect information which is specific to how you use the Internet. BURST! servers note non-personally identifying details such as, but not limited to, the server you are logged onto, the geographic location of the ISP you use, the type of browser you use, and your IP address. This information is obtained solely for the purpose of targeting ads and measuring a given ad's effectiveness on behalf of BURST! clients and customers. To view Burst's complete privacy policy statement, please [visit their site](http://www.burstmedia.com/release/privacy.asp). 

**Use of cookies**

A "cookie" is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies can be used for several purposes, but we only use cookies in a limited way. We allow our traffic counter(Hitbox.com) to use cookies to identify the number of unique browsers that visit our sites and to keep track of how many times browsers visit the site. 

We also allow BURST! Media to use cookies to help serve advertisments. Unlike many other ad networks, BURST! does not use cookies for the purpose of setting unique identifiers that are used to identify you whenever you return to a web site within the BURST! Network, they are just used to help serve ads on the site you are visiting. Cookies cannot be used to identify individuals, only machines, so advertisers will not know who you are. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent that use if you desire. 

**Promotion**

From time to time, ALDaily may sponsor sweepstakes, contests or other events which require the collection, processing and storage of individual contact and demographic information (e.g., your age and state of residence) to be used for the event. ALDaily may also co-sponsor these events along with other companies, in which case the user's individual contact and demographic information is likely to be shared with other participating sponsors, who may use this information as they wish. A registrant's personal contact and demographic information will not be released to any third-party organization other than named sponsors without the user's consent, and ALDaily will request that such named sponsors uphold the privacy of the registrants' information by not distributing or sharing such information with any other businesses or organizations. 

**Surveys**

ALDaily may from time to time conduct voluntary surveys of visitors to the site to obtain aggregate demographic information about them. Such information may be compiled and shared in the aggregate with advertisers and other third parties, but no personal details will be traceable or associated with specific individuals. 

**Other disclosure of personal information**

ALDaily will not otherwise use or disclose any personal information you provide to us without your consent except (i) as described in this privacy policy, or (ii) as required by law, court order or as requested by other government or law enforcement authority. 

**Other sites**

ALDaily contai ns many links to other sites on the Web. We cannot control and are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of such other Web sites. 

**Who can I ask if I have any additional questions?**

If you have any further questions or concerns about ALD's privacy policies and use of personal information, please send them to [web@academicpartners.com](mailto:web@academicpartners.com)

New material is added to **Arts & Letters Daily** six days a week. We continually test links for reliability. However, despite our best efforts, links may fail (often only temporarily) without warning. We apologize for any inconvenience. 

New links are added at or near the tops of sections, with older ones sliding down the columns accordingly. Most items will continue to be available for three or more days. 

Items removed from the main page are transferred to our [**ARCHIVE**](http://www.aldaily.com/arch.htm). As most links will eventually expire, we urge readers who see an item especially worth keeping to save it while the link is still valid. Items removed from the main page during 1999 have been moved to our [**1999 ARCHIVE**](http://www.aldaily.com/arch99.htm). Items removed from the main page during 1998 have been moved to our [**1998 ARCHIVE**](http://www.aldaily.com/arch98.htm)
