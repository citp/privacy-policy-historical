You will have additional options at different points in the site to provide more information about yourself (such as details of the mobile network that you use, number of children that you have or car owned by you). We encourage you to take advantage of these options, so we can provide you with a more personalized experience on our site.

**Security and storage of your personal information**

The Internet is not a 100% secure medium for communication and, accordingly, Aldaniti cannot guarantee the security of any information you send to Aldaniti via the Internet. Aldaniti is not responsible for any loss or damage you or others may suffer as a result of the loss of confidentiality of such information.

You must type the correct password to access your Aldaniti account information. It is your responsibility to ensure the security of your Aldaniti password and not to reveal this information to others.

**Use of Cookies**

A ldaniti uses Sitestat, a Nedstat product, to measure and analyse information with respect to your visits to the Aldaniti site. To that effect we use your IP address to collect, among other things, internet traffic data and data regarding your browser type and computer.

Aldaniti also uses cookies to improve your login experience. A cookie is a small file that is stored on your computer when you visit a website. If you visit the website again, it is recognized as a repeat visit by means of the cookie. The cookie contains merely a unique number and therefore no personal data., and the cookie cannot be used to identify you when you visit any other web sites including web sites of third parties such as Nedstat.

For example, Aldaniti may store your login details in a cookie that will remain on your computer after you log out. This cookie allows you to be automatically logged in the next time you visit the site. If you are using a public computer or for any other reason do not want this information to be stored, you can un-check the "remember me" tick box when you log-in or register and this cookie will not be used. 

Aldaniti also separately uses session cookies to store data on our server that are individually identifiable. When you log out of the site, these session cookies are deleted from your computer.

In addition Aldaniti permits carefully selected third parties to:

  1. use cookies at the Aldaniti site. Aldaniti has no access to or control over these cookies;
  2. employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the full stop at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information. 



Other websites that you visit may store their own cookies on your computer. Aldaniti recommends that you read each site's privacy statement to understand their policies and practices regarding the use of cookies. 

You have the ability to accept or decline any of the cookies located at the Aldaniti site whether or not the cookies are provided by Aldaniti or a carefully selected third party using the settings on your browser. If you have cookies disabled in your browser you are still able to use the Aldaniti site but you will not have the benefit of an automatic login.

The functionality of the Aldaniti site depends upon your browser accepting session cookies. Aldaniti tracks visitors to and on the Aldaniti site by using referrer tracking. Aldaniti uses click thru and open mail tracking when sending emails. This process allows Aldaniti and carefully selected third parties the ability to profile the recipients of their communications.

**Changes to this Privacy Statement**

Aldaniti may update this Privacy Statement from time to time. When we do, we will also revise the "last updated" date at the top and bottom of the Privacy Statement. Aldaniti will also obtain your opt-in consent for any updates to this Privacy Statement that materially expand the sharing or use of your personal information in ways not disclosed in this Privacy Statement at the time of collection.
