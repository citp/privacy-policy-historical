## Internet-Based Advertising

Data about your activities online is being collected on our Sites for use in providing advertising tailored to your individual interests.  You may choose whether or not to have your information collected for that purpose.  This section of the U.S. Online Privacy Notice provides details and explains how to exercise that choice.

You may see certain ads on other websites because we participate in advertising networks administered by third parties and utilize third party service providers.  Networks track your online activities over time by collecting information through automated means, including through the use of the technologies described in the “Information We Collect By Automated Means” section above, and they use this information to show you advertisements that are tailored to your individual interests.  The information they collect includes information about your visits to our Sites, such as the pages you have viewed.  This collection and ad targeting takes place both on our Sites and on third-party websites that participate in the ad networks, such as sites that feature advertisements delivered by the ad networks.  This process also helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.  To learn more about ad networks, including how to opt out, visit [www.aboutads.info/choices](http://www.aboutads.info/choices).  We may also use third party service providers, such as Google’s Double Click to collect information through automated means for the purpose of direct Aldi-related advertising and other content to you.

We also may disclose information about you (i) if we are required to do so by law, regulation or legal process (such as a court order or subpoena), (ii) in response to requests by government agencies, such as law enforcement authorities, or (iii) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity.  We reserve the right to transfer any information we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets (including in the event of a reorganization, dissolution or liquidation).
