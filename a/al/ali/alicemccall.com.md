At alice McCALL we respect your privacy. We collect personal information only for the purposes of fulfilling your order. This may include your name, email address, phone numbers, home address and shipping details.

We may also use the information to assist in providing you with relevant information about our product and special offers that may be of interest to you but only if you subscribe to our newsletter.

Any information that we no longer require is destroyed securely. An exception to this may be retention of the information for data analysis.

However, if this occurs then the information will be retained in a form that does not allow you to be identified from that information.

We may also use personal information to perform credit checks, to authenticate your identity, to validate your credit card, to obtain an initial credit card authorisation and to authorise individual purchase transactions.

Any and all the information collected on this site will be kept strictly confidential and will not be sold, reused, rented, disclosed, or loaned.

Any information you give us will be held with the utmost care and will not be used in ways that you have not consented to. If you have any questions please feel free to contact us.

The alice McCALL eBoutique is a secure site. We use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology for secure data transmission over the internet.

We encrypt all of your personal information, including credit card number, name and address, so that it cannot be read as the information travels over the internet.
