<br><small>(Updated on 16/10/01)</small></font>
</center>
<font class="C">
<br><br>
By using our website, you consent to the collection of use of your information in the manner we describe below. 
<br><br>
<b>Our Commitment to Privacy</b>
<br>
Alibaba respects the privacy of your information. Our Privacy Policy governs our online information practices and reflects our commitment to protect your privacy. 
<br><br>
<b>Security Measures</b>
<br>
We employ reasonable and current security methods to prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy and ensure correct use of information.
<br><br>
Your account information and profile are password protected. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. Our personnel will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited e-mail. Remember to sign out of your account and close your browser window when you have finished your session. 
<br><br>
No data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be perfectly secured. As a result, while we try to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk. 
<br><br>
<b>The Information We Collect</b>
<br>
At the time you register for the services provided on our website, you would be required to provide information such as your name, address, phone number, company name and address and other personally-identifying information. We need this information to provide services that you request and to let you know of additional services about which you might be interested. We may also use this information to customize your experience in using our website. 
<br><br>
In addition, we automatically gather general statistical information about our website and visitors, such as IP address, browsers, pages viewed, number of visitors etc. but in doing so we do not reference you by individual name, email address or telephone number. We use this data in the aggregate to determine how much our customers use parts of our site so we can improve our site. We may provide this statistical information to third parties, but when we do so, we do not provide personally-identifying information without your permission.  
<br><br>
If you establish a credit account with us or our providers or if you purchase a product or service from Alibaba, we may collect additional information, including billing information, credit card numbers and expiration dates and tracking information from cheques or money orders. Such information shall be provided to banking merchants to enable transactions to take place and to allow us to determine the credit-worthiness of our users.
<br><br>
<b>The Way We Use Information</b>
<br>
We use your personally-identifying information to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to statistically analyse site usage, to improve our content and product offerings and to customize our site's content, layout and service.
<br><br>
We may use your information to deliver information to you that, in some cases, is targeted to your interests, such as targeted banners, new services and promotions. We may use your email address, mailing address and phone number to contact you regarding administrative notices, new product offerings and communications relevant to your use of our website.
<br><br>
We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, to manage our website and our server capabilities and to enhance our website based on the usage pattern data we receive. 
<br><br>
<b>Public Access to Information</b>
<br>
The information you provide will be made available to all users of our website. Please remember that any information you disclose becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose personally-identifying information. 
<br><br>

<b>Disclosure of Information</b>
<br>
We may use or disclose information to resolve disputes, investigate problems, to enforce our terms and conditions and User Agreement in relation to the use of this website and our services. 
<br><br>
We reserve the right to disclose your information where we have reason to believe that such disclosure is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be infringing (or threatening to infringe) or who may otherwise be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) our title, rights, interests or property or those of other website users or of anyone else who could be harmed by such activities. 
<br><br>
We also reserve the rights to disclose, without notice to you, personal information in response to a subpoena or other judicial order or when we believe in good faith that such disclosure is required by any law, regulation or listing requirement or by any stock/securities exchange, governmental or regulatory authority.
<br><br>
<b>Co-Branded Relationships</b>
<br>
We have established relationships with other parties to offer you the benefit of other products and services which we ourselves do not offer. We offer you access to these other parties either through the use of hyperlinks to their sites from our website, or through offering "co-branded" sites in which both ourselves and these other parties share the same URL, domain name or pages within a domain name on the Internet. The Privacy Policy of such other parties may differ from ours. We therefore encourage you to read that policy before responding of any offers, products or services provided by such other parties. 
<br><br>
<b>Cookies</b>
<br>
As part of our service, we use cookies to store and sometimes track information about you. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a webserver and stored on your computer's hard drive. Generally, we use cookies to remind us who you are and enable us to access your account information so you do not have to re-enter it; gather statistical information about usage by registered or unregistered users, research visiting patters and help target advertisements based on user interests; assist our retail partners track visits and process orders; and track progress and participation in promotions. 
<br><br>
Preference and options configurations in your browser determine if and how a cookie will be accepted. You can change those configurations on your computer if you desire. By changing your preferences, you can accept all cookies, you can be notified when a cookie is set or you can reject all cookies. If you do so and cookies are disabled, you may be required to re-enter your information more often and certain features of our site may be unavailable. 
<br><br>
<b>Children Under 13</b>
<br>
Alibaba does not target children and expects not to sell any of our products or services to children. Alibaba regards "children" as minors younger than 13 years old. However, we have no way of distinguishing the age of individuals who access our website and so we carry out the same Privacy Policy for individuals of all ages. If a child has provided us with personally-identifying information without parental or guardian consent, the parent or guardian should contact us to remove the information and opt out of promotional opportunities. 
<br><br>
<b>Changes to Privacy Policy</b>
<br>
Any changes to our Privacy Policy will be communicated through our website in advance of its effective date. Information collected before changes are made will be secured according to the previous Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy was last amended on 7 October 1999.
<br><br>
<b>Correcting Your Information</b>
<br>
You can access the information that we collect online and maintain through normal updating methods. To update, correct or delete this information, you can contact <a href="http://www.alibaba.com/bin/user/edit">http://www.alibaba.com/bin/user/edit</a>. 
<br><br>
<b>Your feedback</b>
<br>
Alibaba welcomes your continuous input regarding our Privacy Policy or our services provided to you. You may send us your comments and responses to <a href="mailto:alibaba@alibaba-inc.com">alibaba@alibaba-inc.com</a>.
