# ALIEN - Privacy Policy

**PRIVACY**  
Protecting your privacy is important to us. We have posted the following statement to help you understand how Alien Technology collects, uses, and safeguards the personal information you provide on our web site.  


**INFORMATION COLLECTION**  
When you browse Alien's web site, you do so anonymously. Personal information -- including your E-mail address -- is not collected.

There are times that we may request that you voluntarily supply us with personal information, including your E-mail address and possibly your postal address, for purposes such as correspondence, site registration, registering for a new product, or participating in an online survey.

Like many other commercial web sites, the Alien Technology web site may utilize a standard technology called a "cookie" to collect information about how the site is used.

**INFORMATION USE**  
If you provide us with your E-mail address, or have done so in the past, we may upon occasion send you E-mail updates, and/or offers. We may use information you have given us to, for example, provide a service, measure consumer interest in our various services, and inform you about new products and services. These offers may be based on information you provided in your initial transaction with us, in surveys, or from information that may indicate purchasing preferences and lifestyle.

We also ask you if you want us to share your personal information with other companies that offer related services. If you do not want us or other companies to contact you, you can choose to "opt out," and Alien Technology will respect your wishes.

**DECLINING E-MAIL OFFERS**  
Alien provides customers with an easy means to decline receiving E-mail offers. Although customers tell us they appreciate receiving notice of new events, product and opportunities at Alien, we recognize the importance of providing you with choices. At any time, you may request to discontinue receiving these offers from us by simply replying to the E-mail and informing us of your preferences. All E-mail offers that you receive from Alien will inform you of how to decline receiving further E-mail offers.  


**YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THESE TERMS**  
By using this site, you signify your assent to the Alien Technology Corporation Customer Internet Privacy Statement. If you do not agree to this policy, please do not use our site. We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions from this policy at any time. Please check this page periodically for changes. Your continued use of the Alien Technology site following the posting of changes to these terms means you accept these changes.
