Please read the following privacy policy to understand how your personal information will be treated if it is collected through this Web site (the “Site”) by Company. Except as explicitly provided herein, this Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Company does not own or control, or to people that Company does not employ or manage. This Privacy Policy may change from time to time so please check back periodically. The current version of this Privacy Policy is dated February 11, 2008. <br> <br>Any dispute over privacy is subject to this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service. Please note that the use of information that we gather is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time of use. You should check this Site frequently to see recent changes in this Site’s Privacy Policy and its Terms of Service.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

	<h3>1. What personal information is collected from me?</h3>
	<p>The types of personal information collected on these pages may include, but are not limited to, your name, email address, standard contact information including addresses and phone numbers, transactional information, and financial information such as credit card or bank account numbers. You also may provide additional information to us when you conduct a search on this Site, place an order for merchandise, complete a questionnaire or an entry form for sweepstakes or contests, and participate in forums and chat rooms or other community features. We may also ask you to voluntarily provide us with information regarding, for example, your personal or professional interests, demographics, experiences with the services we provide and contact preferences. Wherever Company collects personal information, we make an effort to include a link to this Privacy Policy on that page.<br> <br>Company may gather and collect any of the following: (1) IP addresses (the Internet address of a computer) to track a user’s session while the user remains anonymous, (2) computer and connection information such as browser type and version, operating system, and platform, (3) purchase history, (4) the full Uniform Resource Locator (URL) clickstream to, through, and from this Site, including date and time, (5) cookie number, and (6) Web pages and/or products you viewed or searched. Company analyzes this data for certain trends in statistics, such as which parts of this Site users visit and how long they spend there. In general, we do not link your IP addresses to anything personally identifiable to you. During some visits Company may use software tools such as JavaScript to measure and collect session information, including page response times, download errors, page interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs), and methods used to browse away from the page.<br> <br>Company gathers and stores certain types of information whenever you use this Site or the services made available hereon (the “Services”). For example, like many Web sites, we use "cookies," and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses this Site. Various third party companies offer utilities that are designed to allow or help you visit and use Web sites anonymously; Please note, however, that Company may not be able to provide you with a personalized experience on this Site if you choose to utilize any such utilities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<div id="pp2">
	<h3>2. What are cookies and how are they used by Company?</h3>
	<p>Company may place Internet cookies on your hard drive. Internet cookies are small files that may be placed on your hard disk for record-keeping purposes. Cookies are used to (a) remind us of who you are in order to deliver you better service, (b) estimate our audience size by determining repeat usage of the Web site to help target advertisements based on user interests and behavior, (c) track your progress and entries in promotions, sweepstakes and contests, if any, and (d) measure certain traffic patterns for use as a research tool to understand how our users’ habits are similar or different from one another.

	<h3>3. Does Company use Web beacons, and, if so, how?</h3>
	<p>Company may employ Web beacons (also called single-pixel gifs), which are customized links or similar technologies, when sending you newsletters or promotional emails. Web beacons allow Company to (a) determine whether you have opened, or acted upon, a promotional email and which links you have clicked on in order to deliver to you more focused email communications and other information, (b) allow Company to count the number of users who have visited certain Web pages and effectively deliver co-branded services, and (c) enable Company to compile aggregated statistics and determine the efficacy of promotions by using Web beacons from third parties, without allowing such third parties to use Web beacons on this Site to collect or access your personal information.</p><p>We may allow third-parties, including our authorized service providers, IAC companies, advertising companies, and ad networks, to display advertisements or provide applications and services on our site.  These companies may use tracking technologies, such as <a href="http://www.google.com/Top/Computers/Programming/Internet/Cookies/" target="_blank">cookies</a> or <a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/W/Web_beacon.html" target="_blank">web beacons</a>, to collect information about users who view or interact with their advertisements or use their applications and services.  Our website does not provide any personal information to these third parties.  This information allows them to deliver targeted advertisements and personalized online experiences and gauge their effectiveness.  Some of the third-party advertising companies may be advertising networks that are members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offers a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies (<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org" target="_blank">www.networkadvertising.org</a>).</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div id="pp4">
