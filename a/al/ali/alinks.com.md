ALinks is strongly committed to protecting the privacy of our users. This policy applies only to ALinks. Our privacy policy statement will help you understand ALinks's commitment to safeguarding your private information.

INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE  
ALinks does not collect any personal or individually identifiable information without the informed consent of the user. The only page where we collect personally identifiable information is on our .Contact Us. form. We use this information (such as name, email address) only to respond to your inquiries or feedback. You may not opt-out of receiving our response. We will not sell, share, or rent your confidential information to third parties, including individuals or other organizations.

INTELLIGENT CACHING   
ALinks may occasionally use caching technology to cache frequently requested Web content. Caching mechanisms are used to serve web pages directly from the ALinks local storage as a means to make web performance faster and more efficient. We do not cache or locally store any end-to-end web content transfers, like e-commerce transactions, via the Secure Socket Layer (SSL).

INTERNET COOKIES   
ALinks may use a feature of your Internet browser called a "cookie" to assign a unique identification to your computer to maintain a session state. These short-lived cookies are not written to your hard drive and are removed when you close the browser. This means that not only are your web activities kept private, but also that your hard drive memory is not depleted. Our customizable user preferences feature uses a single cookie, which is stored on your local hard drive. This cookie is used for user customizable privacy options. ALinks does not, and will not, use cookies to retrieve personal information about you.

We use a third-party tracking service that uses cookies to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our site in the aggregate usage and volume statistics to help target advertisements to the user.

Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies on our site. We have no access to or control over these cookies. See Third Party Advertisers.

Performance statistics logs are collected from time to time in order to evaluate the scalability of the ALinks service and/or introduce new service enhancements. Log files are not tied to personally identifiable information.
