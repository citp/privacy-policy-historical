# Privacy Policy - Alien Skin Software

This privacy policy governs our online store and website. Refer to our [app privacy policy](https://web.archive.org/company/app-privacy-policy/ "App Privacy Policy") for information about our software products.

Below are the circumstances in which we collect contact information and an explanation of what we do with it.

### When You Order from Us

We collect information necessary to complete your order and deliver it to you. This usually includes your name, email address, shipping address and phone number.

If you give us a credit card number, we will only keep it around long enough to process the order. Afterward, we retain only the last four digits.

### When You Register with Us

If you buy one of our products elsewhere, you can register with us through our web site. During that process, we will collect your product license code along with your contact information: name, address, phone, email and platform.

### Mailing List Use

We use the list approximately once a month to e-mail our newsletter. We also use it a few times a year for new product announcements or sales. It is rarely used for anything else because we don’t want you to get sick of us.

When you place an order in our store or register a product with us, we will send an email invitation to join our mailing list if you aren’t already on it. You will only be subscribed if you click the opt-in link in that email message.

Any message sent to our mailing list has an option at the bottom for being removed from the list. Just click that link and you won’t hear from us again.

### Sharing Personal Information

We do not share your personal information with other companies.

We may share information with the police if legally required to do so or if we are investigating illegal activities such as suspected fraud.

### Updating Your Information with Us

You can easily update or delete your contact information, or ask to be added or removed from our mailing list, at any time. Simply phone, email or mail us with your request:
