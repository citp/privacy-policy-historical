 **PRIVACY POLICY**

Alumniclass.com provides a community friendly website (the "Site") for alumni and school faculty to reconnect, email, exchange information and plan reunions. We are committed to protecting the privacy of our members' personal information. Our members' privacy is our number one priority. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to the terms of Alumniclass.com Terms of Use. Use of the Site is conditioned upon your agreement to be bound by the Terms of Use, which incorporate this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the Terms of Use or this Privacy Policy, you must discontinue using the services on our Site and terminate your membership. The Privacy Policy is subject to change at the discretion of Alumniclass.com; all changes will be posted and become effective immediately. Members should read through the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy periodically to learn of any changes.

**COLLECTION AND USE OF INFORMATION**

The information you provide in establishing your profile (such as your name, e-mail address, hobbies, occupation, marital status, community affiliations, and all other information you provide on the site) will be maintained confidentially by Alumniclass.com. Note that the ONLY required information of you is your full name, e-mail address, where you attended school, male or female student, and the country and state in which you currently reside. Although e-mail addresses are required, you are not required to verify your email address to become a member. Members are given the option to submit more detailed information about themselves, including (but not limited to) their maiden name, city in which they reside, birthday, marital status, and activities they participated in during high school. However, once you are registered, your name, country of residence, your graduating year or years attended and any other information you provide on the site, will be displayed on the Site and you will no longer be anonymous to other individuals who access the site. Because this information is publicly displayed on the Site, it may appear in the results of searches conducted on internet search engines while you are a member of the Site and potentially for some time period after your membership is terminated, depending upon the search engine's indexing practices.

Alumniclass.com WILL NOT share your information with third-party solicitors unless you are a reunion coordinator or committee member seeking reunion planning information from outside sources. The Site does maintain the right to use your information (e.g. your name, where you graduated from, your class year and any other information deemed necessary by site administration) in promoting the alumni site to other alumni, to the school or school district, or through tools such as electronic newsletters, e-mails and all other methods deemed appropriate at the sole discretion of site administration.

**COMMUNICATIONS ON THE SITE**

Alumniclass.com does not disclose communications between members. Note that all of the information stored within the Site's database and server is the property of Alumniclass.com. We will not share this information unless it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Alumniclass.com Terms of Use, or as otherwise required necessary by site administration or by law enforcement.

**EMAIL COMMUNICATIONS**

By registering on the Alumniclass.com website and providing your email address you are agreeing to receive email communications from us. By proceeding past the first page of the registration process you are agreeing that a profile and membership will be created for you, and the email address that you provided during registration will be used for Alumniclass.com to send email communications to you. By registering you agree that Alumniclass.com can and will, email you from time to time with promotions, newsletters, apparel sales, discounts, updates, reunion information, paid membership promotions and all other information that Alumniclass.com deems at our sole discretion to be necessary to email you. If you wish not to receive certain emails from Alumniclass.com you can change your email settings or unsubscribe from certain emails. Once logged in you can change your email settings by going to "My Class Page" clicking on "My Profile" and "Update Settings" From there you will be able to make changes to your email preferences. You may also follow the "unsubscribe" option provided on emails. Please note that when changing your email preferences, you may still be emailed administrative notices or other necessary information regarding your membership account.

**YOUR PUBLISHED INFORMATION**

Information you submit to message boards and group photo albums may be displayed to other registered members and to the public, so please exercise care in deciding what information and images you wish to disclose. The Site will review information posted periodically to ensure only appropriate postings, in the sole discretion of the Site, are posted. We have the right to monitor any activity and content associated with the public and private forums and interactive areas on the site.

**SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION**

We have installed physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to store and maintain your profile and member information in a secure environment. You will be required to use a password to access certain areas of the Site where certain types of your information can be changed or deleted. It is of the utmost importance, then, that you take precautions to protect yourself against unauthorized access to your password. It is your responsibility to maintain the confidentiality of your password. It is each member’s due caution to be aware of any information they place on their profile that they deem private. We cannot guarantee that the safeguards we employ will perfectly maintain the privacy of profile information from the threats of others and factors beyond our control.
