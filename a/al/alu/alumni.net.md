  * **Does Alumni.NET sell my Information?**



Alumni.NET will never sell the information in this web site to direct marketers or any other parties without the specific consent of the registrant. Since the service may depend on some advertising revenue, Alumni.NET reserves the right to compile and distribute aggregate information from the alumni registries. 

  * **How secure are my dealings with Alumni.NET? How secure is Alumni.NET's Technical System?**



Alumni.NET uses multiple custom-built servers running on secure and reliable OS as well as highly-scalable, enterprise-class mail software. Member data on the servers is stored on RAID sub-systems to ensure integrity, availability, and fast access. All servers are monitored 24 hours a day to ensure maximum uptime and performance. A world-class facility houses the servers, with raised floors, HVAC temperature control systems, seismically braced racks, fire suppression systems, fully redundant power on the premises, and multiple backup generator systems for crisis and disaster protection. 

The facility is connected to the network backbone from multiple sources for the highest level of reliability through BGP (Border Gateway Protocol), which routes information to networks by the shortest and fastest route possible. A 100% network headroom policy is maintained, eliminating the concern for network congestion. This means that additional backbone and intra-network capacity is provisioned when 50% utilization is achieved. The industry standard, closer to 80%, would allow possible line saturation. 

  * **SPAM Prevention**



Spamming of members is prevented by a database system that never shows the e-mail addresses of its members. Members are able to send messages to each other through the use of website forms.
