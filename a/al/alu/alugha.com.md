The Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG) and the Telemedia Act (TMG) form the legal framework for data protection.

### Collection of general information

With every access to this offer, information is automatically collected by us or the web space provider. This information, also known as server log files, is of a general nature and does not allow any conclusions to be drawn about your person.

Among other things, the following is recorded: name of website, file, date, data volume, web browser and web browser version, operating system, domain name of your internet provider, the so-called referrer URL (the page from which you accessed our website) and the IP address.

Without this data it would be technically impossible to deliver and display website contents. In this respect, the collection of data is mandatory. In addition, anonymous information is used for statistical purposes. It helps to optimize our services and technology. We also reserve the right to check log files if there is suspicion of any illegal use of our services.

### Handling of personal data

Definition: Personal data is any information that uniquely identifies a person. It is therefore data that can be traced back to an individual.

Such personal data includes the first name and surname, telephone number as well as e-mail address. Personal data also includes information on hobbies, memberships and preferences as well as websites that have been accessed.

This data is only collected, used and if necessary, passed on by the provider if the legislator expressly permits this or if the user agrees to the collection, processing, use and to the disclosure of the data.
