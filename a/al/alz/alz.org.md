We maintain reasonable administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect Personal Information against loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction as required by applicable law.  For instance, we use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption, which is one of the leading security protocols for data transfers on the internet.  We also restrict access to your Personal Information to authorized staff with a legitimate and specific business purpose.

  * Security monitoring tools 
  * Regular network scans 
  * Internal and external penetration tests



Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure.  Despite our safeguards, we cannot guarantee the security of information transmitted to us via the internet.  Once we have received your information, we will use all reasonable safeguards to protect it, but if you have reason to believe that your use of the website is no longer secure, please contact us as detailed below.

**Cookies and Web Beacons**

A cookie is a small text file that is sent to your web browser and stored on your hard drive, and a web beacon is an object embedded on a webpage that allows certain parties to check whether content associated with the web beacon has been accessed.  The use of cookies and web beacons is a standard practice among websites to collect information about visitors' activities while using the website.  We use cookies on our website to enable the site to work properly, collect aggregate data about usage of our websites and manage online advertising.  The information generated by the cookies and web beacons we use when you visit our website is anonymized and does not contain any Personal Information which can be associated with an identifiable individual.  We also allow third parties to place cookies and web beacons on our website in order to provide you with targeted advertising on unaffiliated websites based on your visit to our website and other unaffiliated websites you may visit. 

To manage the cookies that are placed on your computer, you may configure your web browser to refuse, accept or delete cookies from our website at any time.  The help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether.  Turning off your browser's cookies will also limit the information collected by web beacons.  Please note that if cookies are disabled or removed, not all features of our website will operate as intended.
