### Direct Marketing

We will not provide your personal information to any third parties for the purpose of direct marketing unless you have provided your express consent by activating the "opt-in" option on the Website. In such cases, we shall only transfer to the third party that data which is necessary to allow you to receive this direct marketing (e.g. name, address and email addresses). You may remove your consent at any time after which we will no longer disclose your information. Each relevant third party will show their contact information in their marketing material. We have no control over such third party marketing material, we therefore disclaim all liability that may arise from such third party marketing material. 

You expressly agree to such uses of your personal information. 

## 5\. Who we share your information with

For example, we give your details to the hotel you have booked. We do not share your information for marketing purposes unless you have specifically agreed that we may do this. 

Information that you provide may be stored and processed in and transferred between any of the countries in which our Travel Providers operate. Where necessary to deliver the services you have asked for, information which you provide may therefore be transferred to countries which do not have data protection laws equivalent to those in force in the European Economic Area (EEA), in particular where your booking destination is outside the EEA. Where this is the case, we take all reasonable steps to ensure that appropriate protection of your data is maintained. Please note, if we cannot pass this information to the relevant Travel Providers, whether in the EEA or not, we cannot provide the services to you. 

We may disclose your personal information: 

  * to the extent that we are required to do so by law;
  * in connection with any legal proceedings or prospective legal proceedings;
  * for the purposes of fraud prevention;
  * to a prospective purchaser of any business or asset which we are contemplating selling



You expressly agree to such transfers and disclosures of your personal information. 

## 6\. How we protect your information

While we cannot guarantee the security of data sent over the internet, we have implemented appropriate administrative, technical, and physical security procedures to help prevent the loss, misuse or unauthorised alteration of the personal information you provide to us. In particular we use encryption when transmitting sensitive personal information (such as credit card details) and we employ firewalls and intrusion detection systems to help prevent unauthorised access to your information. 

You are responsible for keeping your password and user details confidential. We will not ask you for your password (except when you log in to the Website). 

## 7\. Your Rights

You may instruct us to provide you with any personal information we hold about you. Provision of such information will be subject to: 

  * the payment of a fee (currently £10.00); and

We may withhold such personal information to the extent permitted by law. 

Please note that details of any bookings you have made with us can be viewed by logging in through the 'My Account' section of our website. 

We ask you to opt in before we use your personal information for marketing purposes.
