## Security

We cannot however, guarantee total or absolute security, as no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. As part of our commitment to you the customer, we will strive to implement and use any commercially acceptable means available to protect your personal information.

Our operating systems and software are always up to date with the latest security patches and updates.

Firewalls are used extensively to protect data by opening only the necessary channels to the necessary entities on our servers. This means that if a PC or location does not need to have access to our servers for our system to work properly, they will not be able to contact that server. This greatly reduces the chances of hackers being able to penetrate our system. We use the latest anti-virus software to scan our servers in real time against any suspicious files and traffic. Virus definitions are updated multiple times per day. 

All our software runs on RAID hard drives to prevent downtime in the event of hardware failure. We also protect our data from hardware failure or disaster events by running daily backups.
