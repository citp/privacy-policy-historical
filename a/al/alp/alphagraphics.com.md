Your privacy is important to us. To protect your privacy, we provide this policy explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used on this Web site. Because AlphaGraphics is committed to protecting your privacy, we disclose our information practices on our Web site. If you feel that AlphaGraphics is not abiding by its posted privacy policy, please contact the Webmaster.

 **Information Collection and Use**  
AlphaGraphics is the sole owner of the information collected on this Web site. We will not sell, share or rent this information to others in ways different from what those disclosed in this policy. Generally, we collect the domain name, e-mail address, Uniform Resource Locator (URL), and Internet Protocol (IP) address of visitors to our Web site, those who communicate with us via e-mail and those who subscribe to our e-News newsletter. AlphaGraphics also collects information that is volunteered to us, for example when users answer a survey, register at this Web site, place an order or request information. In addition, AlphaGraphics also collects nonpersonal information in the aggregate, such as what pages site visitors access and how often.

  **With Whom Do We Share Information?**  
We may share personally identifiable information, such as e-mail addresses, with service providers hired to assist us, for example, to send e-mails and newsletters regarding AlphaGraphics products and services and to host our Web site. Other than as disclosed in this section and in the Security section below, AlphaGraphics will only share personal identifying information with third parties with your permission. We may share aggregate information about our users with advertisers, business partners, sponsors and other third parties without your permission. In the event that we are acquired, merged or sell certain of our assets, then your personally identifiable information may be transferred and become subject to a different privacy policy. 

  **Registration**  
To use certain parts of this Web site, a user may be required to complete a registration form. During registration, a user is required to give his or her contact information (such as name and e-mail address). This information is used to contact the user to respond to user requests.

  **Order**  
AlphaGraphics may offer products or services from our Web site. We request information from the user on our order forms. Here a user must provide contact information (name and shipping address) and financial information (like credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customers’ orders. If we have questions when processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the user.

  **Cookies**  
A "cookie" is a piece of data stored on the user’s hard drive containing information about the user. We use may use “cookies” to store visitor preferences, record session information, record user-specific information on what pages users access or visit, alert visitors to new areas that we think might be of value to them when they return to our site, or record past activity at a site to provide better service when visitors return to our site.

  **Log Files**  
We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.

  **Links**  
This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that AlphaGraphics is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy policy of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy policy applies solely to information collected by this Web site.

  **Newsletter**  
If a user wishes to subscribe to a newsletter or other AlphaGraphics publication, we ask for contact information such as name and e-mail address. Users are not required to subscribe to our publications as a condition for using our Web site.

  **Surveys**  
From time to time, our site requests information from users via surveys. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary, and therefore, the user has a choice whether or not to disclose information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes if applicable. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.

  **Children**  
This Web site does not sell products for purchase by children. If you are under the age of 18, you may use this Web site only in conjunction with and under the supervision of your parents or guardians.

  **Security**  
This Web site takes precautions to protect our users’ information. When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, their information is protected both online and offline. When our registration form requests sensitive information (such as a credit card number), that information is encrypted using Secure Socket Layer or SSL.

 While we use encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also take reasonable steps to protect user information offline. All of our users’ information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information. Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information, we cannot assure you that personally identifiable information that we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this privacy policy. Please note, however, that information disclosed online is never 100% secure and that protection of passwords and other information controlled by you is your responsibility. If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an e-mail to Webmaster. 

 AlphaGraphics reserves the right to disclose personal information about any user that AlphaGraphics deems, in good faith, to be necessary to: comply with applicable state and federal law or legal process; or protect AlphaGraphics’ rights or assets, including, but not limited to AlphaGraphics’ property rights under copyright, trademark and other intellectual property law. AlphaGraphics may disclose user data if it feels that user has provided fraudulent or illegal information, has attempted to pose as someone else or has attempted an unauthorized access of user’s computer systems. Persons responsible for attempting unauthorized access of AlphaGraphics’ computer systems will be prosecuted to the fullest extent permitted by law.

  **Correction/Updating Personal Information**  
If a user’s personally identifiable information (such as zip code) changes, or if a user no longer desires our services, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user’s personal data provided to us. This can usually be done by emailing the AlphaGraphics Webmaster.

  **Choice/Opt-out**  
Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter may opt out of receiving these communications by following the instructions listed at the bottom of the newsletter e-mail.

  **Notification of Changes**  
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by posting on our Web site. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the most current privacy policy

AlphaGraphics disclaims any and all responsibility or liability for the accuracy, content, completeness, legality, reliability or operability or availability of information or material displayed. AlphaGraphics disclaims any responsibility for the deletion, failure to store, misdelivery or untimely delivery of any information or material.
