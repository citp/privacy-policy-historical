From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys. Participation in these is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes if applicable. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.

While we use encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information.

Persons responsible for attempting unauthorized access of AlphaGraphics' computer systems will be prosecuted to the fullest extent permitted by law.
