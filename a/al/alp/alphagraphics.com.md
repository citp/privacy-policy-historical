# Privacy Policy | AlphaGraphics

**This AlphaGraphics Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) explains our online information practices, defines our users’ (“you” or “your”) privacy options and describes how your information is collected and used by AlphaGraphics (“we,” “us,” “our" or “AlphaGraphics”).**

By using the AlphaGraphics website or any of our applications, products, services, features, tools or resources, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

This Privacy Policy governs your use of the AlphaGraphics website at www.alphagraphics.com (“Site”) and any information we may access through social media platforms such as Facebook, LinkedIn or Twitter. For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, we will refer to all of these access points as the AlphaGraphics System (“System”).  

**Notification of Changes**

We reserve the right to modify this policy from time to time and will mark new versions with a corresponding effective date so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We recommend you visit the Site to review any changes in our practices. Your continued use of the System constitutes your agreement to our then-current Privacy Policy.

**Links**

Our System may contain links to other websites. These websites may have privacy policies different than our Privacy Policy. AlphaGraphics is not responsible for the privacy practices of other websites. The System may also contain certain social media icons or widgets. Although you can view the material we have linked to, you may have to create an individual account or register to use these third-party social media sites to use interactive features. Any interaction on social media websites is governed by the terms of use and privacy policy of the particular platform. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by this System.

From time to time, our Site requests information from users via surveys. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary.

Our Site and System are not designed for children, and we do not knowingly collect information from any person under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 18, you may use this Site only in conjunction with and under the supervision of your parents or guardians.

**How We Share Information**

We collect information about you in order to provide you with our services and products. We also collect information that is necessary for the System to work properly. We use personal information about our users for a variety of purposes related to our business, including but not limited to:   

  * Allowing you to receive information from us regarding AlphaGraphics products and services;

  * Tracking information about your visits to our Site or use of the System to allow us to provide better service;

  * Providing information about your usage or preferences to our third-party vendors and providers; and

We may provide user information to third-party service providers or vendors for purposes of, including without limitation, initiating direct marketing programs on our behalf, data tracking, maintenance or development of our System, development of online products and services, customer service, new product development, or other contracted promotional opportunities. We will not share your information with third parties to directly market their products to you. We may share this information with any subsidiaries, franchisees, licensees, suppliers, distributors, affiliates, assigns, successors, or other related entities and their respective owners. We may also share your personal information in connection with law enforcement requests or in response to investigations, subpoenas, court orders or other legal process to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims or as otherwise required by law.

**Business Transfers**

We may also disclose your information to a third party as part of reorganization or a sale of the assets of AlphaGraphics, or its subsidiaries or divisions. Any third party to which AlphaGraphics transfers or sells the System or related assets will have the right to continue to use the personal and other information that you provide to us.

**Behavioral Advertising**

We may also use third-party vendors, such as Google Analytics, to advertise to our users online. These third-party vendors may display AlphaGraphics advertisements on other websites based on your internet usage. More specifically, these vendors use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytic cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on your past visits to the Site or another site affiliated with AlphaGraphics products or services. Any information that these third parties collect via cookies is not linked to any personally identifiable information (name, address, email address, or phone number) we collect or you provide on the website. You can opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising by using Google’s Ads Settings.

**Security**

We maintain administrative, physical and technical safeguards for all user information collected in our System. When our System requests sensitive information (such as a credit card number), that information is encrypted using Secure Socket Layer (“SSL”).

While we use encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also take reasonable steps to protect user information offline. We take measures to restrict all of our users’ information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, within our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information. Please note, however, that information disclosed online is never 100% secure and that protection of passwords and other information controlled by you is your responsibility.

**Correcting, Updating and Limiting Personal Information**

By providing information to us or using our System, you are consenting to our use of your information as outlined in this Privacy Policy.   

While we work hard to use and disclose our users’ personal information only for the purposes identified above, you can choose not to provide personal information or to limit or update the personal information obtained by us as follows:   

  * You may have your contact information updated or removed from our marketing lists by following the instructions listed at the bottom of the e-mail received from us or by emailing us at marketing@alphagraphics.com;

  * You may limit the collection of “cookies” through your browser settings. However, this may disable our ability to provide you with the most relevant products or information regarding the System; and

  * You may limit the ability of Google Analytics to track your online activity, as outlined in the “Behavioral Advertising” section.




**Your California Privacy Rights**

California Civil Code § 1798.83 permits users that are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please contact us at info@alphagraphics.com.
