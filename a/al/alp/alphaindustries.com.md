1\. Our Commitment 

Transparency - We tell you in advance what information we collect from you and how we intend to use it and how long we keep it. 

Choice - We will not share your Personally Identifiable Information or any other sensitive information you give us with third parties unless we first obtain your consent. We also will give you the opportunity of opting out of other uses that we make of any of the information you provide to us. If we change our Privacy Policy in any material way we will obtain your consent before changing the way we use your Personally Identifiable Information. 

Security - We will implement reasonable security measures, including Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology and other tools to protect all the information we collect about you on our websites. We will retain your Personally Identifiable Information only for the time necessary to achieve the disclosed purposes. 

2\. What Information Do We Collect? How Do We Collect It? 

We collect two types of information on our websites: 

Personally Identifiable Information ("PII")   
Any information that can be used to identify you, such as your name, address, e-mail, or phone number. PII also includes your browsing history if that has been linked to your email address. 

Anonymous Information (“Non-PII”)  
All Information other than PII. For example, the fact that your browser has visited a particular page at a website is Anonymous Information because it does not identify you by name, address, or email. 

We collect PII and/or Non-PII depending on the purpose and functionality of each website ([www.alphaindustries.com](http://www.alphaindustries.com/) & [www.shopalphaindustries.com](http://www.shopalphaindustries.com/)) 

How Do We Collect Information?   
We collect Personally Identifiable Information when you register for promotional emails, set up a shopping account, contact customer service, and place an order through [www.shopalphaindustries.com](http://www.shopalphaindustries.com/).

We collect Anonymous Information through the use of "cookies" and "web beacons." Cookies and web beacons work together to collect and process information regarding how your computer interacts with our Alpha Industries, Inc. ([www.alphaindustries.com](http://www.alphaindustries.com/) & [www.shopalphaindustries.com](http://www.shopalphaindustries.com/)) websites. 

What is a cookie?   
A "cookie" is a computer file that acts as an identification card for your computer. The purpose of the cookie is to distinguish your browser from all other browsers that visit our websites. By recognizing your browser, we can serve you better. For example, the cookies allow us to hold the selections in your shopping cart when you navigate away from the order page and then return to complete the order; because of the cookie, you don't have to start over with your shopping. We can also keep track of what pages of our website your browser visited and whether you purchased a product. 

3\. How We Use Information Purposes for Information Collection

There are three important reasons why we collect information on our websites.

  * First, we collect Personally Identifiable Information to open your online shopping account, to complete online purchases, to answer your customer service questions and occasionally, to send to you (with your permission after you register online) information and email promotions about our products, and. 
  * Second, we collect Anonymous Information that helps us keep track of information for the purposes of improving our website, improving our services and advertising, and measuring the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns. 
  * Third, we collect Anonymous Information to provide you tailored advertising that we believe you will be much more interested in than randomly-generated advertisements. 

  
Disclosure and Sharing of Information:   
We will not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your Personally Identifiable Information (PII) to outside parties without providing you with advance notice and an opportunity to consent. "Outside parties" do not include companies wholly-owned by Alpha Industries, Inc. We reserve the right to disclose your PII and any non-PII to the extent we reasonably believe that disclosure is required by law, to enforce our website policies, or to protect your or others' rights, property or safety.
