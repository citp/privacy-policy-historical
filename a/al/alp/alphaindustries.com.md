# Privacy Policy | Alpha Industries

**1\. Our Commitment**

 **Transparency** \- We tell you in advance what information we collect from you and how we intend to use it and how long we keep it. We may amend this policy from time to time so it is your responsibility to review the policy. By using our web site and providing any information, you are agreeing to be bound by our privacy policy. 

**Choice** \- We will not share your Personally Identifiable Information or other sensitive information you give us with third parties unless we first obtain your consent. We also will give you the opportunity of opting out of other uses that we make of any of the information you provide to us. If we change our Privacy Policy in any material way we will obtain your consent before changing the way we use your Personally Identifiable Information.

 **Security** \- We will implement reasonable security measures, including Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology and other tools to protect all the information we collect about you on our websites. We will retain your Personally Identifiable Information only for the time necessary to achieve the disclosed purposes.

**2\. What Information Do We Collect? How Do We Collect It?**   
We collect two types of information on our websites: 

_Personally Identifiable Information ("PII")_  
Any information that can be used to identify you, such as your name, address, e-mail, or phone number. PII also includes your browsing history if that has been linked to your email address. _Anonymous Information (“Non-PII”)_  
All Information other than PII. For example, the fact that your browser has visited a particular page at a website is Anonymous Information because it does not identify you by name, address, or email. 

We collect PII and/or Non-PII depending on the purpose and functionality of each website (www.alphaindustries.com & www.shopalphaindustries.com) 

_How Do We Collect Information?_   
We collect Personally Identifiable Information when you register for promotional emails, set up a shopping account, contact customer service, and place an order through www.alphaindustries.com. Such Personally Identifiable Information may also be collected through our partners and vendors who work with us to provide our customers with enhanced services. To the extent these third party entities have their own privacy policies and terms of use, such privacy policies and terms of use shall also govern how your information is used. It is your responsibility to review all applicable third party privacy policies and terms of use before providing any such information to these entities. 

We collect Anonymous Information through the use of "cookies" and "web beacons." Cookies and web beacons work together to collect and process information regarding how your computer interacts with our Alpha Industries, Inc. (www.alphaindustries.com & www.shopalphaindustries.com) websites.

In addition, we may also at times use pixel tags, which allow us to read and use cookies. This permits us to gather certain information such as the time when a user has visited our site, IP addresses, and the type of browser being used. This process permits us to help customize your experience with our web site, including provision of information that may be of interest to you, e.g., advertisements.

 _What is a cookie?_  
A "cookie" is a computer file that acts as an identification card for your computer. The purpose of the cookie is to distinguish your browser from all other browsers that visit our websites. By recognizing your browser, we can serve you better. For example, the cookies allow us to hold the selections in your shopping cart when you navigate away from the order page and then return to complete the order; because of the cookie, you don't have to start over with your shopping. We can also keep track of what pages of our website your browser visited and whether you purchased a product. For some purposes, it may be necessary for you to permit us to use cookies. Disabling cookies may affect your use of our web sites.

**3\. Why We Collect Your Information**   
There are three important reasons why we collect information on our websites.   
• First, we collect Personally Identifiable Information to open your online shopping account, to complete online purchases, to answer your customer service questions and occasionally, to send to you (with your permission after you register online) information and email promotions about our products, and.  
• Second, we collect Anonymous Information that helps us keep track of information for the purposes of improving our website, improving our services and advertising, and measuring the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns.  
• Third, we collect Anonymous Information to provide you tailored advertising that we believe you will be much more interested in than randomly-generated advertisements.

 _Disclosure and Sharing of Information:_  
We will not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your PII to outside parties without providing you with advance notice and an opportunity to consent. "Outside parties" do not include companies wholly-owned by Alpha Industries, Inc. or our affiliates or authorized distributors or licensees.
