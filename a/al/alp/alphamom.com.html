<p><strong>Website Tracking Software</strong><br>
We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer the Website.  Your IP address is used to gather broad and specific demographic information, as well as for validation purposes.  Web servers, or those of third party vendors, utilize certain tracking software to capture your domain name address (the address of your Internet service provider) for purposes of tracking Website statistics.  Note that we only collect information about you when you voluntarily provide information through registration.  The capture of your domain name is a common practice among Websites for measuring the number of hits, pages visited and length of your session.  We use this information to measure the effectiveness of the Website offering in order to serve you better.</p>

<p><strong>Cookies</strong><br>
We use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests, to save your password so that you do not have to re-enter it each time that you visit the Website (if you choose), and for other purposes.  For more information on cookies, including how to disable them, please visit www.cookiecentral.com.</p>

<p><strong>Sharing of Information</strong><br>
We use the Personal Information that you supply to personalize your experience with the Website, process your registration for the services and for verification purposes.  The Personal Information that you submit to Alpha Mom™ remains your property, but by submitting that Personal Information to Alpha Mom™ you grant Alpha Mom™ the right, subject to applicable state and federal law, to use that Personal Information for marketing purposes.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, we reserve the right to share/distribute any and all Personal Information with/to third-party agents and independent contractors that help us provide Alpha Mom™ services including, but not limited to, suppression, validation and e-mail marketing purposes.  You agree that we may contact you at any time with updates and/or any other information that we may deem appropriate for you to receive in connection with your continued use of the Website.</p>

<p>Alpha Mom™ will not rent, sell or lease your personally identifiable information to any third party for marketing purposes.  Non-personally identifiable information, such as demographic information, may be shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis.  We also use contact information from your Personal Information to send you information about Alpha Mom™ and to keep you informed of our other products and services that may be of interest to you.

<p>Alpha Mom™ reserves the right to release current or past user information and Personal Information: (A) in the event that we believe that the Website and/or Services is/are being or has/have been used in violation of the Website Terms and Conditions or to commit unlawful acts; (B) if the information is subpoenaed; or (C) if Alpha Mom™ is sold or acquired.  Moreover, you hereby consent to disclosure of any record or communication to any third-party when Alpha Mom™, in its sole discretion, determines the disclosure to be appropriate including, without limitation, sharing your e-mail address with other third-parties for suppression purposes in compliance with the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, as amended from time to time.</p>

In these instances, you may be required to provide certain information, such as a credit card number, to register or complete a transaction at such website.  These third-party websites have separate privacy and data collection practices and Alpha Mom™ has no responsibility or liability relating to them.</p>

<p><strong>Security</strong><br>
All collected information is stored in a technically and physically secure environment.  Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  As a result, while we strive to protect your Personal Information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.

All of our users' information is restricted in our offices.  Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example customer service representative) are granted access to Personal Information.  Our employees are dedicated to ensuring the security and privacy of all Alpha Mom™ user information.  Employees not adhering to our firm policies are subject to disciplinary action.  In compliance with applicable federal and state laws, we shall notify you and any applicable regulatory agencies in the event that we learn of an information security breach with respect to your Personal Information.  You will be notified via e-mail in the event of such a breach.  Please be advised that notice may be delayed in order to address the needs of law enforcement, determine the scope of network damage, and to engage in remedial measures. </p>
