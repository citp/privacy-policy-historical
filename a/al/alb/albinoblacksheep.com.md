# Help » Privacy Policy

I'm proud to say we don't distribute your information, and your privacy is protected here. However, that doesn't mean you don't need to still be careful. We use many third-party tools on this site, and these other companies have their own policies regarding the privacy of your information.

Cookies:

If you visit a page with a popup ad, which is extremely rare on this site, it serves one cookie, and it does not collect personal information. It is used to limit the amount of popups to one popup in total, rather than being displayed on each visit or each reload. If you are getting more than one popup from this site, your cookie directory may be full. Most people will not see any popups on this site.

Another cookie is used for people who change the theme or style of this site. The cookie is stored to remember what theme you selected so that it will display it each time you visit the site. The default theme does not require a cookie.

Email:

The email you use to send an email to me, to sign up for ABS Forums or to register a username on LCIRC is protected under this policy.

We have a mailing list, but we are not accepting any new subscribers or sending any Newsletters at this time.

The third-party sources linked from this site that may ask for your email are TAF Master, when forwarding a link, and Freeze, when downloading a screensaver. An email address is not required to download a screensaver. Focalex, Inc and Freeze.com, LLC have their own privacy policies regarding the email addresses you supply to them.

Other:

If you have computer security concerns, please feel free to download free software from the Security subsection under the Download section. You will be able to remove adware, spyware and viruses that came from any website.
