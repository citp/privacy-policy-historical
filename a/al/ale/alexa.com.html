<b>Updated 17 March 2003</b><span class="small">(<a href="redline">see what's changed</a>)</span>
<br>&nbsp;
		</p>
<p>Alexa is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy
		Policy, which is a binding part of Alexa's <a href="/site/help/terms">
		Website Terms of Use and End User License
		Agreement ("Agreement")</a>, explains the type of
		information Alexa collects through its website and theAlexa
		browser companion software ("Toolbar Service") and
		what Alexa does with it.</p>
<p>ALEXA'S TOOLBAR SERVICE COLLECTS AND STORES
		INFORMATION ABOUT THE WEB PAGES YOU VIEW, THE DATA YOU ENTER IN
		ONLINE FORMS AND SEARCH FIELDS, AND, WITH VERSIONS 5.0 AND
		HIGHER, THE PRODUCTS YOU PURCHASE ONLINE WHILE USING THE
		TOOLBAR SERVICE. ALTHOUGH ALEXA DOES NOT ATTEMPT TO ANALYZE WEB
		USAGE DATA TO DETERMINE THE IDENTITY OF ANY ALEXA USER, SOME
		INFORMATION COLLECTED BY THE TOOLBAR SERVICE IS PERSONALLY
		IDENTIFIABLE. ALEXA AGGREGATES AND ANALYZES THE INFORMATION IT
		COLLECTS TO IMPROVE ITS SERVICE AND TO PREPARE REPORTS ABOUT
		AGGREGATE WEB USAGE AND SHOPPING HABITS.</p>
<p>IN ADDITION, WHEN YOU PERFORM SEARCHES USING THE SEARCH
		FUNCTION AVAILABLE ON ALEXA'S TOOLBAR SERVICE SOFTWARE
		VERSION 6.5 AND HIGHER OR ON THE ALEXA WEBSITE, YOU OFTEN WILL
		BE TAKEN TO A WEBSITE <a href="#detail_page">DETAIL PAGE</a> AT
		AMAZON.COM. IF YOU HAVE AN ACCOUNT ON AMAZON.COM AND AN
		AMAZON.COM <a href="#cookies">COOKIE</a> ENABLED, YOUR SEARCH
		RESULTS WILL BE TRANSMITTED TO AND LOGGED BY AMAZON.COM AND MAY
		BE CORRELATED BY AMAZON.COM WITH ANY PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE
		INFORMATION YOU MAY HAVE PREVIOUSLY PROVIDED TO AMAZON.COM.</p>
<p>Please read the following privacy policy carefully before
		downloading and using Alexa's Toolbar Service software or
		using the Alexa website. If you download and use Alexa's
		Toolbar Service software or use the Alexa website, you will be
		bound by the terms of the Agreement, including this Privacy
		Policy.&nbsp; This policy may change from time to time so you
		should check it frequently.</p>
<p>Alexa's Toolbar Service improves your ability to use the
		Web. One of its most important features is <a href="#related">Related Links</a>, which tells you about websites
		that are "related" to the ones you are viewing while surfing
		the Web and which you may find interesting. It does this, in
		part, by logging and analyzing the Web surfing patterns of
		Alexa users, which we call <a href="#usage_paths">usage
		paths</a>. These usage paths are also used to create research
		and commercial reports that analyze aggregate Web usage
		patterns.</p>
<p>Alexa does not attempt to determine the identity of any
		Alexa user by analyzing Web usage paths.</p>
<p>
<b><u>What types of information does Alexa
		collect?</u></b>
</p>
<p>If you are visiting the Alexa website (alexa.com), we
		collect the following information: the full <a href="#url">Uniform Resource Locator</a><a href="#url">("URL")</a>
		of the Web page from which you came to alexa.com; your <a href="#ip">Internet
		Protocol ("IP") address</a>, which may include a <a href="#domain">domain name</a>; the date and time for each page you
		view; the name of and information about any advertisement that
		brought you to the Alexa website; searches you perform, links
		you click on; and computer and connection information such as
		browser type and version, operating system, and platform. We
		also transmit <a href="#cookies">cookies</a> to your computer
		so we can track the pages of our website that you view and the
		order in which you view them.</p>
<p>If you use the <i>E-mail This Site</i> feature, we collect
		your message, the recipient e-mail address(es), and your e-mail
		address for the purpose of sending the e-mail. We do not send
		other e-mail to these address(es).&nbsp; If you choose, we can
		save your e-mail address in a <a href="#cookies">cookie</a> on your computer to
		make this feature easier to use.</p>
<p>If you download and install the Toolbar Service software,
		which provides the Alexa <a href="#toolbar">toolbar</a>, we
		collect any information voluntarily provided by you during the
		installation and registration process, which can include your
		e-mail address as well as demographic information such as
		gender, age, occupation, household income, zip code and
		country. We also collect the name of and information about any
		advertisement that brought you to the Alexa download. Any
		e-mail address that you give us during the installation process
		is kept separate from information collected during your use of
		the Toolbar Service and is not used to correlate your identity
		to Web usage path or shopping information. Demographic
		information is correlated to Web usage and shopping information
		collected during your use of the Toolbar Service, but we do not
		attempt to determine your identity by analyzing this
		information.</p>
<p>When you download the software, and at times during your use
		of the Alexa website and Toolbar Service, we transmit Alexa <a href="#cookies">cookies</a> to the hard drive of your computer.
		These <a href="#cookies">cookies</a> assign your Web browser a
		unique series of numbers, letters, or characters that enable
		Alexa's servers to recognize and identify your Web
		browser when you are using the Toolbar Service. They also
		enable Alexa to track and store information about your Web
		usage path and online shopping while using the Toolbar Service.
		See below for more information about how Alexa uses this
		data.</p>
<p>When you use the Toolbar Service, we collect information
		about the websites you visit, the searches you perform when you
		use the "search" function, and the pages you view.
		This information allows us to provide you with information
		about the Web page you are viewing (Alexa's Site Info) and to
		build our database of information about related Web pages
		(Alexa's <a href="#related">Related Links</a>). Thus, for every
		Web page you view while using the Toolbar Service, the Alexa
		software transmits and stores the following information from
		your computer to Alexa:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your <a href="#ip">IP address</a>, which may include a <a href="#domain">domain name</a>.</li>
<li>The full <a href="#url">URL</a> of the Web page you are visiting.</li>
<li>General information about your <a href="#browser">browser</a>.</li>
<li>General information about your computer's operating system.</li>
<li>Your Alexa <a href="#cookies">cookie</a> number.</li>
<li>The date and time the above information is logged.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the above information is logged together in a single
		data string for each Web page you visit. Each string is logged
		in our database in the chronological order received from our
		hundreds of thousands of users.</p>
<p>If you use Internet Explorer's Related Links feature, we
		collect the full <a href="#url">URL</a> of the Web page for
		which you requested the Related Links information; your <a href="#ip">IP address</a>, which may include a <a href="#domain">domain name</a>;
		the date and time of your request;
		and computer and connection information such as browser type
		and version, operating system, and platform. This information
		is stored in the same logs as the <a href="#usage_paths">usage
		paths</a>. We do not transmit <a href="#cookies">cookies</a> to your computer
		when you use this Internet Explorer feature. If you use
		Netscape's What's Related feature, we receive from Netscape the
		URL of the Web page for which you requested the related links
		information with the information that appears after the "?"
		stripped out; your <a href="#ip">IP address</a>, which may
		include a <a href="#domain">domain name</a>; the date and time
		of your request; and computer and connection information such
		as browser type and version, operating system, and platform. We
		do not transmit <a href="#cookies">cookies</a> to your computer when you use
		this Netscape feature.</p>
<p>
<b><u>Does Alexa collect personally identifiable
		information?</u></b>
</p>
<p>The <a href="#url">URLs</a> we collect through the Toolbar
		Service sometimes contain personal information about you. For
		example, when you enter information on a Web page (e.g., when
		you complete an online registration form or sign up for a
		contest), the operator of the website may insert that
		information into its <a href="#url">URL</a>for that or the next
		page. This information often appears after a question mark
		("?") in the <a href="#url">URL</a>, although it can appear in
		other places. This means that your name, your address, your
		e-mail address, or similar information you might consider
		private or personally identifiable which you enter into a Web
		page sometimes becomes part of a <a href="#url">URL</a>that is
		then transmitted to Alexa and automatically stored in Alexa's
		databases. This can also occur with words, topics, products, or
		phrases you enter into search engines - whether those
		engines are provided by the Alexa Toolbar Service itself or
		found elsewhere on the Web - while using the Alexa
		Toolbar Service. Alexa has no control over what information
		third party websites put into their <a href="#url">URLs</a> or
		where they put it, but any information in each <a href="#url">URL</a>
		is collected and stored by Alexa when you are
		using the Toolbar Service.</p>
<p>If you use version 5.0 or higher of the Toolbar
		Servicesoftware, as part of the shopping feature of the Toolbar
		Service, we collect information about the products you view or
		search for on the World Wide Web. This allows us to provide
		more detailed product and comparative shopping information. The
		information we collect includes product codes (such as ISBN
		numbers for books), product names, and other identifiers that
		appear in both the text and the <a href="#url">URLs</a> of Web
		pages that you view. The product information that Alexa gathers
		is logged together with your <a href="#ip">IP address</a>,
		Alexa <a href="#cookies">cookie</a> number, the names of Alexa's business
		partners that might have additional information about the
		particular product, and the date and time, in a single data
		string for each Web page you visit. These strings, which we
		call "shopping paths," may also contain personally
		identifiable information. Alexa transmits the product
		descriptions (without your Alexa cookie number or <a href="#ip">IP
		address</a>) to its business partners, who return relevant
		product information and/or comparison shopping information to
		the Toolbar Service for your use.</p>
<p>Also for users of version 5 of the Toolbar Service, the
		shopping feature of the Alexa Toolbar Servicesoftware provides
		comparative shopping information from Amazon.com and enables
		you to purchase items with Amazon.com's 1-Click feature
		or place items in your Amazon.com shopping cart. To do this,
		Alexa reads any Amazon.com cookies stored on your Web browser
		and transmits them to Amazon.com (but not to any other party)
		along with the product information described above. If you are
		not an Amazon.com customer already, Alexa will transmit new
		Amazon.com cookies to enable the Amazon.com shopping features
		of the Toolbar Service. When you make a purchase or place items
		in your Amazon.com shopping cart using the buttons provided by
		the Alexa Toolbar Service, Alexa logs the fact that you
		selected the button and the product for which you selected it.
		<i>Alexa does not receive any information from Amazon.com about
		your existing Amazon.com account or other Amazon.com purchases
		that you make when not using the Alexa Toolbar Service.</i>
</p>
<p>Alexa analyzes its logs of <a href="#usage_paths">usage
		path</a>, shopping path, and purchase information collected
		from users to determine Web usage and shopping patterns of
		users in the aggregate. Further, by storing this information
		with users' Alexa cookie numbers, Alexa correlates each
		user's usage path information, shopping path information,
		Amazon.com purchase information, and demographic information to
		each other.</p>
<p>If you e-mail Alexa, we may store copies of such e-mail or
		similar communications between you and Alexa. This can result
		in the collection of your e-mail address or other personally
		identifiable information you may have in your e-mail text,
		addresses, or other fields, as well as the collection of the
		your <a href="#ip">IP address</a>, the Internet or other
		routing of your communication, and the date and time of your
		communication. We do not attempt to correlate this information
		to your Alexa cookie number or your usage and shopping paths
		unless responding to your inquiry requires us to do so.</p>
<p>
<i>Although these information logs may contain personally
		identifiable information, Alexa does not attempt to correlate
		<a href="#cookies">cookie</a> numbers, <a href="#usage_paths">usage paths</a>, shopping paths,
		Amazon.com purchases, or demographic information to your e-mail
		address and does not attempt to determine the identity of any
		Alexa user by analyzing this information, except as required by
		subpoenas, court orders or legal requirements.</i>
</p>
<p>If you write a Review on the Alexa website, the content you
		submit on the Review form, the <a href="#url">URL</a> that you reviewed,
		your chosen public nickname, the date of the Review, your Alexa
		cookie number, and a record locator number may be logged
		together by Alexa. If you choose to rate a website or recommend
		the addition of a website as a Related Link, your e-mail
		addresses and recommendation and rating are logged together by
		Alexa.</p>
<p>All transmissions between you and Alexa, including e-mails,
		<a href="#url">URLs</a>, <a href="#cookies">cookie</a>
		identification numbers, <a href="#usage_paths">usage paths</a>,
		shopping path information, Amazon.com purchase information, and
		any personally identifiable information they might contain,
		pass through many third party machines, operating systems,
		programs, browsers, Web servers, networks, routers, Ethernet
		switches, ISPs, proxy servers, intranets, the public telephone
		systems, or other devices, any of which may create activity
		logs containing such transmissions.</p>
<p>
<b><u>What does Alexa do with the information it
		collects?</u></b>
</p>
<p>If you gave us your e-mail address when you registered, we
		use it to send you Alexa newsletters, product updates,
		service-related information, and other offers and information
		from Alexa or its business partners. Alexa also may contact you
		by e-mail to respond to reviews, ratings, and customer service
		inquiries you submit. We do not disclose your e-mail address to
		business partners or to anyone other than employees and agents
		working for or on behalf of Alexa, except as required by
		subpoenas, court orders, or legal requirements. We do not use
		your e-mail address to correlate your identity to your Web
		<a href="#usage_paths">usage paths</a>, shopping path information, or Amazon.com
		purchase information. If you have given us your e-mail address
		but wish to unsubscribe at any time, please see our section
		regarding <a href="#change_info">changing your information</a>
		for instructions on how to do so.</p>
<p>We use Alexa <a href="#cookies">cookies</a> for such
		functions as verifying that you are an Alexa user, counting and
		tracking your Alexa website visits, setting the appearance of
		the toolbar, helping the toolbar remember which module and tab
		you were last on and which search feature you used last,
		remembering the default search engine that you used in our Web
		search feature, determining the length of time you spent on a
		Web page, and keeping the nickname you used when you wrote your
		last Web review. We further use cookies to determine the number
		of visitors that came to the Alexa website through a particular
		advertisement. Your Alexa cookie number is also used to create
		usage and shopping paths and to correlate those with any
		demographic information you provide, but we do not use your
		<a href="#cookies">cookies</a>, <a href="#usage_paths">usage paths</a>, shopping paths, or product
		purchasing information to attempt to determine your identity.
		If you have <i>The Web You Made</i> feature turned on, your
		cookie also contains information about the last several
		websites that you visited.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We use <a href="#ip">IP addresses</a> to diagnose problems
		with our servers and to administer our website. Your <a href="#ip">IP
		address</a> also is used by Alexa to gather broad demographic
		information, such as your general geographic location and
		Internet Service Provider. IP addresses are further used to
		help determine the number of Alexa users. This demographic
		information may also be used by Alexa to analyze aggregate Web
		usage behavior.</p>
<p>We use Web <a href="#usage_paths">usage paths</a> to build
		the <a href="#related">Related Links</a> functionality. We use
		shopping paths to build the functionality of our product
		information and comparison shopping features. We use both usage
		and shopping paths and Amazon.com purchase information for
		aggregate research and reports described below.</p>
<p>
<b><u>How does Alexa share the information it
		collects?</u></b>
</p>
<p>User privacy has always been a core value of Alexa. That is why Alexa does not attempt to determine the identity of its users or correlate their e-mail addresses with their Web <a href="#usage_paths">usage paths</a> or shopping information. Except as described below, Alexa does not intentionally disclose personally identifying information collected from any user to any third party-including Amazon.com-without the user's consent.</p>
<p>We provide "stripped" <a href="#usage_paths">usage path</a> information, demographic information, and shopping path information to Amazon.com, researchers, and other third parties. They use it to prepare analyses of aggregate Web patterns and trends. Such analyses are used in research and commercial reports. Before providing the usage path information, we "strip" from the <a href="#url">URLs</a> a portion of your <a href="#ip">IP address</a> and the information that appears after the "?," with limited exceptions for certain types of search terms, leading "search engine" websites, and many e-commerce websites. Before providing the shopping path information to any third party, we strip a portion of your <a href="#ip">IP address</a> from the data string.</p>
<p>Although this process effectively eliminates most, but not all, personally identifiable information collected during use of the Toolbar Service, we require Amazon.com and other third parties to abide by our practice of not attempting to use such information to determine users' identities.</p>
<p>We also provide the stripped usage path information to the
		nonprofit Internet Archive (www.archive.org), which is building
		a "library" of the Web.</p>
<p>If you use the search functions provided on either the Alexa
		website or on versions 6.5 and higher of the Toolbar Service
		software, we transmit your search term and <a href="#ip">IP address</a> to
		the search engine you chose.</p>
<p>When you click on a search result, you often will be sent to
		a website <a href="#detail_page">detail page</a> at Amazon.com. Alexa transmits
		your search result, which includes your original search term,
		the result of the search as displayed on our website, and the
		<a href="#url">URLs</a> of the page found by the search to Amazon.com, who
		uses that information to personalize that <a href="#detail_page">detail page</a>.
		If you have an account on Amazon.com and you have an Amazon.com
		cookie enabled, your search result will be logged by
		Amazon.com's servers and may be correlated by Amazon.com
		with personally identifiable information that you have provided
		to Amazon.com. Alexa does not receive any personally
		identifiable information about you from Amazon.com.</p>
<p>As noted above, with versions 5.0 and higher of the Toolbar
		Service software, Alexa transmits product descriptions of the
		products you view while using the Toolbar Service (without your
		Alexa <a href="#cookies">cookie</a> number or <a href="#ip">IP
		address</a>) to its business partners, who return relevant
		product information and/or comparison shopping information to
		the Toolbar Service for your use. Further, to enable the
		Amazon.com 1-Click and shopping cart features to work on the
		Alexa Toolbar Service, Alexa reads and transmits Amazon.com <a href="#cookies">cookies</a> to and from your computer and
		Amazon.com. Alexa does not use the Amazon.com <a href="#cookies">cookies</a> to attempt to determine your identity,
		and Alexa does not receive any other information about your
		Amazon.com account or any purchases you make while not using
		the Alexa Toolbar Service.</p>
<p>If you write a Review on the Alexa website, the content you
		submit on the Review form, the <a href="#url">URL</a> that you reviewed,
		and your chosen public nickname often are transmitted to
		Amazon.com and logged by Amazon.com.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We disclose any information we possess in response to
		subpoenas, court orders, or legal requirements, and such
		information might be used by the receiving party to determine
		your identity, your Web usage and online shopping behavior, or
		other things about you. We generally do not inform users of
		such requests for information, although we might try to do so
		in some cases.</p>
<p>We employ other companies and individuals to perform
		functions on our behalf, such as technical support services. To
		perform those functions, it may be necessary for them to obtain
		access to Alexa's databases and servers, which may
		contain personally identifying information about users. They
		may not use such access or information for any purpose other
		than that for which they are retained.</p>
<p>In the event that Alexa or substantially all of its assets
		are sold or acquired, all information collected by Alexa would
		be transferred to the acquiring party. In any such transfer,
		however, such information would remain subject to any
		applicable terms and conditions, including the terms of this
		Privacy Policy and any amendment thereto.</p>
<p>
<b><u>How is your information protected?</u></b>
</p>
<p>Alexa uses commercially reasonable computer security
		safeguards to protect its databases and servers against risks
		of loss, unauthorized access, destruction, misuse,
		modification, or inadvertent or improper disclosure of data.
		These risks, however, cannot be completely eliminated and Alexa
		therefore cannot guarantee complete security.</p>
<p>Alexa also segregates certain personally identifiable
		information provided by you. Any e-mail address you chose to
		provide is stored in a database. Your <a href="#usage_paths">usage paths</a> are stored on a separate
		database and server that can be accessed only by a limited
		number of Alexa employees. Shopping paths are stored in a
		database separate from usage paths, e-mail addresses, and
		demographic information. Also, any demographic information you
		chose to provide is stored, along with your Alexa cookie number
		and the name of any advertisement that brought you to the Alexa
		download, in a database separate from e-mail addresses, Web
		usage path information, and shopping path information. Alexa
		prohibits its employees from using any of this information to
		determine your identity.</p>
<p>
<b><u>No Confidentiality for Customer Feedback</u></b>
</p>
<p>Feedback and other comments and statements that you chose to
		submit to Alexa by any means - whether by e-mail to Alexa
		Customer Service, telephone, letter, or any other means -
		shall be considered nonconfidential. Alexa is free to use such
		information on an unrestricted basis.</p>
<p>
<b><u>Data Collection and Use Practices by Other Businesses
		We Do Not Control</u></b>
</p>
<p>The Toolbar Service and Alexawebsite provide links to
		various features, services, and Web pages provided solely by
		our business partners or other organizations, such as
		Amazon.com, InfoSpace, mySimon, YellowBrix, BBBOnLine, and
		VeriSign. The links take you to pages provided solely by those
		entities, although sometimes the pages are co-branded with the
		Alexa logo. You will be able to tell when another entity is
		involved with providing features, services, or Web pages, and
		any information about your interaction with those Web pages,
		including which pages and advertisements you view and any
		search terms or other information you enter, will be received
		by that other business.</p>
<p>When you click on links to other businesses, those
		businesses may attach a cookie to your hard drive and may
		collect information about you. Alexa makes no claims or
		representations about what those businesses do or do not
		collect about you. Please review any terms of use and privacy
		policies of those other businesses to learn about their data
		collection and data use practices.</p>
<p>Further, our business partners may post advertisements on
		pages co-branded with the Alexa logo. Those advertisements are
		transmitted to your browser directly by the advertiser or the
		business partner, not by Alexa, and those advertisers may
		transmit a <a href="#cookies">cookie</a> to your hard drive and
		may collect information about you. If an advertiser or its ad
		server has previously placed a cookie on your machine, it may
		recognize the cookie and learn you have visited our co-branded
		Web page or used our Toolbar Service even though you do not
		click on the advertisement. Alexa makes no claim or
		representations concerning what such advertisers do or do not
		collect about you, and refers you to those entities for
		information about their privacy practices.</p>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that Alexa is not responsible for
		any content, advertising, products, or other materials on the
		websites (whether co-branded with the Alexa logo or not) of or
		available from other businesses that we do not control. You
		further acknowledge that Alexa shall not be responsible or
		liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused
		by or in connection with use of or reliance on any such
		content, goods or services available on or through any such
		site or resource.</p>
<p>
<a name="change_info"></a><b><u>How to Change Your
		Information</u></b>
</p>
<p>You can inform us of a change in the e-mail address or
		demographic information you provide us by <a href="/site/company/contact">contacting us</a>.
		Alexa does not currently enable users to access, review, or
		change usage path and shopping path information collected
		during use of the Toolbar Service. Alexa also does not enable
		users to delete information, including usage path, shopping,
		and demographic information.</p>
<p>If you do not want to receive Alexa newsletters, offers, and
		product and service information, simply <a href="/site/company/contact">contact us</a> and be sure to <i>include the e-mail address</i>  where such information is being
		sent, and state that you no longer want to receive Alexa
		information and updates.</p>
<p>To submit requests to change or remove website owner contact
		information, follow the instructions on the following form: <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/editor?type=contact">Change
		Contact Information Form</a>, or <a href="/site/company/contact">contact us</a>.
		Please note that it can take up to 6 weeks for approved
		requests to be implemented in Alexa's Toolbar Service or
		website.</p>

<b><u>Glossary of Terms</u></b>
</p>
<p>
<a name="related"></a><b><i>Related Links</i></b>
</p>
<p>Related Links are lists of websites that are related to the
		website you are viewing. Whenever you visit a Web page, the
		Alexa Toolbar Service retrieves information from the Alexa
		servers to suggest other related Web pages that might be of
		interest to you. Alexa's Related Links enable you to
		"surf" from one related site to another,
		discovering interesting and unique sites as you go, without
		having to return to a search engine.</p>
<p>
<a name="usage_paths"></a><b><i>Usage Paths</i></b>
</p>
<p>A usage path is the trail of requests automatically
		transmitted to and logged by Alexa as a user surfs the Internet
		with the Alexa toolbar enabled. Usage paths consist of the
		following data for each Web page visited by an Alexa user: (a)
		the IP address assigned to the user; (b) the date and time the
		Web page is visited by the user; (c) the user's browser
		type and version; (d) the user's operating system and
		version; (e) the user's Alexa cookie; and (f) the full
		URL that the site assigns to the Web page.</p>
<p>
<a name="url"></a><b><i>Uniform Resource Locator</i></b>
</p>
<p>A URL (or uniform resource locator) is the full Web address
		of a file or document you view when browsing the Internet. With
		most browsers, such as Microsoft Internet Explorer or Netscape
		Navigator, the URL of every Web page that you view is displayed
		in a window near the top of the screen. Typically, a URL
		consists of four parts: protocol, server (or domain) where the
		file is located, path, and filename. However, some URLs have no
		path or filename. An example of a URL is:</p>
<p>
<font face="Courier New, Courier"><font color="#008080">http</font>://<font color="#800000">www.alexa.com</font>/<font color="#800080">company/</font><font color="#808000">index.html</font></font>
<br>
<br>
<font color="#008080">http</font> is the protocol<br>
<font color="#800000">www.alexa.com</font> is the server<br>
<font color="#800080">company/</font> is the path<br>
<font color="#808000">index.html</font> is the filename</p>
<p>
<a name="ip"></a><b><i>Internet Protocol Address</i></b>
</p>
<p>An Internet Protocol ("IP") address is a set of
		numbers that is automatically assigned to your computer each
		time you connect to the Internet. When you use your Web browser
		to request a Web page from another computer on the Internet,
		your Web browser automatically gives that computer your IP
		address so that the data you request can be sent to your
		computer. For many users who access the Internet from a dial-up
		Internet service provider (ISP), the IP address will be
		different every time they log on ("dynamic" IP addresses);
		others may be assigned only one IP address that remains the
		same from session to session ("static" IP addresses) (more
		common with broadband ISPs).</p>
<p>
<a name="domain"></a><b><i>Domain Name</i></b>
</p>
<p>A domain name identifies one or more IP addresses. Domain
		names are used in <a href="#url">URLs</a> to identify particular
		Web pages. For example, in the <a href="#url">URL</a>
		http://www.alexa.com/site/company, the domain name is
		alexa.com.</p>
<p>
<a name="cookies"></a><b><i>Cookies</i></b>
</p>
<p>A cookie is a small data file consisting of numbers,
		letters, or other characters that the Alexa server sends to
		your browser and stores on your computer's hard drive when you
		visit the Alexa website or download the Alexa Toolbar Service
		software. The Alexa servers can access this cookie when you
		return to the website or use the Alexa Toolbar Service. The
		cookie automatically identifies your computer, but not your
		identity, to our servers while you use the Alexa Toolbar
		Service or the Alexa website. If you have <i>The Web You
		Made</i> feature turned on, your cookie also contains
		information about the last several websites that you
		visited.</p>
<p>Amazon.com cookies may be present on your hard drive if you
		are already an Amazon.com customer. If you are not already an
		Amazon.com customer, Alexa may transmit Amazon.com cookies to
		your computer to enable you to put products in your Amazon.com
		shopping cart through the Toolbar Service. These cookies alone
		do not reveal your identity to Alexa, and Alexa does not use
		these cookies to try and learn your identity.</p>
<p>You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject
		all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. (Each browser
		is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn
		how to change your cookie preferences.) However, if a browser
		is set to reject cookies, it may encounter functionality
		problems with the Alexa Toolbar Service.</p>
<p>
<a name="toolbar"></a><b><i>Toolbar</i></b>
</p>
<p>The Alexa toolbar consists of buttons or links on your Web
		browser and enables you to use the Alexa Toolbar Service. The
		toolbar provides information for each Web page a user views,
		including a rating for the level of traffic the page receives,
		reviews of the page provided by other Alexa users, contact
		information for the owner of the Web page, site statistics,
		Related Links, and, in some cases, comparison shopping
		information.</p>
<p>
<a name="browser"></a><b><i>Browser</i></b>
</p>
<p>A browser, short for Web browser, is a software application
		used to locate and display Web pages. Two popular browsers are
		Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>
<a name="detail_page"><b><i>Detail Page</i></b></a>
</p>
<p>A detail page is the page, displayed by either Alexa or
		Amazon.com, that provides details about a website, provides a
		user the ability to read and write reviews, and provides
		personalized recommendations for other websites and/or products
		that the user may be interested in.</p>
