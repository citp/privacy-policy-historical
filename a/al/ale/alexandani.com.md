# Privacy Policy

## Categories of Information We Collect

We collect personally identifiable information through communications with you, or through the Alex and Ani website (our “Website”), whenever you interact with us online. Some examples include: 

• registering for a shopping account on our Website  
• requesting that merchandise be sent to you or others or place an order  
• purchasing products from our Website 

We may also collect personal information about you from other third parties, such as demographic firms, to make our future service and marketing efforts more efficient and personalized for you. We also gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser information, Internet Service Provider (ISP), operating system, date/time stamp and clickstream data.

## How We Use Your Information

We use your personal information that we collect to conduct our business and to provide you with the best possible products, services and experience. To best serve you, we may share your personally identifiable information with service providers that provide support services to us or that help us market our products and services. Service providers, third parties who perform services on our behalf, are contractually restricted from using your information in any manner other than in helping us to provide you with the products and services available from Alex and Ani. We may also, in certain instances, disclose your personally identifiable information when we have reason to believe that it is necessary to identify you, contact you, or bring legal action to protect your rights or the rights of Alex and Ani or others. We may also disclose your personally identifiable information when you ask us to do so or when we believe it is required by law.

## Mobile Privacy

Alex and Ani offers mobile applications (commonly known as "apps") and mobile-optimized experiences that allow you to shop online, check product availability, learn about store events, or receive other information from Alex and Ani. All personal information collected by Alex and Ani via our mobile application is protected by this Privacy Policy. 

Although you do not have to provide your location information to Alex and Ani to use our mobile applications, our store-specific services such as find-an-item require a zip code to function. You may manually enter a zip code and we will save your zip code(s) for future reference. Alternatively, when you download our mobile application, you may choose to allow it to obtain your precise location from your mobile device when you click the "near me" button. In this case, we will determine your zip code from the precise location data received from your mobile device. We do not store precise location data; we only store the zip code associated with the location. We may also update our mobile applications to offer automatic (or "push") notifications. We will provide push notifications only to those customers who opt-in to receive such notifications from Alex and Ani. If you have questions about location and notification privacy, please contact your mobile service provider or the manufacturer of your device to learn how to adjust your settings. 

In the future, we may offer updated or enhanced versions of our mobile applications that include additional features created by us or using third party functionality. Our applications or the third party may automatically collect information about your precise location from your device, but only if you allow it.

## Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Similar Technologies

Our Website uses "cookie" and "web beacon" technology. We use cookies and web beacons to distinguish you from other visitors, track your IP address and usage of our site, and to identify the name of the website from which you linked to alexandani.com. This information is used for fulfilling contracts with our business partners, and to help us serve you better by improving our website design, as well as our products, services, and promotions. We do not otherwise track any information about your use of other websites. Non-personally identifiable information obtained through cookies and web beacons may be shared with or obtained by service providers on our behalf. 

A cookie is a small data file that is placed on the hard drive of your computer when you visit a website. A "session cookie" expires immediately when you end your session (i.e., close your browser). A "persistent cookie" stores information on the hard drive so when you end your session and return to the same website at a later date, the cookie information is still available. A web beacon is a small string of code that represents a clear graphic image and is used in conjunction with a cookie. 

When you visit our Website, we may use both a session and a persistent cookie. This Alex and Ani-placed cookie may contain information (such as a unique user ID) that is used to track your usage of our Website and in some cases, your e-mail address. Your e-mail address is only saved in this Alex and Ani-placed cookie if you register with us. A web beacon allows us to capture certain additional types of information about a visitor's actions on a website, such as a visitor's cookie number, the time, date, duration and number of page views, a description of the page where the Web beacon is placed, and details about any items that were purchased. 

If you register with us, this Alex and Ani-placed cookie allows us to recognize you when you return to our Website and provides you with access to your account information. If you save your information with or order from us, we may also use cookies to monitor and maintain information about your use of our Website. If you have not saved your information with or ordered from us, we may monitor and maintain information about your use of our Website in a manner that does not identify you. You can disable cookies at any time by using your browser options; however, if you turn off cookies, we will not be able to track your order or enable you to make a purchase from our Website. In addition, we will not be able to recognize you as a registered user to allow you access to your account information. 

We may use Flash Cookies (also known as Local Stored Objects) or other similar technologies. A Flash cookie is a small data file placed on a computer using Adobe Flash technology that may be built into your computer or downloaded by you to your computer. We use these technologies to personalize and enhance your online experience, facilitate processes, personalize and store your settings. Flash cookies may help our website visitors to, for example, set volume preference associated with a video experience, play games and perform surveys. They help us improve our sites by measuring which areas are of greatest interest to customers. We do not use Flash cookies for marketing or behavioral targeting purposes. Flash cookies are different from browser cookies and the cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies. Learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies. If you disable Flash cookies or other similar technologies, please be aware that you may not have access to certain features and services that make your online experience more efficient and enjoyable.

## Third-Party Advertising Partners

We use third-party service providers to serve advertisements (banners or links) on our behalf across the Internet. 

These service providers may collect non-personally identifiable information about your visits to our Website, and your interaction with our products and services. Such non-personally identifiable information is anonymous and does not include your name, address, e-mail address or other personal information. The anonymous information is collected through the use of a pixel tag (also known as cookies and action tags), which is industry-standard technology used by most major websites. 

In addition to the anonymous information about your visits to our Website, our service providers may also use the anonymous information about your visits to other websites to target advertisements for products and services available from Alex and Ani.

To be sure your connection is secure, look at the bottom status bar of your browser window. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending on your browser) the SSL is active and your information is secure. Most browsers offer additional security alerts as well.

## Business Transitions

As we continue to develop our business, we may undergo a business transition such as acquiring another company, merging with an existing company, or selling a portion of our assets. In such transitions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. In the unlikely event that Alex and Ani or substantially all of its assets are acquired or enter a court proceeding, you acknowledge that such transfers may occur and that your Personal Information can continue to be used as set forth in this Privacy Policy.
