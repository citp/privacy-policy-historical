###  Mobile Privacy 

Alex and Ani offers mobile applications (commonly known as "apps") and mobile-optimized experiences that allow you to shop online, check product availability, learn about store events, or receive other information from Alex and Ani. All personal information collected by Alex and Ani via our mobile application is protected by this Privacy Policy.

We may use Flash Cookies (also known as Local Stored Objects) or other similar technologies. A Flash cookie is a small data file placed on a computer using Adobe Flash technology that may be built into your computer or downloaded by you to your computer.

They help us improve our sites by measuring which areas are of greatest interest to customers. We do not use Flash cookies for marketing or behavioral targeting purposes. Flash cookies are different from browser cookies and the cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies.
