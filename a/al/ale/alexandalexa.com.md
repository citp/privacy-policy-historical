# Privacy policy | AlexandAlexa

ALEXANDALEXA.COM ("AA", "we", "our", "us") and its subsidiary companies respect the privacy rights of its online visitors ("you", "your", "yours") and recognise the importance of protecting the information collected about them. We have adopted a Privacy Policy that guides how we collect, store and use the information that you provide us with.

If you are under 18, we require that you inform a parent or guardian about AA's Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions as well as requiring their consent to the Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions before registering with AA or placing and order with AA.

The following information is provided by AA to enable our online visitors to be fully informed of our Privacy Policies. By visiting ALEXANDALEXA.COM, you are accepting and consenting to the practices described in this Privacy Policy and the Terms and Conditions.

Please note that this policy applies to AA and/or its subsidiaries, but not to websites maintained by other companies or organisations to which we link. Please ensure that you read the Privacy Policy of such other companies or organisations before submitting any personal information. Furthermore, from time to time AA may employ third party business partners to collect personal information on AA's behalf. In such cases, these third parties will be subject to confidentiality agreements and instructed by AA to fully comply with the AA Privacy Policy as set forth herein.

## Exactly What Personal Information May Be Collected About You And By What Means?

AA collects personal information in several ways directly from its online visitors when they order for themselves, or when they register for a service offered by AA. If an order is placed with us, we need to hold personal information including your name, email address, phone numbers, home address, shipping address(es), credit card billing address(es) and birth date so that we can process and fulfil your orders. Credit card details are entered directly into our Protx Payment Partner's systems and are neither transmitted nor held on AA systems. In certain instances we may be required to collect and store additional data including credit card details. This will only be done with your explicit consent. Additionally we may also obtain information as a result of authentication or identity checks. Sometimes we may ask for your telephone number. This number may be given to our courier for delivery services. These details allow us to process your order and to let you know the status of your order.

We see this as a value-added service helping you to find useful products or services. We strive to limit use of your information to those offers that we think you would appreciate receiving. Finally, we may use your personal information for our internal marketing and demographic studies, together with non-personal data to monitor customer patterns so we can consistently improve our site design to better meet our visitors' needs.
