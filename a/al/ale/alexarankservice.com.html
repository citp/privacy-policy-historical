<h2 class="h4"><strong>Alexa Internet Privacy Policy</strong></h2>
</header>
<p class="align-center"> Last Updated: November 10, 2016</p>
<p>Alexa knows that you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will
do so carefully and sensibly. This Privacy Policy is a binding part of <a href="/help/terms">Alexa's Website Terms of Use and End User
License Agreement</a> (<strong>“Agreement”</strong>) and explains the type of information Alexa collects through its
website and browser extension software (<strong>“Toolbar Service”</strong>) and what Alexa does with it. If you
download and use Alexa's Toolbar Service or use the Alexa website, you will be bound by the terms of the
Agreement, including this Privacy Policy. This policy may change from time to time so you should check it
frequently.</p>
<p>Alexa measures Internet activity in order to understand trends, help people discover new content, and help people
make better online decisions. Alexa provides Toolbar Service users with information about Internet trends, website
popularity, new and exciting topics, and related content.</p>
<p>NOTE: ALEXA’S TOOLBAR SERVICE COLLECTS AND STORES INFORMATION ABOUT THE WEB PAGES YOU VIEW. IN SOME CASES,
INFORMATION COLLECTED BY THE TOOLBAR SERVICE MAY BE PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE, BUT WE DO NOT ATTEMPT TO ANALYZE WEB
USAGE DATA TO DETERMINE THE IDENTITY OF ANY ALEXA USER.</p>
<h3 class="h5"><strong>What Personal Information About Users Does Alexa Gather?</strong></h3>
<p>The information we learn from users helps us continually improve and provide information about
Internet trends, website popularity, new and exciting topics, and related content. Here are the types of
information we gather.</p>
<ul class="bullets">
<li><p><strong>Information You Give Us:</strong> We receive and store any information you enter on our Web site or
give us in any other way. [<a href="#giveus">Click here</a>] to see examples of what we collect. You can choose not to provide
certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features. We use the
information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing and improving our
services, and communicating with you.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Automatic Information We Collect From the Toolbar Service:</strong> When you use the Toolbar
Service, we collect and store certain information. Examples include the websites you visit and the
advertisements that you see on those websites, the searches you perform using search engines and the "search"
function of the Toolbar Service, the results of your searches, the ways in which you use various Toolbar
Service features (including whether the Toolbar Service is still installed on your computer), and the pages
you view. [<a href="#toolbar">Click here</a>] to see examples of what we collect. Although this information may contain some
personally identifiable information, Alexa does not use it to determine the identity of individual users or
correlate it to your email address or other personally identifiable information that you give us or our
affiliates, except as required by subpoenas, court orders, or other legal requirements.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Automatic Information We Collect from Our Website:</strong> We receive and store certain types of
information whenever you interact with our website. For example, like many websites, we use "cookies," and we
obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses Alexa.com, when you use the Toolbar
Service, or when you view advertisements and other content served by or on behalf of Alexa.com on other Web
sites. [<a href="#collect">Click here</a>] to see examples of the information we receive.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Automatic Information We Collect from Other Websites:</strong> We receive and store certain types
of information when you interact with third-party websites that use our web beacons (also known as “action
tags” or “single-pixel gifs”) and other technologies. For example, we obtain certain types of information when
your Web browser accesses websites that use an Alexa measurement pixel. [<a href="#othersites">Click here</a>] for examples. For more
information about how you may choose to prevent an Alexa measurement pixel from recognizing your computer,
[<a href="/settings/optout">click here</a>]. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Information from Other Sources:</strong> We might receive information about you from other sources.
[<a href="#other">Click here</a>] to see examples of such information. </p></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h5"><strong>What About Cookies?</strong></h3>
<ul class="bullets">
<li><p>Cookies are unique identifiers that we transfer to your device through your Web browser, and through our
Toolbar Service, to enable our systems to recognize your browser. </p></li>
<li><p>The Help feature on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how
to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. </p></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h5"><strong>Does Alexa Share the Information it Receives?</strong></h3>
<p>We share user data with our parent corporation, Amazon.com, Inc., and the subsidiaries it controls, and we
may share personally identifying information with third parties only as described below.</p>
<ul class="bullets">
<li><p><strong>Businesses We Do Not Control:</strong> We may offer search or other services that are powered or
provided by another company. You can tell when a third party is involved in a given service offering, and, if
you choose to use the service, we will share information related to your use of the service with that company.
For example, if you use a third-party search engine offered through our Toolbar Service, we will transmit your
search term and IP address to that company so that it can provide you with the requested search results.
Likewise, if you download our Toolbar Service from a third party website, the Toolbar Service may display the
third party's brand, and consequently that third party may receive information about your use of the Toolbar
Service. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Third-Party Service Providers:</strong> We employ other companies and individuals to perform
functions on our behalf. Examples include storing and analyzing data, providing search results and links
(including paid listings and links), providing customer service, and payment processing. They have access to
user information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy
subsidiaries or business units. In such transactions, user information generally is one of the transferred
business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing privacy notice (unless, of
course, the user consents otherwise). Also, in the event that Alexa or substantially all of its assets are
acquired, user information will of course be one of the transferred assets. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Protection of Alexa and Others:</strong> We release account and other user information when we
believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our <a href="/help/terms">Terms of Use</a> and other agreements;
or protect the rights, property, or safety of Alexa, our users, or others. Obviously, however, this does not
include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from users for
commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Policy. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>With Your Consent:</strong> Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when personally
identifiable information about you might go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not
to share the information. </p></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h5"><strong>How Secure Is Information About Me?</strong></h3>
<ul class="bullets">
<li><p>Alexa uses commercially reasonable computer security safeguards to protect its databases and servers
against risks of loss, unauthorized access, destruction, misuse, modification, or inadvertent or improper
disclosure of data. </p></li>
<li><p>Alexa segregates certain personally identifiable and other information about your use of Alexa's services
into separate databases, some of which can be accessed only by a limited number of employees. </p></li>
<li><p>If you have an Alexa account, it is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your
password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer. </p></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h5"><strong>What About Third-Party Advertising and Links to Other Websites?</strong></h3>
<p>We work with third-party websites, advertisers, and Internet advertising companies working on their behalf,
including Amazon (collectively, "Ad Companies"). These Ad Companies may send (or "serve") advertisements directly
to your browser, from our website, our Toolbar Service, and from other websites. They automatically receive your
IP address when this happens. They may also use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (also known as action tags or
single-pixel gifs), and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize
advertising content. The information practices of these Ad Companies are not covered by this Privacy Policy.
Please contact them directly for more information about their privacy practices. </p>
<h3 class="h5"><strong>Which Information Can I Access?</strong></h3>
<p>If you create an Alexa account, we give you access to a range of information about your account and your
interactions with us for the limited purpose of viewing and, in certain cases, updating that information. [<a href="/account">Click
here</a>] to see your account information or edit your profile. </p>
<h3 class="h5"><strong>What Choices Do I Have?</strong></h3>
<ul class="bullets">
<li><p>You may disable the Toolbar Service from reporting information about your web surfing activities, search
terms, results of your searches, and/or statistics about your use of the Toolbar Service. Depending on which
Toolbar Service you are using, you may do so either by using the Options menu (or similar menu item) or by
uninstalling the relevant Toolbar Service.</p></li>
<li><p>You can choose not to receive marketing emails from us by clicking on the unsubscribe link in any marketing
email. </p></li>
<li><p>The Help portion on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how
to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. </p></li>
<li><p>The Toolbar Service enables you to update certain browser configuration settings, such as your home page or
your default search provider.&nbsp; If supported, you may configure these options during the installation
process. </p></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h5"><strong>Are Children Allowed to Use Alexa?</strong></h3>
<p>Alexa does not offer products or services for use by children. If you are under 18, you may use Alexa's website
or the Toolbar Service only with the involvement of a parent or guardian. </p>
<h3 class="h5"><strong>Conditions of Use, Notices, and Revisions</strong></h3>
<p>If you choose to visit Alexa or use the Toolbar Service, any dispute with Alexa over privacy is subject to this
Privacy Policy and our <a href="/help/terms">Terms of Use</a>, including limitations on damages, resolution of disputes, and application of
the law of the state of Washington. If you have any concern about privacy at Alexa, please contact us with a
thorough description, and we will try to resolve it. Our business changes constantly, and our Privacy Policy and
the Website Terms of Use will change also. We stand behind the promises we make, however, and will never
materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of customer information collected in the
past without the consent of affected customers. </p>
<h3 class="h5"><strong>Examples of Information Collected</strong></h3>
<a name="giveus"></a>
<h4 class="font-body"><strong>&nbsp;Information You Give Us</strong></h4>
<p>If you register for an account at Alexa, we may collect your name, email address, country of origin, nickname,
telephone number, website, company, and title. If you download and install the Toolbar Service software, we
collect any information voluntarily provided by you during the installation and registration process, which can
include demographic information such as gender, age, occupation, household income, zip code and country.
Demographic information is correlated to Web usage information collected during your use of the Toolbar Service.
In addition, you might provide us with personally identifiable information when you communicate with us by phone,
e-mail, or otherwise or complete a questionnaire or a contest entry form. </p>
<a name="toolbar"></a>
<h4 class="font-body"><strong>Automatic Information We Collect From the Toolbar Service</strong></h4>
<p>When you download the Toolbar Service, and at times during your use of the Alexa website and Toolbar Service, we
transmit Alexa cookies to your device. In addition, for every Web page you view while using the Toolbar Service,
the Alexa software transmits and stores your IP address, the full URL of the Web page you are visiting, general
information about your browser, general information about your computer's operating system, a unique identifier
enabling Alexa to identify your device, and the date and time the above information is logged. All of this above
information is logged together in a single data string for each Web page you visit. Each string is logged in our
database in the chronological order received from our millions of users. The Toolbar Service also automatically
collects information about the online advertisements that are displayed on the websites you visit - including, the
text, source, and URL of the online ad - and the terms you choose when you use search engines to search the Web,
and the results of your searches.</p>
<p>Alexa also periodically collects usage statistics from Toolbar Service that describe the frequency of use of each
Toolbar Service feature. </p>
<p>Finally, to ensure accurate information about the number of Toolbar Service users, the Toolbar Service
periodically sends a signal to Alexa containing basic information such as the IP address of your computer. </p>
<a name="collect"></a>
<h4 class="font-body"><strong>Automatic Information We Collect From Our Website</strong></h4>
<p>Examples of the information we collect and analyze when you use our website include the Internet protocol (IP)
address used to connect your computer to the Internet; login; e-mail address; password; computer and connection
information such as browser type, version, and time zone setting, browser plug-in types and versions, operating
system, and platform; the full Uniform Resource Locator (URL) clickstream to, through, and from our Web site,
including date and time; cookie; web pages you viewed or searched for; and the phone number you used to call us.
During some visits to our website we may use software tools such as JavaScript to measure and collect session
information, including page response times, download errors, length of visits to certain pages, page interaction
information (such as scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs), and methods used to browse away from the page. </p>
<a name="othersites"></a>
<h4 class="font-body"><strong>Automatic Information We Collect From Other Websites</strong></h4>
<p>Examples of automatic information we collect from third-party websites include the account identifier for the
website, the URL’s of web pages visited, any referring URL’s to the visited web pages, the IP addresses and
browser user-agents of visitors, and a unique identifier for each visitor.</p>
<a name="other"></a>
<h4 class="font-body"><strong>Information from Other Sources</strong></h4>
<p>An example of information we might receive from other sources is when you authorize a third party website, such
as Facebook, to interact directly with our website to provide or receive personalized information about you. In
that case, we might receive such information as your name and potentially other information used by that third
party website to identify your account with that website. Additional examples of information we might receive from
other sources are IP addresses, websites visited, the advertisements on those websites, and the searches performed
using search engines along with their results. </p>
