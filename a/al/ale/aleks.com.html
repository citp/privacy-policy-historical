<blockquote>
<p>We will notify you of new ALEKS features and updates via email, unless you remove the checkmark next to the text requesting such notification which appears under our request for your email address in our Account Creation forms.&nbsp;We also&nbsp;send&nbsp;periodic student reports of&nbsp;childrens' progress&nbsp;via email, unless you remove the checkmark next to the text requesting such reports which appears under our existing student account or new student registration information in our Account Creation forms. In order to continue to receive student reports while subscribing to our services, you must provide us with your new email address each time you change it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></blockquote><b>Surveys &amp; Contests</b> 
<blockquote>From time-to-time it is possible that our site will request information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. 
<p></p></blockquote><b>Tell-A-Friend</b> 
<blockquote>If a user elects to use&nbsp;any referral service we may provide&nbsp;for informing a friend about our site, we ask them for the friend's name and email address. ALEKS will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site. ALEKS stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email. The friend may request the removal of this information from their database by clicking on the removal link at the bottom of the invitation.</blockquote><b>Security</b> 
<blockquote>
<p>As&nbsp;part of the registration process,&nbsp;users are assigned a login name as described above (see "Registration" above) and an anonymous password. ALEKS will use the login name and password to identify the user on all subsequent visits to the K-12 Site. It is the user's responsibility to keep his or her password confidential. </p>
<p>ALEKS&nbsp;takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line. </p>
<p>When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - Secure Socket Layer ("SSL") protocol. To use this protection technology, you need to have an SSL-capable browser, such as Netscape Navigator 4.5 or higher or Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.5 or higher. While on a secure page, such as our billing information form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'. 
</p><p>While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment, behind a locked cage. 
</p><p>If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email to <a href="mailto:security@aleks.com?subject=ecurity">security@aleks.com</a>. 
</p><p></p></blockquote><b>Special Offers</b> 
<blockquote>We send all new members a welcoming email to verify password and username. Established members will occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals. We may&nbsp;send our customers a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications. Please see our choice and opt-out below.

<blockquote>If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as your zip code), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user's personal data provided to us. 
<p></p></blockquote><b>Choice/Opt-out</b> 
<blockquote>Our users are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for the information. For example, our billing information form has an 'opt-out' mechanism so users who buy a product from us, but don't want any marketing material, can keep their e-mail address off of our lists. 
<p>Users who do not&nbsp;wish to receive certain communications, such as&nbsp;newsletters or promotional materials from ALEKS or&nbsp;our partners may opt-out of receiving these communications by clicking on the opt-out link on the bottom of e-mail communications, or by notifying us in regard to other communications at <a href="mailto:support@aleks.com?subject=opt%2dout">support@aleks.com</a>. 
</p><p>In the event we in the future offer services that require&nbsp;outside parties, users of our site will&nbsp;be notified when their information is being&nbsp;collected by any outside parties. We would do this so our users can make an informed choice as to whether they should proceed with services that require an outside party, or not. 
</p><p></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p></p></blockquote><b>Special Policies&nbsp;Regarding Children Under 13</b> 
<blockquote>We will not knowingly collect online contact information from a child under age 13 without prior verifiable parental consent or direct parental notification of the nature and intended use of this information, which shall include an opportunity for the parent to prevent use of the information and participation in the activity. Where prior verifiable parental consent is not obtained, online contact information shall only be used to directly respond to the child's request and shall not be used to re-contact the child for other purposes. 
<p>Except as described below under "Privacy Policies that Apply Only to Children from Kindergarten through&nbsp;12th Grade Using ALEKS&nbsp;through their School,"&nbsp;children under 13 years old may use ALEKS&nbsp;only if the child's parent or guardian has paid for such use with such parent or guardian's credit card; such payment is verifiable parental consent. Children under 13 years old are not permitted to use any ALEKS "guest" or "free trial" features, because we are unable to obtain verifiable parental consent for their use of such features. 
</p><p>We will not collect personally identifiable&nbsp;information from children under 13 without prior verifiable parental consent. We will not distribute to third parties any personally identifiable information collected from a child under 13 without prior verifiable parental consent. We will not give the ability to children under 13 to publicly post or otherwise distribute personally identifiable&nbsp;information without prior verifiable parental consent, and will make best efforts to prohibit a child from posting any&nbsp;such information. We will not entice a child under 13 by the prospect of a special game, prize or other activity, to divulge more information than is needed to participate in such activity.</p></blockquote>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><strong>In additon to the policies above, which apply to all users of the ALEKS Website,<em> the&nbsp;following policies apply only&nbsp;to K-12 Students.</em></strong></font> 
</p><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><strong>1.</strong> <strong>What are ALEKS's Practices Regarding the Collection of Information&nbsp;</strong></font><strong>from&nbsp;K-12 Students&nbsp;under the age of 13?</strong>&nbsp; </p>
<blockquote>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, and the regulations thereunder, as amended from time to time ("COPPA), governs the collection and use of personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13 by a website. In an effort to meet COPPA's requirements, ALEKS will not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13, except for limited circumstances that are allowed under COPPA. ALEKS intends to comply with COPPA in all its dealings with its users. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If ALEKS desires to collect personally identifiable information&nbsp;from a&nbsp;K-12 Student&nbsp;under 13 at some time in the future, ALEKS will not do so unless we have met the requirements of COPPA. Among other things, COPPA requires that before any such information is collected, websites must obtain verifiable parental consent and notify parents of the nature and intended use of the personally identifiable information that it collects, which shall include an opportunity for the parent to prevent use of the information and participation in the activity. </font></p></blockquote>
<p><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2. What Information Do We Collect from K-12 Students and How Do We Use It?</font></b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> </font></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2"><b>Personally Identifiable Information:</b> ALEKS <b>does not collect</b> personally identifiable information from K-12&nbsp;Students who are (i) below the High School level, or (ii) who are High School students below the age of 13 (collectively, "<b>Younger K-12 Students</b>"), except in the limited circumstances described in "One Time Request for Information" below. ALEKS <b>does collect</b> personally identifiable information from K-12&nbsp;Students (i) who are High School Students <b>and</b> (ii) whose age is greater than 13 ("<b>Older K-12 Students</b>"). Personally identifiable information means information that could be used to contact a child, such as a complete last name, physical address, e-mail address, telephone number or Social Security number. </font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2"><b>Registration:</b> In order to use&nbsp;ALEKS, a&nbsp;K-12 Student&nbsp;must first complete the K-12 Site registration form. During registration, Older K-12 Students will be asked to provide personally identifiable information, such as complete first and last name, student identification number, e-mail address, etc. Younger K-12 Students will not be asked to provide <b>any</b> personally identifiable information, such as complete last name, mailing address or email address. Instead, Younger K-12 Students will be asked to provide non-personally identifiable information, such as their first name, last initial, school and/or class code or other class specific information and their teacher's name, and to indicate the student's educational grade level. With this information, ALEKS will assign each K-12 Site user with a login name and password to use each time the user returns to the K-12 Site. In the case of Younger K-12 Students, the login name will contain only information available to ALEKS, such as first name, first initial of last name, and algorithmically assigned alpha-numeric characters. </font></font>
</p><blockquote>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"></font>
</p><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2"><i>Example: if John Smith , a 7th grade student registers in ALEKS, he will furnish only his first name: "John" and the first initial of his last name: "S." ALEKS may assign him the login name "<b>JohnS05324</b>." ALEKS will not be able to personally identify this student from this information.</i> </font></font></p></blockquote>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2"><b>Teacher and School Access to Information:</b> Even though ALEKS will not have access to personally identifiable in regard to Younger K-12 Students, ALEKS will supply information on each ALEKS student (including login name) to the student's teacher and school. This information contains a large amount of information about the individual student's (and the class and/or school as a whole's) skills, knowledge and performance on individual items of study, such as math topics and problems. Even though ALEKS has no access to personally identifiable information in regard to Younger K-12 Students, from the login name of the student, together with other information that the teacher and school generally have available to them, the teacher and school will normally be able to personally identify the student. <b>This means, in effect, that the teacher will&nbsp;generally be able to obtain information from ALEKS as to each individual child's knowledge, skills, performance, work habits, etc., just as the teacher would from other, less automated, instructional tools, even though ALEKS is not able to identify any individual Younger K-12 Student.</b> </font></font></p>
<blockquote>
<p>
</p><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2"><i>Example: Ms. Brown, a 7th grade teacher, has two John's in her class: John Jones and John Smith. John Smith has the ALEKS login name: <b>JohnS05324</b> and John Jones has the login name: <b>JohnJ00735</b>. When Ms. Brown uses the ALEKS teacher module, even though ALEKS does not have any personally identifiable information regarding either of these Younger K-12 Students, Ms. Brown can readily identify the individual students.&nbsp;</i> </font></font></p></blockquote>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2"><b>One Time Request for Information:</b> The normal procedure for requesting and receiving customer support in the school environment is for the student to ask the teacher for help, and for the teacher to contact ALEKS if necessary. If a Younger K-12 Student does send an e-mail directly to ALEKS to ask a question or report a problem, it is preferred that the student do so inside the ALEKS internal email system, in which case ALEKS will not obtain any personally identifiable information in regard to that student. In the rare event that a student insists on sending ALEKS an e-mail requesting support from an e-mail address external to ALEKS, ALEKS will use such e-mail address for the sole purpose of responding to that support request from the Younger K-12 Student. ALEKS will not use the information to recontact the child after the customer support issue has been resolved, and any personally identifiable information will be deleted from ALEKS Customer Support records after a response is made. </font></font></p></blockquote>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Consent:</b> By permitting K-12 Students to access and use the&nbsp;ALEKS Website, school districts, schools, teachers and parents of student users are consenting to the provisions of this Privacy Statement, including the use of information by ALEKS in the manner described in this Privacy Statement.</font></p>
