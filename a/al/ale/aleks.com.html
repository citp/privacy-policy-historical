</p><p>
</p><blockquote></blockquote><b>Information Collection and Use</b> 
<blockquote>ALEKS is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. ALEKS collects information from our users at several different points on our website, including information about your knowledge level as you use our services in order to provide you with the next level of tutoring services suitable to your needs. 
<p></p></blockquote><b>Registration</b> 
<blockquote>In order to use this website, a user must first complete the registration form. During registration a user is required to give their contact information (such as name, mailing address and email address), and choose the educational grade level and topic on which the user wishes tutoring. With this information, we will assign you a login name and password to use each time you return to our site. 
<p></p></blockquote><b>Billing Information</b> 
<blockquote>We request information from the user on our billing information form for the services offered on our website. Here a user must provide contact information (name and billing address) and financial information (credit card number and expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes. If we have trouble processing the billing information, this contact information is used to get in touch with the user. 
<p></p></blockquote><b>Cookies</b> 
<blockquote>A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. Once the user closes their browser, the cookie simply terminates. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site. Cookies can also enable us to protect confidential data, and track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site. 
<p></p></blockquote><b>Log Files</b> 
<blockquote>We use IP addresses and hostnames to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses and hostnames are not linked to personally identifiable information. 
<p></p></blockquote><b>Sharing</b> 
<blockquote>We will share aggregated demographic information with others. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. 
<p>We use an outside credit card processing company to bill users for our services. This company does not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. 
</p><p>In the future, it is possible that we will partner with another party to provide specific services. In that event, when the user signs up for these services, we will share names, or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services. Such parties will not be allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services. 
</p><p></p></blockquote><b>Links</b> 
<blockquote>This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that ALEKS is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site. 
<p></p></blockquote><b>Updates and Student Reports</b> 
<blockquote>We will notify you of new ALEKS features and updates via email, unless you remove the checkmark next to the text requesting such notification which appears under our request for your email address in our Account Creation forms. We also will send you a student report of your or your child/children's progress every two weeks via email, unless you remove the checkmark next to the text requesting such reports which appears under our existing student account or new student registration information in our Account Creation forms. In order to continue to receive student reports while subscribing to our services, you must provide us with your new email address each time you change it. 
<p></p></blockquote><b>Surveys &amp; Contests</b> 
<blockquote>From time-to-time it is possible that our site will request information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. 
<p></p></blockquote><b>Tell-A-Friend</b> 
<blockquote>If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask them for the friend's name and email address. ALEKS will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site. ALEKS stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email. The friend may request the removal of this information from their database by clicking on the removal link at the bottom of the invitation. 
<p></p></blockquote><b>Security</b> 
<blockquote>This website takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line. 
<p>When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - Secure Socket Layer ("SSL") protocol. To use this protection technology, you need to have an SSL-capable browser, such as Netscape Navigator 4.5 or higher or Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.5 or higher. While on a secure page, such as our billing information form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'. 
</p><p>While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment, behind a locked cage. 
</p><p>If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email to <a href="mailto:security@aleks.com?subject=ecurity">security@aleks.com</a>. 
</p><p></p></blockquote><b>Special Offers</b> 
<blockquote>We send all new members a welcoming email to verify password and username. Established members will occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals. We may in the future send our customers a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications. Please see our choice and opt-out below. 
<p></p></blockquote><b>Site and Service Updates</b> 
<blockquote>We also send the user site and service announcement updates. Members are not able to un-subscribe from service announcements, which contain important information about the service. We communicate with the user to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account via email or phone. 
<p></p></blockquote><b>Correction/Updating Personal Information</b> 
<blockquote>If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as your zip code), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user's personal data provided to us. 
<p></p></blockquote><b>Choice/Opt-out</b> 
<blockquote>Our users are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for the information. For example, our billing information form has an 'opt-out' mechanism so users who buy a product from us, but don't want any marketing material, can keep their e-mail address off of our lists. 
<p>Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter or promotional materials from our partners may opt-out of receiving these communications by clicking on the opt-out link on the bottom of e-mail communications, or by notifying us in regard to other communications at <a href="mailto:support@aleks.com?subject=opt%2dout">support@aleks.com</a>. 
</p><p>In the event we in the future offer services that require an outside parties, users of our site will always be notified when their information is being collected by any outside parties. We would do this so our users can make an informed choice as to whether they should proceed with services that require an outside party, or not. 
</p><p></p></blockquote><b>Notification of Changes</b> 
<blockquote>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will notify users on our Homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an e-mail. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. 
<p></p></blockquote><b>Special Policy on Information Regarding Children Under 13</b> 
<blockquote>We will not knowingly collect online contact information from a child under 13 without prior verifiable parental consent or direct parental notification of the nature and intended use of this information, which shall include an opportunity for the parent to prevent use of the information and participation in the activity. Where prior verifiable parental consent is not obtained, online contact information shall only be used to directly respond to the child's request and shall not be used to re-contact the child for other purposes. 
<p>Children under 13 years old may use ALEKS at <a href="http://www.aleks.com/">www.aleks.com</a> only if the child's parent or guardian has paid for such use with such parent or guardian's credit card; such payment is verifiable parental consent. Children under 13 years old are not permitted to use any ALEKS "guest" or "free trial" features, because we are unable to obtain verifiable parental consent for their use of such features. 
</p><p>We will not collect personally identifiable offline contact information from children under 13 without prior verifiable parental consent. We will not distribute to third parties any personally identifiable information collected from a child under 13 without prior verifiable parental consent. We will not give the ability to children under 13 to publicly post or otherwise distribute personally identifiable contact information without prior verifiable parental consent, and will make best efforts to prohibit a child from posting any contact information. We will not entice a child under 13 by the prospect of a special game, prize or other activity, to divulge more information than is needed to participate in such activity.</p></blockquote></font><font face="Arial" size="3"></font></td></tr></tbody></table><font face="Arial" size="3">
