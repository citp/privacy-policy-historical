## Our Processing Activities

### Business contacts

#### Collection of personal data

A&M processes personal data about contacts (existing and potential A&M clients and/or individuals associated with them) using a customer relationship management system (the “A&M CRM”).  
A&M does not sell or otherwise release personal data contained in the A&M CRM to third parties for the purpose of allowing them to market their products and services without consent from individuals to do so.  
The collection of personal data about contacts and the addition of that personal data to the A&M CRM is initiated by A&M personnel and will include name, employer name, contact title, phone, email and other business contact details.   In addition, the A&M CRM may collect data from A&M email (sender name, recipient name, date and time) and calendar (organiser name, participant name, date and time of event) systems concerning interactions between A&M personnel and contacts or third parties.  

#### Use of personal data

Personal data relating to business contacts may be processed by A&M personnel to learn more about an account, client or opportunity they have an interest in, for the following purposes:

  * Administering, managing and developing our businesses and services;
  * Providing information about us and our range of services;
  * Making contact information available to other A&M personnel;
  * Identifying clients/contacts with similar needs;
  * Describing the nature of a contact’s relationship with A&M; and
  * Performing analytics, including producing metrics for A&M leadership, such as on trends, relationship maps, sales intelligence and progress against account business goals



In addition, the A&M CRM evaluates the strength of interactions between an A&M user and a contact.  This ranking is primarily based on interaction frequency, duration, how recent the contact was and response time.   

### A&M’s clients (and individuals associated with our clients)

#### Collection of personal data

Where we need to process personal data to provide professional services, our clients are responsible for providing the necessary information to the data subjects regarding its use.  This includes, where a client engagement involves the transfer of personal data outside the European Union, that the relevant clients are responsible (where required) for providing appropriate notice to or obtaining appropriate consent from, the individuals whose data may be transferred.   
Our clients may use relevant sections of this privacy policy or refer data subjects to this privacy policy if they consider it appropriate to do so.  
Given the diversity of the services we provide to clients, we process many categories of personal data, including:

  * Contact details;
  * Business activities;
  * Information about management and employees;
  * Payroll and other financial-related details; and
  * Investments and other financial interests.



#### Use of personal data

We use personal data for the following purposes:

    * managing our relationship with clients;
    * developing our businesses and services;
    * maintaining and using IT systems;
    * hosting or facilitating the hosting of events; and

  * We monitor the services provided to clients for quality purposes, which may involve processing personal data stored on the relevant client file;  
  * We collect and hold personal data as part of our client engagement and acceptance procedures.  As part of those procedures we carry out searches using publicly available sources (such as internet searches and sanctions lists) to identify politically exposed persons and heightened risk individuals and organisations and check that there are no issues that would prevent us from working with a particular client;  
  * Unless we are asked not to, we use client business contact details to provide information that we think will be of interest about us and our services.  Examples include industry updates and insights, information on other services that may be relevant, and invitations to events; and   
  * As a professional services firm, we and our personnel are subject to legal, regulatory and professional obligations.  We maintain certain records to demonstrate that our services are provided in compliance with those obligations and those records may contain personal data.

We provide external users with access to various applications used by A&M.  Such applications will contain their own privacy statements explaining why and how personal data is collected and processed by those applications.  

### Others who contact us

We collect personal data when an individual gets in touch with us with a question, comment or feedback (such as name, contact details and contents of the communication).  In these cases, we will only use the data for the purpose of responding to the communication.

  * Where a supplier is helping us to deliver professional services to our clients, we process personal data about the individuals involved in providing the services in order to administer and manage our relationship with the supplier and the relevant individuals (for example, where our supplier is working with us as part of an A&M team providing professional services to our clients);

We regularly review the appropriateness of the measures we have in place to keep the data we hold secure.  Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorized access.

## 

We will only share personal data with others when we are legally permitted to do so.  When we share data with others, we put contractual arrangements and security mechanisms in place to protect the data and to comply with our data protection, confidentiality and security standards.  
We are a global professional services firm and sometimes use third parties located in other countries to assist us with business activities.   As a result, personal data may be transferred outside the countries where our clients are located.  This includes countries outside the European Union ("EU") and to countries that do not have laws that provide specific protection for personal data.   We take steps to ensure all personal data is provided adequate protection, and that all transfers of personal data outside the EU are done lawfully.  When we transfer such personal data outside of the EU to a country not determined by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of protection for personal data, the transfers will be under an agreement which covers the EU requirements for the transfer of personal data outside the EU (such as the European Commission approved standard contractual clauses).    
Personal data held by us may be transferred to:

#### Other A&M affiliate entities

For details of A&M’s locations, please [click here](https://web.archive.org/global-locations). We may share personal data with other A&M affiliates where necessary for administrative purposes and to provide professional services to our clients (e.g. when providing services involving advice from A&M affiliates in different territories).  Our business contacts are visible to and used by A&M personnel from A&M affiliates to learn more about a contact, client or opportunity they have an interest in (please see the Business Contacts section of this privacy policy for more information about our processing of this type of data).

#### Third party organisations that provide applications / functionality, data processing or IT services to us

We use third parties to support us in providing our services and to help provide, run and manage our internal information technology (IT) systems.  Examples include providers of IT, cloud based “software as a service”, identity management, website hosting and management, data analysis, data back-up, security and storage services.  The servers powering and facilitating cloud infrastructure are located in secure data centres around the world, and personal data may be stored in any one of them.

#### Third party organisations or advisers that otherwise assist us in our operations

We use third parties to assist us in our operations, e.g. auditors and other professional advisers.  

#### Law enforcement or other government and regulatory agencies or to other third parties as required by, and in accordance with, applicable law or regulation

Occasionally, we may receive requests from third parties with authority to obtain disclosure of personal data. Examples may include checking that we are complying with applicable law and regulation; or to investigate an alleged crime, or establish, exercise or defend legal rights.  We will only fulfil requests for personal data in accordance with applicable law or regulation.  
We will also disclose personal data where reasonably necessary to:

  * enforce our terms and conditions and other agreements, including investigation of any potential violation thereof;
  * detect, prevent or otherwise address security, fraud or technical issues; 
  * protect the rights, property or safety of us, our personnel, a third party or the public as required or permitted by law (exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection); or 
  * in the event that we sell any business or assets, in which case we will disclose your data to the prospective buyer of such business or assets;
