# Privacy Policy | Alorica

**_Privacy Statement_**

**Updated: 5/24/18**

We respect and protect your privacy. The purpose of this Privacy Statement is to explain to you, with respect to the website, what types of information about you we may collect, and how we may use and disclose your information. It is also our goal to explain who you can contact with concerns you may have regarding your personal information. Please note that your use of our website (“Site”) signifies your agreement to be bound by the most recent version of this Privacy Statement. Accordingly, when you use our website, you should check the date of this Privacy Statement at the top and review any changes we have made from the previous version.

In order to make sure that your data is being kept safe, we have also implemented applicable requirements of Regulation 2016/679 EU (the General Data Protection Regulation or “GDPR”), adopted by the European Union, which is in force as of 25 May 2018.

##### Just visiting the Website?

Our website allows you to learn about what Alorica offers, for both customers and employees.  In general, you can visit our website without revealing any information about yourself.  By visiting a website, there will be IP addresses shared and logged as part of the process.  However, we do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, so you will remain anonymous to us.  In addition, cookies may be created and shared as part of the browsing process.  However, we do no use cookies to attempt to identify you or track your individual activity on our website.

We may collect information through cookies and other data technologies from our website visitors in an aggregate and non-identifiable way. We may use such aggregate non-identifiable information from our website visitors to help us design and provide better customer service and experience on our website. For example, we may analyze such collection of non-identifiable information to examine how many visits a certain page on our website gets per day.

**Protecting Children’s On-line Privacy**

We comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), and in particular, recognize the importance of protecting the privacy of children. Accordingly, our website does not intend to target or attract children, and pursuant to COPPA, we will not knowingly collect any Personal Information from children under the age of 13. If you have reason to believe a child has used or is using Alorica’s website, please contact us, and we will take appropriate and prompt measures to delete any information related to the child.

**Links to non-Alorica websites**

Our website may contain links to other third-party websites, including social media sites like Facebook and Linkedin. Please note that we are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of those other websites when you access them from our website. As such, we encourage you to read the privacy policies of any third-party website you may access from our Site.

##### When you provide Personal Information to Alorica

**_What is Personal Information?_**

Personal Information is basically any information that identifies you. Examples of Personal Information you may send to Alorica include job applicant information, such as your resume, and contact information.

In general, you can use our website without telling us who you are and without giving any personal information about yourself. There are times, however, when you may want to send your information to us.

**_When and how do we collect or use your Personal Information?_**

You may choose to give us personal information in a variety of situations. For example, you may give us your contact information (e.g. your name, address, or e-mail address) for us to correspond with you regarding our Services and Products. Another situation where you may provide us with your personal information is when you give us a description of your education and work experience for a potential employment opportunity at Alorica.   In any event, you will be providing the information to us directly.

**For potential employment opportunity**

You may provide us with your personal information, such as a resume, curriculum vitae, and/or security number in connection with a potential employment opportunity at Alorica, whether advertised on the Alorica website or otherwise. We may use this information throughout Alorica for the purpose of your employment consideration. We also may share and use the information on your job application with third parties/suppliers, such as background services and our affiliates, to evaluate and analyze your potential employment. Unless you expressly instruct us otherwise, we may keep the information you provide us in connection to your job application for your future employment consideration at Alorica.

In addition, if personal data is provided as part of an employment opportunity covered under the GDPR, then the specific Alorica recruiting process for that opportunity may provide additional disclosures at the time of obtaining that data.

**To comply with the Law**

Please be aware that in certain circumstances, such as law-related investigations, we may have to disclose your information to comply with the law, regulations and other lawful requirements.

**_How do we protect your personal information?_**

**Using Information Security and Quality technology**

We intend to protect your personal information and to maintain its integrity. We implement commercially standard measures and processes, such as using encryption when transmitting sensitive information, with the goal of maintaining and securing the privacy of your information. However, please be aware that no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As such, while we strive to protect your information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. Therefore, the Terms of Use, Disclaimer of Warranty and Limitations of Liability in this Site Terms of Use apply.

**How about when third party Suppliers are involved?**

In some cases, in the ordinary course of business (e.g. checking your information with a background services provider in connection to your job application), we may use suppliers to collect, use, analyze and otherwise process information on our behalf. It is our policy and practice to require such suppliers to handle information in a manner consistent with our security measures and processes.

**_When you contact us_**

You may communicate us, and we may respond to you, via e-mail, telephone, mail, or fax in connection to your inquiry.  To the extent your contact with us: 1) processes personal data from you as a data subject and is covered under the GDPR, 2) is where Alorica would be the data controller and not a processor for its customers, and 3) is not covered by another specific disclosure at the time of contact; then we want to share the following information with you:

You are about to submit data to Alorica Inc. (“Alorica”) that may be subject to the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”).   The data controller for your data will be Alorica Inc.  Personal data questions related to GDPR may be directed to Bob Schlotfelt at  [privacy@alorica.com](mailto:privacy@alorica.com).  The processing of your data is necessary for the legitimate interest of responding to your inquiry, and it will be kept for the time set out in the applicable document retention policy.

The recipients or categories of recipients of your personal data will be personnel of Alorica Bulgaria engaged in responding to inquiries from the website, including but not limited to employee recruitment.  In the course of responding to your inquiry, your personal data may be shared with other companies within the group of Alorica. All such companies will have implemented adequate measures for protection of your personal data.

Subject to limitations set forth in the GDPR, with respect to your personal data being processed, you have the right to access, rectification, erasure, restriction, portability, and to object to processing.  You have the right to lodge a complaint with your appropriate supervisory authority.  The provision of your personal data will be required to respond to your inquiry.  If you do not provide your personal data, or if your personal data is erased at your request, then we may not be able to respond to your inquiry.
