### WHAT DO WE COLLECT?

There are certain types of data we require to store and use here at Made by Magnitude in order to carry out our normal business tasks. We store and use both data that qualifies as personal and data that is only associated with a business. This data comes from the following services:

  * Made by Magnitude

  * Fetch

  * Stalkr

  * Snug

  * Wishlist




The data we collect & store includes First Name, Last Name, Username / Similar Identifier, Title, Email Address, Billing Address, Delivery Address, Telephone Numbers, Bank Account / Payment Card, Invoice Address, Social Accounts, Follower Count, Following Count, Time Last Accessed, Stripe Email, Unique Token (Tumblr Identifier), Instagram Name, Follower Count, Following Count, Device Version, Type, Model & Name.

_**How is this data collected?**_

We collect data various ways: direct interactions with us or our website, visiting the website, contacting us through contact forms, reaching out to us manually via email, calling via the telephone, subscribing to our service or publications, entering into a contract of work, giving us feedback, requesting marketing information to be sent to you.

Most of Stalkr's data is supplied by Tumblr through their API. You must log-in to and authenticate Tumblr to access the Stalkr service. Billing information is linked to Stripe & we never see or store any of your billing information.

Some of Snug's data is sent directly to us through Instagram's API, Apple also share device data with us if you've opted-in to send information to developers inside iOS. No data for Snug is captured manually by us, you must authenticate the action with Instagram and Apple to be able to our services.

_**How do we use this personal information?**_

The data we collect is used for a number of reasons, including: entering into contracts of work, managing payments, fees & charges, notifications of important updates, delivery of consented marketing information, legitimate interests, compliance with legal obligations, performance and execution of a contract of work, to deliver products, goods & services and relevant and important contact.

We use some of your unconventional data (follower counts) for example, to operate our services.

_**How do we store data?**_

All of the data collected from our services is stored securely in the cloud, on a server rented through Dacentec. We may have email trails and traces of user data, stored on the cloud service Google Drive. Our emails are handed by Google Mail and stored securely on their servers.

Some client data (contracts of work) is stored physically inside a locked cupboard, inside our locked & alarmed building. This data may also include email trails and names associated with clients. No payment information is stored physically, and physical information will be destroyed upon request.

The usual risks associated with electronic storage of information apply to the data we collect, but we take precautions to ensure your data is not breached, including multi-layered password protection, 2-factor authentication and limited keyholders for physical security.

We do not offer any hosting packages and therefore do not have any access to client data or client servers.

_**Accessing data**_

As according to GDPR and your data rights, you can access your data that we hold at any time. You can email or call us to inform us of your request using the details at the top of this privacy policy. Of course, you will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights), though we may refuse unfounded, repetitive or excessive requests.

_**Deleting or changing data**_

If you request, we are happy to entirely dispose of any data we hold about you. The same request should be sent as per above, via email or telephone. We will dispose of all data as soon as possible, but within 1 month. We are happy to change any data we have access on file upon request, though some data must be changed at its source origin (i.e. social networks) for us to receive the updates.

_**Obtaining data**_

Data portability is another right of yours within GDPR rules. We are happy to provide data via request for any purpose, in a physical or digital format. The contact methods are the same as outlined above.

_**Collecting new data**_

We do not partake in outbound marketing, but if details are entered into our website contact form, we will specifically state that we are collecting your data and guide the you to this updated privacy policy. We will never ask you for more personal data than is necessary to carry our our legitimate business-related interest functions. We will never pass your data onto third parties or use for external marketing purposes. If we collect any new data that identifies you, we will ask for explicit, unambiguous consent to do so. If you feel at any point you're unsure what you're providing information for, you can always contact us for clarification.

_**Accessing client data**_

From time to time, we may run into your client data (Made by Magnitude) when logging into your CMS, back-end, receiving content to upload to your website or software and migration of databases. We give our full assurance that we will never use that data for our own purposes, pass it onto any third parties or access it without need. We will only access the data after receiving explicit permission to do so. We understand that more sensitive information may be stored by your company than ours.

_**Data retention**_

Your data will only be stored by us as long as is necessary to fulfil the purpose we collected it for, including the purposes of satisfying our company obligations such as legal, account or reporting requirements.

_**In case of a data breach**_

In the unlikely event that we suffer a security breach involving personal data, we will inform you within the GDPR guideline of 24 hours, but of course, we would aim for this to be far sooner.
