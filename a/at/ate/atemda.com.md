### **Personal Information**

You may choose to provide personal information (such as your name, address, telephone number and email address) on this Web site. Here are some of the ways you may provide the information and the types of information you may submit. We also tell you how we may use the information.

### **Contact Us**

If you email us through the “Contact Us” link on this site, we ask you for information such as your name and email address so we can respond to your questions and comments. You may choose to provide additional information as well.

If you email us through the “Demonstration Request” link on this site, we ask you for information such as your name, company, address, phone number and email address so we can respond to your questions and comments. You may choose to provide additional information as well.

### **Questionnaires and Surveys**

We occasionally may ask visitors to our Web site to complete online surveys and opinion polls about their activities, attitudes and interests. These surveys help us serve you better and improve the usefulness of our site. In conducting these surveys we may ask you for your name and email address. We do not keep any personal information about you in connection with your participation in a WideOrbit.com survey unless you specifically agree to provide that information.

### **Non-Personal Information**

We collect certain aggregate and non-personal information when you visit this Web site. Aggregate and non-personal information does not relate to a single identifiable visitor. It tells us such things as how many users visited our site and the pages accessed. By collecting this information, we learn how to best tailor our Web site to our visitors. We collect this information either through “cookie” technology or with “web beacons,” as explained below.

### **Interest based advertising on internet**

We collect anonymous data for each user that is used to show the best possible advertisement at each page view on the internet. At the same time we respect our users’ privacy and understand that some users don’t want any data to be collected about them. To opt out go to [www.youronlinechoices.com](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/). WO Programmatic Digital adheres to the European Principals of the EDAA Online Behavioral Advertising (OBA) Framework.

### **Cookies**

Like many companies, we use browser cookies on this Web site. Browser cookies are bits of text that are placed on your computer’s hard drive when you visit certain Web sites. We use browser cookies to tell us, for example, whether you’ve visited us before or if you’re a new visitor and to help us identify site features in which you may have the greatest interest. Browser cookies may enhance your online experience by saving your preferences while you are visiting a particular site.

The “help” portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to stop accepting new browser cookies, how to be notified when you receive a new browser cookie, and how to disable existing browser cookies. Remember though, without browser cookies, you may not be able to take full advantage of all our Web site features.

### **Web Beacons**

Certain pages on our site contain “web beacons” (also known as Internet tags, pixel tags and clear GIFs). These web beacons allow third parties to obtain information such as the IP address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the beacon appears, the URL of the page on which the beacon appears, the time the page containing the beacon was viewed, the type of browser used to view the page, and the information in cookies set by the third party. We use log files to store the data that is collected through web beacons.

### **Information We Share**

We do not sell or otherwise disclose personal information about our Web site visitors, except as described here. We may share information provided by our visitors to WideOrbit.com with service providers we have retained to perform services on our behalf. These service providers are contractually restricted from using or disclosing the information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or to comply with legal requirements. In addition, we may disclose information about you (i) if we are required to do so by law or legal process, (ii) to law enforcement authorities or other government officials, or (iii) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity.

### **Links to Other Sites**

We provide links to other Web sites for your convenience and information. These sites may have their own privacy statements in place, which we recommend you review if you visit any linked Web sites. We are not responsible for the content of linked sites or any use of the sites.

### **Children’s Privacy**

This Web site is not directed to children under the age of thirteen and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of thirteen on the site. If we become aware that we have inadvertently received personal information from a visitor under the age of thirteen on the site, we will delete the information from our records.
