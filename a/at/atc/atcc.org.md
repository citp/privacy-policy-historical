**Privacy Policy  
Last Updated August 19, 2002**

This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personal information we collect when you access our American Type Culture Collection ("ATCC", "we", "us", or "our") web site located at [www.atcc.org](http://www.atcc.org/) (the "Site"). This Privacy Policy applies and is limited to treatment of information that is collected online. This Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected offline, such as information sent via postal mail, discussed on the phone or included in forms that you obtain from the Site but submit to ATCC by postal mail or fax.

**A.   General and Policy Updates**   
ATCC takes the privacy of your personal information very seriously and will make reasonable efforts to use your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Please review this Privacy Policy carefully.

We may revise this Privacy Policy over time. If we make significant changes, we will notify you by posting a notice on our Site. Please check the Site from time to time for the most current version of our Privacy Policy. Your continued use of the Site after we have notified you of such changes as described above constitutes your acceptance of such changes.

**B.   Information We Collect**   
When you use the shopping cart, place orders, submit forms online, e-mail ATCC (with questions, information or your resume), and at other times, you may provide ATCC with your personal information, such as your name, phone number and e-mail address. If you place an order, you may also be asked for credit card or other payment information. ATCC's web servers automatically collect web site usage information from you when you visit the Site, such as the number and frequency of visits to each web page, your Internet Protocol address, browser and platform type, length of stay, the web site you entered from, the actions you take and other information. Certain pages of the Site may use sessional and/or persistent cookies to track and store your information for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, and to allow us to recognize you if you return to the Site using the same computer and browser. In order to help process your orders and to protect against potential fraud, we may verify with third parties the personal information you provide to us. In the course of such verification, we may receive personal information about you from such third parties.

**Children**   
The Site is directed towards adults in the scientific community; ATCC does not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13. 

**C.   How We Use The Information Collected**   
We may combine the personal information you provide ATCC with other information about you that is available to us, including information from other sources. We may use this information to process, manage and deliver orders; to verify your account information; to troubleshoot; to provide you with technical information and customer service; to respond to your specific inquiries; to provide you with information on ATCC products and services, either on a personalized or aggregate basis; to develop new features and products for our visitors; to improve the content and navigation on the Site; to enforce the ATCC Terms of Use, resolve disputes, prevent and detect fraud, and otherwise help ATCC and its community to avoid legal liability; to notify you of changes to this Privacy Policy, or to other policies or terms that affect you and your use of the Site; and for other purposes. We will use your resume information only for the purpose of evaluating your candidacy for a job opening. We may share the information described in this paragraph with our wholly-owned subsidiary, BioDominion, for the purposes described above.

We may share your information with third parties to validate your payment information, to prevent fraud and to fulfill your order. If you have granted another user access to your order information on the Site, such user will have access to your personal information. We may also share your information with our service providers to perform marketing and other services on our behalf.  In addition, ATCC may disclose any information about you to law enforcement, regulatory agencies, other government officials or other third parties, as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate in connection with an investigation of fraud or other activity that is illegal or may expose us to legal liability, to enforce our policies governing our Site and for regulatory compliance. We may also disclose such information in connection with any merger or consolidation with, or sale of substantially all of our assets to, a third party, provided that such third party agrees to comply with our Privacy Policy.

**D.   Security**   
ATCC makes reasonable efforts to use industry-standard security technologies to secure your information. Servers where personal information is stored are password and firewall-protected, and access is limited to those employees and independent contractors with a need to know and only for the purposes identified above. All financial information is transmitted and stored in encrypted form. We maintain safeguards to protect the security, integrity and privacy of these servers and of your personal information.

**E.   Your Ability to Choose**   
We communicate with you to provide information, products and services that you have requested. It is your choice to send us these requests. You have the option to reject the Site's cookies and still use the Site. However, your access to the Site will be limited. For example, you will not be able to place or track orders.
