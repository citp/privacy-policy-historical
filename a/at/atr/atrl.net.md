# ATRL - Privacy Statement

ATRL cares about your privacy and would not take or use any information that you wouldn't willfully give to us.

**Registration**  
When registering for ATRL, you provide to us a user name, email address, and password. Your password is encrypted by vBulletin software and cannot be viewed by anyone, including administrators, though it can be reset to a random password by request if needed. When posting messages at ATRL, we keep a log of your computer's IP addresses, in order to track abusive or duplicate members and deal with them accordingly.

**Who's Online**  
When visiting any page of ATRL, the location of the page that you are viewing is stored on the [Who's Online](http://atrl.net/forums/online.php) page for 15 minutes after the last page you have clicked on. ATRL administrators and moderators can view your IP address during this time, but other visitors and members cannot. Members can choose to be "invisible" to everyone while browsing the site, and therefore not appear on the Who's Online page, by selecting that option on ATRL's [Preferences](http://atrl.net/forums/profile.php?do=editoptions) page.

**Cookies**  
ATRL uses cookies, small text files that are stored on your computer, to keep you signed in. By default, once you sign in, ATRL stores a cookie on your computer until you choose to sign out, keeping you automatically signed in otherwise. However, if you uncheck "Remember Me" when signing in, ATRL will only store a cookie temporarily while you are browsing, and you will be automatically signed out after 15 minutes of inactivity. If your browser does not support cookies, a session ID will be sent through each link to keep you signed in until you stop browsing or sign out.

**Email**  
From ATRL's [Preferences](http://atrl.net/forums/profile.php?do=editoptions) page, members can choose how their email addresses will be used. By default, ATRL may use your email address to send you important information about changes to the site, to notify you of replies to your subscribed threads, to respond to a question, and to check for duplicate members. However, you can choose to opt out of all email communication from the [Preferences](http://atrl.net/forums/profile.php?do=editoptions) page.

**Private Messages**  
ATRL also uses a private messaging system to allow members to easily communicate with each other, as well as a personal notepad feature. Private messages and notes are stored in our server's database unencrypted, but no one else can read your messages or notes. If you wish, you can choose to opt out of all private message communication from ATRL's [Preferences](http://atrl.net/forums/profile.php?do=editoptions) page.

**Advertisements**  
We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information about your visits to this and other websites (but never your name, address, email address, or telephone number) in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please go to [Google's privacy center](http://www.google.com/privacy.html).

**vBulletin**  
For more information about vBulletin, the software that powers ATRL, including the member database, login system, and forums, visit the [vBulletin web site](http://www.vbulletin.com/).

**Contact Us**  
Check this page periodically for updates. If you have any questions about this privacy statement, please write to the [ATRL webmaster](http://atrl.net/forums/sendmessage.php).

Privacy Statement last updated: March 17, 2009.
