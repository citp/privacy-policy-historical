team at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:customercare@theambassadors.com">customercare@theambassadors.com</a>.</p>

<p style="">Once you do this,
we will update your profile to ensure that you don’t receive any further
marketing messages. However, please note that it might take a few days for our
systems to be updated, so you might continue to receive messages from us whilst
we process your request.</p>

<p style="">Stopping marketing
messages from us will not end communications such as updates in relation to
your order of tickets or useful information about your visit to one of our
events.</p>

<p style=""><b>5.&nbsp;THIRD
PARTY LINKS</b></p>

<p style="">Our websites and
communications with you may provide links to the websites of third parties.
Please remember that when you use a link to go from one of our websites to
another website, or you request a service from a third party, this Privacy
Policy no longer applies.</p>

<p style="">Your browsing and
interaction on any other website, or your dealings with any other third-party
service provider, are subject to that website’s or third-party service
provider’s own rules and policies.</p>

<p style="">We do not monitor,
control, or endorse the privacy practices of any third parties.</p>

<p style="">We encourage you
to become familiar with the privacy practices of every website that you visit
or third-party service provider that you deal with, and to contact them if you
have any questions about their respective privacy policies and practices.</p>

<p style="">This privacy
policy applies solely to personal information collected by us through our
websites and does not apply to these third-party websites and third-party
service providers.</p>
<p style=""><b>&nbsp;6.&nbsp;KEEPING
AND STORING YOUR INFORMATION</b></p>
<p style="">Retaining your
personal information. We keep your
personal information for as long as we require for the purposes for which it
was collected (see above). Once the relevant purpose has been satisfied we will
securely delete or anonymise your personal information unless we are required
to retain a copy of such information under applicable law.</p>
<p style="">Where we store
your personal information.&nbsp;All personal information that you provide is stored
on our secure servers or those of our suppliers which may be situated outside
of the European Economic Area (“EEA”). Your information may also be processed
by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers
for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. Where we transfer personal
information outside of the EEA we will ensure that adequate contractual safeguards
are in place (e.g. the European Commission’s standard data protection clauses
or “model clauses”), to ensure the security of your personal information
is maintained when it is processed by the third party.</p>

<p style=""><b>&nbsp;7.&nbsp;HOW
WE PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</b></p>
<p style="">We are committed
to keeping your personal information secure. We take appropriate technical and
organisational measures to ensure the security of all personal information we
hold (and endeavour to only work with third parties who provide equivalent protections)
in accordance with industry best practices (for example, if you provide us with
your credit card information, the information is encrypted to ensure its
security). However, please note that there are inherent security implications
of disclosing personal information online for which we cannot be held
responsible.</p>

<p style="">Account details. You are responsible for
keeping the log in details and password in respect of any account you hold with
us confidential at all times.</p>
<p style=""><b>8.&nbsp;WHAT
ARE YOUR RIGHTS OVER YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</b></p>

<p style="">You have rights in
relation to the personal information we hold about you, and have the right to:</p>

<p style="">·<span>&nbsp;
</span>A
copy of your personal information which we hold about you;</p>

<p style="">·<span>&nbsp;
</span>Request that we correct any personal
information that is inaccurate or out of date;</p>

<p style="">·<span>&nbsp;
</span>Withdraw your consent to processing at
any time if we have relied on your consent to process your personal
information;</p>

<p style="">·<span>&nbsp;
</span>Request in certain circumstances that
your personal information is removed from our systems where it is no longer necessary
for us to hold your personal information;</p>

<p style="">·<span>&nbsp;
</span>Request in certain circumstances that
we transmit your personal information that we hold elsewhere (known as “data
portability”);</p>

<p style="">·<span>&nbsp;
</span>Object to us processing your personal
information. In this instance, we will stop processing your personal
information if we are relying on it for our own or someone else’s legitimate
interests, processing it for direct marketing or processing it for research
(unless such processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out
in the public interest);</p>

<p style="">·<span>&nbsp;
</span>Restrict the processing of your
personal information, if you contest the accuracy of the personal information
that we hold about you. This means we must stop any processing activities until
we have verified the accuracy of the personal information, or we no longer need
your personal information; and</p>

<p style="">·<span>&nbsp;
</span>Contact us directly and be given an
explanation about any automated decision-making and profiling that produces a
legal (or similarly significant) effect on you.</p>
<p style=""><b>9.&nbsp;CHANGES
TO HOW WE PROTECT YOUR PRIVACY</b></p>

<p style="">To ensure that you
continue to be aware of how we use your personal information, we will update
this privacy policy from time to time to reflect any changes to our use of your
personal information. We may also make changes as required to comply with
changes in applicable law or regulatory requirements.</p>

<p style="">If we make
significant changes this Privacy Policy, we will make that clear the next time
you access our website or notify you by some other means of contact such as
email, so that you are able to review the changes before you continue to use
our website and/or services. However, we encourage you to review this privacy
notice periodically to be informed of how ATG uses your personal information.</p>
