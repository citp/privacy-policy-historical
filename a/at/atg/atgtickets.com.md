**Collation of personal Information**

We may collate different categories of information that we collect about you. Where this is the case, and where such collated data amounts to personal information, we will process this data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

**3.   ****SHARING YOUR INFORMATION**

We will never sell, exchange or otherwise distribute your personal information to third parties without your consent except to the extent required by applicable laws and regulations, or as set out in this Privacy Policy.

However, we share your data with the following categories of companies as an essential part of being able to provide our services to you:

·  Companies within the Group (where necessary to provide our services to you), as sometimes different Group companies can be responsible for different activities;

·  The venue in respect of any ticket booking you have made;

·  Our business partners, suppliers, agents and sub-contractors where necessary to fulfil data processing activities for the purposes listed in this policy on our behalf, for example third parties who provide services to us (e.g. payment processors, delivery companies) or on our behalf (e.g. our ticketing partners); or

·  Analytics and search engine providers that assist us in the improvement of our websites and the services we provide.

**Exceptional circumstances**

We may also disclose your personal information to third parties if:

·  We undergo a change of control or any of our business or assets are sold or transferred (in which case we may disclose your personal information to the buyer to enable them to continue providing services to you);

·  We are under a duty to disclose or share your information to comply with any legal obligation (for example, a court order); or

·  We need to protect our rights, property, the safety of our website users/customers or to help prevent fraud or crime. This may include exchanging personal information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection or with governmental and law enforcement authorities.

**Anonymised and pseudonymised data**

We may anonymise personal information so that you can no longer be identified from such information. We may also pseudonymise your personal information. This allows us to recognise where multiple behaviours are linked to a certain individual, without seeing any personally identifiable data. You will be able to contact us directly to tell us what you think, have the decision explained, and the opportunity to challenge the resulting decision.

**4.   ****YOUR INFORMATION AND DIRECT MARKETING**

Where you have consented or where we have a legitimate interest, we will use your personal information to contact you via email, SMS, telephone or post (depending on any preferences notified to us) with relevant information about ATG, our websites, our products, services, offers and events. Where you have asked to receive information about our Group, our corporate partners or sponsors, your personal information will be used by us to send this information to you. 

**How to stop marketing messages from ATG**

You can stop receiving marketing messages from us at any time. You can do this:

·  By clicking on the ‘unsubscribe’ link in any marketing email or sms; or

·  By contacting our Customer Care team at [customercare@theambassadors.com](mailto:customercare@theambassadors.com).

Once you do this, we will update your profile to ensure that you don’t receive any further marketing messages. However, please note that it might take a few days for our systems to be updated, so you might continue to receive messages from us whilst we process your request.

Stopping marketing messages from us will not end communications such as updates in relation to your order of tickets or useful information about your visit to one of our events.

**5.   ****THIRD PARTY LINKS**

Our websites and communications with you may provide links to the websites of third parties. Please remember that when you use a link to go from one of our websites to another website, or you request a service from a third party, this Privacy Policy no longer applies.

Your browsing and interaction on any other website, or your dealings with any other third-party service provider, are subject to that website’s or third-party service provider’s own rules and policies.

We do not monitor, control, or endorse the privacy practices of any third parties.

We encourage you to become familiar with the privacy practices of every website that you visit or third-party service provider that you deal with, and to contact them if you have any questions about their respective privacy policies and practices.

This privacy policy applies solely to personal information collected by us through our websites and does not apply to these third-party websites and third-party service providers.

**6.   ****HOW WE KEEP AND STORE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION**

**Retaining your personal information**. We keep your personal information for as long as we require for the purposes for which it was collected (see above). Once the relevant purpose has been satisfied we will securely delete or anonymise your personal information unless we are required to retain a copy of such information under applicable law.

**Where we store your personal information.** All personal information that you provide is stored on our secure servers or those of our suppliers which may be situated outside of the European Economic Area (“EEA”). Your information may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. Where we transfer personal information outside of the EEA we will ensure that adequate contractual safeguards are in place (e.g. the European Commission’s standard data protection clauses or “ **model clauses** ”), to ensure the security of your personal information is maintained when it is processed by the third party.

**7.   ****HOW WE PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION**

We are committed to keeping your personal information secure. We take appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure the security of all personal information we hold (and endeavour to only work with third parties who provide equivalent protections) in accordance with industry best practices (for example, if you provide us with your credit card information, the information is encrypted to ensure its security). However, please note that there are inherent security implications of disclosing personal information online for which we cannot be held responsible.

**Account details**. You are responsible for keeping the log in details and password in respect of any account you hold with us confidential at all times.

**8.   ****WHAT ARE YOUR RIGHTS OVER YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION**

You have rights in relation to the personal information we hold about you, and have the right to:

·   A copy of your personal information which we hold about you;

·  Request that we correct any personal information that is inaccurate or out of date;

·  Withdraw your consent to processing at any time if we have relied on your consent to process your personal information;

·  Request in certain circumstances that your personal information is removed from our systems where it is no longer necessary for us to hold your personal information;

·  Request in certain circumstances that we transmit your personal information that we hold elsewhere (known as “ **data portability** ”);

·  Object to us processing your personal information. In this instance, we will stop processing your personal information if we are relying on it for our own or someone else’s legitimate interests (except if we can demonstrate compelling legal grounds for the processing), processing it for direct marketing or processing it for research (unless such processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest);

·  Restrict the processing of your personal information, if you contest the accuracy of the personal information that we hold about you. This means we must stop any processing activities until we have verified the accuracy of the personal information, or we no longer need your personal information; and

·  Contact us directly and be given an explanation about any automated decision-making and profiling that produces a legal (or similarly significant) effect on you.

**9.   ****CHANGES TO HOW WE PROTECT YOUR PRIVACY**

To ensure that you continue to be aware of how we use your personal information, we will update this privacy policy from time to time to reflect any changes to our use of your personal information. We may also make changes as required to comply with changes in applicable law or regulatory requirements.

If we make significant changes to this Privacy Policy, we will make that clear the next time you access our website or notify you by some other means of contact such as email, so that you are able to review the changes before you continue to use our website and/or services. However, we encourage you to review this privacy notice periodically to be informed of how ATG uses your personal information.

**10.   ****HOW WE USE COOKIES**

We use cookies on our website. For more information on cookies, please see our [Cookie Policy](http://www.atgtickets.com/cookies/) to find out more about the cookies we use and how to manage and delete cookies.
