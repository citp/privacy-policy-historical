Users of the Site do so at their own risk with respect to such communications.

## 5\. Geographic Location

**5.1 Transfer and Processing of Data**

For users within the United States, we process data in data centers located in the United States.  We have adopted reasonable physical, technical, and organizational safeguards against accidental, unauthorized, or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, disclosure, access, use, or processing of user data in our possession.  We comply with state and federal laws governing the protection of personal information.

For users within the European Union and Switzerland, we transfer data from the European Union to data centers located in the United States for processing.  Such processing is performed in accordance with Regulation 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 27, 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and free movement of such data, known as the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”).  This includes the imposition of required safeguards with respect to accidental, unauthorized or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, disclosure, access, use or processing of data. Transfers of European Union user data to processors in the United States are made in accordance with the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework, as explained below.

**5.2 Users Located in the European Union and Switzerland**

We have undertaken efforts to comply with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland transferred to the United States pursuant to Privacy Shield.  We have undertaken efforts to certify that we adhere to the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to such data. If there is any conflict between the policies in this privacy policy and data subject rights under the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification page, please visit [https://www.privacyshield.gov/](https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome)

  * request an accounting of all personal information that we possess that pertains to you in an electronically portable format (e.g., electronic copies of information attached to an email).
  * request that we change any personal information that pertains to you.
  * request that we delete any personal information that pertains to you.
  * fully or partially withdraw your consent to the collection, processing, and/or transfer of your personal information.



To request an accounting of your personal information, a change to your personal information, deletion of your personal information, or to withdraw your consent to the collection, processing, and/or transfer of your personal information, contact privacy@atiim.com. Once we have received notification that you withdraw your consent, we will no longer process your information for the purpose(s) to which you originally consented unless there are compelling legitimate grounds for further processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.

We commit to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information transferred to the United States pursuant to the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework.  EU and Swiss residents with Privacy Shield inquiries or complaints should first contact our CTO at privacy@atiim.com.

We are committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the Privacy Shield Framework to an independent dispute resolution mechanism, the BBB EU PRIVACY SHIELD, operated by the Council of Better Business Bureaus. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed, please visit [www.bbb.org/EU-privacy-shield/for-eu-consumers](https://www.bbb.org/EU-privacy-shield/for-eu-consumers/) for more information and to file a complaint. This service is provided free of charge to you.

If your Privacy Shield complaint cannot be resolved through the above channels, under certain conditions, you may invoke binding arbitration for some residual claims not resolved by other redress mechanisms.  See Privacy Shield Annex 1 at <https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=ANNEX-I-introduction>.[](https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=ANNEX-I-introduction)

You also have a right to lodge a complaint with a national Data Protection Authority.  Each European Union member nation has established its own Data Protection Authority; you can find out about the Data Protection Authority in your country here: <http://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/structure/data-protection-authorities/index_en.htm>.

## 6\. Data Storage

Atiim uses third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to run Atiim. Although Atiim owns the code, databases, and all rights to the Atiim application, you retain all rights to your data.

We will only retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected and processed, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, accounting or reporting requirements.

In some circumstances, we may anonymize your personal information so that it can no longer be associated with you, in which case it is no longer personal information.

It is our policy to retain personal information for 3 months once such personal information is no longer necessary to deliver the Service and to delete such personal information thereafter.  This means that, if you close your account with us, we will delete personal information associated with your account after 3 months. Regarding other types of information we collect as described in this policy (Cookies, Log Files, Geo-Location Information, Device Identifiers), it is our policy to retain such personal information for 3 months and to delete such personal information thereafter.

## 7\. Disclosure

Atiim may disclose personally identifiable information under special circumstances, such as in compliance with lawful requests of public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements, or when your actions violate the Terms of Service.
