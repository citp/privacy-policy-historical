# ATI Technologies Inc.

|    
This privacy policy discloses how ATI Technologies Inc. ("ATI") collects, protects, uses and shares information gathered about you on our www.ati.com web site (the "Site"). We hope that this policy will help increase your confidence in our Site and enhance your experience on the Internet.

As a general guideline, ATI is committed to protecting your privacy and to ensuring you have a secure online experience. You can surf through most of our site without providing us any information about yourself. In some instances, however, we do need information to provide services that you may request. This privacy policy explains how we use and collect data about you in those situations. 

**Collection of Personal Information**

ATI will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you (personal information) or allows us to contact you. Generally, this information is requested when you are asked to register before entering a contest, ordering e-mail newsletters, joining a limited-access premium site, or when purchasing and registering ATI products. Personal information collected by ATI often is limited to e-mail address, language, country or location, but may include other information when needed to provide a service you requested. 

When you buy and install a new product, we may ask you to register your purchase electronically. When you do, we keep this registration information on file with any information you've already given us on previous visits to our Site. This is considered your personal information. 

**ATI's Use of Personal Information**

We use your personal information for four primary purposes: 

  * To make the site easier for you to use by not making you enter your personal information more than once.
  * To help you quickly find software, services or information on the Site.
  * To help us create and deliver content most relevant to you.
  * To alert you to product upgrades, special offers, updated information and other new services from ATI.

We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, including packaging, mailing and delivering purchases, answering customer questions about products or services, sending postal mail and processing event registration. We will only provide those companies the information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose. 

ATI will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process served on ATI or the Site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of ATI and its Site, and, (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Site, or the public.

**Control of your Personal Information**

When you register, or otherwise give us personal information, ATI will not share that information with third parties without your permission, other than for the limited exceptions already listed. It will only be used for the purposes stated above. 

ATI may send out periodic e-mails informing you of technical service issues related to a product or service you requested. You will, of course, be able to choose to unsubscribe to these mailings.

**Security of your Personal Information**

ATI strictly protects the security of your personal information and will honor your choices for its intended use. We carefully protect your data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration, or destruction. 

Your personal information is never shared outside the company with any third parties without your permission, except under conditions explained above. Inside the company, data is stored in password-controlled servers with limited access. Your information may be stored and processed in Canada or any other country where ATI, its subsidiaries, affiliates or agents are located. 

**Cookies**

To ensure we are publishing content customers need and want, ATI collects aggregated site-visitation statistics using cookies. We do not track individuals' use of the site. 

When someone visits the site, a cookie is placed on the customer's machine (if the customer accepts cookies) or is read if the customer has visited the site previously. 

Web beacons, also known as clear gif technology, or action tags, assist in delivering the cookie. This technology tells us how many visitors clicked on key elements (such as links or graphics) on a Site page. We do not use this technology to access your personally identifiable information on the Site; it is a tool we use to compile aggregated statistics about usage of the Site. We do not share tracking information outside of ATI, and do not allow other companies to place clear gifs on our sites. 

If you choose to not have your browser accept cookies from the Site, you will be able to view the text on the screens, however you will not experience a personalized visit nor will you be able to subscribe to the service offerings on the site. 

**Changes to this Policy**

ATI will occasionally update this privacy statement. When we do, we will also revise the "last updated" date at the top of the privacy statement. For material changes to this Statement, ATI will notify you by placing prominent notice on the Web site. 

**Further Information**

ATI welcomes your comments regarding this Statement of Privacy, please contact us by e-mail or postal mail.
