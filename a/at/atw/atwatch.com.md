Atwatch collects information about our customers and sites only during registration and subscription to the Atwatch service. Atwatch respects our customers right to privacy. The data we collect is used in the aggregate to give us demographic information about the entire Atwatch customer base in order to improve the Atwatch service. The corporate or personal information you provide - name, address, etc. -- allows us to inform you about updates to the service and to notify you of products and services of Atwatch, its affiliates and third parties that we believe may be of interest to you. We also share aggregate information -- not individual data --with our advertisers to help them better understand our services and to monitor the reach of their advertising on the service. 

Atwatch uses reasonable precautions to keep all information disclosed to us secure and to disclose such information only to third parties we believe to be responsible. However, we are not responsible for any breach of security or for any actions of any third parties which receive the information. Atwatch also links to a wide variety of other sites. We are not responsible for their privacy policies or how they treat information about their users.
