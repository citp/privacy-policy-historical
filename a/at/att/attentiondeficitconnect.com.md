## Information Alliance Health Collects

_Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data:_

We may use this information in the administration of this site, diagnose problems with our server, to improve site usability, to analyze trends, to track users' movement around the site, and to gather Demographic Information (definition below) about our user base as a whole.

_Click-through URL:_

In some of our email messages we use a click-through URL linked to content on our site. When visitors click one of these URLs, they pass through our web server before arriving at the destination web page. We track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our communications. If you prefer to avoid this type of tracking; avoid clicking text or graphic links on the site or in site related emails.

_Pixel tags:_

Pixel tags are tiny graphic images that tell us what parts of our site visitors have visited. This allows us to measure the effectiveness of searches visitors perform on our site. Pixel tags also enable us to send email messages in a format consumers can read. Pixel tags also allow us to determine whether emails have been opened, thereby ensuring that we're sending only messages that are of interest to consumers. We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to consumers.

_Web Beacons:_

We employ or our third party tracking utility partner employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customer’s personal information.

#### Demographic Information

Based on our collection of your geographic location such as a submitted zip code or your IP address, we may extrapolate demographic characteristics about you. This data is not unique to you but refers to selected population characteristics, based on your geo-location and may include, age, preferences, gender, race or ethnicity, occupation, career history, interests and favorites.

#### Behavioral Information

Behavioral information, individual and aggregate, is about individuals' online activity over a period of time to determine potential future behaviors or interests. We use behavioral information in aggregate to improve your web experience including presenting content and offers that may be most relevant to you based on previous online actions.

This information can include information regarding how visitors use our sites, the areas of the sites that are visited, what services are accessed, and information about your computer hardware and software, geolocation, browser, operating system type, domain names, access times, and referring Web site addresses.

Some of this information is necessary for analyzing the use of resources, troubleshooting problems, preventing fraud, and improving our services.

#### Cookie Information

A cookie is a small text file stored by a web site on your computer to track information. It is important to know that there are many types of cookies. We may link cookie information to Personally Identifiable Information. Following each cookie type are links for information on how to manage your privacy for that type of cookie.

  * To tailor advertising to you both on our site and other sites on the web based on cookie information collected on our site




Submission of your Personally Identifiable Information and accessing our sites provides you with a wealth of information including discussions, ratings and reviews, and blog postings. In most cases, this information is retained and used, for instance, so you can return to view prior messages you have sent or easily see your friend list. When you update your community membership information, a backup copy of the prior version is kept for a reasonable period of time to enable revision to the prior version of that information should the need arise.

Furthermore, we provide you with a variety of options for you to take control of your health by providing you with promotions and offers through our partnerships. When you "opt-in" to one of our partner advertising offers and you provide your Personally Identifiable Information to receive an advertising offer within or hosted on our site we are committed to providing the information you submitted to our advertising partners.

When you make such request, you provide consent for us to disclose (share, sell, rent or trade) your Personally Identifiable Information, such as your name, address, phone or address, to said third party who may then use your Personally Identifiable Information to contact you; and provide you the information, materials, products or services you requested.

In such specific cases, you may also specifically grant Alliance Health and said third party permission to contact you by telephone, mail and/or email, including phone calls that may use computer assisted technology and/or pre-recorded messages.

Occasionally we may utilize this information ourselves in an aggregate basis to understand your preferences or disclose this same information in aggregate with our sponsors and advertising partners to provide better service to you.

We respect your privacy in the utmost and commit never to pursue the following activities:

  * Disclose your private online communications; however, information you choose to post in public forums or comments on our sites is open to the general public and search engines. We do however provide the ability for you to de-identify your conversations through tools that we provide like anonymous Connect posting or offer privacy solutions featured in the user profile.

  * Share, rent, or sell or trade your Personally Identifiable Information with third parties except where you have positively and explicitly "opted-in", to an offer within or hosted on our site requesting information, materials, products or services from a third party, such as our advertising partners.




In certain circumstances we may share Personally Identifiable Information for the following purposes:

  * We may employ other companies and individuals, as our subcontractors, to perform functions on our behalf. These companies and individuals may not share any Personally Identifiable Information with any third party. All such subcontractors are contractually obligated to use and maintain the confidentiality of Personally Identifiable Information in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy.

  * The authentication and verification of Personally Identifiable Information to prevent fraud on our platform.

  * Disclose Personally Identifiable Information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be violating the site's Privacy Policy and/or Terms of Use.

  * This same disclosure policy also applies to those cases where we believe an individual may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) the rights or property of Alliance Health, other site users, of anyone else that could be harmed by such activities.

  * Disclose or access Personally Identifiable Information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it, and for administrative and other purposes deemed necessary to maintain, service, and improve our products and services and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site.

## Our Advertising Partners and Our Relationships to Other Companies

In our effort to empower consumers and help enable a more consumer-centric healthcare industry, we are committed to providing a free and independent service. As a result our site may contain information, links to other sites and advertisements of healthcare services and partners that may help you make educated healthcare choices. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of such websites but encourage you to evaluate their specific commitment to you.

Certain products and services marketed through the site are made available by the trusted partner companies of Alliance Health with which we have a strategic alliance. To obtain these products and services you may be required to visit another company's website or a site they share with the site. When ordering, registering for, or purchasing products or services from these partners, you will be entering into an agreement with that partner, and not with Alliance Health. In these cases, this privacy policy does not apply; instead, the privacy policy of the partner providing the goods or services will apply.

We urge you to read and understand our partners' policies before entering into agreements with them. We are committed to partnering with companies that share our privacy concerns. Alliance Health, however, cannot control the way these partners collect or use information.

If you have questions about our partners' privacy policies or the privacy policies of these other sites, we encourage you to contact them directly.

All Alliance Health offers are subject to participation by the advertising partner, product availability, and any applicable state or federal laws that govern such offers. Any offers shown are reasonable facsimiles, and participating advertising partners reserve the right to withdraw offers, substitute another product, or modify offers at their sole discretion.

## Security

We use secure technology, privacy protection controls, and restrictions on employee access in order to safeguard your Personally Identifiable Information.

  * We use a secure, respected hosting provider for all of our sites, which are housed in a SAS 70 TYPE II certified data center.

  * We also use firewalls and other access controls on our servers that are monitored to help protect against security vulnerabilities.

  * When Personally Identifiable Information is entered or displayed on registration forms and pages, we encrypt that information. We exclusively use 2048 bit SSL certificates.




Each and every one of our employees servicing our sites are obligated to abide by the Privacy Policy. Only authorized employees servicing our sites are permitted to have access to your Personally Identifiable Information, and such access is limited by need.

Since the internet is not a 100% secure environment, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Alliance Health. There is no guarantee that the information may not be accessed, copied, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.

Any improper collection or misuse by unauthorized third parties of Personally Identifiable Information, or other information provided on the site is a violation of the terms of use and should be reported to [community@alliancehealth.com](mailto:community@alliancehealth.com). 

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use at any time, so please review them frequently.

If we make material changes to either our Privacy Policy or our Terms of Use, we will notify you here, or by email, or by means of a notice on our home page prior to the change becoming effective.

Although this Privacy Policy is not a contract and does not create any legal rights, it does serve as an expression of our commitment to protecting Personally Identifiable Information.

The most current version of this Privacy Policy, which supersedes all previous versions, can be reviewed by clicking on the Privacy Policy at the bottom of each page of this site.

Your use of the site and any services provided by Alliance Health after any changes to this Privacy Policy are implemented constitutes your acknowledgement and acceptance of any such changes.
