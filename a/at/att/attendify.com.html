    <header>
      <h2>Purpose of the Privacy Policy.</h2>
    </header>
    <p>KitApps, Inc. dba Attendify (“Attendify”, “we” or “us”) provides a platform to enable clients (“Attendify Clients”) to create and manage various mobile or web applications (“App” or “Apps”) as well as related support and hosting services (“Service” or “Services”). Attendify Clients in turn make the Apps available to their customers (“End Users”) for use in connection with the events and conferences arranged by Attendify Clients.
    </p><p>We are committed to respecting the privacy rights of Attendify Clients and their End Users, and we created this Privacy Policy to give you notice of how your private information will be used by us as a result of submitting it via the Apps. This Privacy Policy provides information on our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information we receive from (1) Attendify Clients, (2) End Users who download and use the Apps created by Attendify Clients (“End Users”), and (3) visitors who simply browse the Site or Apps (“Visitors”). End Users may be asked by Attendify Clients to provide additional information to them, including your personally identifiable information, to be used and shared pursuant to their own privacy policies, and we may collect and share information related to interactions by End Users with Attendify Client Apps. We encourage you to read Attendify Clients privacy policies before providing any information to them or other third parties. We are not responsible for the use of your information by Attendify Clients, and disclaim any liability related thereto.
    </p><p>This Safe Harbor Privacy Policy Statement (the “Policy”) sets forth the privacy principles Attendify follows with respect to transfers of personal information from the European Economic Area (EEA) (which includes the twenty-seven member states of the European Union (EU) plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway) and from Switzerland to the United States. 
    </p><p><a href="http://safeharbor.export.gov/list.aspx">We self-certify compliance with:</a></p>
    <p>
      <a class="img-container" href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor">
        <img title="Safe Harbor Privacy Policy" alt="Safe Harbor Privacy Policy" src="//assets.attendify.com/website/0.0.26-staging/assets/img/content/safe-harbor-privacy.png">
      </a>
    </p>
    <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Site. You are advised to consult this policy regularly for any changes. 
  </p></section>

  <section>
    <header>
      <h2>1. What Information Do You Collect and How Do You Collect It?</h2>
    </header>
    <p>At various times, you could be asked to provide information such as your name, email address, contact phone number or other information. Information collected is often defined as being either anonymous or personally identifiable: 
    </p><ol>
      <li>Anonymous Information refers to information that cannot be tied back to a specific individual. For instance, we may know that thousands of people have visited this Privacy Policy, but we do not necessarily know their names, where they live, or their date of birth. What we collect from visits such as this constitutes anonymous information. Some of the individuals who access our Services decline to use the personalization features that are available to them, and therefore those individuals are anonymous to us and the only data we collect about them is anonymous information. 
      </li><li>Personally Identifiable Information refers to information that tells us specifically who you are, such as your name, email address, or phone number. Downloading and using an App may allow the Company to “recognize” you to allow us to personalize our service for you. 
    </li></ol>
    <h2>Anonymous Information</h2>
    <p>As is true of most apps and web sites, we gather certain information (such as mobile provider, operating system, etc.) automatically and store it in log files. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the app, to track users movements around the app and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may link this automatically-collected data to certain Personally Identifiable Information. 
    </p><h2>Personally Identifiable Information</h2>
    <p>If you are an Attendify Client, when you register with us via our Web Site to create and manage Apps, we will ask you for personally identifiable information, such as your first and last name, company name, email address, billing address, and credit card information. You may review and update the personally identifiable information in your profile by logging in and editing such information in your dashboard. If you decide to delete all of your information we may cancel your account. We may retain an archived copy of your records as required by law or for reasonable business purposes. 
    </p><p>In order to use some features of this Service or an App, you may be asked by an Attendify Client to provide certain personal information (such as your name, company, title, email address, mailing address, and telephone or cell phone number). Providing such information is voluntary. Depending on the services you have chosen to use, some or all of your Personally Identifiable Information may be used by us to provide such services and by Attendify Clients. Personally Identifiable Information may also be provided to intermediaries and third parties who assist us with the Apps. Except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy, however, we will not rent or sell your Personally Identifiable Information to third parties without your permission. 
    </p><p>If you choose to allow an App to collect your location data, such location data will be available to the applicable Attendify Client. In addition, if you have an account with Facebook, Twitter, Google+, LinkedIn, Foursquare or other similar websites (each a “Social Network”), your Social Network identity, including your public picture, may be associated with your location data. KitApps, Inc. is the owner of the information collected through the Service. 
    </p><p><b>No Information Collected from Children.</b> Company will never knowingly collect any personal information about children under the age of 13. If Company obtains actual knowledge that it has collected personal information about a child under the age of 13, that information will be immediately removed from any access. Because it does not collect such information, Company has no such information to use or to disclose to third parties. Company has designed this policy in order to comply with the Children s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”).</p>

      <h2>2. How Do You Use Individual Information?</h2>
    </header>
    <p><b>General Use.</b> For Attendify Clients, we use personal information mainly to provide the Services and contact Attendify Clients regarding account activities, new version and product offerings, or other communications relevant to the Services. In general, we do not sell or share any personally identifiable information of End Users to any third parties, except, of course, to the applicable Attendify Client whose event you are attending. If you contact us by email or by filling-out a registration form, we may keep a record of your contact information and correspondence, and may use your email address, and any information that you provide to us in your message, to respond to you. In addition, we may use the personal information described above to send you information regarding the Apps and/or the Services. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such information or communications from us, email us at support@attendify.com and request to be removed from our list. The circumstances under which we may share such information with third parties are described in part (4) below.</p>

    <header>
      <h2>3. How Do You Store My Personal Information?</h2>
    </header>
    <p><b>Storage of Individual Information.</b> Company operates or leases secure data networks protected by industry standard firewall and password protection systems. Our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary, and only authorized individuals have access to the information provided by our customers.  Notwithstanding such measures, Company cannot guarantee that its security measures will prevent its computers from being illegally accessed, and the individual information on them stolen or altered.</p>
    <p><b>Third Party Hosting, Serving and Storage.</b>  COMPANY MAY CONTRACT WITH A VARIETY OF THIRD PARTY SUPPLIERS/PROVIDERS/VENDORS/SOCIAL NETWORKS FROM TIME TO TIME, TO PROVIDE FOR COMPANY S HOSTING, AUTHENTICATION, SERVING STORAGE AND TELECOMMUNICATION NEEDS, ETC., INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION STORAGE OF OUR USERS PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION.

  </section>

  <section>
    <header>
      <h2>4. Do You Disseminate Any Personal Information?</h2>
    </header>
    <p><b>Service Providers.</b> We may use third parties to help operate and distribute our Apps, authenticate users and deliver products and services, and may share your Personally Identifiable Information with our affiliates, service providers, vendors, suppliers, Social Networks and other third parties (including advertisers) that provide products or services for or through this Service (such as Web Site or database hosting companies, authentication providers, address list hosting companies, e-mail service providers, analytics companies, distribution companies and other similar service providers that use such information on our behalf). Unless otherwise stated, these companies do not have any right to use the Personally Identifiable Information we provide to them beyond what is necessary for them to assist us.
    </p><p><b>Aggregate Statistics.</b> We may disclose aggregate statistics regarding user behavior as a measure of interest in, and use of, our Service, our Apps and e-mails to third parties in the form of aggregate data, such as overall patterns or demographic reports that do not describe or identify any individual user.</p>
    <p><b>Complying with Legal Process.</b> Company reserves the right to use or disclose your Personally Identifiable Information in response to subpoenas, court orders, warrants, or legal process, or to otherwise establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims or in the event you violate or breach an agreement with Company. Company will use and disclose your Personally Identifiable Information if we believe you will harm the property or rights of Company, its owners, or those of Company s other customers. Finally, we will use or disclose your Personally Identifiable Information if we believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person or property, violations of Company s other policies, or as otherwise required by law when responding to subpoenas, court orders and other legal processes.</p>
    <p><b>Business Transitions.</b>  In the event Company goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets as well as in the event of a bankruptcy, assignment for benefit of creditors or receivership, your Personally Identifiable Information may be disclosed and will likely be among the assets transferred. You may be notified thereafter via prominent notice on our Company web site for 30 days of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information. Company further reserves the right to disclose, transfer or sell your personal information to companies who are affiliated with Company in Company s sole discretion.</p>

      <h2>5. Do You Allow Foreign Use Of The Apps?</h2>
    </header>
    <p>To the extent that you are accessing our Apps in the United States while domiciled outside of the United States, you acknowledge that the Personally Identifiable Information you are providing Company may be collected and stored in the United States and elsewhere and therefore consent to the transfer of information to and storage of the information outside of your domiciled country and in the United States and elsewhere, except in the case of data transfers from the EEA or Switzerland, which our covered under the EU Safe Harbor Framework.

      <h2>6. Do You Comply With The Safe Harbor Framework?</h2>
    </header>
