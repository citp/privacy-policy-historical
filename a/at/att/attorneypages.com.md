# Advice Company Privacy Statement

AttorneyPages.com is a unit of the Advice Company, and has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for the AttorneyPages.com website. Questions regarding this statement should be directed to the Webmaster by emailing [admin@adviceco.com](mailto:admin@adviceco.com)

#### Advice Company Privacy Policy

Advice Company is a leading provider of information and advice on the Internet and e-commerce solutions for individuals and businesses. We invite you to explore our Web site and find out what all the talk is about.

#### Information this Site Gathers/Tracks

The Advice Company's Web site logs IP addresses and browser types, but we do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means that a user's session will be tracked, but the user will be anonymous.

You can browse our site without entering any personal information and therefore remain anonymous during your visit. However, we hope that all of our visitors will register with us so that we can learn more about our valuable customers and keep them updated with our monthly newsletter. Our registration form asks users for name, email address, preferences, and various types of demographic information.

We encourage all visitors to register with Advice Company. Your name and email address are used to send you our newsletter containing news about the subjects you and fellow readers have asked us about. If you would rather not receive the newsletter, but would still like to register, please indicate your preference by marking the appropriate box presented on the registration form. Occasionally, we like to present you with special offers from our partners. This involves sharing your information with them so they can send you the offer. If you prefer, you can choose that your information not be shared with our partners by indicating your preference on the registration form. Preferences and demographic information is used to help us improve our service and products. The more we know about you, the better we can serve you.

Visitors may choose to voluntarily "Sign In", or request our Free online newsletter, use the Tell a Friend feature, complete a Visitor Survey, enter our contests, request information from us, or choose to use the FreeAdvice Live! feature. If so, we may on our own behalf send you Email, copies of our Free newsletters or surveys. (We would delete your Email address on request.)

If you choose to request a Consultation from an attorney listed on AttorneyPages' Lawyer Directory, you may do so directly by telephone, by fax, by mail or by using the online Request Form. As the Request Form states, you should NOT send any attorney any confidential information until and unless the attorney asks you to do so.

If you choose to use the online Request Form, your message is typically transmitted directly to the attorney by Email or through an independent provider's "Email to Fax service". We can take no responsibility for the transmission or delivery of any such message. A copy of most messages sent via the Request Form is sent to our archives, where it may be used on a confidential basis solely for Advice Company's own purposes, such as to determine traffic flow, attorney responsiveness or visitor satisfaction. Advice Company will maintain the confidentiality of any request from its end of the Internet to the fullest extent permitted by law.

If a visitor, within a short period of time, sends multiple copies of a similar message using a Request Form, or tries to evade our programs designed to prevent the sending of multiple messages, our systems or staff may alert us and/or some or all of the attorneys to that fact to enable the attorneys to take that into account in determining whether or not to reply or grant a Consultation. We may also bar the visitor from future use of the Websites or any of its features.

FreeAdvice.com and AttorneyPages.com NEVER require reports from attorneys on who contacts them through our Websites, or who becomes a client, or the nature or specifics of any matter. FreeAdvice.com and AttorneyPages.com are publishers, and not "legal referral bureaus" nor law firms, and NEVER receive any portion of any attorney's fees should you become a client of any attorney.

The only other place that we collect personal information on our Web site is on the order forms, which ask for billing information such as name, postal address, email address and credit card number should you decide to place an order online.

#### Use of the Information this Site Gathers/Tracks

The Advice Company Web site logs IP addresses for systems administration purposes and these logs are analyzed to constantly improve the value of the materials available on the website.

#### Surveys, Bulletin Boards and FreeAdvice Live!

Our online surveys ask visitors for contact information (like their email address) and demographic information (like their zip code, age, or income level). We use contact data from our surveys to send the user information about our company. Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. This information is shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis.

#### Posting information on the Site

Our FreeAdvice Live! feature allows visitors to chat directly with a an Advice Company participating professional. Visitors can sign on using an assumed name, but if they do identify themselves, by giving their email, name, address or other identifying information, the Company may use that information to contact you.

The Company maintains special relationships, such as "Powered by CommTouch" and "Powered by LivePerson" with various partners, business partners, and operated several co-branded sites. The operators of the co-branded sites may gather additional information; the Company sometimes has access to some or all of the information, and the Company's partner's use of the information is not within the Company's control.

#### Advice Company Order Form

The information that we require on our order form is only used to process your order quickly and accurately. Your contact information will only be used to send you the product that you purchase and your billing information will only be used to bill you for that product. This information may be used for marketing purposes by Advice Company. The customer's contact information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below.

#### Sharing of the Information this Site Gathers/Tracks

For those visitors who register with Advice Company, we share your name, email address, preferences, and demographic information with select partners so they can present you with special offers. Though, as mentioned above, you may tell us that you don't want your information shared, in which case we will of course respect your wishes. Please see the Opt-out section below.

The information that you submit on the order form (contact and billing information) is never shared with any third parties, including our partners.

#### Security

When you place an order online, your personal information and credit card information are scrambled using encryption technology before being sent over the Internet. This makes it virtually impossible for your information to be stolen or intercepted while being transferred through cyberspace. When we receive your order, it is kept encrypted until we're ready to process it. In addition, we erase your credit card information from our web site database so it isn't connected to the Internet, and is therefore safe from "hackers."

#### Links

Advice Company websites contain links to other Web sites. Please be aware that our privacy policy does not apply to these linked sites. We encourage you to read the posted privacy statement whenever interacting with any Web site.

#### Cookies

Our site uses cookies to keep track of items in your shopping cart and to provide our visitors with a tailored user experience. With the help of cookies, we can present you with customized content and ads that will be of more interest to you. We also use cookies in our bbs-forums to remember your passwords for you so you don't have to re-enter them each time you visit the site. You have the option of setting your browser to reject cookies. However, if certain cookies that track your purchase are rejected then we won't be able to keep items in your cart.

#### Advertiser Cookies

You may be served cookies from our advertisers or advertising agencies while visiting our site. We do not control, nor do we have access to any of the information they may collect.

#### Opt-out Policy

If at any time after registering, you change your mind about receiving the newsletter or sharing your information with third parties, you may send your requests to: Advice Company Privacy Manager, admin@adviceco.com

#### Correcting/Updating

If you would like to correct and/or update your registration information, please contact: Advice Company Customer Services, [admin@adviceco.com](mailto:admin@adviceco.com)

#### General Advice

Finally, although Advice Company has a very strong Privacy Protection policy on our end, and does its utmost to protect privacy of all visitors, we bear no responsibility for anyone else's conduct with respect to material you transmit. As is true with ANY Internet usage and access to ANY Website, if you are using someone else's computer, or someone else has access to your computer, or you are using a corporate or other "network", it may be possible for that "someone else" or the "network" operator to retrieve copies of Email you sent from the computer and/or to trace the places you have been visiting on the Internet.

#### Amendments

We may amend this Privacy Policy on a prospective basis (i.e., for future visits) at any time by posting a revised policy on our Web site. Further, nothing in this Privacy Policy is designed to protect the privacy of visitors whose use of the Company's Websites is, in the reasonable opinion of Advice Company or its attorneys, intended for illegal, improper or abusive purposes, for purposes of marketing or solicitation, or would violate any other terms and conditions relating to use of the Web site. This FreeAdvice.com Privacy statement is effective November 7, 1999.
