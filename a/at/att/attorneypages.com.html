<p>AttorneyPages.com is the exclusive attorney directory associated with FreeAdvice, which is recognized as the Number 1 Legal Website for consumers and small businesses.&nbsp; We respect the privacy of visitors to our site. AttorneyPages and FreeAdvice are units of Advice Company (Advice &amp; Counsel Incorporated), a leading provider of information and advice and E-commerce solutions on the Internet. </p>
<p>Please read this Privacy Policy so that you can understand how we seek to enforce our firm commitment to privacy. Questions regarding this statement should be directed to the Officer named below by emailing <a href="mailto:admin@adviceco.com">admin@adviceco.com</a></p>
<p>We invite you to explore <a href="http://attorneypages.com/">AttorneyPages</a> and its affiliated Websites, including <a href="http://freeadvice.com/">FreeAdvice</a> and <a href="http://expertpages.com/">ExpertPages</a>.</p>

<h3 style="color:#ff0000;">Information this Site Gathers / Tracks </h3>
<p>The information gathered by Advice Company falls into two categories: (1) information voluntarily supplied by visitors to our websites when they register or initiate transactions, and (2) tracking information gathered as visitors navigate through our sites. Third party providers featured on or linked to from our websites, such as vendors of products and services offered through our sites, may be gathering the same kinds of information.</p>
<p>To help make our sites more responsive to the needs of our visitors, help you navigate between sections, tailor content to your needs and to measure traffic within our sites, our web servers automatically collect limited information about your computer's connection to the Internet, including your IP address, when you visit our sites. They also invoke a standard feature of browser software, called a "cookie," to assign each visitor a unique, random number, a sort of user ID, which resides on your computer. The cookie helps give us an idea of which parts of our site users are visiting and doesn't actually identify the visitor, just the computer that a visitor uses to access our site. </p>
<p>Unless you voluntarily identify yourself (through registration or sending a message, for example), we won't know who you are, even if we assign a cookie to your computer. The only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply. Our cookies can't read unrelated data from your computer. Our advertisers and the third parties that provide products or services through our sites may also assign their own cookies to your browser, but we don't control their cookies or their processes, and they do not regularly share information they gather with us. </p>
<p>To make use of certain features on our websites (such as free email, personal web pages, our ask a lawyer live chat, bulletin boards and other interactive forums) visitors need to register and to provide certain information as part of the registration process. We may also ask for information from those who buy products or services or conduct other transactions on our websites. We may ask, for example, for your name, email address, street address, sex, age, city or town, zip code (and for those who seek to purchase a product or service, credit card number), and we sometimes request information on your interest in other topics.&nbsp; Those who choose to use our sites to transmit email messages to attorneys or experts also must provide certain identifying information, including name, city and state, email and phone number, so that the professional to whom the message is directed may reply to them. </p>
<p>The information you supply may help us to offer you more personalized features, to tailor our sites to your interests and make them more useful to you, and to process e-commerce transactions. Of course, even if you want to remain completely anonymous, you're still free to take advantage of the wealth of content available on our sites without registration. The vast majority of our sites do NOT require visitors to complete a registration form or give us contact information (such as a name and email address) to visit.</p>
<p>The more we know about our visitors the more value we can potentially offer them. Supplying such information is entirely voluntary. But if you don't supply the information we require, we may be unable to provide you with services we make available to other visitors to our sites. For example, while we allow anyone to read postings in our Bulletin Board / Forums without registration, asking a question or furnishing an answer requires registration, which enables visitors to modify their own posts. Our one-on-one live chat feature, FreeAdvice Live! also requires a separate registration. And we can't send you targeted email alerting you to a relevant new service we're offering, or articles on topics of interest to you, if you don't tell us what you're interested in and give us your email address. Similarly, we can't notify you that you've been lucky enough to win a prize in a promotional contest if we don't know how to contact you. Such personal information is gathered by us only with our users` knowing and active permission and participation.</p>
<p>Our online surveys and contests ask visitors for contact information (like their email address) and demographic information (like their zip code, age, or income level). Demographic and profile data collected at our site may be shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis.</p>
<p>We collect financial information (like an account or credit card numbers) only from visitors making a credit card or other purchase. We use the financial information solely to bill the user for products and services and necessary information from the order form to send orders. </p>
<p>We also use customer contact information from the various registration forms, opt in features and service features to send the user information about our site, our company and our affiliates. Users may opt-out of receiving routine future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below</p>
<p>As this privacy policy reaffirms, we strive to protect confidentiality for our visitors. We do reserve the right to use customer contact and other information when we deem it necessary or appropriate to comply with applicable laws, rules, or lawful orders of courts and governmental agencies, to enforce compliance with the terms and conditions for use of our sites, or to protect third parties from what we regard as threats of serious harm. </p>

<h3 style="color:#ff0000;">Third Party Features </h3>

However we cannot guarantee that the measures in place have been, are now, or will remain adequate. </p>

<h3 style="color:#ff0000;">Children's Guidelines</h3>
<p>This Web site is directed at adults, not children, and we do not seek to collect from children online contact information,&nbsp;or distribute to third parties any personally identifiable information from children, or entice children by the prospect of a special game, prize or other activity, to divulge information to us.
