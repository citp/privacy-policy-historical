# atmgreetings.com : Privacy Policy

**Privacy policy**

Overview 

atmgreetings.com (ATM) is a provider of free greeting cards on the Internet. This Overall Privacy Statement discloses the privacy practices for the entire atmgreetings.com website. 

ATM", protecting our users' privacy and security is a top priority. For this reason, we have adopted the following policy to advise you of our use of your personal information online and your choices regarding that use. This policy describes what types of information we gather about you, how we use it, under what circumstances we disclose it to third-parties, and your rights to update or correct it. 

Scope of Policy 

This Policy applies to all atmgreetings.com, including our co-branded sites as may be launched subject to changes from time to time as the circumstances may require. This Policy does not apply to other companies' or organizations' web sites to which we link. You should carefully review the privacy policies of those web sites in order to determine how they treat your personal information. 

What Information does atmgreetings.com collect? 

Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you with the best and most useful content and services. Because we derive revenue mainly from advertising, collecting information is essential to keep our services affordable to users. 

We collect personal information about our users during usage of the atmgreetings.com service, from our use of 'cookie' technology as and when you use the service and during sending or viewing an ecard through atmgreetings.com or while subscribing to our newsletter and special offer services. 

Information About You Information Gathered From All Visitors Aggregate Data 

We gather certain generic information with respect to customers' use of our web site, such as the number of unique visitors, the frequency with which they visit, and the areas on the web site that they favor. These statistics are very much like television ratings that tell the networks how many people tuned in to a program. We only use this type of data in aggregate-that is, we look at the data on a collective basis, in summary form, rather than on an individual basis. This data helps us determine the extent to which our customers use certain parts of our web site, which, in turn, enables us to make it as appealing as possible. We may also provide statistical "ratings" about how our customers collectively use our web site to advertisers, sponsors, and other companies with which we do business ("Business Partners"). We do this so they, too, can understand how often people use their areas of the site in order for them to provide you with the best possible experience. These statistical ratings do not contain any personally identifiable information about you or any of our users.
