_4.1._ We will use the personal information we collect, and may share such personal information with other entities (such as service providers) to:

  * provide our services (including retaining your data and content when you temporarily suspend your account);
  * identify you when you sign-in to your account and verify that your account is not being used by others;
  * carry out research and analysis so we can better understand and serve you;
