# Your privacy | Australian Taxation Office

When we administer the taxation laws, we collect information about you.  We may get this information from you or from other parties.  We respect your privacy and keep your information confidential.

Privacy refers to the right of an individual to have their personal information protected, and know how their personal information may be used and for what purposes. It also refers to the obligations of those who receive the personal information and how this information is handled.

Personal information is any information that can identify a living person. This may include names, addresses, date of birth, gender, phone numbers or employment details.

In general terms, the _Privacy Act 1988_ protects the personal information of individuals. It protects an individual against unauthorised disclosures of personally identifiable information. Taxpayer confidentiality protects information about a taxpayer's affairs obtained under the taxation laws.

We comply with the _Privacy Act 1988_ , which contains provisions designed to safeguard personal information about you. The Privacy Act requires us to comply with privacy principles set out in that Act.

The amended principles of the Privacy Act became effective on12 March 2014. As an individual, the Privacy Act gives you greater control over the way that your personal information is handled. The Privacy Act allows you to:

  * know why your personal information is being collected, how it will be used and who it will be disclosed to
  * ask for access to your records (including your sensitive information about you)
  * correct inaccurate information about you
  * make a complaint, if you think we have mishandled your personal information.
