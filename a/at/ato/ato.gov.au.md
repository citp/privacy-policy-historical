Cookies are pieces of information that a website can transfer to an individual's computer hard drive for record keeping. Cookies can make websites easier to use by storing information about your preferences on a particular website. The information remains on your computer after the Internet session finishes. ATO _assist_ uses cookies in two very limited ways. 

The first time you visit ATO _assist_ one cookie will be stored on your computer. On each visit to ATO _assist_ the system checks whether there is an ATO _assist_ cookie on your computer. If so, it simply notes its presence and records your visit to ATO _assist_ as a 'previous user'. If not, it will store one and record your visit as a 'first time visitor'. This cookie will be stored permanently unless you choose to delete it. The information is used by the ATO to help it improve ATO _assist_ by understanding how it is used. There is no attempt made to identify individual users in any way. 

On each use a 'session cookie' is temporarily placed on your computer, which is used to maintain navigation information during your site visit. These session cookies are deleted from your computer at the end of each Internet session.

The Legal Database saves cookies to your hard drive so that they are available next time you use it. These cookies record details of search results and viewed documents to make your navigation easier on subsequent visits to the Legal Database. The ATO does not record this information.

Most Internet browsers are pre-set to accept cookies. If you prefer not to receive cookies, you can adjust your Internet browser to refuse cookies or to warn you when cookies are being used.

Advice about the Internet and personal information can be found on the Privacy Commissioner’s web site, [www.privacy.gov.au](https://web.archive.org/externalsite.asp?url=http://www.privacy.gov.au)

## Security of information

Taxation Acts have secrecy provisions that prohibit any officer of the ATO (or any other government department) from accessing, recording or disclosing anyone's taxation information except in performing their duties or in specific situations permitted by taxation laws. There are severe penalties for breaking these provisions. 

Your personal information will not be released unless the law permits it or your permission is given. We provide a secure environment and a reliable system but you should be aware that there may be inherent risks associated with the transmission of information via the Internet. For those who do not wish to use the Internet, the ATO provides alternative ways of obtaining and providing information. In some circumstances, the ATO security guidelines may also require us to send particular information by non-electronic means.
