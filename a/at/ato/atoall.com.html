        </p><h3 id="information">Information we collect and how we use it</h3>
        <p>We offer a number of services that do not require you to register for 
        an account or provide any personal information to us, such as Atoall 
        Search. In order to provide our full range of services, we may collect 
        the following types of information: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
          <p align="justify"><strong>Information you provide</strong> – When you 
          sign up for a Atoall Account or other Atoall service or promotion that 
          requires registration, we ask you for personal information (such as 
          your name, email address and an account password). For certain 
          services, such as our advertising programs, we also request credit 
          card or other payment account information which we maintain in 
          encrypted form on secure servers. We may combine the information you 
          submit under your account with information from other Atoall services 
          or third parties in order to provide you with a better experience and 
          to improve the quality of our services. For certain services, we may 
          give you the opportunity to opt out of combining such information.
          </p></li>
          <li>
          <p align="justify"><strong>Cookies</strong> – When you visit Atoall, 
          we send one or more cookies – a small file containing a string of 
          characters – to your computer or other device that uniquely identifies 
          your browser. We use cookies to improve the quality of our service, 
          including for storing user preferences, improving search results and 
          ad selection, and tracking user trends, such as how people search. 
          Atoall also uses cookies in its advertising services to help 
          advertisers and publishers serve and manage ads across the web. We may 
          set one or more cookies in your browser when you visit a website, 
          including Atoall sites that use our advertising cookies, and view or 
          click on an ad supported by Atoall’s advertising services. </p></li>
          <li>
          <p align="justify"><strong>Log information</strong> – When you access 
          Atoall services, our servers automatically record information that 
          your browser sends whenever you visit a website. These server logs may 
          include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol 
          address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your 
          request and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your 
          browser. </p></li>
          <li>
          <p align="justify"><strong>User communications</strong> – When you 
          send email or other communications to Atoall, we may retain those 
          communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your 
          requests and improve our services. </p></li>
          <li>
          <p align="justify"><strong>Affiliated Atoall Services on other sites</strong> 
          – We offer some of our services on or through other web sites. 
          Personal information that you provide to those sites may be sent to 
          Atoall in order to deliver the service. We process such information 
          under this Privacy Policy. The affiliated sites through which our 
          services are offered may have different privacy practices and we 
          encourage you to read their privacy policies. </p></li>
          <li>
          <p align="justify"><strong>Gadgets</strong> – Atoall may make 
          available third party applications through its services. The 
          information collected by Atoall when you enable a gadget or other 
          application is processed under this Privacy Policy.&nbsp;Information 
          collected by the application or gadget provider is governed by their 
          privacy policies. </p></li>
          <li>
          <p align="justify"><strong>Location data</strong> – Atoall offers 
          location-enabled services, such as Atoall Maps for mobile. If you use 
          those services, Atoall may receive information about your actual 
          location (such as GPS signals sent by a mobile device) or information 
          that can be used to approximate a location (such as a cell ID). </p></li>
          <li>
          <p align="justify"><strong>Links</strong> – Atoall may present links 
          in a format that enables us to keep track of whether these links have 
          been followed. We use this information to improve the quality of our 
          search technology, customized content and advertising.&nbsp; </p></li>
          <li>
          <p align="justify"><strong>Other sites</strong> – This Privacy Policy 
          applies to Atoall services only. We do not exercise control over the 
          sites displayed as search results, sites that include Atoall 
          applications, products or services, or links from within our various 
          services. These other sites may place their own cookies or other files 
          on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from 
          you. </p></li>
        </ul>
        <p align="justify">Atoall only processes personal information for the 
        purposes described in this Privacy Policy and/or the supplementary 
        privacy notices for specific services. In addition to the above, such 
        purposes include: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Providing our services, including the display of customized 
          content and advertising; </li>
          <li>Auditing, research and analysis in order to maintain, protect and

        <p>You can find more information about how we process personal 
        information by referring to the supplementary privacy notices for 
        particular services. </p>
        <h3 id="infochoices">Choices for personal information</h3>
        <p align="justify">When you sign up for a particular service that 
        requires registration, we ask you to provide personal information. If we 
        use this information in a manner different than the purpose for which it 
        was collected, then we will ask for your consent prior to such use. </p>
        <p align="justify">If we propose to use personal information for any 
        purposes other than those described in this Privacy Policy and/or in the 
        specific service privacy notices, we will offer you an effective way to 
        opt out of the use of personal information for those other purposes. We 
        will not collect or use sensitive information for purposes other than 
        those described in this Privacy Policy and/or in the supplementary

        <h3 id="infosharing">Information sharing</h3>
        <p>Atoall only shares personal information with other companies or 
        individuals outside of Atoall in the following limited circumstances:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
          <p align="justify">We have your consent. We require opt-in consent for 
          the sharing of any sensitive personal information. </p></li>
          <li>
          <p align="justify">We provide such information to our subsidiaries, 
          affiliated companies or other trusted businesses or persons for the 
          purpose of processing personal information on our behalf. We require 
          that these parties agree to process such information based on our 
          instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and any other 
          appropriate confidentiality and security measures. </p></li>
          <li>
          <p align="justify">We have a good faith belief that access, use, 
          preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary 
          to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or 
          enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable Terms of 
          Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) 
          detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical 
          issues, or (d) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety 
          of Atoall, its users or the public as required or permitted by law.
          </p></li>
        </ul>
        <p align="justify">If Atoall becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, 
        or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will ensure the 
        confidentiality of any personal information involved in such 
        transactions and provide notice before personal information is 
        transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. </p>
        <p>We may share with third parties certain pieces of aggregated, 
        non-personal information, such as the number of users who searched for a 
        particular term, for example, or how many users clicked on a particular 
        advertisement. Such information does not identify you individually. </p>
        <p>Please contact us at the address below for any additional questions 
        about the management or use of personal data. </p>
        <h3 id="infosecurity">Information security</h3>
        <p align="justify">We take appropriate security measures to protect 
        against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or 
        destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data 
        collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as 
        well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access 
        to systems where we store personal data. </p>
        <p align="justify">We restrict access to personal information to Atoall 
        employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in 
        order to operate, develop or improve our services. These individuals are 
        bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, 
        including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet 
        these obligations. </p>
        <h3 id="dataintegrity">Data integrity</h3>
        <p align="justify">Atoall processes personal information only for the 
        purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this Privacy 
        Policy or any applicable service-specific privacy notice. We review our 
        data collection, storage and processing practices to ensure that we only 
        collect, store and process the personal information needed to provide or 
        improve our services or as otherwise permitted under this Policy. We 
        take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we process 
        is accurate, complete, and current, but we depend on our users to update 
        or correct their personal information whenever necessary. </p>
        <h3 id="access">Accessing and updating personal information</h3>
        <p align="justify">When you use Atoall services, we make good faith 
        efforts to provide you with access to your personal information and 
        either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data 
        at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or 
        for legitimate business purposes. We ask individual users to identify 
        themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or 
        removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process 
        requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require 
        disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or 
        would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning 
        information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not 
        otherwise required. In any case where we provide information access and 
        correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so 
        would require a disproportionate effort. Some of our services have 
        different procedures to access, correct or delete users’ personal 
        information. We provide the details for these procedures in the specific 
        privacy notices or FAQs for these services. </p>
        <h3 id="enforcement">Enforcement</h3>
        <p align="justify">Atoall regularly reviews its compliance with this

        <p align="justify">Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from 
        time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy 
        without your explicit consent, and we expect most such changes will be 
        minor. Regardless, we will post any Privacy Policy changes on this page 
        and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent 
        notice (including, for certain services, email notification of Privacy 
        Policy changes). Each version of this Privacy Policy will be identified 
        at the top of the page. </p>
