### Atos Binding Corporate Rules

Atos is the first IT company to have obtained approval of its [Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs)](https://atos.net/content/dam/global/documents/atos-binding-corporate-rules.pdf "Binding Corporate Rules") by European data protection authorities both as a data controller and a processor. This approval evidences Atos’ commitment to the protection not only of its own data but also that of its clients: all Atos entities provide a very strong level of protection to personal data, regardless of their location in the world. The BCR are a commitment whereby the companies of the Atos Group undertake to process personal data in accordance with a stringent level of protection to personal data it processes for its own needs (employee data, etc.) but also for the needs of its customers, therefore allowing the free flow of personal data between the companies of the Atos Group.
