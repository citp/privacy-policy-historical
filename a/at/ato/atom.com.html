<span class="grey8bold"><i>How is my personally identifiable information used by AtomShockwave?</i></span>
                  </p>

                  <p>
<span class="grey8bold">Customized experience.</span>  AtomShockwave gathers user information to provide you with a customized experience on our sites.  Your user information helps us tailor the content, services, goods and advertising to your current and future needs.  For this reason, we may ask you to register or to provide personal information when you visit certain areas of AtomShockwave, download free software, enter a contest, order products, or subscribe to a newsletter.  If you choose not to register you may not have access to areas that require personal identification.
                  </p>

                  <p> <span class="grey8bold"> E-mail.</span> If you register
                    with our site or purchase products from us, from time to time,
                    we may e-mail you with informative messages about our services
                    or third party products and services we believe may be of
                    interest to you, such as new features and services, special
                    offers and updated information. The newsletters may contain
                    code that enables our database to track your usage of the
                    newsletters, including whether the email was opened and/or
                    what links (if any) were clicked. We will combine that information
                    to other information we have about you and may use that information
                    to improve your site experience and/or provide customized
                    e-mail communications to you.</p>

When does AtomShockwave collect my information, including personally identifiable information?
</i>
</span>
                  </p>

                  <p>
<span class="grey8bold">
Registration.</span>  When you register, AtomShockwave asks for your e-mail address, a user selected user name, and other information.  Once you are a registered user you can update your profile and may be able to provide additional preferential information (e.g. a member name, a nickname, and certain user preferences).  AtomShockwave may also ask for other optional information. <a href="#kids">(See below on AtomShockwave's policy with respect to children under 13)</a>
                  </p>

                  <p> <span class="grey8bold"> Order Forms and Products Store.</span>
                    AtomShockwave also uses an order form for users to request
					information, products and services. For that order form, we
					collect a user's contact information (e-mail address) and
					necessary financial information to process the order
					(i.e. credit card number). Contact information from the order
					is used to send orders to our registered users and to get in
					touch with the user when deemed necessary. AtomShockwave may
					use third parties to accept and process orders and credit card
					purchases for merchandise and products, including software.
					For some products, Yahoo! hosts the store pages, ordering system,
					and order data. Yahoo! automatically collects order information
					but may only use this information in the aggregate. If you accessed
					the store through Yahoo! Shopping, Yahoo! also automatically
					collects information about your shopping experience. Please see
					the <a href="http://privacy.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! Privacy Policy</a>
					for more information about how Yahoo! uses this information. </p>

                  <p> <span class="grey8bold"> Special Contests or Promotions.</span>
                    AtomShockwave may occasionally present a special contest or
                    promotion that is sponsored by another company. To qualify
                    for entry in that contest or promotion, we may ask you to
                    provide personal information. If we plan to share that information
                    with the sponsor(s) or with others, we will provide a statement
                    to that effect in the contest or promotion terms. </p>

<span class="grey8bold">
IP Address.</span>  An Internet Protocol (IP) address is unique string of numbers that is assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider.  Web servers automatically identify your computer by its IP address.  We will use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our site.  Your IP address also may be used to gather broad demographic information.

<span class="grey8bold">
Cookies.</span>  A "cookie" is a small line of text that is stored with your Web browser for record-keeping purposes and to help us provide better service to you. Your browser has options to accept, reject, or provide you with notice when a cookie is sent.  We use cookies to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our site.

                  <p> <span class="grey8bold"> DoubleClick Banner Advertisements.</span>
                    We use an outside ad company, DoubleClick, to serve ads on
                    our site. In the process of serving ads, DoubleClick places
                    a DoubleClick cookie in your browser's cookie file and may
                    use information (excluding your name, address, email address
                    or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web
                    sites in order to provide advertisements on this site and
                    other Web sites about goods and services that may be of interest
                    to you. By delivering ads on the AtomShockwave Sites, DoubleClick
                    is able to record what ads a user -- identified by the unique
                    cookie -- has seen, and what AtomShockwave site pages the
                    user was viewing when the ads were delivered. This Web usage
                    information is combined with other ad delivery information
                    DoubleClick has (e.g., what type of operating system your
                    computer uses) collected from your visits to AtomShockwave
                    Sites and other sites not affiliated with AtomShockwave. This
                    non-personally identifiable information is used as part of
                    the ad serving process for reporting and to select and direct
                    the ads you see online at AtomShockwave Sites and other sites
                    not affiliated with AtomShockwave. Unlike the cookies AtomShockwave
                    uses in other parts of our site, cookies received with banner
                    ads are collected by DoubleClick and we do not have access
                    to this information. Additionally, some ads served by DoubleClick
                    are generated by third party ad serving systems that also
                    may place a cookie on your browser to provide web usage information
                    to those third parties. To find out more about those specific
                    third party ad serving systems, please click to their sites

Who does AtomShockwave share information with?

                  <p> We will not share your personally identifiable information
                    with third parties (aside from entities that perform services
                    for us, such as fulfilling orders, that either are bound to
                    comply with our privacy policy or have privacy policies that
                    protect your information) unless you have "opted-in" to such
                    sharing. If you have previously opted-in to such sharing under
                    a prior privacy policy version, you are still considered to
                    have opted-in under this Privacy Statement. As stated, AtomShockwave
                    may use third parties to accept and process orders for merchandise
                    and products, including software. In particular, Yahoo! hosts
                    the store pages, ordering system, and order data. Yahoo! automatically
                    collects order information but may only use this information
                    in the aggregate. If you accessed the store through Yahoo!
                    Shopping, Yahoo! also automatically collects information about
                    your shopping experience. Please see the <a href="http://privacy.yahoo.com/">Yahoo!
                    Privacy Policy</a> for more information about how Yahoo! uses
                    this information. </p>

                  <p>
However, AtomShockwave may disclose information you provide if required to do so by law or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is necessary to (1) comply with the law or with legal process served on AtomShockwave; (2) protect and defend the rights or property of AtomShockwave; or (3) act in an emergency to protect someone's safety.
                  </p>

                  <p>
We may gather demographic information from you (for example, your age, education level or household income) from time to time.  We will not share that information in a manner that identifies you as an individual with any other entity, unless we let you know that at the time of collection or we have your permission. When we share demographic information with third parties, we will give them aggregate information only.
                  </p>

                  <p>
As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets, and, depending upon the transaction, your personal information may be one of the transferred assets.  In the event that AtomShockwave is acquired by another company, your personal information may be part of the assets transferred to the acquiring party.

The AtomShockwave Sites are general audience sites and are not directed to children under the age of 13.  AtomShockwave assumes products purchased through credit card means are purchased by adults.  AtomShockwave respects the privacy of parents and children and is committed to complying with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).  On those areas of the Sites that ask for age, AtomShockwave does not collect personal information from individuals who identify themselves as under the age of 13 except in those limited circumstances where AtomShockwave believes that such collection is permitted under COPPA.

                  <p>
AtomShockwave may ask prospective users to provide their age during the registration process and on other areas of the AtomShockwave Sites.  If a user indicates that he or she is under the age of 13 then all personal data collected during the registration process is automatically deleted except AtomShockwave may retain and use limited information, such as the child's email address, for a limited period of time, in those cases where AtomShockwave believes that the collection and use of such information is permitted under COPPA.
                  </p>

                  <p>
If a parent believes that his or her child has submitted personal information to AtomShockwave, he or she can contact us via e-mail or postal mail as listed below.  AtomShockwave will promptly delete the information upon learning that it relates to a child under the age of 13.
                  </p>

                  <p>
AtomShockwave believes that parents should supervise their children's online activities and consider using parental control tools available from online services and software manufacturers that help provide a kid-friendly online environment.  These tools can also prevent children from otherwise disclosing online their name, address and other personal information without parental permission.
