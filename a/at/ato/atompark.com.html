<h3>Browsing</h3>
<p>This Website does not collect personally identifiable information
from your computer when you browse the Website and request pages from

provide us with personally identifiable information, we will not know

information. When you request a page from our Website, our servers log
the information provided in the HTTP request header, JavaScript or
similar technical tools, including the IP number, the time of the
request, the URL of your request and other information. We collect such
information in order to make our Website function correctly and provide
you the functionality that you see on this Website, as our servers use
this information to deliver to you the pages on this Website. We also
use this information to better understand how visitors use our Website
and how we can better tune our Website, its contents and functionality

<p>The Website does not process any personally identifiable data and
does not combine the processing data with any personal information. If
you do not wish the information collected as stated above, by the
Website, to be processed by us, you should notify your request by
sending an e-mail to: medik@atompark.com</p>

<p>As a visitor to this Website, you can engage in many activities
without providing any personal information as described above in Section

withhold requested information, we may not be able to provide you with
some of the services dependent upon the collection of this information.
Depending upon the activity, some of the information that we ask you to
provide is identified as mandatory and some as voluntary. If you do not
provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular activity or

purchase.<br>
AtomPark Software Inc. is the sole owner of the information it gathers
on its site. AtomPark Software Inc. will only share your information

<p>When you use the Website, AtomPark Software Inc. or third parties
authorised by AtomPark Software Inc. may also collect certain technical
and routing information about your computer to facilitate your use of
the Website and its services. When you surf the Internet, your Internet
browser (such as Microsoft Internet Explorer® or other browsers)

time you access content on one of our sites. Examples of such
information include the URL of the Web page you were just on (known as

computer you are using, or the browser version you are using to access
our Website. All of this information may be collected by AtomPark
Software Inc. and used to analyse the activity on the Website and help
improve our offerings to you.</p>
<p>We use such data to facilitate and track your use of the Website and
its services. AtomPark Software Inc. also uses such environmental
variables to measure traffic patterns on the Website. <br>

Software Inc. services and products. In order to use those services, you
may be required to provide personal information to the providers. Unless
expressly provided to the contrary, personal information that you
provide while you are visiting a provider's web site will be subject to
the privacy policy posted on such site, and personal information that
you provide while on this Website in conjunction with a provider's
service will be subject to this Privacy Policy. You should be aware that
our agreements with these service providers often provide that they will
share with AtomPark Software Inc. personal information collected from
you. In such instances, AtomPark Software Inc. may use this information

<p>AtomPark Software Inc. operates secure data networks protected by

<p>AtomPark Software Inc. takes steps to ensure that your information is
treated securely and in accordance with our terms of service, end User
License Agreement and this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>No data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed secure. As a
result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot
guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us or from our
online products or services, and you use these services at your own
risk. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone.
AtomPark Software Inc. will never ask you for your password in an
unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited email. You the consumer are
ultimately responsible for the security of your login name and password.</p>
<p>We treat the information you provide to us as confidential
information. It is, accordingly, subject to our company's security
procedures and corporate policies regarding protection and use of
confidential information. After personally identifiable information
reaches AtomPark Software Inc. it is stored on a server with physical
and electronic security features as customary in the industry, including
utilisation of login/password procedures and electronic firewalls
designed to block unauthorised access from outside of AtomPark Software
Inc.</p>
<p>All AtomPark Software Inc. employees are aware of our privacy and
security policies. Your information is only accessible to those
employees who need it in order to perform their jobs.</p>
<p>Because laws applicable to personal information vary by country, our
offices or other business operations may put in place additional
measures that vary depending on the applicable legal requirements.
Information collected on the sites covered by this Privacy Policy is
processed and stored in the United States and the European Union and
also in other countries where AtomPark Software Inc. and its service
providers conduct business.</p>

<div style="width:100%" class="rounded-box-title rounded-body">PART C. USE AND DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION</div>	
<h3>How Your Personal Information Is Used</h3>
<p>AtomPark Software Inc. collects your information in order to record

responsible use of information collected on this Website. Without your
consent, AtomPark Software Inc. will not communicate any information to
you regarding products, services, and special offers available from
AtomPark Software Inc. or its affiliates, although we may find it
necessary to communicate with you regarding your use of the services on
this Website or the products you have purchased from AtomPark Software
Inc.</p>
<p>Except in the particular circumstances described in this Privacy
Policy, AtomPark Software Inc. will also not provide your name to other
companies or organizations without your consent.</p>
<h3>Public Announcements</h3>
<p>With you prior consent, AtomPark Software Inc. may identify you to
the public as its customer and describe in a customer case study the
services and solutions delivered by AtomPark Software Inc. to you.
AtomPark Software Inc. may also issue one or more press releases,
containing an announcement relating to of the execution and delivery of
the agreements between you and AtomPark Software Inc. and/or the
implementation of the product by you. Nothing contained in this section
shall be construed as an obligation by you to disclose any of your
proprietary or confidential information to any third party. In addition,
you may opt-out from this Section by writing an opt-out request to
AtomPark Software Inc. at: medik@atompark.com</p>
<h3>Disclosure of Information to Third Parties</h3>
<p>AtomPark Software Inc. does use the services of third parties, such
as e-mail service providers, purchase and order processing merchants and
marketing companies that act as independent contractors on behalf of
AtomPark Software Inc. These parties are contractually prohibited from
using personally identifiable information for any purpose other than for
the purpose AtomPark Software Inc. specifies. We do provide
non-personally identifiable information to certain service providers for
their use on an aggregated basis for the purpose of performing their
contractual obligations to us. We prohibit the sale or transfer of
personal information to entities outside of the AtomPark Software Inc.'s
affiliates for their use without your approval.</p>
<p>AtomPark Software Inc. may disclose your personally identifiable
information if we believe in good faith that we are required to do so in
order to comply with applicable law, a subpoena, or other legal process.
AtomPark Software Inc. may also disclose personally identifiable
information when we have reason to believe that disclosing this
information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action
against someone who may be violating our Privacy Policy or End User
License Agreement or to protect the safety of our users and the public
or under confidentiality agreements with certain third parties which
assist us in developing, operating and maintaining AtomPark Software
Inc.'s products.</p>
<p>In the event that all or substantially all of AtomPark Software
Inc.'s stock and/or assets are transferred or sold to another entity,
AtomPark Software Inc. may transfer personally identifiable information
to the acquiring entity. If, as a result of such a business transition,
your personally identifiable information will be used in a materially
different manner, you will be given choice consistent with our policy
regarding notification of changes.</p>
<h3>Choices Available to You</h3>
<p>You can always choose whether or not to disclose personally
identifiable information and that choice will not prevent you from using
the AtomPark Software Inc. Website. Please note, however, if you should
choose to withhold requested information, we may not be able to provide
you with some of the services dependent upon the collection of this
information.<br>
You can choose at anytime to opt out of receiving emails from AtomPark
Software Inc. or from having your personally identifiable information
shared with selected companies. If you want to opt out, you can do so by
editing your preferences with respect to email or the sharing of
information. If you elect to "opt out" we will not, as
applicable, share your personal information with third parties or send
you emails. However, we may continue to use your personal information
for internal purposes, to enhance your user experience or as necessary
to administer the Website or comply with applicable law.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to send a one-time registration confirmation
email, and infrequent service alert messages to users to inform them of
specific changes that may impact their ability to use a service they
have previously signed up for, regardless of email contact opt-in
status. We also reserve the right to contact you if compelled to do so
as part of a legal proceeding or if there has been a violation of our
End User License Agreement.</p>
<p>AtomPark Software Inc. is retaining these rights because in limited
cases we feel that we may need the right to contact you as a matter of
law or regarding matters which will be important to you. These rights do
not allow us to contact you to market a new or existing service if you
have asked us not to do so, and issuance of these types of
communications are rare.</p>
