    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    
    <div><p>

</p><p>Atkins Nutritionals, Inc. ("Atkins
Nutritionals") has created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our
commitment to our visitors' and customers' privacy. Our site is a safe
environment for anyone who visits and purchases products or uses our services.
As a seller of products and provider of services over the Internet, we are
committed to providing you the best possible online service and experience as
well as the best products and information. As our Web site evolves, our Privacy
Policy will also undergo changes. We reserve the right, at our discretion, to
make changes to this policy at any time. We encourage you to check our Privacy
Policy periodically or when you notice new features on our site. By using this
site, you signify your agreement to the Atkins Nutritionals Privacy Policy and
consent to the collection and use of your information by Atkins Nutritionals as
described below: </p>



<p><b>Information We Collect And How We Use It:</b><br></p><ul><li>Information You Give Us: When you purchase a product from Atkins
Nutritionals you provide such personal information as: (i) first and last name;
(ii) billing address; (iii) shipping address; (iv) e-mail address; (v) phone
numbers; and (vi) credit card account number. We collect all or some of this
information on the pages where you create your personal account, and at other
locations. This allows us to process and fulfill your order, to notify you of
the status of your order and to provide you with the best possible customer
service. When you request a copy of our Catalog, we need to know your mailing
address. We use this information in part to send you the material you
requested. When you enter a contest or other promotional feature, we may ask
for such things as your name, address and email address so that we can
administer the contest. When you submit a review, testimonial, inquiry, comment
or survey response with regard to such things as Atkins Nutritionals products,
services or the Atkins Nutritional Approach™, or when you register to use areas
such as My Atkins, we request your name, address and email address. We also may
ask you for information related to your health and physical condition. This
information will be used to provide you with articles and other materials that
may be of interest you, and which you may find useful. We do not provide you
with medical advice, and nothing stated or presented on our site is intended to
be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. We
may use the information we collect to tailor your experience at our site. We
may also monitor customer traffic patterns and site usage to help us develop
and improve the design and layout of the site. </li></ul>

<p>We may also use the information for such
things as notifying you about Atkins Nutritionals products and services,
changes to the Web site, promotional updates and special offers. We
occasionally make our customer list available to carefully screened companies
whose products and services you may find of interest. </p>

<ul><li>&nbsp;Automatic Information: We receive and store certain types of
information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many Web sites, we
use "cookies" (see below) and we obtain certain types of information
when your Web browser accesses our site. A number of companies offer utilities
designed to help you visit Web sites anonymously. Although we will not be able
to provide you with a personalized experience at our site if we cannot
recognize you, we want you to be aware that these tools exist. </li></ul>

<p><b>Cookies:</b><br>
"Cookies" are pieces of information that may be placed on your
computer by a Web site for the purpose of facilitating and enhancing your
communications and interaction with that Web site. We may use cookies for such
things as (i) to customize your visitation and shopping experience, (ii) to
deliver content consistent with your stated interests, (iii) to provide you
with custom-tailored content, and (iv) to save your password (if you have
registered with us). The use of cookies is an industry standard - you will find
them at most major Web sites. </p>

<p>A cookie lets the computer remember that you
have registered, which allows us to speed up your activities at our site,
particularly purchases. Letting it do the record-keeping saves you the trouble
of entering information over and over again during a single visit. By showing
us how and when shoppers use the site, cookies also help us see which areas are
popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates to the site are based
on data such as total number of visitors and pages viewed. Atkins Nutritionals
relies on cookies and cookie technology as stated above and otherwise to
retrieve information from your computer for purposes that are related to the
Atkins Nutritionals site. Atkins Nutritionals never uses cookies to retrieve
information from your computer that was not originally sent or stored in a
cookie. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you would prefer,
the Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how you can set
yours to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. However,
it is possible that some parts of the site, such as shopping in the online
store, will not function properly if you do so. </p>

<p><b>Internet Protocol (IP) Address: </b><br>
Atkins Nutritionals uses your IP address to help diagnose problems with our
server, and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is used to help
identify you and to gather broad demographic information. When visitors request
pages from the Atkins Nutritionals Web site, our servers log the visitors' IP
addresses. We do not link IP addresses to personally identifiable information.
This means that a visitor's session will be logged, but the user will remain
anonymous to us. </p>

<p><b>Security: </b><br>
Atkins Nutritionals uses Secured Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to ensure the
privacy of your personal information. When you make an online purchase, our
advanced security technology encrypts or scrambles your personal data
(including your name, delivery and e-mail addresses and credit card number)
before it is sent to us, making it virtually impossible for anyone other than
Atkins Nutritionals to read it. To further protect your information, we utilize
state of the art back-end systems and restrict employee access to your
information. Unless specifically authorized by you, no outside party is able to
access or receive any of your personal customer information. </p>

<p>To make sure you are accessing our secure
server before you submit personal financial information, look at the lower left
corner of your browser. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending
upon your browser), the SSL is active. To double-check for security, look at
the location line or your browser. If you have accessed a secure server, the
first characters of the address in that line should change from
"http" to "https." Some browser versions and some firewalls
do not permit communication through a secure server like the ones we use at
Atkins Nutritionals. If for any reason you cannot access the secure server,
please feel free to place your order with us by phone at 1-800-2-ATKINS. It is
important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and
to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer.
Atkins Nutritionals wants you to feel completely comfortable. If you have more
questions about our security systems, or feel more comfortable ordering by
phone, please call 1-800-2-ATKINS and we will be happy to help you. </p>

<p><b>Disclosure of Information to Outside Parties:</b><br>
Except as noted below in this section, Atkins Nutritionals will in no case
share with or sell your personal information to advertisers, sponsors, partners
or other third parties. Under no circumstances will Atkins Nutritionals collect
or distribute your personal information in any form, or use your information
for our own marketing or promotional purposes, without your knowledge and
consent. </p>

<ul><li>Agents: We sometimes employ other companies and individuals to
perform functions on our behalf. Examples include sending Atkins e-mail updates
and newsletters, fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail
and email, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit
card payments, and providing customer service. They have access to personal
information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other
purposes. </li></ul>

<ul><li>Mailing List: We occasionally make our customer list available
to carefully screened companies whose products and services you may find of
interest. </li></ul>

<ul><li>Business Transfers: As we continue to develop our business, we
might sell or buy stores, subsidiaries, or business units. In such transactions,
customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but
remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing privacy policy
(unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). In the event that Atkins
Nutritionals or substantially of its assets are acquired, customer information
will of course be one of the transferred assets. </li></ul>

<ul><li>Statistical Information: Atkins Nutritionals may provide
aggregate statistics about customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related site
information to third parties. </li></ul>

<ul><li>Protection of Atkins Nutritionals and Others: Atkins
Nutritionals may release personal information when you consent to the release
of such information, or when we believe that such disclosure is reasonably
necessary to (i) comply with the law, a subpoena, Court order or legal process,
(ii) enforce or apply the provisions of the Terms of Use or other Agreement
with Atkins Nutritionals; or (iii) protect the rights, property or safety of
Atkins Nutritionals, our users or others. </li></ul>

<p><b>Links to/from Other Sites:</b><br>
Our site may contain links to other Web sites that are operated by third
parties. Other sites may also reference or link to our site. Atkins
Nutritionals is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of
those other sites. </p>

<p><b>Children's Privacy:</b><br>
We are committed to protecting the privacy of children. You should be aware
that this site is not intended or designed to attract children under the age of
13. Consistent with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, we
will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone
under the age of 13 without prior verifiable parental consent. </p>

<p><b>Legal Enforcement:</b><br>
Atkins Nutritionals fully cooperates with law enforcement agencies in
identifying those who use our services for illegal activities. We reserve the
rights to release information about individuals who we believe are in violation
of our content guidelines, and to report to law enforcement agencies any
activities that we reasonably believe to be unlawful. </p>

<p><b>What Choices Do You Have?</b></p>

<ul><li>As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide
information, even though it might be needed to make a purchase or to take
advantage of certain areas of the Atkins Nutritionals Web site. </li></ul>

<ul><li>&nbsp;The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you
how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser
notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether.
However, some areas of the site, such as shopping in the online store, will not
function properly if you do so. </li></ul>

<ul><li>·Some companies offer utilities designed to help you visit Web
sites anonymously. Although we will not be able to provide you with a
personalized experience at our site if we cannot recognize you, we want you to
be aware that these tools exist. </li></ul>

<ul><li>·You can check, correct, update, or delete your personal
information online, or by contacting us by telephone at 1-800-2-ATKINS, by
email, or by mail at Atkins Nutritionals, Inc., Re: Online Privacy, 100 Park
Avenue, 2nd Floor, New York, NY 10017. If you wish to change your email
address, which is also your username, such request must be made by telephone or
