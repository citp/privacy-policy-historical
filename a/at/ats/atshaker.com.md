  * **Non-personal Information is collected in order to:**
    * Enhance the User’s experience on Shaker (e.g. by determining the screen resolutions).
    * Learn about the preferences of Users and general trends on Shaker (e.g. understand which features are more popular than others).
  * **Personal Information is collected in order to:**
    * Enable the overall operation of Shaker.
    * Personalize your experience on Shaker.
    * Enhance other Shaker users’ experiences on Shaker (as specified on Section 5).

registered Users.
    * Allow us to contact you with proposals and tailored information regarding events, offers, services, etc.
    * Identify you when conducting customer service operations (such as providing feedback, etc.).



**5\. Sharing personal information with Users**

Shaker allows you to share your Facebook profile information with other Users on Shaker. Please note that certain information which you have defined as private on Facebook (e.g. information which is visible to Facebook friends only) may become public through Shaker (i.e. enabling Shaker Users to view such information).

Shaker provides three privacy modes for you to choose: A friendly mode, normal mode and a shy mode. When first entering Shaker, you will be asked to choose your level of sharing and privacy mode. However, you can alter your privacy mode as you please at any time, during your use of Shaker.

Setting your privacy to friendly mode, shall mean that other Users which are logged on to Shaker with you, will be able to view all the information about you specified on Section 2 above, even if they cannot view such information on Facebook, including your basic Facebook profile information, your picture, your tagged pictures and your albums. For example, say “A” is a Facebook user that cannot normally see your tagged pictures on your Facebook account, and your Shaker Privacy mode is set to friendly mode. When both “A” and yourself are present on Shaker, “A” will be able to see your tagged pictures (“A” will be able to view these pictures only from Shaker and won’t be able to see them on Facebook).

Setting your privacy to shy mode, any other User logged to Shaker with you, will be able to view only the information about you they can already view on Facebook, which include your basic Facebook profile information and your picture.

Setting your privacy to normal mode, will enable any other User logged to Shaker with you to view your basic profile information, your picture and your tagged pictures as well.

To change your privacy mode while using Shaker, look for the “Privacy” button on the top bar of the application.

Clicking the privacy mode button will present you with a pop-up asking you whether you want to change the level of sharing on Shaker to shay, normal or friendly mode. Clicking on the selected mode, your privacy mode will change accordingly.
