		<h2>Shaker’s Privacy Policy</h2>
<h3>Last Revised: June 5, 2012</h3>
<p>Scene53 Inc. and its affiliates (“<strong>Company</strong>” or “<strong>we</strong>“) respect the privacy of Shaker’s users (“<strong>User</strong>” or “<strong>you</strong>“) and are committed to protect the User’s information. We believe that you have a right to know our practices regarding the information we may collect and use when you visit the Shaker application on Facebook at the address <a style="color: #0cf;" title="Shaker Website" href="http://apps.facebook.com/shakerapp" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://apps.facebook.com']);" target="_blank">http://apps.facebook.com/shakerapp</a> (hereinafter, “<strong>Shaker</strong>“).</p>

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><strong>2.2</strong> Personal Information. The other type of information is individually identifiable information (“<strong>Personal Information</strong>“). To put it simply, this information may identify an individual or is of a private and/or sensitive nature.

Please note that such logs shall not be put to any commercial use by us or disclosed to any third-party, except for limited disclosure for security purposes (see Section 4(a)-(f) below).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>3. How do we collect information on our Users? </strong></span></p>
<p>There are two main methods we use:</p>
<ul style="font-size: 13px; list-style: lower-latin; padding-left: 15px; line-height: 15px;">
<li><strong>We collect information while you access or use Shaker.</strong> In other words, when you access or use the Shaker application we are aware of your usage of Shaker, and may gather, collect and record the information relating to such usage. For example, when you connect to Shaker, your computer tells us your IP address. We may further log the content you generate during your use of Shaker, such as status lines on Facebook, chat and/or conversation logs.</li>
<li><strong>We collect information which you voluntarily permitted Facebook to provide us.</strong> For example, when you wish to connect to Shaker for the first time, we will ask you to allow Facebook to provide us certain information (as described above).</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>4. What are the purposes of the collection of information?</strong></span></p>
<ul style="font-size: 13px; list-style: lower-latin; padding-left: 15px; line-height: 15px;">
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Non-personal Information is collected in order to:</span></strong>
<ul style="font-size: 13px; list-style: circle; padding-left: 15px; line-height: 15px;">
<li>Enhance the User’s experience on Shaker (e.g. by determining the screen resolutions).</li>
<li>Learn about the preferences of Users and general trends on Shaker (e.g. understand which features are more popular than others).</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Personal Information is collected in order to:</span></strong>
<ul style="font-size: 13px; list-style: circle; padding-left: 15px; line-height: 15px;">
<li>Enable the overall operation of Shaker.</li>
<li>Personalize your experience on Shaker.</li>
<li>Enhance other Shaker users’ experiences on Shaker (as specified on Section 5).</li>
<li>Provide you with certain information and services available only to<br>
registered Users.</li>
<li>Allow us to contact you with proposals and tailored information regarding events, offers, services, etc.</li>
<li>Identify you when conducting customer service operations (such as providing feedback, etc.).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>5. Sharing personal information with Users</strong></span></p>
<p>Shaker allows you to share your Facebook profile information with other Users on Shaker. Please note that certain information which you have defined as private on Facebook (e.g. information which is visible to Facebook friends only) may become public through Shaker (i.e. enabling Shaker Users to view such information).</p>
<p>Shaker provides three privacy modes for you to choose: A friendly mode, normal mode and a shy mode. When first entering Shaker, you will be asked to choose your level of sharing and privacy mode. However, you can alter your privacy mode as you please at any time, during your use of Shaker.</p>
<p>Setting your privacy to friendly mode, shall mean that other Users which are logged on to Shaker with you, will be able to view all the information about you specified on Section 2 above, even if they cannot view such information on Facebook, including your basic Facebook profile information, your picture, your tagged pictures and your albums. For example, say “A” is a Facebook user that cannot normally see your tagged pictures on your Facebook account, and your Shaker Privacy mode is set to friendly mode. When both “A” and yourself are present on Shaker, “A” will be able to see your tagged pictures (“A” will be able to view these pictures only from Shaker and won’t be able to see them on Facebook).</p>
<p>Setting your privacy to shy mode, any other User logged to Shaker with you, will be able to view only the information about you they can already view on Facebook, which include your basic Facebook profile information and your picture.</p>
<p>Setting your privacy to normal mode, will enable any other User logged to Shaker with you to view your basic profile information, your picture and your tagged pictures as well.</p>
<p>To change your privacy mode while using Shaker, look for the “Privacy” button on the top bar of the application.</p>
<p>Clicking the privacy mode button will present you with a pop-up asking you whether you want to change the level of sharing on Shaker to shay, normal or friendly mode. Clicking on the selected mode, your privacy mode will change accordingly.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>6. Sharing Personal Information with third parties (other than Users)</strong></span></p>
<p>We will share Personal Information only in the following cases: (a) to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process, subpoena or governmental request; (b) to enforce these Privacy Policy or the Terms of Service <a style="color: #0cf;" title="Terms of Service" href="https://www.atshaker.com/terms-of-service/" target="_blank">http://www.atshaker.com/terms-of-service/</a>, including investigation of potential violations thereof; (c) to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; (d) to respond to claims that any content published on Shaker violates any right of a third-party; (e) to respond to claims that unauthorized information (e.g. phone number, name, etc.) of a third-party has been posted on Shaker; (f) to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of the Company, its Users or the general public; (g) when Company is undergoing any change in control, including by means of merger, acquisition or purchase of all or substantially all of the assets of Company; (h) pursuant to your approval, in order to supply certain services you have requested from Company; or (i) to let our partners and affiliates serve you with their content and commercials.<br>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>8. Cookies &amp; Local Storage</strong></span><br>
When you visit Shaker, Company may use industry-wide technologies such as “cookies” and Flash (or similar technologies), which stores certain information on your computer (“<strong>Local Storage</strong>“) and which will allow us to enable automatic activation of certain features, and make your Shaker experience much more convenient and effortless.

It is easy to prohibit the Local Storage. Most browsers will allow you to erase cookies from your computer’s hard drive, block acceptance of cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. In order to erase or disable the Local Storage option in Flash you should use the settings option of Flash according to the specific instructions provided by the technology provider. However, if you block or erase cookies, or change the settings of Flash, your online experience may be limited.</p>
<p>We also use certain third-party cookies. These are a different kind of cookies, stored on your computer by third parties, rather than by the Company. This kind of cookie is only read (and not altered by Shaker) each time you visit Shaker, and also when you visit certain websites or applications that uses similar cookies. Third-party cookies usually store only a Non-personal Information, such as the web pages you have visited, the duration of your browsing, etc.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>9. Security </strong></span><br>
We take a great care in maintaining the security of Shaker and your information and in preventing unauthorized access to it through industry standard technologies and internal procedures. However, we do not guarantee that unauthorized access will never occur.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>10. Third Party Websites</strong></span><br>

Please be advised that such third party websites are independent from Shaker, and we assume no responsibility or liability whatsoever with regard to privacy matters or any other legal matter with respect to such third party websites. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policies and the terms of use or service of such websites.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>11. Changes to the Privacy Policy </strong></span><br>

Company reserves the right to change this policy at any time, so please re-visit this page frequently. In case of any material change, we will make reasonable efforts to post a clear notice on Shaker.<br>
<strong><br>
Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective as of the stated “Last Revised” and your continued use of Shaker on or the Last Revised date will constitute acceptance of, and agreement to be bound by, those changes.</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>12. Got any Questions? </strong></span><br>
