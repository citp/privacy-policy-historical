We use that combined information to enhance and personalize the shopping experience of you and others with us, and to recognize our customers so that we can communicate with you directly about our products and events that may be of interest to you, and for other promotional purposes.

We may share your information for our business purposes and as legally required or permitted, including:

We might also share information with the vendors and manufacturers of our products and services to respond to your reviews and questions.

_To offer financial products_.  We may use service providers or other third parties to offer financial products, such as the At Home credit card.  We may share personal information about our consumers with these entities in order to provide you with tailored information about products and services and special offers. These entities also have their own privacy statements that set out the manner in which they will collect, use and disclose personal information. We encourage you to review each entity's privacy statement at the time you submit your application for such financial products.

_To provide extended warranty services_.  If you purchase a warranty service you will be required to provide information such as your name and address to our warranty service providers. While these service providers are limited by contract in the way they may use your information to provide warranty services, we encourage you to review each service provider's privacy statement at the time you submit your personal information for such services.

_With any successor to all or part of our business_.  For example, if all or part of our business is sold we may sell or disclose our customer list in preparation for or as part of that transaction.

_California and Utah Privacy Rights_. We may from time to time elect to share your personal information, demographic information and usage information with select partners for direct marketing purposes. California and Utah residents are entitled to ask us for a notice describing what categories of personal information we share with select partners for direct marketing purposes. If you are a California or Utah resident and want a copy of this notice, please submit a written request to the following address (limit one request per year): At Home, Attn: Customer Service – Privacy Rights Notice, 1600 East Plano Parkway, Plano, Texas 75074.

_Connecticut Privacy Rights_. Connecticut law requires any entity that collects Social Security numbers from Connecticut residents in the course of business to create a privacy protection policy and to publish or display it publicly. It is our policy to protect the confidentiality of Social Security numbers in our possession from misuse and improper disclosure by maintaining and enforcing policies and physical and electronic safeguards against misuse and improper disclosure. Unlawful disclosure of Social Security numbers is prohibited, and access to them is limited to personnel who need access to such information in order to perform their job functions.

_Controlling Our Tracking Tools:   _You may be able to control the sharing of your device’s location information in the settings menu of your device.  Your browser may give you the ability to control cookies.  How you do so depends on the type of cookie. Certain browsers can be set to reject browser cookies, though flash cookies cannot be controlled through your browser settings.  Your mobile device may not give you the ability to control cookies.  If you wish to block cookies on our mobile applications, you will need to delete the application from your mobile device. If you configure your computer to block cookies, you will limit the functionality we can provide when you visit the Site.  If you configure to block or delete cookies, not all of the tracking that we have described in this policy will stop.

_Browser "Do Not Track" signals_ :  Some browsers have a "Do Not Track" feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked.  These browser features are not uniform, so we are not currently set up to respond to those signals.

**Our Sites and Children**

Our websites and mobile applications are not created for children.  To our knowledge we do not collect information online from children.  If we become aware that we have inadvertently received personal information from a visitor under the age of thirteen on our Sites, we will delete the information from our records. If you are a parent or guardian and think we have information about your child, please contact us immediately as indicated below.

**Security   **

We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect against unauthorized disclosure, use, alteration or destruction of the personal information you provide on our Sites. We use secure socket layer (SSL) technology to help keep the personal information you provide on our Sites secure. When we collect or transmit sensitive information such as a credit card number, we use at least industry standard methods to protect that information. We also request that our third-party service providers use commercially reasonable security measures to protect your information from unauthorized access or use. However, no method of electronically transmitting or storing data is ever completely secure, and therefore, we cannot guarantee that your information will never be accessed, used, or disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy.

**Links**

Some parts of the Site contain links to third party websites. If you click on one of those links, you will be taken to websites we do not control.  This Privacy Policy does not apply to the information practices of those websites. You should read the privacy policies of other websites carefully.  We are not responsible for third party websites.
