					<h5>This policy is effective as of November 1, 2006.</h5>
					<p>
                        We built Athlinks to make it easy to share information with your friends and
					    fellow athletes. We understand you may not want everyone in the world to have
					    the information you share on Athlinks; that is why we give you control of your
					    information. Our default privacy settings limit the information displayed in
					    your profile to your networks and other reasonable community limitations that
					    we tell you about. 
                    </p>

					<h3>Athlinks follows two core principles:</h3>

					<p>
                        <strong>1. You should have control over your personal information.</strong>
                        <br>
					    Athlinks helps you share information with your friends and fellow endurance
					    athletes. You choose what information you put in your profile, including
					    contact and personal information, pictures, interests and groups you join. And
					    you control with whom you share that information through the privacy settings
					    on the each bit of content uploaded to the site. 
                    </p>

					<p>
                        <strong>2. You should have access to the information others want to share.</strong>
				        <br>
				        There is an increasing amount of information available on the Internet, and you
				        may want to know what relates to you, your friends, and people around you. We
				        want to help you easily get that information. 
                    </p>

					<p>
                        Sharing information should be easy. And we want to provide you with the
					    privacy tools necessary to control how and with whom you share that
					    information. If you have questions or ideas, please <a href="/contact.aspx?topic=privacy">contact us</a>.
                    </p>

					<h3>Athlinks's Privacy Policy</h3>

					<p>
                        Athlinks's Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand how we collect
					    and use the personal information you decide to share, and help you make
					    informed decisions when using Athlinks located at www.athlinks.com ("Athlinks"
					    or "Web Site"). 
                    </p>

					<p>
                        By using or accessing Athlinks, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy. 
                    </p>

					<h3>The Information We Collect</h3>

					<p>
                        When you visit Athlinks you provide us with two types of information:
					    personal information you knowingly choose to disclose that is collected by us
					    and Web Site use information collected by us as you interact with our Web Site.
					</p>

					<p>
                        When you register with Athlinks, you provide us with certain personal
					    information, such as your name, your email address, your gender, date of birth,
					    and city/state/province/country of residence. We use this information to gather
					    your results data and automatically merge it with your member profile based these
					    criteria.
                    </p>

					<p>
                        When you enter Athlinks, we collect your browser type and IP address. This
					    information is gathered for all Athlinks visitors. In addition, we store
					    certain information from your browser using "cookies." A cookie is a
					    piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user.
					    We use session ID cookies to confirm that users are logged in. These cookies
					    terminate once the user closes the browser. By default, we use a persistent
					    cookie that stores your login ID (but not your password) to make it easier for
					    you to login when you come back to Athlinks. You can remove or block this
					    cookie using the settings in your browser if you want to disable this
					    convenience feature. 
                    </p>

					<p>
                        When you use Athlinks, you may form relationships, send messages, perform
					    searches and queries, form groups, set up events, and transmit information
					    through various channels. We collect this information so that we can provide
					    you the service and offer personalized features. In most cases, we retain it so
					    that, for instance, you can return to view prior messages you have sent or
					    easily see your friend list. 
                    </p>

					<p>
                        You post User Content (as defined in the Athlinks <a href="http://www.athlinks.com/helpTermsOfUse.aspx">Terms of Use</a>) on the Site at
					    your own risk. Although we allow you to set privacy options that limit access
					    to your pages, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or
					    impenetrable. We cannot control the actions of other Users with whom you may
					    choose to share your pages and information. Therefore, we cannot and do not
					    guarantee that User Content you post on the Site will not be viewed by
					    unauthorized persons. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy
					    settings or security measures contained on the Site. You understand and
					    acknowledge that, even after removal, copies of User Content may remain
					    viewable in cached and archived pages or if other Users have copied or stored
					    your User Content. 
                    </p>

					<p>
                        Any improper collection or misuse of information provided on Athlinks is a
					    violation of the Athlinks Terms of Service and should be reported on our <a href="/contact.aspx?topic=privacy">contact us</a> page.
                    </p>

					<p>
                        If you choose to use our invitation service to tell a friend about our site,
					    we will ask you for your friend's email address. We will automatically send
					    your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. Athlinks
					    stores this information to send this one-time email, to register a friend
					    connection if your invitation is accepted, and to track the success of our
					    referral program. Your friend may <a href="/contact.aspx?topic=privacy">contact us</a> to request
					    that we remove this information from our database.
                    </p>

					<p>
                        Athlinks also collects race results from outside sources in order to provide
					    you with a complete user experience as an endurance athlete and a more
					    personalized experience.
                     </p>

					<p>
                        By using Athlinks, you are consenting to have your personal data transferred
    					to and processed in the United States. 
                    </p>

					<h3>Children Under Age 13</h3>

					<p>
                        Athlinks does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from
					    anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register. If you
					    are under 13, please do not send any information about yourself to us,
					    including your name, address, telephone number, or email address. No one under
					    age 13 is allowed to provide any personal information to or on Athlinks. In the
					    event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child
					    under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that
					    information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any
					    information from or about a child under 13, please <a href="/contact.aspx?topic=privacy">contact us</a>.
                    </p>

					<h3>Children Between the Ages of 13 and 18</h3>

					<p>
                        We recommend that minors over the age of 13 ask their parents for permission
    					before sending any information about themselves to anyone over the Internet. 
                    </p>

					<h3>Use of Information Obtained by Athlinks</h3>

					<p>
                        When you register with Athlinks, you create your own profile and privacy
					    settings. Your profile information, as well as your name, age, gender, and
					    photo, are displayed to people in the networks specified in your privacy
					    settings to enable you to connect with people on Athlinks. We may occasionally
					    use your name and email address to send you notifications regarding new
					    services offered by Athlinks that we think you may find valuable. We do not
					    ever give out this contact information either on the site or in private or
					    public communications. All messages sent through the site use Athlinks’
					    proprietary messaging system in order to hide at all times your email address.
                    </p>

					<p>
                        Profile information is used by Athlinks primarily to be presented back to
					    and edited by you when you access the service and to be presented to others
					    permitted to view that information by your privacy settings. In some cases
					    where your privacy settings permit it (e.g., posting to your wall), other Athlinks
					    users may be able to supplement your profile. 
                    </p>

					<p>
                        Profile information you submit to Athlinks will be available to users of Athlinks
					    who belong to at least one of the networks you allow to access the information
					    through your privacy settings (e.g., school, geography, friends of friends).
					    Your name, alias, and profile picture thumbnail will be available in search
					    results across the Athlinks network and those limited pieces of information may
					    be made available to third party search engines. This is primarily so your
					    friends can find you and send a friend request. People who see your name in
					    searches, however, will not be able to access your profile information you
					    choose to make that information public which allows such access based on your
    					privacy settings. 
                    </p>

					<p>
                        Athlinks will send you only service-related announcements from time to time
					    through the general operation of the service. For instance, if a friend sends
					    you a new message, requests you as a confirmed friend, or someone posts on your
					    wall, you will receive an email alerting you to that fact. 
                    </p>

					<p>
                        Athlinks may use information in your profile without identifying you as an
					    individual to third parties. We do this for purposes such as aggregating how
					    many people in a race event or group use particular gear or for personalizing advertisements
					    and promotions so that we can provide them to you on Athlinks where appropriate.
					    We do this to cut down on the amount of unrelated advertisements and increase
					    the relevancy of advertisements that are shown to you. 
                    </p>

					<h3>Sharing Your Information with Third Parties</h3>

					<p>
                        Athlinks is about sharing information with others — friends and people in your
					    networks — while providing you with controls that restrict other third parties
					    from accessing your information. We allow you to choose the information you
					    provide to friends and networks through Athlinks. Our network architecture and
					    your privacy settings allow you to make informed choices about who has access
					    to your information. We do not provide contact information to third party
					    marketers. We share your information with third parties only in limited
					    circumstances where we believe such sharing is 1) reasonably necessary to offer
					    the service, 2) legally required or, 3) permitted by you. 
                    </p>

					<p>
                        Unlike most sites on the Web, Athlinks limits access to site information by
					    third party search engine "crawlers" (e.g. Google, Yahoo, MSN, Ask). Athlinks
					    blocks access by these engines to personal information beyond your name,
					    profile picture, and limited aggregated data about your profile (e.g. number of
					    wall postings). 
                    </p>

					<p>
                        We may provide information to service providers to help us bring you the
					    services we offer. Specifically, we may use third parties to facilitate our
					    business, such as to host the service at a co-location facility for servers, to
					    send out email updates about Athlinks, to remove repetitive information from
					    our user lists, to process payments for products or services, or to provide
					    search results or links (including sponsored links). In connection with these
					    offerings and business operations, our service providers may have access to
					    your personal information for use for a limited time in connection with these
					    business activities. Where we utilize third parties for the processing of any
					    personal information, we implement reasonable contractual and technical
					    protections limiting the use of that information to the Athlinks-specified
					    purposes.
                     </p>

                     <p>
                        We may be required to disclose user information pursuant to lawful requests, such as subpoenas
						or court orders, or in compliance with applicable laws. We do not reveal
						information until we have a good faith belief that an information request
						by law enforcement or private litigants meets applicable legal standards.
						Additionally, we may share account or other information when we believe it
						is necessary to comply with law, to protect our interests or property, to
						prevent fraud or other illegal activity perpetrated through the Athlinks
						service or using the Athlinks name, or to prevent imminent bodily harm.
						This may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers, agents
						or government agencies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            We let you choose to share
						    information with marketers or electronic commerce providers through
						    sponsored groups or other on-site offers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            We may offer stores or
						    provide services jointly with other companies on Athlinks. You can tell
						    when another company is involved in any store or service provided on Athlinks,
						    and we may share customer information with that company in connection with
						    your use of that store or service.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            If the ownership of all or
						    substantially all of the Athlinks business, or individual business units
						    owned by Athlinks, Inc., were to change, your user information may be
						    transferred to the new owner so the service can continue operations. In
						    any such transfer of information, your user information would remain
						    subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy.
                    </p>

					<h3>Links</h3>

					<p>
                        Athlinks may contain links to other websites. We are of course not
					    responsible for the privacy practices of other web sites. We encourage our
					    users to be aware when they leave our site to read the privacy statements of
					    each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This
					    Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by Athlinks. 
                    </p>

					<h3>Third Party Advertising</h3>

					<p>
                        Advertisements that appear on Athlinks are sometimes delivered (or
					    "served") directly to users by third party advertisers. They automatically
					    receive your IP address when this happens. These third party advertisers may
					    also download cookies to your computer, or use other technologies such as
					    JavaScript and "web beacons" (also known as "1x1 gifs") to
					    measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content.
