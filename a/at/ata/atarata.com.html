				described in more detail in Part C below, there are limited circumstances in which some of your
				information will be shared with third parties, under strict restrictions, so it is important for you to
				review this Privacy Policy.</p>

			<p>This Privacy Policy contains numerous general and technical details about the steps we take to respect

				circumstances we disclose it. All personal information, as further described in Part B, that we collect
				and maintain will be subject to the version of the Privacy Policy in effect at the time of such
				collection. Alawar reserves the right to change the Privacy Policy from time to time at its sole
				discretion, and will prominently post any material changes on the home page of the Website. You will be
				given the opportunity to opt-out. If as the result of such changes, you want to alter the ways in which
				Alawar is allowed to use your personal information, you can do so by following the procedure described
				in Section Creating and Updating Your Personal Account and Preferences. You will be deemed to have been
				made aware of, and will be subject to, the changes to the Privacy Policy by your continued use of the

				communicate with you, either by Alawar or by third parties, Alawar will not change your preference in
				this regard without your express consent.</p>

			<p><b>Third Party Websites</b></p>

			<p>Alawar does not control the information collection and distribution policies on Internet domains other
				than those Internet domains that are under the control of Alawar itself. When you are on the Alawar
				Website, you may be directed to other sites that are beyond our control. These other sites may
				independently collect data, solicit personal information, or send their own cookies to you. Alawar is
				not responsible for any use of the information including click-stream data created when using such third
				party sites.</p>

			<p><b>Legal Issues</b></p>

			<p>This is a United States website and is subject to the laws of the United States. Alawar will disclose
				personally identifiable information without your permission when required by law, or in good faith
				belief that such action is necessary to investigate or protect against harmful activities to Alawar
				guests, visitors, associates, or property (including this Website), or to others. As mentioned above,
				laws related to personal identifiable information vary by country. For example, personally identifiable
				information collected in the European Union is subject to the EU Directives concerning personal data,
				privacy and electronic communications, including but not limited to Directive 2002/58/EC of the European
				Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the
				protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector and Directive 95/46/EC of the European
				Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the
				processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data.</p>

			<p>Alawar may be required by law enforcement or judicial authorities to provide personally identifiable
				information to appropriate governmental authorities. If requested by law enforcement or judicial
				authorities, we will provide this information upon receipt of the appropriate documentation. Alawar may
				also provide information to law enforcement to protect its property and the health and safety of
				individuals as permitted by statute.</p>

			<h2>B. COLLECTED INFORMATION</h2>

			<p><b>Browsing</b></p>

			<p>This Website does not collect personally identifiable information from your computer when you browse the
				Website and request pages from our servers. This means that, unless you voluntarily and knowingly
				provide us with personally identifiable information, we will not know your name, your e-mail address, or
				any other personally identifiable information. When you request a page from our Website, our servers log
				the information provided in the HTTP request header, JavaScript or similar technical tools, including
				the IP number, the time of the request, the URL of your request and other information. We collect such
				information in order to make our Website function correctly and provide you the functionality that you
				see on this Website, as our servers use this information to deliver to you the pages on this Website. We
				also use this information to better understand how visitors use our Website and how we can better tune
				our Website, its contents and functionality to meet your needs.</p>

			<p><b>Information We Collect</b></p>

			<p>As a visitor to this Website, you can engage in many activities without providing any personal
				information as described above in Section Browsing above. In connection with other activities, such as
				subscribing to the services offered on the Website, subscribing to periodic newsletters sent by Alawar,
				requesting customer support, downloading trial versions of software, utilizing online software
				applications or purchasing any of the products and services available on the Website, Alawar may ask you
				to voluntarily supply us with certain information about yourself by filling out and submitting an online
				form. It is completely optional for you to engage in these activities and/or make any purchases. If you
				elect to engage in these activities or make purchases, however, Alawar may ask that you provide us
				personal information, defined as any information that identifies or can be used to identify, contact, or
				locate the person to whom such information pertains, including but not limited to your first and last
				name, mailing address (including ZIP code), e-mail address, employer, and other personal information.
				This information is requested in conjunction with the purchase and registration of our Products or
				Services. In addition, as noted below, minimum information is requested if you choose to subscribe to
				our newsletter service.</p>

			<p>You never have to answer any questions, and you can decline this exchange of information at any time.
				However, if you should choose to withhold requested information, we may not be able to provide you with
				some of the services dependent upon the collection of this information. Depending upon the activity,
				some of the information that we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some as voluntary. If
				you do not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular activity or purchase, you will not be
				able to engage in that activity or make such a purchase.</p>

			<p>Alawar is the sole owner of the information it gathers on the Website. Alawar will only share your
				information with outside parties in ways that are described in this privacy statement or if we are
				required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary in order to conform
				to the edicts of the law, cooperate with law enforcement agencies, or comply with a legal process served
				on our Website.</p>

			<p>When you use the Website, Alawar or third parties authorized by Alawar may also collect certain technical
				and routing information about your computer to facilitate your use of the Website and its services. When
				you surf the Internet, your Internet browser (such as Mozilla Firefox or Microsoft Internet Explorer)
				automatically transmits some information to Alawar every time you access content on one of our internet
				domains within the Website. Examples of such information include the URL of the Web page you were just
				on (known as the "Refer"), the IP (or Internet Protocol) address of the computer you are using, or the
				browser version you are using to access our site. All of this information may be collected by Alawar and
				used to help improve our offerings to you.</p>

			<p>We use such data to facilitate and track your use of the Website and its services. Alawar also uses such
				environmental variables to measure traffic patterns on the Website. Without expressly informing you in
				each particular circumstance, we do not match such information with any of your personal
				information.</p>

			<p>When you place an order for software or services online, you may be re-directed to a third-party Website.
				Any third-party company administers its own Privacy Policy that is not under the control of Alawar.
				Prior to placing an online order, please review the Privacy Policy on that Website.</p>

			<p>Credit Card information is not retained as part of the registration process. This information is
				processed during the purchase process and is then immediately destroyed. You are provided an opportunity
				on the Alawar Website to subscribe to a periodic newsletter. This newsletter is a marketing tool that
				allows Alawar to inform you of new Products and Services, as well as other news relevant to the company.
				The subscription service requires you to provide your first and last name as well as your email address.
				Optionally, you are asked to provide the name of the company you represent. You are given the
				opportunity to choose the type of information we provide to you.</p>

			<p><b><i>While the subscription list is maintained by a trusted third party affiliate, the list remains the
						sole exclusive property of Alawar. Your name and email address is not shared with any third
						party and will not be used to send you unsolicited communications. A link is provided to allow
						you to change your subscription preferences, including cancellation of your
						subscription.</i></b></p>

			<p>When you submit personal information to Alawar through this Website, you understand and agree that this
				information may be transferred across national boundaries and may be stored and processed in any of the
				countries in which Alawar and its affiliates and subsidiaries maintain offices. You also acknowledge
				that in certain countries or with respect to certain activities, the collection, transferring, storage,
				and processing of your information may be undertaken by trusted vendors of Alawar. Such vendors are
				bound by contract not to use your personal information for their own purposes or provide it to any third
				parties.</p>

			<p>Alawar may establish relationships with various service providers whose services may become available to
				you from this Website or from other websites that are linked to this Website. Typically, these providers
				would offer services that Alawar customers might find useful, such as those that can be used in
				conjunction with Alawar services and products. In order to use those services, you may be required to
				provide personal information to the providers. Unless expressly provided to the contrary, personal
				information that you provide while you are visiting a provider's Website will be subject to the privacy
				policy posted on such site, and personal information that you provide while on this Website in
				conjunction with a provider's service will be subject to this Privacy Policy. You should be aware that
				our agreements with these service providers often provide that they will share with Alawar personal
				information collected from you. In such instances, Alawar may use this information in a manner
				consistent with this Privacy Policy.</p>

			<p><b>Information for Affiliates and Software Developers </b></p>

			<p>From time to time, companies or individuals who develop software may access this Website in an effort to
				enter into a business relationship with Alawar. In addition, owners of third-party websites may access
				this Website in an effort to affiliate with Alawar. Contact information for this purpose is posted on
				our Website. For these individuals and entities, in addition to information related to your business,
				Alawar reserves the right to request personal information including but not limited to your full name,
				physical address, email address, telephone contact number, employer, etc. This information will normally
				be requested only in those situations where you are not contacting Alawar in the capacity of an agent or
				representative of an established business, and only in those circumstances where the information is
				required in order to consummate a business relationship. You may elect not to provide personal
				identifying information. However, failure to provide the requested information may hinder Alawar's
				ability to do business with you.</p>

			<p><b>Accessing and Updating Your Personal Preferences</b></p>

			<p>You may access and correct your personal information and privacy preferences (such as whether you wish to
				receive promotional communications from Alawar or third parties) by writing Alawar at
				privacy@alawar.com.</p>

			<p><b>Information Relating to Children</b></p>

			<p>The Alawar Website and any products or services available on that site are not directed at children under
				13 years of age and, therefore, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA") does not apply.
				However, we recognize that children under the age of 13 may access this Website and subscribe to the
				newsletter, purchase products and services, or download trial versions of software programs. The
				collection of information is covered above.</p>

			<p>Parents and Legal Guardians may request from us to review, delete or stop the collection of the
				personally identifiable information of their child. You may do so in one of two ways. If you know the
				user name and password or email address, follow the instructions below regarding Choices Available to
				You or you may contact us by letter, phone or email using the address information provided at the bottom
				of this page.</p>

			<p><b>Securing the Transmission and Storage of Information</b></p>

			<p>Alawar operates secure data networks protected by industry standard firewall and password protection
				systems. Our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary, and only
				authorized individuals have access to the information provided by our users. Even your registration
				account password is encrypted before it is sent to our computers. Any other particularly sensitive
				information, such as a customer's credit card number collected for a commerce transaction, is also
				encrypted prior to transmission.</p>

			<p>Alawar takes steps to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with our Terms
				of Service and this Privacy Policy. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be
				guaranteed secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot
				guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services,
				and you use these services at your own risk.</p>

			<p>We treat the information you provide to us as confidential information; it is, accordingly, subject to
				our company's security procedures and corporate policies regarding protection and use of confidential
				information. After personally identifiable information reaches Alawar it is stored on a server with
				physical and electronic security features as customary in the industry, including utilization of
				login/password procedures and electronic firewalls designed to block unauthorized access from outside of
				Alawar. Because laws applicable to personal information vary by country, our offices or other business
				operations may put in place additional measures that vary depending on the applicable legal
				requirements. Information collected on the sites covered by this Privacy Policy is processed and stored
				in the United States and also in other countries where Alawar and its service providers conduct
				business. All Alawar employees are aware of our privacy and security policies. Your information is only
				accessible to those employees who need it in order to perform their jobs.</p>

			<h2>C. USE AND DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION</h2>

			<p><b>How your personal information is used</b></p>

			<p>Alawar collects your information in order to record and support your participation in the activities you
				select. We will use your e-mail address to send a confirmation and, if necessary, might use the other
				information to contact you for help to process the purchase or service you have selected. If you
				subscribe to a service or register a product, for example, the information is used to register your
				rights, if any, to technical support or other benefits that may be made available to registered users.
				Your personal information is also used to keep you informed about product upgrades, patches, special
				offers, and other products and services of Alawar and selected third parties if you have so opted to
				receive such communications.</p>

			<p>Alawar may collect information about the use of the Website, such as the types of services used and how
				many users we receive daily. This information is collected in aggregate form, without identifying any
				user individually. Alawar may use this aggregate, non-identifying statistical data for statistical
				analysis, marketing, or similar promotional purposes.</p>

			<p>Alawar recognizes and appreciates the importance of responsible use of information collected on this
				Website. Without your consent, Alawar will not communicate any information to you regarding products,
				services, and special offers available from Alawar or its affiliates, although we may find it necessary
				to communicate with you regarding your use of the services on this Website. Except in the particular
				circumstances described in this Privacy Policy, Alawar will also not provide your name to other
				companies or organizations without your consent.</p>

			<p><b>Disclosure of Information to Third Parties</b></p>

			<p>Alawar does use the services of third parties, such as e-mail service providers, purchase and order
				processing merchants and marketing companies that act as independent contractors on behalf of Alawar.
				These parties are contractually prohibited from using personally identifiable information for any
				purpose other than for the purpose Alawar specifies. We do provide non-personally identifiable
				information to certain service providers for their use on an aggregated basis for the purpose of
				performing their contractual obligations to us. We prohibit the sale or transfer of personal information
				to entities outside of the Alawar's affiliates for their use without your approval.</p>

			<p>Alawar may disclose your personally identifiable information if we believe in good faith that we are
				required to do so in order to comply with applicable law, a subpoena, or other legal process. Alawar may
				also disclose personally identifiable information when we have reason to believe that disclosing this
				information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating
				our Terms of Service, this Privacy Policy or to protect the safety of our users and the public or under
				confidentiality and licensing agreements with certain third parties which assist us in developing,
				operating and maintaining the Website and its content.</p>

			<p>In the event that all or substantially all of Alawar's stock and/or assets are transferred or sold to
				another entity, Alawar may transfer personally identifiable information to the acquiring entity. If, as
				a result of such a business transition, your personally identifiable information will be used in a
				materially different manner, you will be given choice consistent with our policy regarding notification
				of changes.</p>

			<p><b>Choices available to you</b></p>

			<p>You can always choose whether or not to disclose personally identifiable information and that choice will
				not prevent you from using the Alawar Website. Please note, however, if you should choose to withhold
				requested information, we may not be able to provide you with some of the services dependent upon the
				collection of this information.</p>

			<p>You can choose at anytime to opt out of receiving emails from Alawar or from having your personally
				identifiable information shared with selected companies. If you want to opt out, you can do so by
				editing your preferences with respect to email or the sharing of information. If you elect to "opt out"
				we will not, as applicable, share your personal information with third parties or send you emails.
				However, we may continue to use your personal information for internal purposes, to enhance your user
				experience or as necessary to administer the site or comply with applicable law.</p>

			<p>We reserve the right to send a one-time registration confirmation email, and infrequent Service Alert
				messages to users to inform them of specific changes that may impact their ability to use a service they
				have previously signed up for, regardless of email contact opt-in status. We also reserve the right to
				contact you if compelled to do so as part of a legal proceeding or if there has been a violation of our
				Terms of Service or applicable licensing agreements.</p>

			<p>Alawar is retaining these rights because in limited cases we feel that we may need the right to contact
				you as a matter of law or regarding matters that will be important to you. These rights do not allow us
				to contact you to market a new or existing service if you have asked us not to do so, and issuance of
				these types of communications are rare.</p>

			<p>If you wish to opt out of receiving emails, newsletters, the sharing or retention of any personal
				identification information, or otherwise change your personal preferences, you must contact Alawar
				either by email at [privacy@alawar.com] or regular mail at [Alawar Entertainment, Inc 901 N. Pitt Street
				Suite 325 Alexandria, VA 22314].</p>

			<p>To ensure that your request is honored, you must provide Alawar with information sufficient for us to
				accurately identify and access your records. The information we require is your full name, address and
				the email address you provided to Alawar when you requested services or products. Alawar reserves the
				right to contact you to verify that we have accurately identified your record.</p>

			<p><b>Cookies</b></p>

			<p>Our Website uses "cookie" technology. "Cookies" are short pieces of data generated by a web server that a
				website stores on a user's computer. Certain pages on our Website may require the use of a cookie for
				purposes of keeping information you enter on multiple pages together. Cookies also enable us to
				customize our Website and offerings to your needs and provide you with a better online experience with
				us. In addition, cookies are used to:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>allow registered users to sign in without typing their sign in name each time;</li>
				<li>measure usage of various pages on our Website to help us make our information; more pertinent to
					your needs and easy for you to access; and
				</li>
				<li>provide functionality such as online orders, Alawar's services and other functionality that we
					believe would be of interest and value to you.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The types of cookies that we use are referred to as "session" cookies and "persistent" cookies. Session
				cookies are temporary and are automatically deleted once you leave the Website. Persistent cookies
				remain on your computer hard drive until you delete them. We do not use cookies to gather information
				concerning your visits to other websites, nor ascertain any personally identifiable information about
				you apart from what you voluntarily provide us in your dealings with Alawar. Cookies do not, under
				ordinary circumstances, corrupt or damage your computer, programs, or computer files.</p>

			<p>In addition, the service providers we use to serve and host our advertisements, and/or deliver our
				e-mails, use session and persistent cookies, to track the number of times the Website is accessed and
				whether the site was accessed from an advertisement. There are no cookies in the advertisement or
				e-mail. A cookie is placed on your computer only if and when you click on an advertisement or open the
				e-mail. The cookie generated from the advertisement or e-mail does not contain any personally
				identifiable information and will remain on your hard drive until you delete it.</p>

			<p>You may set your browser to block cookies (consult the instructions for your particular browser on how to
				do this), although doing so may adversely affect your ability to perform certain transactions, use
				certain functionality and access certain content on our Website.</p>

			<h2>D. PRIVACY-RELATED INQUIRIES AND COMPLAINTS</h2>

			<p>Alawar takes and addresses its users' privacy concerns with utmost respect and attention. If you believe
				that there was an instance of non-compliance with this Online Privacy Policy with regard to your
				personal information or you have other related inquiries or concerns, you may write or contact Alawar at
				Legal@Alawar.com or Alawar Entertainment, Inc 901 N. Pitt Street Suite 325 Alexandria, VA 22314.</p>

			<p>In your message, please describe in as much detail as possible the nature of your inquiry or the ways in
				which you believe that the Alawar Online Privacy Policy has not been complied with. We will investigate
				your inquiry or complaint promptly.</p>

			<p>Please note that if you provide Alawar with inconsistent privacy preferences (for example, by indicating
				on one occasion that third parties may contact you with marketing offers and indicating on another
				occasion that they may not), Alawar cannot guarantee that your most recent privacy preference will be
				honored.</p>
