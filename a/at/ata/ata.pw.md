 **Sharing your Personal Data with others**

##### We may share your personal data with service providers, business partners and other third parties, in accordance with applicable law.  
   
For example, ATA may sell you a product or offer you a service in a joint marketing effort with another company (business partner). The agreements with these business partners will limit the purposes for which your personal data can be used and disclosed, and will require your personal data to be adequately safeguarded. We will let you know that such a relationship exists and who these companies are prior to processing your data for such joint marketing efforts.  
ATA may also disclose your data to other companies such as IT and communications service providers, testing companies, data management support partners and other parties bearing a necessary relationship for ATA to provide its services.  
   
When you interact with ATA as a business customer, supplier or business partner, ATA may disclose personal data available in reports and other materials provided by you and/or your company pursuant to an engagement with another business partner and/or a supplier.  
   
If we are required by law to obtain your consent, or otherwise believe that your consent is appropriate in the circumstances, we will obtain your consent before we share your personal data.  
   
ATA will disclose personal data only in conformance with this privacy notice and/or when required by law.  
   
From time to time, ATA may sell a business or a part of a business to another company. Such a transfer of ownership could include the transfer of your personal data directly related to that business to the purchasing company.  
   
 **Your rights**

##### Once you have provided us with your personal data, you have reasonable access to that information so that you can update, modify or, if legally possible, delete it. For this purpose, we refer you to the ATA privacy website (www.ata.pw) where you can exercise your rights. On this website you can also pose other privacy questions or file your privacy complaints.  
   
You can also delete or change the privacy settings of your My ATA account by logging in to your account and accessing your “personal settings”.  
   
You will also be provided with an opt-out opportunity in our commercial messages to you.  
   
We encourage you to keep your personal settings and personal data complete and current.  
   
 **Your choices**

##### We want to know you better so that we can serve you better while at the same time respecting your choices about how we use your personal data.  
   
Your personal data may be transferred from your home country to other ATA companies in different locations around the world, which may communicate with you about ATA products, services or special offers that you may be interested in. If local law requires it, we will ask for prior consent to transfer your personal data outside of your geographic region.  
   
If you do not want us to send you personalised offers or information, you can let us know by ticking the appropriate box on the registration form or reply card, or by selecting “opt-out” on emails you receive.  
   
Where local law requires it, we will ask you to “opt-in” or affirmatively consent to the processing of your personal data. For example, where local law so requires, we will only send you newsletters if you have subscribed to them. Similarly, where local law so requires, we will ask you to “opt-in” before using sophisticated profiling techniques.  
   
Because ATA sells thousands of products and services in hundreds of countries, you may have previously provided us with your personal data through reply cards, via our call centres or in some other manner. Your decision not to register now will not affect the personal data you have already provided to ATA. Of course, you will always have the option to unsubscribe from any targeted communication from ATA or change your personal profile information as described under “Your Rights”.
