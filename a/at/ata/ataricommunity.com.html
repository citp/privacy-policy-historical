  <br><a href="http://www.esrb.org/confirm/Infogrames-confirmation.htm"><img border="0" width="76" height="105" src="/confirm1.gif" align="left"></a><b>Atari’s Online Privacy Policy </b><br> Atari is very concerned with the privacy rights of our online visitors and customers 
and is committed to protecting the information collected about you. We have adopted 
an Online Privacy Policy that guides how we collect, store and use the information 
you provide while visiting any of the websites governed by this Privacy Policy 
(as listed below). For our information collection practices with respect to children 
under 13, please see our special children's section below. <br>
  <br>
  This Privacy Policy and the certification seal located on this page confirm 
  that Atari is a valid licensee and participating member in the Entertainment

  your privacy, we have voluntarily undertaken this privacy initiative and all

  meet established online information collection and use practices. As part of 
  this privacy program, we are subject to frequent audits of our sites and other 
  enforcement and accountability mechanisms administered independently by the 
  ESRB.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Whenever you visit a Website that displays the ESRB Privacy Online Certification 
  Seal, you can expect to be notified of the following: </b>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>The websites and information covered by this Privacy Policy </li>
  <li>Exactly what personal information may be collected and how it will be used 
  </li>

</ul>
  <b>The websites and information covered by this Privacy Policy: </b><br>
  <br>
  This Privacy Policy currently applies to the following Web sites operated by 
  Atari:<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  <a href="http://www.atari.com">www.atari.com</a> <br>
  <a href="http://www.ina-support.com">www.ina-support.com</a><br>
  <a href="http://www.funkidsgames.com">www.funkidsgames.com</a><br>
  <br>
In addition, Atari may own several other domain names that point to the websites 
listed above. From time to time, we may add new websites and will take reasonable 
steps to update the list. Please note, however, that this Privacy Policy applies 
only to the websites set forth above, and not to websites operated by our International 
affiliates (e.g., Atari in France, United Kingdom, Italy, etc.). When you link 
to these foreign sites or any other sites from a website listed above, their privacy 
policies will apply. <br>
  <br>
  Also, please note that this Privacy Policy applies only to information collected 
  by Atari online through the sites listed above, not to information that Atari 
  may collect offline.<br>
  <br>
  <b>What information does Atari collect and how will it be used?</b><br>
  <br>
  In order to give you the best experience on our sites, Atari may collect information 
  about you, but only if you voluntarily provide it to us. Typically, we may ask 
  a user to submit personal and/or demographic information, and it will usually 
  take the form of either: (1) game-specific or site registration; (2) community 
  registration; (3) technical product support; (4) placement of an order for goods 
  or services in the event Atari launches an online store; (5) sending an e-card 
  to a friend; (6) submitting a question or comment to our webmaster; and/or, 
  (7) personal information submitted in a business capacity (e.g., resumes). The 
  types of information requested for each activity and the way the information 
  is used are detailed by category below. Please note, however, that depending 
  on the Atari website which you are visiting, some of the amenities listed above 
  may not be available. <br>
  <br>
  Unless noted otherwise, we may also use your personal information collected 
  through one of the means set forth below for our internal marketing and demographic 
  studies, so we can constantly improve the products and services we provide you 
  and to better meet your needs. Demographic information is similarly used to 
  tailor our visitor's experience at our site, showing them content that we think 
  they might be interested in, and displaying content according to their preferences. 
  <br>
  <br>
  No matter what method we use to collect information and no matter how we use 
  that information, we will only collect the information deemed reasonably necessary 
  to fulfill your online requests and our legitimate business objectives.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Game Specific Registration</b><br>
  <br>
  Almost all game pages that appear on our sites provide you the opportunity to 
  register to receive the latest news and information about a particular game 
  (i.e., Subscription Center). If you choose to subscribe, you may be prompted 
  to submit personal information such as your full name, home address, phone number 
  and email address. Additionally, we may ask you for some demographic information 
  including your age, gender, the game systems you own, and the types of games 
  you play. The information you provide on this registration form will be used 
  to send you, via email, game news and information tailored to your game and 
  platform preferences. In addition, we may use the information to send you notices 
  that contain additional information, discounts, and offers from Atari, unless 
  you opt out from receiving such notices at the time of registration or at a 
  later time. <br>
  <b><br>
  Community Forum Registration</b><br>
  <br>
To register for membership in our online community, we may ask you to provide 
personal information such as your email address, and to create a username and 
password. We may also collect demographic information about you, including your 
occupation, hobbies and interests, and other preferences. The information that 
you submit to us for this purpose is used to give you access to our community 
forums and other community features. <br>
  <br>
  The ability to participate in the community forums by simply logging in is available 
  to only those Web users who have already created a password during an earlier 
  visit to the community registration area of our site. To login as a member, 
  we may ask you to submit your username and password. This information is collected 
  so that you can access and participate in the community forums without having 
  to reregister. <br>
  <br>
  Please note that whenever you give out personal information in public areas 
  such as on our community forums, that information can be collected and used 
  by people you don't know. While we strive to protect those who wish to participate 
  in these forums, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you post 
  in these areas. When you register for the community forum, you have the option 
  to make your email address inaccessible to other users of the forum.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Technical Support</b><br>
  <br>
  To submit a question or problem to our technical support center using Atari’s 
  email form, you may be asked to provide your first and last name, date of birth, 
  country, state or province, email address, telephone number, the date and location 
  of your purchase, the name of the game in question, the operating system you 
  are having the trouble on, and a description of the problem you are encountering. 
  The information you provide us for this purpose is used to respond to your troubleshooting 
  problem.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Online Store</b><br>
  <br>
  In the event Atari launches an online store for its web users, visitors purchasing 
  goods or services may need to provide a valid credit card number and expiration 
  date, in addition to name, mailing and billing addresses, phone number and e-mail 
  address. In the event that we launch such an online store, we may also ask you 
  to create a password so that when you return to our site, you can easily retrieve 
  your shopping cart by logging in. <br>
  <br>
  <b>E-cards</b><br>
  <br>
Web users who wish to send an e-card to a friend or family member may be asked 
to provide their name and email address, and the name(s) and email address(es) 
of the person(s) to whom they wish to send the e-card. After we send the E-card, 
we do not store the collected email addresses or use them for other purposes.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Email to Webmaster</b><br>
  <br>
  Atari may collect and temporarily store personal information that you voluntarily 
  submit to us via email correspondence. For example, Atari provides a link through 
  which an online visitor can send e-mail to our Webmaster addressing any issue 
  a user encounters when using our websites. Any personal information contained 
  in such email is used by Atari for the sole purpose of responding to your questions. 
  Although most e-mail messages are deleted after they are responded to, in certain 
  cases hard copies of or data from certain e-mail correspondence may be kept 
  on file for security purposes. Any such copy or data will also be stored in 
  a secure location, and information from these messages will not be used for 
  marketing purposes.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Business Capacity</b><br>
  <br>
  Atari allows for the online submission of resumes. Personal information collected 
  from resumes will be used solely for the purpose of accepting and evaluating 
  candidate submissions for job postings. Information obtained from resumes may 
  be shared within our company.<br>
  <br>
  Portions of our site may also contain an area where businesses can submit a 
  request to receive corporate or financial information about Atari (e.g., www.atari.com). 
  Any personal information collected from such requests, such as name, email address, 
  and phone number, is used to respond to the specific request and, if you opt-in, 
  is added to our business mailing list. <br>
  <br>
  Other than as explained above, this Privacy Policy does not apply to personal 
  information gathered through resumes or requests for corporate or financial 
  information. <br>
  <b><br>
  What happens if I refuse to provide my personal information?</b><br>
  <br>
  Your refusal to submit personal information may limit your ability to participate 
  in some of our activities such as sweepstakes or community forums. However, 
  you do not need to provide personal information to access and browse our Web 
  sites. <br>
  <br>
  Does Atari use cookies, track IP Addresses or use other passive means to collect 
  information?<br>
  <br>
  Atari uses cookies on its websites. A "cookie" is a small bit of record-keeping 
  information that websites often store on a user's computer. Cookies do not include 
  people's names, e-mail addresses, or other information that is personally identifiable; 
  they are typically used to quickly identify a user's computer and to "remember" 
  things about the user's visit.<br>
  <br>
  Atari also keep tracks of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for safety and security 
  reasons. An IP address is a number that is used by computers on the network 
  to identify your computer every time you log on to the Internet.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Who is collecting my personal information?</b><br>
  <br>
  The information you submit to our websites is collected by Atari and is used 
  in the manner specified under the section titled "What information does 
  Atari collect and how will it be used?" Contact information for Atari is 
  provided below. <br>
  <br>
  <b>With whom does Atari share my personal information?</b><br>
  <br>
  It is our policy not to share your personal information with any third parties. 
  However, this policy does not apply when disclosure is required by law enforcement 
  or other government officials in connection with an investigation of fraud, 
  intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may 
  expose you or us to legal liability. In addition, information about our customers, 
  including personal information, may be disclosed as part of any bankruptcy, 
  merger, sale, transfer of company assets, or acquisition, if permitted by and 
  done in accordance with applicable law. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Can I choose how my personal information is used?</b><br>
  <br>
If you do not want Atari to send you communications about its products and services, 
you can opt-out from receiving these communications at the time of information 
collection or by contacting us by phone at (425) 951-7106 or by regular mail at 
Atari, Inc., 2230 Broadway Avenue, Santa Monica CA 90404, Attn: Customer Database. 
In addition, along with every communication sent to you, Atari gives you the opportunity 
to discontinue receiving future communications.<br>
  <br>
  <b>How do I access my personal information?</b><br>
  <br>
  You always have the option to view, correct and/or delete the personal information 
  collected about you and stored in our database. To do so, please take any one 
  of the following steps: <br>
  <br>
  1. Send mail to the following postal address: <br>
  Atari, Inc. <br>
  2230 Broadway Avenue, <br>
  Santa Monica, CA 90404 Attn: Customer Database<br>
  <br>
  2. Call the following telephone number: <br>
  (425) 951-7106 and use our Automated Systems' Main Menu option or speak to a 
  customer service representative. <br>
  <br>
  <b>What is Atari’s policy regarding links to third party sites?</b><br>
  <br>
  You should be aware that while you are on a website operated by Atari, you could 
  be directed to other sites that are beyond our control and for which we are 
  not responsible. Because we cannot guarantee that the privacy policies of these 
  websites meet our high standards and the requirements of the ESRB Privacy Online 
  Program, we recommend that you read the privacy policy of the website to which 
  you link before you submit any personal information.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Does Atari collect personal information from children under 13?</b><br>
  <br>
  <u>Collection and Use of Personal Information</u><br>
  <br>
  At this time, we collect and store personal information about children under 
  13 ("children" or "child") only if it submitted by way of 
  our email support page (accessible from the Technical Support area of our site 
  at www.ina-support.com) and is submitted after we've obtained verifiable parental 
  consent. We do not collect personal information from children through our kids' 
  site located at www.funkidsgames.com. On our email support page, we determine 
  who is younger than 13 years old and whether parental consent is required by 
  asking all users seeking technical support help to submit their age (i.e., date 
  of birth). Those users under 13 years old are directed to our Parental Consent 
  Form. If given verifiable permission from a parent, Atari may collect and store 
  the following types of personal information about a child seeking technical 
  support help: first and last name, email address, and telephone number. Atari 
  may also collect demographic information about a child such as the country and 
  state in which the child lives, the child's date of birth, and a description 
  of the hardware (e.g., operating system) and/or product the child has encountered 
  a problem with; and, combine such information with the child's personal information. 
  Atari will only collect this information if it is voluntarily submitted to us 
  by the child. We do not collect personal information about the child through 
  the use of passive collection mechanisms such as cookies. <br>
  <br>
  The information collected from a child through our email support page is used 
  by Atari for purposes of diagnosing a child's specific technical problem and 
  providing an acceptable solution, and may be stored for purposes of providing 
  ongoing technical support. From time to time and through the use of our email 
  support page, we receive requests from children relating to Frequently Asked 
  Question documents (FAQ's), Hint documents, and/or patch disks or update disks 
  related to a specific game or games, and we may use the contact information 
  provided to respond to such requests. <br>
