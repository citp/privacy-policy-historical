Please note that this Privacy Policy applies only to information submitted and collected online through the Atari Websites (as listed above), and does not apply to information that may be collected by Atari offline. In addition, this Privacy Policy does not extend to websites maintained by our international affiliates (e.g., Atari in France, United Kingdom, Italy, etc.) or by other companies or organizations to which we link (e.g., websites of third party companies). When you link to these foreign sites or any other sites from a website listed above, their privacy policies will apply. 

Please note that by using our Websites, you signify your assent to Atari's Online Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not use our Websites. We reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy. Please check back from time to time to ensure that you are aware of these changes. If we make a material change to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you by posting the change on our Websites. Your continued use of our Websites will signify your acceptance of these changes. 

This Privacy Policy reflects the law of the United States. In France, the collection of personal information on the Internet is governed by French law no. 78-17 of January 6, 1978. 

  
**What types of information does Atari collect?**  
In order to give you the best experience on our Websites, Atari may collect information about you, but only if you voluntarily provide it to us. Typically, we may ask you to submit personal and/or demographic information in connection with any one of the following features or services. 

  * Online contact information 
  * Website registration 
  * Game-specific registration
  * Newsletter subscription
  * Community forum
  * Online Store
  * Technical support
  * Contests, sweepstakes, and other promotions
  * Polls, surveys, or questionnaires
  * Other features such as e-cards, wish lists, and tell-a-friend



  
Please note that depending on the Atari website that you are visiting, some amenities listed above may not be available. When available, the types and amount of personal information collected will vary depending on the activity. The requested personal information may include: your name, home address, telephone number, e-mail address, and (for those purchasing products online) credit card information, including billing and shipping addresses. For some activities, we may ask you to create a username and password and to provide other non-personal information such as your age or date of birth, gender, game and platform preferences (including information about the games and hardware you own), hobbies and interests, and other information (also known as "demographic information"). If demographic information is collected for an activity that also requires personal information, we may combine the demographic information with your personal information. Combining data allows us to customize the notices we send you and the content we provide you according to your interests and preferences. For more on how we use your information, please read the section on use below.   


No matter what method we use to collect information and no matter how we use that information, we will only collect the information deemed reasonably necessary to fulfill your online requests and our legitimate business objectives. 

  
**How does Atari use the information it collects?**  
Generally, information that we collect for a particular purpose is used for that purpose only. For example, information collected from those who register on our Websites is used to provide registrants the benefits associated with registration (e.g., subscription to our newsletter or access to the latest game news and exclusive promotions). Similarly, if you sign up for membership in our online community, your information will be used to give you access to our community forums and other community features. And, of course, credit card information is used to fulfill your purchase. In some instances, however, you may also be given the option to have your information used for an activity or service different from the activity or service that you are requesting (e.g., to have your name entered into a contest when subscribing to our newsletter or vice versa). If you choose to receive these additional services, Atari will use your information to provide them to you.  
We may use your email address to send you service-related announcements that tell you about updates to our Privacy Policy, new areas or features on our Websites, changes to our online service or technical support policies, and other related changes.   
We may also use your personal and demographic information for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can constantly improve the online products and services we provide you and to better meet your needs. For example, demographic information is used to tailor our visitor's experience on our Websites, showing them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying content according to their preferences.   
In some areas of our Websites, you may be able to submit information about yourself in a business capacity. Although we can assure you that any personal information gathered in this context will be used solely for its intended purpose, such information is not subject to this Privacy Policy. These areas typically include an employment section where you can submit your resume online and/or an investor relations section where you can fill out an online form to request financial information about Atari. 

  
_A Special Note about our Community Features_  
Please note that whenever you give out personal information in public areas such as on our community forums, that information can be collected and used by people you don't know. While we strive to protect those who wish to participate in these activities, we cannot guarantee the security of, and are not responsible for, any information posted in these areas. When you register for the community forum, you have the option to make your e-mail address inaccessible to others users of the forum.

  
**What happens if I refuse to provide my personal information to Atari?**  
If you choose not to submit personal information when requested, you may not be able to participate in certain activities on our Websites and may limit the services we can provide you. For example, if you refuse to share your email address, you will not be able to register on our Websites or participate in our community forums. To simply browse our Websites, however, you do not need to give us any personal information.

  
**Does Atari use cookies, track IP addresses, or use other passive means to collect information?**

_Cookies_  
We may use cookies to improve the use and functionality of our Websites. A "cookie" is a small file or record-keeping device that websites often store on a user's computer. Storage of cookies on your system provides an easy and convenient method for us to personalize your experience on our Websites. For example, cookies will remember your username and password, tell us that you have visited one of our Websites before, and may contain other information that will make your next visit to our Websites more enjoyable. We do not use cookies to collect personal information such as your name or to link your browsing habits to personal information already collected about you. You can always disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent to your computer. 

  
_IP Addresses_  
Atari may also keep track of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses to troubleshoot technical concerns and to maintain website safety and security. An IP address is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer every time you log on to the Internet.

  
_Log Files_  
Atari may collect information in the form of logs - files that record website activity and gather statistics about web users' browsing habits. These entries are generated anonymously, and help Atari determine (among other things) how many and how often users have visited our Websites, which pages they've visited, and other similar data (a.k.a., navigational data). We also use the log file entries for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can constantly improve the online services we provide you. Log files are used internally only, and are not associated with any particular user, computer, or browser.

**  
Who is collecting my personal information and is it shared with anyone?**  
The information that you disclose on the Atari Websites is collected by Atari or by a vendor on Atari's behalf; and, is used in accordance with the practices set forth above. Vendors (or agents) are entities that provide support for the internal operations of our Websites and who only use the information we share with them (or that they collect on our behalf) for purposes of internal fulfillment (e.g., registration fulfillment and community forums operation). Vendors are required to handle such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

  
Once collected, Atari may share your personal information with our affiliate, subsidiary, or parent companies ("affiliates"). We do this to conduct demographic studies about the people visiting and registering on our Websites (as well as on theirs) and so that you can enjoy the products and services our affiliates have to offer. Our affiliates have agreed to maintain the confidentiality, security, and integrity of the personal information we share with them.

  
When you register on one of our Websites, you may also be given the option to have specific contact information (such as your name and postal address) shared with or rented to reputable third party companies that offer products or services that we believe may be of interest to you. These third party companies tend to be other companies in the videogame industry such as magazine publishers, game developers, or software licensees. We see this as a value-added service helping you find useful products or services. While we have no control over the third party's use of such information, we will attempt to ensure that they agree to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of any personal information we give them. We will not share or rent your information unless you have opted-in to such on our registration form. 

  
We may disclose personal information in the good faith belief that we are required to do so by law, including but not limited to disclosure to law enforcement or other government officials in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose you or us to legal liability. In addition, in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other similar event, Atari's customer information may be transferred to our successor or assign.

  
**Can I choose how my personal information is used?**  
If you do not want to receive our newsletter, service related announcements, or any other communications and/or services from Atari, please opt-out from these communications or services at the time of registration or information collection. If you have opted-in and, at a later time, wish to opt-out, please contact us using the information provided below. 

  
**How can I access my personal information?**  
You always have the option to view, correct and/or delete the personal information collected about you and stored in our database. To do so, please use take any one of the following steps:   
1\. Send mail to the following postal address: Atari, Inc., 2230 Broadway Avenue,   
Santa Monica, CA 90404 Attn: Customer Database.  
2\. Call the following telephone number: (425) 951-7106 and use our Automated Systems' Main Menu option or speak to a customer service representative. 

**What is Atari's policy regarding children under 13?**  
We do not knowingly collect personal information such as name and email address from children under 13 years old on our Websites. We take steps to ensure that those who wish to register or submit personal information on our Websites meet certain age requirements before they can do so. We recognize the importance of safeguarding the privacy of children and encourage parents to check and monitor their children's use of online activities regularly.  
From time to time, certain portions of the Atari Websites may allow children under 13 to disclose a limited amount of personal information without first telling us their age or getting their parent's permission. Such portions of our Websites operate activities or provide services in a way that does not require prior parental consent.  


**What safeguards does Atari use to protect my personal information?**  
Atari maintains reasonable procedures to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of the personal information collected from our website visitors. Personal information collected by Atari is stored in secure operating environments that are not available to the public and that are only accessible to authorized employees. We also have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. For example, before we allow web users to access their community forums profile, we verify their identity by requesting information such as their username and password.

**  
How do I ask a question or file a complaint? (Contact Information)**
