# Privacy Policy | Atlus USA

5\. Your choices and rights

You have options and choices over how we use your information. We provide you with tools to access and update specific information relating to your use of the Products at any time. If you need to sign in to access certain Products, you can update and amend your key contact information directly.

We respect the rights you may have under applicable law to request access to your personal information and where applicable, to request to receive that information in a commonly used electronic format (or ask for this information to be provided in that format to a third party where feasible). You may also have the right under applicable law to request the correction or erasure of your personal information, to seek to object to the further processing under certain circumstances of your information or to request that the processing of specific information about you is restricted while we verify or investigate your concerns about this information. We do not verify the correctness of your personal information.

Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to online services you visit. Note, however, there is no industry consensus as to what site and app operators should do with regard to these signals. Accordingly, we do not monitor or take action with respect to “Do Not Track” signals or other mechanisms. For more information on “Do Not Track,” visit [http://www.allaboutdnt.com](http://www.allaboutdnt.com/).

Please contact us as described in Section 7 to exercise any of these rights.

If you remain unhappy with a response you receive, and are in the European Union, you can also refer the matter to your data protection supervisory authority (see <http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm>).

California Civil Code Section 1798.83 (“Shine the Light”) permits our customers who are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. For inquiries regarding our disclosure policy, please contact us as described below in Section 7 “Contact Us”. Requests must include “California Privacy Rights Request” in the first line of the description and include your name, street address, city, state, and ZIP code.

In addition, if you believe that we have not responded to your privacy-related inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, please contact Atlus U.S.A. Inc.’s Data Protection Officer (DPO@sega.net) or the ESRB at <https://www.esrb.org/privacy/contact.jsp>, or
