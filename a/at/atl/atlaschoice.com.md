  5. ## Data Storage Security

Any personal information saved is held safely on our mainframe computer, with security systems preventing unauthorised access and we always ensure it is treated confidentially.

We take security very seriously and we use one of the strongest available security systems to protect your communications with us. Whenever you fill in an online form, such as a request for a quote, it is automatically protected using something called a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) between your computer and ours. SSL works in the following ways:

It prevents impersonation – you can tell that you are using a genuine SSL site by the padlocking symbol in address bar. Clicking on SSL Certificate that is issued by thawte, a leading Internet security company.

It encrypts data – as soon as your computer has recognised our computer they encrypt all information that is passed between them. Data encryption means that no one else can read or change your information as it travels over the Internet.

It prevents scrambling – SSL uses a Message Authentication Code (MAC) to prevent anyone tampering with our Internet site. Your computer will always check this code before it takes a message from us. This means that if anyone tried to interfere with a message, your computer would not recognise the code and would alert you.

  6. ## Log In Security

We would like to remind you to keep any log in details and passwords you have secure at all times. Security details should only be entered on our secure website. We may use e-mail to direct you to a secure log in page on our Site or, where consent is given, to inform you of other products, but we will never ask you to reveal or send your security details to us via email.

Please be on your guard for suspicious e-mails. If you do receive an email asking you to submit account or security details (such as a credit card number, password or PIN number) or if you are suspicious in any way of any communication you are asked to provide over the internet in connection with Atlas please [contact us.](http://www2.atlaschoice.com/contact-us/)
