                Depending on the specific service or transaction, the City of 
                Atlanta may share personally identifiable information amongst 
                its agencies in order to provide such service or complete such

                <br>
                <strong>Personalization</strong><br>
                <br>
                You may choose or opt to voluntarily provide certain personally 
                identifiable information in order to customize your visits to 
                atlanta-airport.com. To personalize your experience, you may be 
                required to register and create an online profile. Information

                (which need not be your legal name), a password and a valid email

                personally identifiable information. You may review, delete or

                on atlanta-airport.com, or conduct most transactions, you are 
                not required to use the personalization features.<br>
                <br>
                <strong>Public Disclosure</strong><br>
                <br>
                We will not disclose any personally identifiable information collected 
                to entities outside of City of Atlanta departments and agencies 
                except where you have given us permission, or where the information 
                is public information under the Georgia Open Records Act O.C.G.A. 
                50-18-70 et seq., or other applicable laws. Visitors should be 
                aware that information collected through the portal may be subject 
                to examination and inspection, if such information is a public 
                record, or not otherwise protected from disclosure.<br>
                <br>
                <strong>Cookies</strong><br>
                <br>
                The atlanta-airport.com portal may occasionally use "cookies" 
                to customize your browsing experience. Cookies are simple text 
                files stored by your web browser and they provide a method of 
                distinguishing among visitors to the websites, and allowing customized 
                features such as a "shopping cart" feature for online 
                purchasing. Cookies created on your computer by using our websites 
                do not contain personally identifiable information and do not 
                compromise your privacy or security. You can refuse the cookie 
                or delete the cookie file from your computer at any time by using 
                any one of a number of widely available methods.<br>
                <br>
                <strong>Security</strong><br>
                <br>
                Several tools, policies and protocols are used to safeguard the 
                submission of information through the portal. Security measures 
                have been integrated into the design, implementation and day-to-day 
                operations of the entire operating environment as part of our 
                continuing commitment to the security of electronic content as 
                well as the electronic transmission of information.<br>
                <br>
                For services requiring online financial transactions, atlanta-airport.com 
                uses the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption protocol to safeguard 
                your sensitive personal information, including your credit card 
                number. Information is encrypted from your computer to the portal 
                computer processing your request.<br>
                In order to further secure your privacy, do not divulge any passwords 
                or sensitive information (e.g. credit card number) to anyone in 
                a phone call or email. When you are finished with those applications 
                that are password protected or required the input of your credit 
                card information, it is always recommended that you close or otherwise 
                exit the browser page.<br>
                <br>
                <strong>E-mail</strong><br>
                <br>
                E-mail is not a secure form of transmission. As such, atlanta-airport.com 
                does not recommend that you submit sensitive or personally identifiable 
                information via e-mail. If you choose to provide us with personal 
                information in an e-mail we may use the email and the information 
                contained within it to improve our service to you or to respond 
                to your request. Sometimes, we forward your email to other City 
                employees who may be better able to help you, and this staff may 
                be employed by a different agency within the City. Except for 
                authorized law enforcement investigations or as required by law, 
                we do not share our e-mail with any other organizations outside 
                of the public sector.<br>
                <br>
