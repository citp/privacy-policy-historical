## DEFINITIONS

"Atlassian's Services" include our products, services, plug-ins, mobile applications, downloadable software, and websites, including Atlassian.com, but not those created by third parties, even when they are accessed through Atlassian.com or available through the Atlassian Marketplace.

"Atlassian's Public Services" are Atlassian's Services provided over the public Internet and excludes Atlassian's Services installed on private infrastructure by our clients for their use only.

We consider "Personal Information" to include information that alone or when in combination with other information may be used to readily identify, contact, or locate you, such as: name, address, email address, or phone number. We do not consider Personal Information to include information that has been anonymized so that it does not allow a third party to easily identify a specific individual.

"Non-Personal Information" is all information other than Personal Information.

## INFORMATION WE COLLECT

**Personal Information Collection.** Atlassian's Services may collect Personal Information from you, including when you register to evaluate, subscribe or obtain a license to a product or service; purchase a product or service; participate in surveys, contests, or sweepstakes; submit bugs; or contact customer service. The categories of Personal Information Atlassian's Services may collect about you include: your name, email address, username, password, location, and billing and credit card information. Atlassian's Public Services may also collect Personal Information you post while using Atlassian's Services, including in free-text fields or during group chat sessions. You should avoid posting your Personal Information in public areas because that information may be viewable to users of Atlassian's Public Services and possibly the Internet.

**Non-Personal Information Collection.** Atlassian may collect Non-Personal Information as you use Atlassian's Services. When you use Atlassian's Public Services, Atlassian, third-party service providers (e.g. Google Analytics), and partners may receive and record Non-Personal Information from cookies, server logs, and similar technology from your browser or mobile device, including your IP address. Cookies are small text files that are placed in visitors' computer browsers to uniquely identify and store their preferences. Most browsers allow you to block and delete cookies. However, if you do that, Atlassian's Public Services may not work properly. Atlassian may also use persistent cookies to collect Non-Personal Information for marketing purposes as users browse the Internet. Third-party products to Atlassian's Services are not authorized by Atlassian to collect Personal Information through cookies or similar technologies without your permission.

We may combine some Non-Personal Information with the Personal Information we collect. Where we do so, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information if the resulting combination may be used to readily identify or locate you in the same manner as Personal Information alone.

By using Atlassian's Services, you are authorizing us to gather, parse, and retain data related to the provision and use of Atlassian's Services for our use as described in this Privacy Policy.

**Use of Atlassian Services with Third Party Plug-ins and Integrations.** If you choose to use Atlassian's Services in connection with third-party products and services, whether purchased through the Atlassian Marketplace or acquired elsewhere, Atlassian's Services may have access to information from such third party products or services. Atlassian Services may collect information through your access of the third-party products and services, such as your name, username, email address along with Non-Personal Information about your third party plug-in usage.

Atlassian's Services may also collect information as you use Google Apps. For example, if you choose to embed a Google document into Atlassian's Service, Atlassian may collect information, including the document title, authors, type, ID, and URL. Atlassian's Services collect only links to the content of Google Apps; they do not collect the actual content. For example, Atlassian's Services do not store the contents of email, calendar meetings, or documents from Google Apps.

## HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION

**Internal and Service-Related Usage.** We use Personal Information for internal and service-related purposes only. There are very limited circumstances in which we may provide it to third parties to allow us to facilitate Atlassian's Services. For example, a user may choose to purchase a third-party plug-in from Atlassian's Marketplace, which will permit data to be shared between Atlassian's Services and the plug-in vendor.

**To Improve Atlassian's Services.** We may use any information you provide to:

  * Provide customer support;
  * Track the types of questions we receive;
  * Analyze trends;
  * Personalize your experience; and
  * Otherwise operate and enhance Atlassian's Services.



**Communications.** We may send you a welcome email to verify your account and other transactional emails for operational purposes, such as billing, account management, or system maintenance. You may only stop those emails by terminating your account. We may also send you promotions, product announcements, surveys, newsletters, developer updates, product evaluations, and event information or other marketing or commercial e-mails. You can opt out of receiving these email communications from Atlassian at any time by unsubscribing using the unsubscribe link within each email, updating your e-mail preferences at my.atlassian.com or emailing us to have your contact information removed from our email list or registration database. Although opt-out requests are usually processed immediately, please allow ten (10) business days for a removal request to be processed.

**Marketing.** We do not rent, sell, or share Personal Information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies for marketing purposes (including direct marketing purposes) without your permission. We may use and share Non-Personal Information for our marketing purposes, including, without limitation, marketing on other websites. For example, we may use the information to control the number of times you have seen an ad, deliver ads tailored to your interests, and measure the effectiveness of ad campaigns. You can prevent us from tailoring our ads to you on other websites by deleting your cookies.

**Aggregate Data.** Atlassian may anonymize and aggregate data collected through Atlassian's Services and use it for any purpose, including for research and reporting usage. This anonymized aggregate information may be viewable to other users of Atlassian's Services.

**Vendors and Suppliers.** Atlassian's Services uses Personal Information for internal and service-related purposes only and may provide it to third parties to allow Atlassian to offer Atlassian's Services. For example, Atlassian may share billing and credit information with service providers for the purposes of processing credit card transactions.

**As Required By Law and Similar Disclosures.** We may access, preserve, and disclose your Personal Information, other account information, and content if we believe doing so is required by law or if those actions are reasonably necessary to:

We do not guarantee that any entity receiving such information in connection with one of these transactions will comply with all terms of this Privacy Policy.

**To Others Within Your Organization or with Your Permission.** After a person demonstrates proof that he belongs to a certain organization, we may disclose to that person the names of that organization's members who have evaluated or purchased our software. We may also disclose your Personal Information with your permission.

## SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION

We take steps to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Unfortunately, the Internet cannot be guaranteed to be 100% secure, and we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you provide to us. We do not accept liability for unintentional disclosure.
