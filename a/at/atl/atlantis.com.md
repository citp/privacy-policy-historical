INFORMATION WE COLLECT, HOW WE COLLECT IT AND ITS USES

Your personal information and non-personal information may be shared for any purpose among Kerzner International Resorts, Inc and with its affiliated companies and affiliated properties and service providers and contractors for limited purposes, including fulfilling customer reservations; offering certain products and services in connection with our Site; communicating to customers; providing customer service; enhancing and improving customers' online experience; enabling access to our partners' sites; providing a personalized online experience; and completing credit card transactions. Otherwise, except for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, we do not share your personal information with any other third parties unless we have your permission.   
When using our Site, you may be asked to voluntarily provide certain personal information. You can use our Site without creating an account, but you will need to create an account if you want to take advantage of certain features, such as "MyPlan" and other time saving features. Also, upon your registering at check-in we may request that you provide us certain information in our guest cards or similar registration materials. When you place a reservation or register at check-in, we request your name, email address, mailing address, phone number, credit card number and expiration date. We may also ask for personal information when you contact our reservations department or other customer service departments. This will allow us to assist you better and to protect your confidentiality by verifying your identity.

Your resort stay information is collected and stored by our resort locally, and subsequently transferred to a centralized database in the United States. This facilitates aggregated trend analysis used for resort management purposes such as planning new resort locations, evaluating resort amenities, guest preferences, and advertisement planning. In addition, your business with us is valued and we may use the record of your stay to send you via postal mail or email, communications such as guest surveys or promotional offers and benefits. You may “opt-out” or choose to be excluded from these communications by noting this on your guest registration during your resort stay or by contacting us as provided below in "How To Contact Us." 

Tracking Technology: As a part of our standard data collection process, we collect the e-mail addresses of those who communicate with us via e-mail. We may track your movement within the Site, the pages from which you were referred, access times and browser types. We only use this information in aggregate and do not link it to you personally. To gauge the effectiveness of our Site, we do collect some generic information about our visitors. Our web servers automatically recognize a visitor's domain name, the web page from which a visitor enters our Site, which pages a visitor visits on our Site, and how much time a visitor spends on each page and logs IP addresses. We may use anonymous tracking technologies to collect, store and sometimes track information for statistical purposes and to improve the services we provide. We aggregate this information and use it to evaluate and improve our Site. 

We store information that we collect through cookies, log files, clear gifs, and/or third party sources for instance to verify your address and update your information.

A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file Persistent cookies are used to differentiate subscribers from non-subscribers to customize the content of certain sections of the website and enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Site. If you reject cookies, you may still use our Site, but your ability to use some areas of our Site, such as promotions or surveys, may be limited. Some of our business partners may use cookies on our Site and we have no access to or control over these cookies. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by us only and does not cover the use of cookies by any such third parties.

We are currently using and have contracted with Omniture, a third party, to track and analyze non-personally identifiable usage and volume statistical information from our visitors and customers to administer our Site and constantly improve its quality. All data collected by Omniture on our behalf is owned and used by us. We reserve the right to publish non-personally identifiable, summary information regarding its Site visitors for promotional purposes and as a representative audience for advertisers.

Sweepstakes or Promotions: From time to time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in sweepstakes or other promotions on our Site or otherwise, which might be sponsored or conducted by a third party. If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you such as name, mailing address, zip code and age. Participation in these sweepstakes is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. We may transfer personal information to certain sponsors and ad partners that you have explicitly requested to receive information from.  It will be clear at the point of collection who is collecting the personal information and whose privacy statement will apply.

Some of our promotional offers have a feature that allows you to have the offer sent to a friend with your comment. If you choose to use this feature, we collect the email address of your friend(s) to facilitate the referral.

Surveys: We may from time to time provide a survey for our readers to fill out providing us with demographic information (such as income level and gender) to us.

Exceptional Circumstances: If Kerzner International Resorts, Inc., or any of its affiliated companies or properties, is sold or disposed of as a going concern, whether by merger, sale of assets or otherwise, the relevant customer database of Kerzner International Resorts, Inc. could, in whole or in part, be sold as part of that transaction. In the event Kerzner International Resorts, Inc. goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personal information will likely be among the assets transferred. We also may have to release personal information when it is necessary to comply with judicial or other government subpoenas, warrants, orders, to enforce our Terms and Conditions or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Kerzner International Resorts, Inc. or others.
