**ATLANTIC BROADBAND CUSTOMER PRIVACY POLICY**

**Protection of Subscriber Privacy**   
Atlantic Broadband considers the privacy of our subscribers to cable television service to be very important and we keep the non-public personal information about our subscribers secure and confidential. As a subscriber to our services, federal law entitles you to receive a notice from Atlantic Broadband at the time you subscribe and at least annually thereafter informing you of the type of information that we collect, how we use it, how we protect it and the limited cases where we may disclose some of that information. 

**Types of Information Atlantic Broadband Collects**   
Federal law permits a cable system operator to collect personally identifiable subscriber information: to provide cable or other services to you; to detect unauthorized reception of services, or in other cases with your prior written or electronic consent. Personally identifiable information necessary to provide services includes customer name, address, e-mail address, telephone numbers, Social Security Number, billing, service and credit records, bank account and credit card numbers used to pay for our services, customer correspondence, maintenance and complaint information, the services you subscribe to and use, the purchases you make over the system and the types and number of devices you use to connect to the system (e.g., televisions and computers). We may also collect additional personally identifiable information from third parties to enhance our customer database. We may maintain research records containing information obtained through voluntary subscriber interviews questionnaires or surveys. 

We collect personally identifiable information to provide you with accurate and high quality customer service, properly deliver your services and protect the security of the system . Additional information also allows us to tailor our cable and other services, as well as develop and market new services, to better fit your needs. 

**Disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information**   
Atlantic Broadband will only disclose personally identifiable information to others if: (a) you provide written or electronic consent in advance or (b) it is permitted under federal law. Specifically, federal law allows us to disclose personally identifiable information to third parties: when it is necessary to provide our services or to carry out our business activities related to the provision of services. People that have authorized access to your information include our employees, billing and collection services; installation, repair and subscriber assistance subcontractors or agents; program guide distributors; software vendors; network suppliers, program and other service suppliers for audit purposes; marketers of Atlantic Boradband's products and services; our attorneys and accountants; or affiliated legal entities. The frequency of disclosures varies according to business needs, and may involve access on a regular basis. 

If allowed by and after complying with federal law requirements, we may disclose personally identifiable information about you to representatives of government or to comply with a court order. Disclosures to representatives of government may be made pursuant to an administrative subpoena, warrant, court order, our reasonable discretion in cases of an emergency or serious physical injury, or other permitted means if allowed under the laws applicable to the services you subscribe to. If federal law permits, we will notify you of such disclosure. Certain personally identifiable information may also be disclosed to a government entity pursuant to the USA PATRIOT ACT of 2001. 

Unless you object, federal law also allows us to disclose certain specified personally identifiable information, (your name, address and the services to which you subscribe) to non-affiliated entities, including advertisers and marketing entities, for non-cable related purposes, including product advertisement, direct marketing and research. We will not provide information that directly or indirectly reveals the extent of any viewing or other use of a cable service or other service we provide. You may prohibit this disclosure to third parties by notifying us in writing at::

**Maintenance and Protection of Personally Identifiable Information**   
We will maintain personally identifiable information about you only as long as it is necessary for the purpose for which it was collected, to comply with laws governing our business, including tax and accounting laws, or to satisfy pending requests or orders for access by a subscriber to his/her information or pursuant to a court order. 

We use security/encryption technology to secure personally identifiable information collected over the system. We also maintain our customer database in a restricted area and secure the content by use of firewalls and other security methods. Atlantic Broadband limits access to databases containing subscribers' personally identifiable information to those specifically authorized employees and agents of Atlantic Broadband and other parties identified in the disclosure section above. 

**Your Rights**   
The personally identifiable information we have about you as a customer is maintained at our offices. Federal law entitles you to see this information. To schedule an appointment to see your personally identifiable information, please send us a written request at the address indicated above or to your business office listed on your monthly bill, and we will make an appointment for you to come in to our local office during regular business hours. If your review reveals an error in our records, we will correct it. 

If you believe that we have violated our limitations and responsibilities under federal law, you may also have the right to bring an action in Federal District Court. 

If you have any questions about our privacy protections and policies, please contact us during normal business hours or write us at the local system address. 

**Non-Personal Information.**   
Non-personal information, including aggregate information about our customers obtained from other sources, does not identify individual customers. We may combine this data with our business records as necessary to better serve our customers.
