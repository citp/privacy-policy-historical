# Privacy Policy

## Overview

Axon Enterprise (“Axon”) knows that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and Axon takes your privacy seriously. Axon created this Privacy Policy Statement (“Statement”) in order to demonstrate our commitment to your privacy. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy.

## Privacy Policy Coverage

This Statement covers Axon’s collection of personal information that Axon gathers when you are on Axon Enterprise websites. It does not apply to information collected and stored by a means other than these websites or practices of third parties that Axon does not own or control, or to individuals that Axon does not employ or manage. By accessing the Axon Enterprise websites, you are accepting the practices outlined in this Statement.

Access to information about customers collected from the Axon Enterprise websites is restricted to Axon and third parties that need access to customer information in order to provide Axon operational or other support services, Axon product information or product, service or upgrade offers, or as may be required by law. Axon does not distribute, sell or rent any personal information collected via its websites. This is also true for personal information (email address, postal address, etc.) sent to the websites’ email addresses. Axon does not send unsolicited emails to users of its sites. The transmission of personal information entered via the sites’ forms is protected by security features.

## Axon’s Personal Information Collection and Purpose

Axon’s primary goal in collecting information is to provide you with a friendly, customized, and efficient experience. Axon takes reasonable precautions to protect from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction of personal information. We collect the following types of information from our customers:

### (A) Information You Provide to Us

Axon collects identifying information when you use the Axon Enterprise websites, and when you enter promotions or contests. For example, we may require customers who register to use the Axon Enterprise websites to give us the following personal information: their name, Company name, address, phone number, and e-mail address, and financial qualification and billing information, such as billing name and address, credit card number, and the identity of users within the organization that will be using the Axon Enterprise websites. When you initially express interest in obtaining additional information about the Axon Enterprise websites, or when you register on the Axon Enterprise websites, we may also ask for additional types of personal information, such as title, department name, fax number, or additional company or agency information. We may also request demographic information and unique identifiers in order to provide you with a more personalized experience or verify your passwords. All financial and billing information that we collect from you is used for the purposes of checking your qualifications as a prospective customer and billing you for purchases. Axon may use a third-party intermediary to manage the credit card and billing processing. This intermediary is solely a link in the distribution chain, and is not permitted to store, retain, or use the information provided, except for the sole purpose of credit card and billing processing.

If you are a registered user of the Axon Enterprise websites, please note that some information about you may remain in our records.

### (B) Automatic Information

Axon receives and stores certain types of information whenever you interact with us via Axon Enterprise websites. Axon automatically receives and records certain "traffic data" on our server logs including your IP address, Axon cookie information, the page you requested, and your communications and interactions with other site users. Axon uses this traffic data to help diagnose problems with its server, analyze trends and administer the Axon Enterprise websites.

Axon automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our websites and use of components of our websites. Axon may use this information to provide research, advice and information, including, without limitation, for benchmarking purposes (e.g. we may publish an industry white paper that uses data collected through the use of our Axon Enterprise websites). This data is only used in the aggregate. This type of collective data also enables us to figure out how often customers use parts of the Axon Enterprise websites so we can make the websites appealing to as many customers as possible. In addition, we may provide statistical information to our partners about how our customers, collectively, use the Axon Enterprise websites. We may share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use areas of our Axon Enterprise websites, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal experience. We also collect and use information for internal purposes.

Many companies offer programs that help you to visit web sites anonymously. While Axon will not be able to provide you with a personalized experience if we cannot recognize you, we want you to be aware that these programs are available.

### (C) Email Communications

Axon may receive a confirmation when you open an e-mail from Axon if your computer supports this type of program, in order to help us make e-mails more interesting and helpful. Axon may also send out emails with information regarding Axon including promotions and events. Customers may opt out of receiving such emails by selecting the “unsubscribe” link in the Axon email.

## Information From Other Sources

For purposes such as improving personalization of the Axon Enterprise websites, Axon may receive information about you from other sources and add it to our account information.

## Google Analytics Demographic and Interest Reporting

Axon receives Demographic and Interest Reports from Google, which include aggregated, non-personally identifiable information about our website traffic regarding visitors’ age, gender, and interests.

## Google Adwords Remarketing

Axon has implemented Remarketing with Google Analytics to help personalize its advertising efforts online.
