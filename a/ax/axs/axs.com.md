## Information we collect and how it is used

### A. Non-Personally Identifiable Information.

We may collect and use non-PII in order to improve the functionality of our site, better target products and services to you, and in the course of general maintenance and administration of the Site. Non-PII information is anonymous and cannot be used to identify you.

Examples of Non-PII we collect include:

#### Cookies. 

As with many websites, the Site uses standard technology called "cookies," which are small data files that are transferred to your computer when you allow your browser to accept cookies. Cookies automatically identify your Web browser to the Site whenever you visit the Site, and make using the Site easier for you by saving your preferences and recent activities. By tracking how and when you use the Site, cookies help us determine which areas are popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates to the Site are based on data obtained from cookies. Accepting cookies allows you, among other things, to personalize your experience on the Site. Cookies may also allow the Site to present to you advertising which may be of interest to you. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, you generally can opt out of providing this information by turning the cookies off in your browser; however, some areas of the Site may not provide you with a personalized experience if you have disabled the use of cookies.

**Third Party Cookies**  
The use of cookies by our [partners, affiliates, tracking utility company, service providers] is not covered by our privacy statement. We do not have access or control over these cookies. Our [partners, affiliates, tracking utility company, service providers] use session ID cookies [to make it easier for you to navigate our site, in order for you to use the shopping cart, etc.] 

**Web beacons**  
Our Web pages contain electronic images known as Web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel gifs) and are used along with cookies to compile aggregated statistics to analyze how our site is used and may be used in some of our emails to let us know which emails and links have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our customer communications and marketing campaigns.

#### IP Addresses and Click-stream Data. 

We may collect IP addresses and/or click-stream data for purposes of system administration, to improve our Site, to report aggregate information to our advertisers and sponsors and/or other internal uses related to the Site. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you access the Internet. Our computers identify your computer by its IP address. When you request Web pages from the Site, our computers log your IP address. Click-stream data is information collected by our computers when you request Web pages from the Site. Click-stream data may include such information as the page served, the time, the source of the request, the type of browser making the request, the preceding page view and other such non-personal information. When analyzed, this data helps us analyze how visitors arrive at the Site, what type of content is most popular, what type of visitors in the aggregate are interested in particular kinds of content and advertising, and the like.

### B. Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

The personally-identifiable information we collect is used to facilitate delivery of tickets and /or other products and/or services to our customers. In the process of providing these tickets, products and/or services, we require our customers to provide certain personally-identifiable information.

We take the security of your personal information very seriously, and follow all applicable laws regarding its security. PII may include, but is not limited to the following:

#### i. Registration information

You may be asked to complete a registration form and provide personally-identifiable information; you may also be asked to choose a user ID and password in order to take advantage of certain features the Site may choose to offer, including, but not limited to, Newsletters, Contests, Notifications, and Social Networking tools. Registration information may include your name, physical address, email address, telephone number(s), and/or credit card information. If you register with the Site, your information and information related to purchases you make on any of our Sites will be aggregated and maintained as part of your profile and may be accessed or used by us.

Unless you opt out, we may use your PII to send you information about AEG and its services as well as promotional material on behalf of some of our partners. If at any time you change your mind and prefer to no longer receive such marketing communications from us, please see the "Opt-Out Policy" section below.

#### ii. Social Networking information

We may ask you to share information about you stored on social networks and other third-party services in order to personalize your experience on the Site. This information may include your username or id, email address, interests, activities, and relationships to other users of the Site. 

#### iii. Contact information for email newsletters, site emails and/or Mobile Offers

We may offer newsletters and/or other communications to share information with you about the Site, about us and our affiliates and subsidiaries, or about our business partners and advertisers and sponsors. You may receive a newsletter either by registering for a particular newsletter or in conjunction with a special feature or membership for which you have registered on the Site.

You may change your opt-in settings by following the instructions provided on the Site or in the designated area of the newsletters or emails or as specified in a mobile communication. For more information refer to the Opt-Out policy section below. Remember, if you consent to receive texts from us, your wireless carrier may impose a charge on incoming texts. Please check with your wireless carrier for details.

#### iv. Entry information for Contests or Sweepstakes ("Offers")

We may operate contests, sweepstakes, collectively "Offers", throughout the Site and other AEG properties, such as our Facebook page, which may require registration in order to enter. The personally-identifiable information that may be collected in an entry or similar form includes, but may not be limited to, Customer's first name, last name, zip code, phone number and email address. Your entry in the contest or sweepstakes may also result in your being added to our mailing/texting lists as well as those of our promotional partners associated with the contest or sweepstakes.

Winners of contests, drawings, sweepstakes, and/or promotions will be required to provide additional personally-identifiable information such as a shipping address and telephone number. Acceptance of a prize may also require you (unless prohibited by law) to allow us to post publicly some of your information on the Site, such as on a winner's page, in the event you win a contest or sweepstakes. Your personally-identifiable information may be used by us to contact you for winner notification, prize delivery confirmation or other promotional purposes.

If the privacy policy varies for a particular sweepstakes, promotion or feature, that information will be disclosed in the sweepstakes or promotion rules or feature's terms of use. In some instances, a third party advertiser or sponsor may operate or host a contest or sweepstakes on the Site, and collect your information; that company is prohibited from using our users' personally-identifiable information for any other purpose. In those cases, where we are not the Sponsor of the contest or sweepstakes, we may have no control over the information collected and accordingly urge you to review the official rules of the contest/sweepstakes as well as the advertiser's or sponsor's privacy policy applicable to the contest or sweepstakes before participating.

In the event that the Official Rules of an Offer conflict with this Privacy Policy, the Official Rules will govern that particular Offer.

#### v. Information collected for Surveys or Voting

From time-to-time we may request personally-identifiable information from you via surveys or voting polls. Most surveys will be anonymous and not request your personally identifiable information. However, at times, you may have to register to vote or to take part in a survey. All survey participation is, of course, voluntary, and you will be able to decide the information you provide.

#### vi. Information required to process transactions  


If you place an order or subscribe for any of the services offered on our Site, we will ask you to complete an order form that will request certain information from you. The personally-identifiable information that may be collected from our customers in completion of a ticket, product and/or service purchase, includes, but may not be limited to: Customer's first and last name, first and last name of the credit card owner, credit card billing address, credit card number, credit card security code, credit card expiration date, customer's shipping address, phone number, and email address. You may also have the opportunity to permit us to maintain this information in a personal profile for you so you do not have to re-enter the information each time you make a purchase. We will use this information only to complete the transaction that you have requested, e.g., to deliver the information, products or other services that you order, and to invoice you. Such information is collected and stored through encrypted means for your protection. Refer to the Security section for more details on how we protect this sensitive information.

#### vii. Information used for Internal Business Purposes.

We may also use your PII for our internal business purposes, such as to target advertising, for data analysis, for audits, for fraud prevention and for other internal purposes.

#### viii. Information collected for "Send to a Friend" messages.

The Site may allow you to send information on the site via email, social network, or other messaging system to recipients who you feel may be interested in receiving such information. To use this feature you provide us with certain information about the receiving party. Any PII you provide in connection with sending such other party the message, such as your name and your email address will, of course, be disclosed to such other party. While, due to technical restrictions, the recipient's information may be retained in our systems as required for delivery and logging, we do not knowingly share it with third parties and we do not use this PII for any purpose except to send this one-time message (unless the recipient has already consented to such use of his/her PII). Recipients of these messages will not be opted in to any future communications from AEG unless they have previously given their consent by using this Site, and as such in accordance with their privacy and Opt-Out choices.

#### ix. Information provided to customer support.

To facilitate our ability to provide you with timely and accurate customer support services, we may ask you for personally identifiable information, such as name, email address, and phone number so that we may be able to respond to your request quickly and identify your customer records in our database so as to identify and resolve your particular issue.

#### xi. Data Retention.

We will retain your information for as long as your account is active, as needed to provide you services and will use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

#### xii. Chat Rooms, Forums, and Message Boards

The Site may make chat rooms, forums and message boards available to its users. You are not required to provide any personal information when using these areas but you may choose to do so. We strongly recommend that you DO NOT use your personal information as your user name and DO NOT post any personally-identifiable information on line, since such information will be publicly available. We cannot ensure the security of any information you choose to make public in a chat room, forum, or message board. Also, we cannot ensure that parties who have access to such publicly available information will respect your privacy. Please exercise caution when deciding to disclose personal information in these areas.

#### xiii. Pre-populating forms with PII

To facilitate some transactions, including but not limited to activities on the Site such as registration, ticket purchase, contest entry, and "Send to a Friend" we may pre-populate form fields with your PII in order to minimize data entry. You may, in all cases and at your discretion, review and edit your PII as it is displayed before submitting the form or transaction. Furthermore, we encourage you to review your PII wherever it is displayed for accuracy, and make corrections as necessary.   
In some cases, we may pre-populate forms with your PII in the course of an Offer or transaction with one of our Partners. In the case where there is an AEG partner who may receive your information, we encourage you to review the Privacy Policy of the partner entity to familiarize yourself with their practices governing the security of your PII. For more information, please refer to the section regarding Data Collection by Third-Parties.

## Information we collect and how we use it

We may collect two types of information about you during your use of this Site, affiliated sites and applications: personally identifiable information (PII), such as your name, contact information and financial information, as well as non-personally identifiable information, such as browsing patterns, geographic location and demographics which does not reveal your specific identity.

### A. Non-Personally Identifiable Information

We may collect and use non-PII in order to improve the functionality of our site, better target products and services to you, and in the course of general maintenance and administration of the Site. Non-PII information is anonymous and cannot be used to identify you.

Examples of Non-PII we collect include:

#### Cookies

As with many websites, the Site uses standard technology called "cookies," which are small data files that are transferred to your computer when you allow your browser to accept cookies. Please see our Cookie Policy for further details of the cookies which we use and how to disable them should you wish. 

#### Web beacons

#### 

Our Web pages contain electronic images known as Web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel gifs) and are used along with cookies to compile aggregated statistics to analyse how our site is used and may be used in some of our emails to let us know which emails and links have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our customer communications and marketing campaigns.

### B. Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

The personally-identifiable information we collect is used to facilitate delivery of tickets and /or other products and/or services to our customers. In the process of providing these tickets, products and/or services, we require our customers to provide certain personally-identifiable information.

We take the security of your personal information very seriously, and follow all applicable laws regarding its security. We collect and use PII in the following ways:

#### i. Registration information

When you sign up for an AXS.com account (an "Account") you will be asked to complete a registration form and to provide personally-identifiable information; you may also be asked to choose a user ID and password. Registration information may include your name, physical address, email address, telephone number(s), and/or credit card information. If you register with the Site, your information and information related to purchases you make on any of our Sites will be aggregated and maintained as part of your profile and may be accessed or used by us.

Unless you opt out, we may use the PII we collect when you register for an Account to send you personalised marketing communications which may include, without limitation, event announcements, updates, reviews and special offers about AXS and its services as well as promotional material on behalf of some of our Partners. If at any time you change your mind and prefer no longer to receive such marketing communications from us, you may "opt-out" in accordance with the "Opt-Out Policy" section below.

#### ii. Social networking information

We may ask you to share information about you stored on social networks and other third-party services in order to personalise your experience on the Site. This information may include your username or id, email address, interests, activities, and relationships to other users of the Site. You may choose not to provide this information. 

#### iii. Contact information for email newsletters, site emails and/or mobile Offers

With your consent, we may send you newsletters and/or other marketing communications to share information with you about the Site, about us or about our Partners and advertisers and sponsors. Subject to providing your consent and unless you opt out, you may receive a newsletter from AXS either by purchasing a ticket, registering for a particular newsletter, registering for an Account or in conjunction with a special feature or membership for which you have registered on the Site. 

You may change your opt-in settings by following the instructions provided on the Site or in the designated area of the newsletters or emails or as specified in a mobile communication. For more information refer to the Opt-Out policy section below. Remember, if you consent to receive texts from us, your mobile network provider may impose a charge on incoming texts. Please check with your mobile network provider for details.

#### iv. Entry information for contests or sweepstakes ("Offers")

We may operate Offers throughout the Site and other AEG Group properties, such as our Facebook page, which may require registration in order to enter. The personally-identifiable information that may be collected in an entry or similar form includes, but may not be limited to, Customer's first name, last name, post code, phone number, age and email address. Where applicable and indicated to you, your entry in the contest or sweepstakes may also result in your being added to our mailing/texting lists as well as those of our promotional partners associated with the contest or sweepstakes.

Winners of contests, drawings, sweepstakes, and/or promotions will be required to provide additional personally-identifiable information such as a shipping address and telephone number. Acceptance of a prize may also require you (unless prohibited by law) to allow us to post publicly some of your information on the Site, such as on a winner's page, in the event you win a contest or sweepstakes. Your personally-identifiable information may be used by us to contact you for winner notification, prize delivery confirmation or other promotional purposes.

If the privacy policy varies for a particular sweepstakes, promotion or feature, that information will be disclosed in the sweepstakes or promotion rules or featureís terms of use. In some instances, a third party advertiser or sponsor may operate or host a contest or sweepstakes on the Site, and collect your information should you enter such contest or sweepstake; that company is prohibited from using our usersí personally-identifiable information for any other purpose without their consent. In those cases, where we are not the operator or sponsor of the contest or sweepstakes, we may have no control over the information collected and accordingly urge you to review the official rules of the contest/sweepstakes as well as the advertiser's or sponsor's privacy policy applicable to the contest or sweepstakes before participating.

In the event that the Official Rules of an Offer conflict with this Privacy Policy, the Official Rules will govern that particular Offer.

#### v. Information collected for surveys or voting

From time-to-time we may request personally-identifiable information from you via surveys or voting polls. Most surveys will be anonymous and not request your personally identifiable information. However, at times, you may have to register to vote or to take part in a survey. All survey participation is, of course, voluntary, and you will be able to decide the information you provide.

#### vi. Information required to process transactions (including financial information)  


If you place an order or subscribe for any of the goods and/or services offered on our Site, we will ask you to complete an order form that will request certain information from you. The personally-identifiable information that may be collected from our customers in completion of a ticket, product and/or service purchase, includes, but may not be limited to: Customer's first and last name, first and last name of the credit card owner, credit card billing address, credit card number, credit card security code, credit card expiration date, customer's shipping address, phone number, and email address. You may also have the opportunity to permit us to maintain this information in a personal profile for you so you do not have to re-enter the information each time you make a purchase. Such information is collected and stored through encrypted means for your protection. Refer to the Information Security Practices section for more details on how we protect this sensitive information.

We will use your PII including your financial information to complete the transaction that you have requested, e.g., to deliver the information, products or other services that you order, and to invoice you. We may also use your payment information to allow us to ship or deliver tickets and/or receipts to you, respond to customer service requests, review and enforce limits on the number of tickets purchased per event and to help prevent credit card fraud.

In addition, unless you have opted out, we will use your contact details obtained during the transaction process in order to send you personalised marketing communications. 

If you'd prefer not to give us any personally identifiable information when you purchase tickets for events, then please visit the Box Office at the venue where an event is taking place.

#### vii. Information used for internal business purposes.

We may also use your PII for our internal business purposes, such as to target advertising, for data analysis, for audits, for fraud prevention and for other internal purposes.

#### viii. Information collected for "Send to a Friend" messages.

The Site may allow you to send information on the Site via email, social network, or other messaging system to recipients who you feel may be interested in receiving such information. To use this feature you provide us with certain information about the receiving party and by doing so you warrant that you have their consent to do so. Any PII you provide in connection with sending such other party the message, such as your name and your email address will, of course, be disclosed to such other party. While, due to technical restrictions, the recipient's information may be retained in our systems as required for delivery and logging, we do not share it with third parties and we do not use this PII for any purpose except to send this one-time message (unless the recipient has already consented to such use of his/her PII). Recipients of these messages will not be opted in to any future communications from AXS and/or the AEG Group and/or Ticket Suppliers unless they have previously given their consent by using this Site, and as such in accordance with their privacy and Opt-Out choices.

#### ix. Information provided to customer support.

To facilitate our ability to provide you with timely and accurate customer support services, we may ask you for personally identifiable information, such as name, email address, and phone number so that we may be able to respond to your request quickly and identify your customer records in our database so as to identify and resolve your particular issue. Information collected during customer support activities may be stored in our logs to provide us with heuristic information to monitor and improve our customer support capabilities, but will not be shared with third-parties or used for marketing purposes by AXS and/or the AEG Group.

#### xi. Data retention.

We will retain your information for as long as your Account is active, as needed to provide you services and will use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

#### xii. Chat rooms, forums, and message boards

The Site may make chat rooms, forums and message boards available to its users. You are not required to provide any personally-identifiable information when using these areas but you may choose to do so. We strongly recommend that you DO NOT use your personal information as your user name and DO NOT post any personally-identifiable information on line, since such information will be publicly available. We cannot ensure the security of any information you choose to make public in a chat room, forum, or message board. Also, we cannot ensure that parties who have access to such publicly available information will respect your privacy. Please exercise caution when deciding to disclose personal information in these areas.

#### xiii. Pre-populating forms with PII

To facilitate some transactions, including but not limited to activities on the Site such as registration, ticket purchase, contest entry, and "Send to a Friend" we may pre-populate form fields with your PII in order to minimize data entry. You may, in all cases and at your discretion, review and edit your PII as it is displayed before submitting the form or transaction. Furthermore, we encourage you to review your PII wherever it is displayed for accuracy, and make corrections as necessary.

In some cases, we may pre-populate forms with your PII in the course of an Offer or transaction with one of our Partners, however, we will not share your data with our Partners unless you have given us your consent to do so. In the case where there is a Partner who may receive your information where you have given us your consent to share it, we encourage you to review the Privacy Policy of the Partner entity to familiarise yourself with their practices governing the security of your PII. For more information, please refer to the section "With whom the information may be shared" and "Information collection by third-parties.

## II. With whom the information may be shared.

The PII we collect from you may be transferred to certain parties, depending upon the purpose for which the information was provided, the consents which you give at the time the information is provided and the context in which the information was provided, as described in the following sections. We reserve the right to share Non-PII, which does not personally identify you, with third parties, for any purpose. For example, we may share information with advertisers or other third parties that are not part of the AEG Group on an aggregate or other basis that does not disclose any of your PII.

### A. Within the AEG group

Where we have your consent to do so, which is obtained at the time you create an Account or sign up for our weekly event calendar email and certain other newsletters as notified to you at the time, we may share your PII within the AEG Group, which includes, without limitation, AEG Live and The O2. The data will be shared in order to enhance your experience on other AEG websites and for the AEG Group to contact you with personalised marketing communications, including, without limitation, personalised event announcements, updates and reviews. To the extent we share your data within the AEG Group, we make sure that your PII receives the same level of protection throughout the AEG Group. All AEG Group companies comply with applicable privacy and security laws and, at a minimum, in any commercial e-mail they send to you, will give you the opportunity to choose not to receive such e-mail messages in the future. Please note that such sharing may involve the collection use, storage, or disclosure of PII within Europe and the United States of America. PII will only be processed within the United States of America by corporations which comply with the U.S. ñ E.U. Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce.

### B. AXS Ticket Suppliers

Unless you opt-out of such communications, when you purchase a ticket to a specific event on our Site, your first name, last name, physical address, phone number and email address may be provided to the person or entity which supplies the tickets to AXS and on whose behalf we sell tickets which may include, without limitation, venues, promoters, producers, artists, teams and record labels (the "Ticket Supplier"). There may be more than one Ticket Supplier per event. 

### C. AXS service providers

By providing your Payment Information, you are authorizing us to give that information to third parties as necessary to confirm and fulfill your order (for example, to process your credit card or payment account number and to send you products you have ordered and to exchange information with other companies and organisations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction). When we do so, we apply payment industry standard encryption methods to maintain its security and use reasonable efforts to assure that they comply with our Privacy Policy and applicable law.

We will share your PII with our service providers in order to fulfill your order. Outbox Enterprises UK Limited process transactions on behalf of Axs and your PII will be used and stored by them in either Europe and/or Canada and/or the United States in order to fulfill your order. Where we use a third party supplier to carry out specific business operations (e.g. a Customer Relations Management system, a market research company, a courier) we will share your PII with them for that purpose.

If you've ordered any additional goods or services through our Site such as ticket insurance or merchandise for an event, your information may be passed to the providers of such goods or services so they can process your transaction and provide you with the goods or services you've ordered.

Except as explained above, we will not share your financial information with any third parties without your prior consent.

### D. Other Uses

In the event that we go through an existing or potential business transition, such as a merger, acquisition, liquidation or sale of all or a portion of our assets, customer information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred.

Finally, we may, without your consent, access and disclose your personal information, any communications sent or received by you, and any other information that we may have about you as may be permitted or required by law, regulation, rule or court order pursuant to requests from governmental, regulatory or administrative agencies or law enforcement authorities; or to prevent, investigate, identify persons or organisations potentially involved in, or take any action regarding suspected fraud, violations of our Terms of Use and/or Additional Purchase Terms and Conditions, or activity that appears to us to be illegal or we believe may expose us to legal liability. Additionally, we may disclose personal information in situations that we believe to be emergencies involving potential threats to the physical safety or any person or property if we believe that your information in any way relates to that threat.

Any PII that you provide when signing up at any co-branded page may be collected by, or shared with, our Partner. We have no control over, and are not responsible for, our Partners' use of your PII. If you want to learn more about other entities' privacy practices, please review the websites of those third parties.

#### B. Transactions with e-commerce Partners, vendors and advertisers. 

This Site may offer merchandise, ticket purchase services, or advertising for products offered by one of our Partners.
