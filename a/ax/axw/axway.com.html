		<big>Information Collected and How It's Used</big><br>
		<br>
		<b>Your IP Address</b><br>
		An IP (Internet Protocol) address is automatically assigned to your computer every time you establish a connection on the Internet. Axway uses your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our web site. Axway does not link your IP address to any identifiable personal information. Your IP address is used to help identify you and to gather broad demographic information.<br>
		<br>
		<b>Cookies</b><br>
		In computer language, a cookie is used to store data on your computer's hard drive. We use cookies to store your e-mail ID or a unique identifier on your computer so that you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit Axway. We never use cookies to capture or contain personal information from your computer. The only personal information Axway has is what you give to us.<br>
		<br>
		<b>Your Account</b><br>
		When establishing an account with Axway, or requesting information from a Axway web site, you will be asked to submit a request with your contact information address. We may also ask you to provide us some technical, commercial or other interest-based information. Providing such information is optional, however, the more we know about you the better we can provide the products and services you want most and service your business needs.<br>
		<br>
		We use your customer contact information to respond to your e-mail requests and to reach you if we need additional information to complete your product request. Any financial information collected is used only for billing products and services you purchase at Axway. We may also contact you about promotional or upcoming events, or to take part in on-line focus groups or surveys. You may opt-out of these mailings as outlined below in the choice/opt-out section.<br>
		<br>
		<b>Additional Information Collected</b><br>
		When you make a purchase at Axway you will be asked to supply your name, address, general business and credit card information. For your protection Axway does not currently retain or store credit card information; if Axway changes this policy in the future it will provide advance notice on this policy page. Axway will store and use other information provided by you to fill your order. If necessary, we may use this information to reach you if we need additional information to complete your order.<br>
		<br>
		Any personal correspondence you send to us, including e-mail and letters, as well as correspondence from other customers or third parties about your activities or postings pertaining to Axway, and all entries made by you onto our site may be collected and stored. Any notes, ideas, suggestions, or other material submitted by guests will be treated as the property of Axway.<br>
		<br>
		Axway may run contests where we ask guests for contact information such as e-mail or physical addresses. We use contact data from our contests to send guests information about Axway, as well as promotional material from some of our partners. You may opt-out of receiving future mailings as outlined below.<br>
		<br>
		<b>Expunging Your Information From Our Records</b><br>
		To discontinue any email solicitation go to <a href="/unsubscribe">www.axway.com/unsubscribe</a>. Please send an email <a href="mailto:webmaster@us.axway.com">webmaster@us.axway.com</a>, or use one of the alternate contact methods listed below to remove your contact information from our database provided we have completed all your pending transactions. Please note, however, that information is never completely removed from our history and disaster recovery archives. We also need to retain sale information for tax records.<br>
		<br>
		<big>Disclosure of Information to Third Parties</big><br>
		<br>
		<b>Personal Information</b><br>
		Axway defines personal information as your name, e-mail address, mailing address, method of payment, and any other information that identifies you.<br>
		<br>
		Axway, our suppliers and shippers use your personal information to process and ship your orders. Axway does not sell, trade, rent, or release your personal information to third parties. If we were to ever do so, you will have the opportunity to opt-out beforehand.<br>
		<br>
		<b>Transactional Information</b><br>
		Axway transactional information such as traffic patterns, sales, aggregate data regarding general shopping patterns, and other site information may be shared with vendors and other reputable third parties. This data will never contain any identifiable personal information of Axway guests. For example, we might share statistics on how many customers purchased a specific product, but we will not specifically disclose who purchased the product.<br>
		<br>
		<b>Legal Issues</b><br>
		Axway discloses personal information when required by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary for the following:<br>
		<ul>
		<li>To conform to the edict of the law or comply with a legal process served on Axway or its web site. 
		</li><li>To protect and defend the property rights of Axway, the Axway web site, or that of Axway guests. 
		</li><li>Or to act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of Axway guests, employees, or the general public.
		</li></ul>
		<b>Other Sites' Policies</b><br>
		Axway has no control over, nor does it bear any of the responsibility for the privacy policies and/or content of any sites or advertisers linked to or on our site. Axway also takes no responsibility for the cookies these sites or advertisers might deposit on your hard drive.<br>
		<br>
		<big>Public Terms</big><br>
		<br>
		Axway's web sites may make chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups available to our users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose any personal or sensitive information.<br>
		<br>
		<big>Safety and Security</big><br>
		<br>
		<b>Credit Card Security</b><br>
		Axway protects such personal information as your name, address, and credit card number by transferring it over a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) line. This protocol ensures your information is encrypted and cannot be read by others as it travels over the Internet. The secure mode begins as soon as you initiate your order. You should see a locked padlock icon at the bottom of your browser window to indicate you are on a Secure Socket Layer Line. You can also verify you are in secure mode by looking at the URL window in your browser. When accessing a secure server, the first characters of the site address will change from "http" to "https."<br>
		<br>
		For your protection Axway does not currently retain or store credit card information; if Axway changes this policy in the future it will provide advance notice on this policy page. After Axway receives other data from you, it is stored on a secure server behind a firewall and cannot be accessed from outside the company. The Axway employees who process your order are the only people with access to your personal information. All Axway employees sign a privacy/security policy agreement, which provides legal confidentiality protections for all Axway guests. Any violation of this policy results in disciplinary action, including possible termination, criminal prosecution, and civil action.<br>
