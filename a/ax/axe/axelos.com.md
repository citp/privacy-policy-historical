### Why does AXELOS collect personal information?

AXELOS collects information for the some or all of following reasons:

  * To provide services to you after you have taken one of our educational certifications/qualifications including validation of your certification/qualification by us
  * To provide information about products or services you have shown interest in purchasing within a reasonable time afterwards, if you are already an existing AXELOS customer
  * To provide information to you about products or services you have purchased from us, or related products or services
  * To employ you or consider you for employment
  * To provide goods or services to you under contract
  * For legal reasons, for example, if you have entered into a contract with us
  * To provide information to you about our products and services if you have consented to receive it.



### What legal basis does AXELOS have for processing my information?

AXELOS may process your information because:

  * We have a contract with you
  * You have given us permission to do so
  * We must provide services to you after you have purchased something from us
  * We must provide services to you because you have taken one of our qualifications
  * To comply with the law.



All of these reasons are reasons AXELOS may legally process the information we have about you.

### Who might AXELOS share your information with?

AXELOS may share your personal information with third parties, either because you have consented to allow us to do so or for legal reasons. For example, we may share your personal information with:

  * Our examination institute (PeopleCert) to provide pre-examination, examination and post-examination services
  * The training organization who provided training to you before you took an examination, for example, if you have a complaint or need assistance from them
  * Our group companies, which means our subsidiaries, or our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries, as defined in section 1159 of the UK Companies Act 2006
  * Subcontractors and third parties for the purpose of the performance of a contract that we hold with them or that we hold with you
  * With third parties because you have given consent
  * With third parties who provide shipping or publishing services because you have purchased goods or services
  * On our Successful Candidate Register if you have consented.



**Other reasons AXELOS may share your personal information with a third party**

If AXELOS Limited or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, personal data held by AXELOS about its customers will be one of the transferred assets of the company.

In addition, AXELOS will share your personal data with third parties for the following reasons:

  * If AXELOS must comply with a legal obligation
  * To enforce or apply our Website Terms of Use, Terms and Conditions of Sale, or other agreements
  * To protect the rights, property, or safety of AXELOS Limited, our customers or others
  * We will exchange information with other companies or organizations to prevent fraud or to reduce our credit risks.



**Aggregated or anonymized data with personal information removed**

AXELOS may, from time to time, provide third parties with data that has been aggregated or anonymized.

This means that your personal information that could be used to identify you have been removed from the data. Data provided to third parties in this way is not personal data; however, you do keep your right to object.

### Where we store your personal data

We primarily store and process your personal data in the EU/European Economic Area (“ **EEA** ”). If we do transfer your personal data outside the EEA it will be because you have consented or because we have a legal reason to do so.

Some examples of reasons your data may be processed outside of the EEA include:

  * Order fulfilment
  * Payment processing
  * Technical support services.



If your personal data cannot be processed within the EEA, we will:

  * Comply with all other data protection principles
  * Where possible, be to a country that is on the list of the EU Commissions’ countries that provide adequate protections for the rights and freedoms of data subjects
  * If the transfer is to the United States of America, we will use reasonable endeavours to make sure they participate in the Privacy Shield program
  * Make sure we have assessed the adequacy of protections in all other cases.



**Access to your stored personal data via password**

Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.

**Transmission and storage of your personal data**

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we use best practice to ensure your data is encrypted to the standard required in the GDPR to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data as it is transmitted and stored.

### How long will you keep my personal information?

AXELOS will not retain your personal information for longer than required.

We will keep your personal information:

  * For as long as required by law
  * Until we no longer have a valid reason for keeping it
  * Until you request us to stop using it.



We may keep just enough of your personal information to ensure that we comply with your requests not to use your personal information or comply with your right to erasure. For example, we must keep your request to be erased even if it includes your personal data until such time as you are no longer our customer.

If you have questions about our Data Retention Policy, please contact: [dpo@axelos.com](mailto:dpo@axelos.com).

### What if I chose not to give you my personal information?

If the personal information is necessary in order to supply goods or services to you under a contract between you and AXELOS, then we will not enter into that contract or provide the services or goods if you do not give us your personal information.
