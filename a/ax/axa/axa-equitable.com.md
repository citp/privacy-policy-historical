## Security Of Information Transmissions

Information you provide to us when filling out forms or requests for information on our websites, as well as information we supply when you are visiting those areas, is protected while passing through the Internet using encryption technology called Secure Sockets Layer or SSL. Your browser will indicate when you are within a secure area of our websites by displaying a symbol, such as a locked padlock or an unbroken key. Encryption technology scrambles transmissions so it is incomprehensible to third parties. Although we will use all reasonable efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your information, Internet transmissions cannot be made absolutely secure. We will not be liable for the unintended disclosure of information due to errors in transmission or unauthorized acts of or breaches of security by third parties. Please note that regular Internet e-mail is not secure. To protect your privacy, please do not use e-mail to communicate information that you want kept confidential. You can, of course, always contact us by telephone or mail as described below.

## Links

Our websites can be reached by hypertext links ("hyperlinks") from websites ("third party sites") that are not owned or controlled by us. It may also be possible to use hyperlinks to reach third party sites from our websites. Third party sites may have privacy policies controlling the collection and use of personal information about you that are different from our privacy policy. A link to or from a third party site is not an endorsement by us of the site, its content, its privacy practices or its sponsoring organization, and we cannot be responsible for the practices, content or accuracy of third party sites.

## Third Parties

We may engage with third parties to facilitate your sharing of content from our web sites with others and to provide us with certain analytical services to better understand our visitors, who may use cookies, web beacons and similar mechanisms to collect information when you click on or move your cursor over their buttons. We may have access to this information to permit us to identify other websites that you have visited that are also associated with that third party. In doing so, however, these third parties do not collect personal information (unless you explicitly provide it to them), and we do not give any personally identifiable information to them. These third parties may collect certain non-personally identifiable information such as what web site a visitor came from, your IP address, and what type of browser you are using. We do not control the dissemination of these third party cookies, web beacons and similar mechanisms, and you should check the relevant third party websites for more information and whether and how you may opt out of receiving them.
