confidentiality and security of the personal information we collect.</p>
<h3>Safeguarding Your Personal Information</h3>
<p>If you are a client one of our companies, you have already received a copy of our Privacy Policy. We will protect the confidentiality of all personal information about you in our possession, including any personal information you may provide us through this Website, in accordance with our <a title="Privacy Policy" href="/axa/Privacy-Policy-August-2008.pdf">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
<p>If you are not an AXA Equitable client and are accessing our website to learn more about our companies and the products and services we offer, please be assured that we will also protect the confidentiality of any personal information we may acquire about you. We will not sell or rent information about you to anyone. However, we may disclose personal information to our affiliates, third party service providers or as otherwise required or permitted by law.</p>
<h3>Information We Collect from Our Website</h3>


We may collect two types of information from our Website: information you enter into our Website when you request information from us on Website and tracking information that tells us how you use our Website. Any information you enter into our website will be treated as personal information. Personal information may include your name, address, telephone number and e-mail address as well as information about your investments, your investment goals and your tolerance for risk. We may also collect information about how you use our Website. We may obtain this information by tracking when you use our Website, which pages you view at which times and similar data through our Web server software and "cookies, web beacons and clear GIFs or tracking pixels". 

<p align="right"><a href="#top">top</a></p>
<p><strong>Our Use of Cookies, Web Beacons and Clear GIF or Tracking Pixels</strong></p>
<p>A cookie is a small data file that a Website can send to the browser on your computer when you link to that Website. It is not a computer program. A cookie does not extract personal information about you, such as your name and address, from your computer. It does not read data on your hard drive or instruct your computer to perform any function. A cookie sent to your browser from our Website can be used by our Website to recognize your computer whenever you subsequently log onto our Website. We also use cookies to track your usage patterns of our Website, such as how frequently you log in, which pages you use, when and for how long. Tracking information we may obtain by using a cookie may also be associated with personal information we may have collected about you.<br>
You may be able to use your browser to give you the option of accepting or rejecting a cookie whenever visit a Website. You may also be able to use your browser or other software to clear cookies from your hard drive any time you wish. However, deleting a Website's cookie may mean that the Website will not recognize you as a repeat user. As a result you may have to re-enter information and reject a new Website cookie every time you attempt to access the website. Besides cookies we may use web beacons and clear GIFs or tracking pixels to also track your usage patterns of our Website. Like cookies, these small files also do not store, record or share any personal information about you. We utilize third party Internet services vendors to collect site traffic data through the use of these web beacons and clear GIFs or traffic pixels that can be embedded in our Website. These vendors can then provide us with completely anonymous usage data to allow us to improve our Website. This usage data cannot in any way be associated with any personal information we have about you.</p>
<p align="right"><a href="#top">top</a></p>
<h3>Security Of Information Transmissions</h3>
<p>Information you provide to us when filling out forms or requests for information on our Website, as well as information we supply when you are visiting those areas, is protected while passing through the Internet using encryption technology called Secure Sockets Layer or SSL. Your browser will indicate when you are within a secure area of our Website by displaying a symbol, such as a locked padlock or an unbroken key. Encryption technology scrambles transmissions so it is incomprehensible to third parties. Although we will use all reasonable efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your information, Internet transmissions cannot be made absolutely secure. We will not be liable for the unintended disclosure of information due to errors in transmission or unauthorized acts of or breaches of security by third parties. Please note that regular Internet e-mail is not secure. To protect your privacy, please do not use e-mail to communicate information that you want kept confidential. You can, of course, always<br>
contact us by telephone or mail as described below.</p>
<h3>Website Links</h3>
<p>Our Website can be reached by hypertext links ("hyperlinks") from Websites ("third party sites") that are not owned or controlled by us. It may also be possible to use hyperlinks to reach third party sites from our Website. Third party sites may have privacy policies controlling the collection and use of personal information about you that are different from our privacy policy. A link to or from a third party site is not an endorsement by us of the site, its content, its privacy practices or its sponsoring organization, and we cannot be responsible for the practices, content or accuracy of third party sites.</p>
<h3>Changes to Our Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>We may make changes to our privacy policy in the future. If you are a client, we will not make any change affecting you without first sending you a revised privacy policy describing the change. Similar changes will also be described on this Website.</p>
<h3>Contacting Us</h3>
<p align="left">If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please call us at 1-877-806-4573 and<br>
ask for our Privacy Information Center.</p>
