(g) resolve complaints, as well as handle requests for data access or correction;

(h) protect your, our or others' rights and interests; and

(i) communicate with you regarding your account or changes to our policies, terms and conditions.

Some jurisdictions require a legal basis to use or process your personal information. In most cases the legal basis will be one of the following:

(a) to fulfill our contractual obligations to you in connection with your policy or contract with us, for example using your contact details to reply to your requests. Failure to provide this information may prevent or delay the fulfillment of these contractual obligations; 

(b) in order to comply with our legal obligations, for example to keep records of the services we provide you with as required by applicable law or regulation, or to comply with any governmental, quasi-governmental or court orders or subpoenas; 

(c) where there is a public interest in the processing, for example where it is necessary in order to prevent and detect fraud; and 

(d) to meet our or a third party's legitimate interests, for example to understand how you use our services and to enable us to derive knowledge from that to develop new services, to protect our rights or the rights of third parties, or to resolve any disputes. When we process personal information to meet our legitimate interests, we put in place robust safeguards to help ensure that your privacy is protected and that our legitimate interests are not overridden by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms.

We may also obtain your consent to collect and use certain types of personal information, including when we are required to do so by law (for example, in certain jurisdictions where consent is always required to collect personal information, or in relation to our direct marketing activities or use of Cookies and Tracking Technologies, or when we process sensitive personal information about you). If we ask for your consent to process your personal information, you may withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us using the details at the end of this privacy notice.

**3\. YOUR RIGHTS OVER YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION**

You may have certain rights regarding your personal information, subject to local law. These include rights in certain circumstances to:

  * rectify the information we hold about you;
  * erase your personal information;

We will contact you if we need additional information from you in order to honor your requests.

**4\. AUTOMATED DECISIONS ABOUT YOU**

We may automatically process your personal information to make decisions or conduct 'profiling' about you. This may involve using software that is able to evaluate your personal aspects and predict risks or outcomes. We may carry out this automatic processing for general business purposes including, for example, advertising, risk assessment or fraud prevention. The processing may involve decisions about you that relate to products that we sponsor or your eligibility to use the Services. The significance of our actions in this connection is that is that it may have legal or similar effects for you, namely, availability of access to services. The logic involved may be related to our cookies policy, or it may be related to specific underwriting software, for example.

We will only make these kinds of automated decisions about you where:

  * such decisions are necessary for entering into a contract. For example, we may decide not to offer Services to you, or we may decide on the types or amount of Services that are suitable for you, or how much to charge you for our Services based on your credit history and other financial or related information we have collected about you;
  * such decisions are required or authorized by law, for example for fraud prevention purposes; or
  * you give your consent to us carrying out automated decision-making.



Subject to local legal requirements and limitations, you can contact us to request further information about automated decision-making, object to our use of automated decision-making, or request an automated decision to be reviewed by a human being.

We also may make automated decisions about you based on your personal information in the circumstances such as: to select personalized offers, discounts or recommendations to send you based on your shopping history or browsing history, subject to any applicable laws or regulations.

These types of decisions will not have legal or similar effects for you, but you can still contact us for further information.

When required by applicable law, when we share personal information with corporate third parties we will ensure that such third parties maintain a comparable level of protection of the personal information as set out in this privacy notice by using contractual or other means.

Please be aware that, despite our ongoing efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable.

We may provide links to other websites not owned or controlled by us that we think might be useful or of interest to you. We are not, however, responsible for the privacy practices used by other website owners or the content or accuracy contained on those other websites.
