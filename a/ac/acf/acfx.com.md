## Use of cookies

ACFX uses cookies to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that a website stores on your computer’s hard disk for the purpose of keeping records when you visit the website. Cookies allow us to improve your comfort of use, for example by remembering your passwords and viewing preferences, thus allowing you to visit various “member-only” parts of the website without re-registering. Furthermore, cookies are used by us to measure activity on the website and make improvements and updates based on which areas are popular and which are not.

We do not use cookies to retrieve information which was not originally sent in a cookie. We do not use information transferred through cookies for any direct promotional or marketing purposes without your consent.

  * To send out newsletters or information about other opportunities that we believe will be of interest to you. We will only send this to you if you have indicated that you wish to receive such information and we will respect your wish not to do so if you communicate such wish to us.



Personal Information is collected when our users provide personal information to us upon registering for membership or when applying on-line for an account.
