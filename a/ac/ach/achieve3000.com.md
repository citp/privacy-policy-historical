# Privacy Policy | Achieve3000

**Version Effective Date: November 6, 2015**

Achieve3000 is committed to assuring the privacy of student users (“Students”) of our educational products and services (“Services”), the teachers and administrators of educational institutions that subscribe to our Services (“Administrators”), and visitors to this Website.

This Privacy Policy sets forth our information handling practices and obligations with respect to data we gather and use in delivering Services to Students and Administrators through subscribing schools, school districts, and other educational institutions (collectively, “Service Data”).

This Privacy Policy also separately describes the information (other than Service Data) that we gather from users of our Website, how we use that information, and what we do to protect it. By visiting or using our Website, you expressly consent to the information handling practices described in this Privacy Policy. Your use of the Website and any information you provide via the Website are subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

 ** _Service Use and Service Data_**

Achieve3000 provides the Services solely to and through subscribing schools, school districts, and other educational institutions (“Schools”). Identity information for Students and Administrators for Service delivery is provided to Achieve3000 by Schools and is not separately solicited by Achieve3000. The information provided to us by Schools may include certain individually identifiable information, including Students’ names and academic levels and Administrators’ names, titles, and curricular responsibilities. We also collect and record data identifiable to individual Students and Administrators regarding their use or administration of, and interaction with, our Services. At the request of a School, we may also accept and include in reports we provide to the School additional Student data, including class code, room number, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, disability and other information. Collectively, the information we receive regarding Students and Administrators and that is generated through their interaction with our Services constitutes Service Data as defined above.

Achieve3000 uses Service Data solely to deliver the Achieve3000 Services to and through associated Schools, provide Students with individualized content within those Services, and provide Administrators with reports on Students’ academic progress in using the Services. Achieve3000 does not collect any more individually identifiable information about Students and Administrators than is reasonably necessary to administer and provide our Services and individualized content to Students and their Schools, to enable participation in School-sanctioned Student contests, and to generate School-requested reports on individual Student academic progress. Achieve3000 may also perform internal research and analysis on aggregated and anonymous Service Data to assess Service effectiveness and improvements in Student performance.

Except as directed by the responsible subscribing School, Achieve3000 does not disclose Student or Administrator information or other Service Data that is identifiable to an individual to third parties other than our contractors and agents directly involved in the development and delivery of our Services. These contractors and agents who help us manage our Service delivery and related information handling activities are required to use these data only as needed to perform the specific services they provide and not for any other purpose.

Students and Administrators are provided private user names and passwords to access applicable Services and associated Service Data by Achieve3000. These identification credentials allow Students to gain access to the Services to which their Schools subscribe and allow Administrators to track Student progress and assignment completion. Achieve3000 Services and associated Service Data are not made accessible to anyone other than our employees, contractors, and agents involved in Service development, delivery, and administration and those accessing the Services or associated Service Data using assigned user names and passwords.

If the parent or legal guardian of a Student wants to review the information that Achieve3000 has collected about the Student or learn more about the Service(s) the Student is participating in, he or she should contact the Student’s School.

Achieve3000 sometimes posts materials from Students on its Website and on-line Services. These materials may include Student comments, testimonials, and contest results. When we post such material, we limit associated identity information to the applicable school, state, and age or grade of user.

Achieve3000 makes reasonable efforts to secure Service Data against unauthorized access. These efforts include employment of physical, administrative, and technical safeguards based on currently available technology and practices to promote the integrity and security of the Services and Service Data.

In certain of our Service materials we include links to other websites. This Privacy Policy does not apply to such external links, and we make no representations concerning the privacy policies followed by linked websites. We urge parents and teachers to learn more about protecting children on the Internet by visiting the following sites: [U.S. Dept. of Education’s Internet Safety](http://www.ed.gov/edblogs/technology/) and [SafeKids.com](http://www.safekids.com/).

In the event that Achieve3000 is acquired by or merged with a third-party entity, we may transfer or assign Service Data as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control, unless otherwise prohibited by applicable law.

However, without cookies you may not have access to certain services and features of the Website.

Achieve3000 may use third-party service providers, such as YouTube to host videos or [Google Analytics](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/) _™_ to understand our Website usage. We may allow third-party service providers to place and read their own cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies to collect information through the Website.

Achieve3000 may also disclose Website usage information if required to do so by law, or if we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with local, state, federal, international, or other applicable laws (such as U.S. Copyright law) or respond to a court order, judicial or other government subpoena or warrant, or administrative request. In some cases, we may make such disclosures without first providing notice to applicable Website users.

In the event that Achieve3000 is acquired by or merged with a third-party entity, we may transfer information that we have collected about Website use as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control.

 **5\. Children Users**

Except for Service Data received from Schools and generated by Student access to and use of Services, Achieve3000 does not solicit and does not knowingly acquire, store, or use personal information relating to children who are less than 13 years of age. If Achieve3000 learns that personal information of persons less than 13 years of age (other than Service Data) has been collected via the Website without parental consent, then Achieve3000 will take appropriate steps to delete this information from its systems.

The Website may be linked to websites operated by other entities or individuals. Some of these websites, such as our Facebook™ page, may be co-branded with our name or logo. This Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot always control the activities of, such other third-party websites.
