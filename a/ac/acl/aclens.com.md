## Your California Privacy Rights

California law permits our users who are California residents to request and obtain from us once a year, free of charge, information about the personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year. If applicable, this information would include a list of the categories of personal information that was shared and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared such information in the immediately preceding calendar year. At this time, AC Lens does not disclose your personal information to any third parties for their direct marketing purposes, only to assist AC Lens in its own marketing efforts, so this requirement does not apply to us. 

In addition, under California law, web site operators are required to disclose how they respond to web browser "do not track" signals or other similar mechanisms that provide consumers with the ability to exercise choice regarding the collection of personal information of a consumer over time and across third party web sites, to the extent the operator engages in that collection. AC Lens does not respond to any such "do not track" signals, as no one do not track standard has gained consensus. 

This law also requires web site operators to disclose whether third parties may collect personal information about their users' online activities over time and across different web sites when the users use the operator' web site. AC Lens does not knowingly permit third parties to collect personal information about an individual consumer's online activities over time and across different web sites when a consumer uses our web site. 

Third parties that have content embedded on our web site (such as social networking features) may set cookies on a user's browser and/or obtain information about the fact that a web browser visited our web site from a certain IP address. These third parties cannot collect any other personal information from our web site unless you provide it to them directly.

## California Transparency in Supply Chains Act

The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 requires that applicable manufacturers and retailers such as AC Lens disclose their efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from the supply chain. 

AC Lens is committed to conducting business in accordance with ethical, legal and socially responsible rules and principles. These standards and commitments are outlined in the Company's Code of Conduct (the "Code") which every AC Lens Associate is trained on upon hire and is distributed annually during the course of their employment. Consistent with the Code, we respect the personal dignity of every individual and comply with all applicable human rights laws. Failure to comply with the standards of the Code subjects violators, regardless of position, to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment. 

With respect to our supply chain partners, we expect the same commitment to high ethical standards and compliance with applicable laws, as detailed in the Code. AC Lens monitors the standards of our supply chain partners for quality, safety and employment standards by conducting annual scheduled on-site audits of our major vendors and laboratory manufacturers. When entering into written contracts with suppliers, AC Lens requires suppliers to comply with all applicable laws which include those that prohibit slavery and human trafficking. Failure to comply with all applicable laws subjects supplier to breach and possible termination of contract. 

At this time AC Lens does not engage independent auditors or require separate verifications/certifications from its suppliers relating to human trafficking and slavery. While AC Lens believes it conducts its business with suppliers that maintain high ethical standards, we are continuously evaluating additional programs as it relates to combating the tragedy of human trafficking and slavery.
