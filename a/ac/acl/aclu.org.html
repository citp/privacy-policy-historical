				<h2 align="center">Privacy Statement for ACLU Freedom Network</h2><p>The American Civil Liberties Union has created this privacy statement to demonstrate its firm commitment to privacy by informing site visitors of the ACLU's data collection and storage practices, and guidelines for use of visitor data.<br><br>For more details about our advocacy work on electronic privacy, see <a href="http://www.aclu.org/Privacy/PrivacyMain.cfm">http://www.aclu.org/Privacy/PrivacyMain.cfm</a><br><br>The ACLU has filed comments on the National Telecommunications and Information Administration's notice and request for comments regarding electronic commerce, which may be found at <a href="http://archive.aclu.org/congress/l070698a.html">http://archive.aclu.org/congress/l070698a.html</a><br><br>The following statements detail information gathering and dissemination practices for the ACLU's Freedom Network, located at http://archive.aclu.org and any other associated sites using the aclu.org domain.&nbsp;</p><h3>User Tracking and Data Capture Practices</h3><p>Our servers collect and aggregate user information site-wide, including anonymous site statistics, such as the number of views of each page. We log domain names and/or IP addresses of visitors (such as umich.edu, aol.com, 209.168.1.1, etc.), which permits us to know "where" visitors are from, or what access service they use, without knowing their individual identities. Because we do not require users to register with us, this "host level" tracking is our primary basis for assessing traffic patterns.<br><br>On certain pages such as the ACLU Membership Form, we give users the option of providing us with names, addresses, phone numbers, fax numbers, email addresses, and other personal information, and various other kinds of details. This more personal information is gathered only with users` knowing and active permission and participation. <br><br>The ACLU website does not use any cookies that are automatically written to your computer's hard drive or retained by the ACLU or our vendors. (Our activist tools do allow users to have a cookie written to their hard drives to enable them to more easily take action. For more information about this feature, see the section on "Activist Letters" below.)<br><br>The ACLU website does set "session specific cookies" to help run its interactive online applications, such as the shopping cart. The session specific cookies only exist in your computer's short term memory (RAM) and only exist as long as the session lasts. They expire (disappear from your computer's memory) when the session ends. These cookies will NOT be written to a user's hard drive. Under no circumstance will any information associated with these cookies be retained or used by the ACLU or its vendors after the session is completed.<br><br>In addition, the third party email management provider that oversees the ACLU's newsletter distribution and data handling (see section below) will use cookies for the sole purpose of ensuring that an individual user can only access his/her personal profile and subscription information. This prevents a user from accessing or viewing another subscriber's personal or subscription information. By contract with the ACLU, the vendor will not transfer or sell any information that it collects from users of the ACLU website to a third party.<br><br>We review and discard the information in some cases (e.g. IP address logs for file transfers), while in others we may use the information to tailor our users` Web experience in the form of custom content or results drawn from databases. On some pages, users can sign up to receive additional information by e-mail through an e-mail subscription service (as discussed below), or by other means, including postal mail. Personal information that has been volunteered to us may also be combined with data from third parties, such as Congressional district maps, to improve our services to members. No such combining will be done for marketing purposes.<br><br>We may at some point share user information, including e-mail addresses, with our local offices for the above named purposes. Website visitor information is not shared or exchanged with other parties, with the exception of those visitors who also become ACLU members (see below regarding ACLU Member Address Exchange) and as provided for in the section on email list subscriptions below. <br><br>E-mail addresses of visitors and members are <b>never</b> exchanged with other organizations except as provided for in the section on email list subscriptions below.</p><h3>Activism</h3><p>Our activist letters and activist list are administered on acluaction.org, a website that the ACLU runs on CapWiz, an electronic communication service of Capital Advantage Inc. The contract between ACLU and Capitol Advantage allows CapWiz to collect and store the personal information that you provide on our behalf, but Capitol Advantage is prohibited from sharing this information to any except the ACLU. The contract forbids Capitol Advantage from renting, selling or trading any of this information.</p><dir><p><b>Activist Letters </b></p><p>Our write your elected representatives feature counts your letter and its recipient, but does not record its content. Counting permits us to track how many letters are delivered to which officeholders. Your elected representative is selected according to the address you enter when sending a letter. If you wish to have your address stored as a "cookie" for future use on your computer, select the "remember me" option when sending letter. If you do not select "remember me," your information will not be stored on your computer or our server. If you choose to be remembered, the cookie will be stored on your computer solely for the purpose of retrieving your personal address when you send letters. It will not be stored on Capitol Advantage or ACLU servers. </p><p><b>Activist List </b></p><p>By joining our activist list, you will receive periodic email informing you of action that you can take in the defense of civil liberties. You can join our action list by selecting "subscribe me to the ACLU's action alert listserv" when sending an activist letter or you can subscribe through our "Join Our Alert List" page. We will use the mail address that you provide to assign your email address to the proper legislative districts. Both your email and your mail address will be used exclusively for the purpose of sending you email from the ACLU. You will not be contacted in any other way, nor will your information be offered to a third-party. </p></dir><h3>ACLU Publications Merchandise Customer Records</h3><p>The ACLU Freedom Network website store features a "shopping cart" tool that relies on .perl script using a "session ID," and therefore does not collect any customer data prior to the completion of the order. E-mail addresses provided by customers are used only to communicate about the customer's order. Customer postal addresses will never be exchanged with other not-for-profit or advocacy organizations.</p><h3>Tracking and the ACLU Membership Form</h3><p>When website users click a button or link to "Join the ACLU" anywhere on the ACLU Freedom Network website and possibly also on other websites, data indicating that location is passed onto the membership form as a hidden field and sent to our servers only when the form is completed and sent by the user. Such tracking helps to assess which content is persuading web visitors to join the ACLU. If a user wishes to evade this tracking, they may join from the "join" link in the toolbar used throughout our site. See more about sharing and the ACLU Membership Form below.</p><h3>Exchange of ACLU Member Addresses</h3><p>Individual information about website visitors, including e-mail addresses, is never shared with third parties (except as provided for in the section on email list subscriptions below).</p><p>However, the names and postal addresses of ACLU members, including those who join through the ACLU Freedom Network website, may be exchanged or rented to other organizations or publications under the procedures outlined below.<br><br>Members who join through the ACLU Freedom Network website are provided with an opportunity to opt out of this exchange.</p><p>Like most other non-profit membership organizations, the ACLU obtains the names of potential new members by renting the membership lists or subscriber lists of like-minded organizations and publications. Sometimes, instead of paying the rental fee, ACLU exchanges its list with that of another organization.<br></p><p>Whether by exchange or rental, the lists are governed by very strict privacy procedures, as recommended by the U.S. Privacy Study Commission. All exchanges are made on a "blind" basis, as follows: Lists are never given into the physical possession of the organization which has rented or exchanged them. This safeguard is necessary to prevent one organization from knowing who the members of any other organization are. Instead, usually through a list broker, the list, either in the form of labels or tape, is sent to a mail house which prepares the mailing without our ever seeing who is addressed. The only time we get possession of a name from one of these lists is when the person receiving our invitation to join responds by sending our return envelope back to us.<br></p><p>If the receipt of duplicate mailings is too burdensome, you may wish to consider writing to each of the organizations to which you belong and publications to which you subscribe, requesting that your name be eliminated from lists made available for exchange or rental. The ACLU always honors such requests, and we believe that the organizations with which we exchange or rent lists honor them also, although of course we can't guarantee the actions of outside organizations.</p><h3>Financial Data Security</h3><p>Membership and merchandise sale forms that collect financial information (such as a credit card number) are offered over a Netscape Commerce Server that encrypts the data for delivery to our contractor's server, and all financial data is stored or transmitted using appropriate security measures.</p><h3>Email List Subscriptions</h3><p>The ACLU uses your email address to update you on news that you have requested. To deliver this information to you, we use ClickAction Email Relationship Management (ERM), an email marketing service that helps us to conduct targeted permission-based email campaigns. When registering for our email newsletter(s), ClickAction may collect and store the personal information that you provide on our behalf, but the contract between the ACLU and ClickAction prohibits it from sharing, renting, selling or trading any of this information to parties other than ACLU. In addition to its own strict privacy policy, ClickAction is a member of several industry privacy associations including: the Coalition Against Unsolicited Commercial Email and TRUSTe. ClickAction also adheres to all Federal and State privacy laws such as the FTC's privacy guidelines and other industry standards.
