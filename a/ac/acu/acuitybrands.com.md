## Privacy Policy

Effective: August 31, 2009

Acuity Brands knows that you are concerned about online security and privacy information. We appreciate your trust that we will act responsibly with any information you share through this site.

This site allows anonymous viewing of all public information on this site. You can view the information on these pages without telling us who you are.

However, there may be some pages on this site that request certain personally identifying information from you. These pages include feedback forms, registration forms, online surveys and other forms that may appear on this site. We will act reasonably to make certain that we use your personal information only for the purposes intended by the submission form. If you fill out one of these forms, any information you provide will be received and stored by Acuity Brands. Acuity Brands may store your information indefinitely, either in separate or aggregate form, for our business records and as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy.

We never sell or share your personal information with unaffiliated organizations for commercial purposes unrelated to the business of Acuity Brands. If necessitated by your request (e.g., if you submit a Literature Request Form), we may provide the minimum required information (e.g., mailing address) to allow these third-party organizations to provide their services. 

Certain types of non-identifying information are collected automatically from each visitor's session on this site. This type of information includes technical information, such as your IP address and browser type. We also log and track which pages are visited to enable us to measure traffic usage and patterns.

Like many sites, this site may use "cookies" to recognize a visitor’s computer on subsequent visits to this site. Cookies are small files created by web sites that reside on the hard drive of the visitor’s computer and that store information about a visitor’s use of a particular web site. 

Exceptions: Acuity Brands may disclose all or any portion of your personal information if it believes there are exceptional reasons to do so. These include, but are not limited to, the following situations: (1) to correct technical problems and malfunctions in how the site operates or processes visitor’s information, (2) to protect the security and integrity of the site and its service; (3) to protect Acuity Brands rights and property and the rights and property of others; (4) to take precautions against liability; (5) to respond to claims that submitted information violates the rights or interests of third parties; (6) to the extent required by law or to respond to judicial process; (7) to the extent permitted under other provisions of law, to provide information to law enforcement agencies or for an investigation on a matter related to public safety, as applicable; or (8) in connection with the purchase or sale of one or more of Acuity Brands businesses or their business assets.

This site has taken commercially reasonable precautions to protect the data and information under our control from misuse, loss or alteration. Unfortunately, no system can ensure complete security.

The Acuity Brands site may contain links to other sites that contain information we believe may be of interest to our visitors. While we try to link only to sites that share our high standards and respect for privacy, we are not responsible for the content or the privacy practices employed by other sites.

Acuity Brands does not knowingly collect or maintain any personal information from children under the age of 13. In addition, no part of our site is designed with the purpose of attracting any person under the age of 13.

We reserve the right to amend this Privacy Policy and will post any revisions on this site.

Questions or comments about this Privacy Policy or the practices of the site should be directed to [webmaster@AcuityBrands.com](mailto:webmaster@AcuityBrands.com).
