**Acumatica Privacy Statement**

**Last Updated November 12, 2015**

Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices.

**Policy**

Acumatica, Inc., a Washington Company (“Acumatica”) will never sell, rent, barter, trade, distribute or lease personally identifiable information to outside parties unless Acumatica obtains customer permission or disclosure is required by law.

**Purpose**

Acumatica uses the information customers provide only to the extent necessary to offer our services to our customers. Acumatica uses return email addresses to answer the email Acumatica receives. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.  The only individually identifiable information that Acumatica collects about you is that which you choose to share with us in registration. As stated earlier, this information will be closely protected and used for internal purposes only. Acumatica will never willfully release your personal information to any third party unless you direct us to do so or disclosure is required by law.

Acumatica also collects information about aggregate site usage. Statistics that we gather about unique visits, repeat visits and page views are all based on IP address, not on your individual activities.

**Cookies**

There is a technology called “cookies” which can be used to provide tailored information from a web site. A cookie is an element of data that a web site can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your system. A “cookie” marks and identifies visitors on an Internet site to allow customers to enter customized information and have it available on subsequent visits. Acumatica pages may use cookies so that Acumatica can provide a customer with access to information when a customer returns to Acumatica’ web site.

Although there has been debate over the privacy implications of cookies, it is important for Acumatica customers to know that cookies do not read your hard rive, nor can cookies be used to reveal new information about you that you have not elected to reveal.  Acumatica may also use cookies to log your activity on the site. Everything Acumatica learns from these logs will be used to enrich your experience on our site. It will help Acumatica understand what you like and don’t like, so Acumatica can focus its energies more effectively and provide you with better data.

** ** **Security**

Acumatica is committed to protecting the security of your personal information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, we store the personal information you provide on computer systems with limited access, which are located in controlled facilities.

If a password is used to help protect your accounts and personal information, it is your responsibility to keep your password confidential. Do not share this information with anyone. If you are sharing a computer with anyone you should always choose to log out before leaving a site or service to protect access to your information from subsequent users.

**Opt-Out**

To opt out of receiving marketing related communications from Acumatica, please click on the “opt-out” link in the communication. Please note that if you do opt-out of receiving marketing- related emails from us, we may still send you important administrative messages, and you cannot opt-out from receiving administrative messages.

**Changes to This Privacy Statement**

We will occasionally update this privacy statement to reflect changes in our services and customer feedback. When we post changes to this Statement, we will revise the “last updated” date at the top of this statement. If there are material changes to this statement or in how Acumatica will use your personal information, we will notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes prior to implementing the change or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to periodically review this statement to be informed of how Acumatica is protecting your information.
