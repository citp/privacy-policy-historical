that you voluntarily choose to have displayed publicly on the Acunote 
Services – including your username, alias, or ID 
– becomes publicly available information and may be collected and 
used by others without restriction</u>.</p>
<p>      This 
Privacy Notice is incorporated into and is subject to the Acunote 
<b><a href="terms">Terms of 
Service</a></b>.  Your use of

<ul type="DISC">
  <li>Acunote uses the information 
  you provide or that we collect to operate, maintain, enhance, and provide 
  all of the features and services found on the Acunote Services including 
  without limitation accessing your SCM Systems on your behalf and displaying 
  organizational, task, timeline, and backlog information related to projects 
  inputted by you or another contact within your organization.  </li>
  <li>Acunote reserves the right 
  to use your email address, without further consent, for administrative 
  purposes such as notifying you of major Acunote Services updates, for 
  customer service purposes, or to address copyright infringement issues.</li>
  <li>Acunote uses all of the information 
  that we collect to understand the usage trends and preferences of our 
  Users, to improve the way the Acunote Services work and look, and to 
  create new features and functionality. </li>
  <li>Acunote may use “automatically 
  collected” information and “cookies” information to:  (a) 
  determine user-specific access privileges and remember your information 
  so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next 
  time you visit the Acunote Services; (b) provide customized third-party 
  content, and information; (c) create project-timeline forecasts and 
  offer other project-management related features; (d) monitor aggregate 
  site usage metrics such as total number of visitors and pages viewed; 
  and (e) track your project entries, submissions, and status in any other 
  activities. </li>

  <li>Acunote will not use your 
  email address or other personally identifiable information to send promotional 
  or marketing messages without your consent or except as part of a specific 
  program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in.</li>

  process such information in compliance with this Privacy Notice, we 
  authorize only a limited use of such information, and we require these

  belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal 
  laws (such as U.S. Copyright law) or respond to a court order, judicial 
  or other government subpoena, or warrant.  In some cases, we may 
  make such disclosures without providing notice to Users. </li>
  <li>Acunote also reserves the 
  right to disclose Subscriber information that we believe, in good faith,

you transmit to Acunote, and you do so at your own risk.  Once

notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective 
steps. Acunote may post a notice on the Acunote Services if a security
