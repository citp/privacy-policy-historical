# Acura Website Privacy Policy

**PRIVACY POLICY (United States Only)**

Information regarding the Acura Division of American Honda Motor Co.'s privacy practices: 

This document describes the Acura Division of American Honda Motor Co.'s (hereafter referred to as Acura) policy regarding information received about you during visits to our web site. The amount and type of information received depends on how you use our site. 

**NORMAL WEB-SITE USAGE:**  
You can visit Acura's web site to read product information or use our online tools (calculators, etc.) without telling us who you are and without revealing any personal information. The only information we collect and store during normal web-site usage is the name of your Internet service provider, the web site that referred you to us, the pages you request, and the date and time of those requests. We use this information to generate statistics and measure site activity to improve the usefulness of customer visits. During normal web-site usage, we do not collect or store personally identifiable information such as name, mailing address, e-mail address, phone number or Social Security Number. 

**COLLECTION OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION:**  
There are instances where Acura requests personally identifiable information to provide the web-site visitor a service or correspondence (promotions and mailed brochures). This information, such as name, mailing address, e-mail address, type of request and possibly additional information, is collected and stored in a manner appropriate to the nature of the data and is used to fulfill your request. The information you provide is used by Acura to improve the services we provide you. It is never provided to any other company for that company's independent use. 

**ACURA'S INTERNET SERVICES:**  
To use Acura's Internet services, such as Brochure requests, etc., we require a certain amount of personally identifying information (examples are: name, address, zip code, etc.) that we can use to meet with your request. We use this information to identify and access data in the existing relationship we have with you to provide you with the requested services. Again, this information will not be provided to any third party. We request electronic mail addresses (e-mail) as an alternate means of contacting you. Providing your e-mail address is optional. 

**ELECTRONIC MAIL SENT TO US THAT CONTAINS PERSONAL INFORMATION:**  
Internet users may decide to send Acura personally identifying information, for example, in a message containing comments about the Acura web site. Acura will only use this information to identify the user. We will not use this information other than to resolve the matter identified in the e-mail. 

By using this site, you are agreeing to the terms of our Privacy Policy. We reserve the right to change our Privacy Policy. A revised Privacy Policy will only apply to data collected subsequent to its effective date. Any revisions will be posted at least 10 days prior to its effective date. Your continued use of this site following the posting of changes to these terms will mean that you accept these changes. 

If you are under the age of 16, please do not submit or post any personal information.
