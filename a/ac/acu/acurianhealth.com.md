# Privacy Policy | AcurianHealth | Your Guide For Getting Connected To Clinical Trials

Updated: September 23, 2016

This privacy policy describes how Acurian, Inc. (“Acurian”) collects and uses the personal information you provide on our web sites: [www.acurian.com](http://www.acurian.com/), [www.acuriantrials.com](http://www.acuriantrials.com/), and [www.acurianhealth.com](http://www.acurianhealth.com/). Acurian’s primary mission is to increase awareness about, and facilitate participation, in clinical trials related to development of investigational drugs and therapies. Individuals entrust us with information of a personal and confidential nature, so we have adopted this Privacy Policy (“Policy”) to inform you about our practices in collecting, using and protecting such information. The Policy explains in general terms how we seek to comply with data privacy laws and regulations, including but not limited to national laws.

### Children Under 13

Our websites are not intended for children under 13 years of age. No one under age 13 may provide any personal information to us through our websites. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are under 13, do not use or provide any information on our websites. If we learn we have collected or received personal information from a child under 13 we will delete that information.

### Information Covered by this Policy

This Policy applies to any personally identifiable information about you (“Personal Information”) that you may provide to Acurian when:

  * using any of our websites or sending us information by email;
  * speaking with one of our representatives on the phone; or
  * providing information in writing.



### Information Collected and How We Use It

At various locations on our site, and during our business practice, we ask you for information, which will allow us to provide you (whether you are a patient or physician) with information that is targeted specifically to you. If you would like to be considered for enrollment in a clinical trial, this information allows us to contact you regarding particular studies for which you may be eligible. We collect information in the following ways:

  * Initial User Registration. We collect information you provide to us when you register at one of our sites (e.g., name, date of birth, email address, address, phone number, and demographic information).
  * Further Information. At various locations on our site, we may ask you for additional information so that we can provide you with additional services (e.g., notification about your appointments or new clinical trials).
  * Enrollment Forms. Many of our users are interested in enrolling in clinical trials. To learn whether you satisfy the criteria for a particular trial, we request medical information via a questionnaire. If you meet the prequalification criteria for the trial, and grant Acurian explicit permission to do so, your information will be forwarded to an investigator in your area for further evaluation; the investigator will be under strict constraints by laws governing the disclosure of Personal Information. You can also input your child’s date of birth and medical information to verify if your child satisfies the criteria for a particular trial.
  * Data Aggregation. To enhance our ability to provide you with our services, we may combine your Personal Information with aggregated data about groups of people in similar circumstances. For example, we may infer that there is a 50% chance that you are divorced from the fact that your zip code has a 50% divorce rate.
  * Tell-a-friend. We allow users to tell their friends about our site using our referral service. If you provide your friend’s name and email address, we will automatically send a one-time email inviting him or her to visit our site. We do not store this email address and will not use it for any other purpose. Your friend may contact us at [information@acurian.com](mailto:information@acurian.com) to request that we remove this information from our database.
  * We and our partners (e.g., medical centers, healthcare companies, medical websites) may occasionally offer newsletters or other publications focused on specific medical conditions that you might want to receive. If you ask to receive a newsletter, we will use your contact information to deliver the material you request.
  * Data Partners. Acurian partners with several companies that gather opted-in information from consumers, which include self-reported health information. If you have provided Personal Information to one of our Data Partners (including information on your health, purchasing habits, or lifestyle) indicated an interest in clinical research studies or health information, and opted in to receive information of interest from third parties, we may receive your Personal Information from the Data Partner.
  * Public Records. In some circumstances, we may link the information you have provided to our Data Partners with publicly available data about you, such as public directory phone numbers.
  * _Lifestyle-based Analytics_. In some circumstances, we may contact you by mail regarding potential clinical studies where information you voluntarily provided to our Data Partners or publicly available information suggests on the basis of analysis of various demographic and societal trends that you might benefit from such studies.
  * _Messaging Services.  _If you enroll in a clinical trial and expressly consent to receiving study information and messages, we will provide you with appointment reminders, study instructions, and other important study instructions. In addition, we may exchange relevant health information with the study doctor and staff in order to provide these services.
  * _Opt Out Requests._ If you register to use our resource documents, we request your name, company email address, company name, and telephone number. We use this information to create an account for you to allow you access to our patient recruitment white papers, recorded webinars, brochures, case studies, and other resources.
  * _Resource Documents Registration_. If you register to use our resource documents, we request your name, company email address, company name, and telephone number. We use this information to create an account for you to allow you access to our patient recruitment white papers, recorded webinars, brochures, case studies, and other resources.



We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. You may remove your information from our contact list by sending an email entitled “Unsubscribe” to [information@acurian.com](mailto:information@acurian.com). Please note that we may retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order or similar legal process served on our Web Site, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

### Information Sharing and Transfer

We will share your Personal Information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy statement or unless you expressly opt in to such sharing.

### Service Providers/Partners

We may provide your information with third-party service providers (e.g., call centers, email service providers), or data partners who are contractually bound to handle your information confidentially and prohibited from disclosing your information to others.

### Legal Notice

In certain situations, Acurian may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

We may also disclose your personal information as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or other legal process, when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.

### When and How Acurian May Contact You

When you register with Acurian, or complete a prequalification questionnaire associated with a particular trial, you indicate your consent for Acurian to store your Personal Information in our database and contact you about clinical trials for which you may be eligible by various means, including telephone, email, and US mail. You also have the option of receiving emails regarding new postings to our site, including news or new clinical trials. In addition, Acurian may contact you periodically when we have provided new functionality to our website, so that you may take advantage of the new services. If you receive a text message from us and would like to discontinue such messages, you may reply with the word “STOP.” Providing a telephone number constitutes your consent for Acurian to contact you at that number for the purposes outlined in this Policy.
