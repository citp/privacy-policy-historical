## WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE GATHER?

When you visit this Website, you may provide acmetools.com with two types of information: personal information you knowingly and voluntarily choose to disclose, and information that we automatically collect as you browse this Website. 

**Information You Voluntarily Submit** \- We collect and store any information you enter on this Website, or provide to acmetools.com in other contacts we have with you.

You may request to have the information on your account deleted or removed, although you cannot delete information associated with past purchases.

We collect this, and other information, as disclosed in this Policy, in order to fill your order, to communicate with you about your order and to send you promotional materials. Before confirming your order, you will have the opportunity to review the product order form and make changes and additions to the information it contains. These changes will be automatically kept for future use.

Individual survey answers are confidential, although non-personally identifiable information is collected and disclosed to third parties. If you do not wish to participate in a survey, simply decline to participate when asked. 

**Contests and Sweepstakes** \- When you enter a contest or other promotion, we may ask you for contact information such as your name, address and e-mail address in order to administer the contest, to send you promotional e-mails, notify winners and make the winner's list publicly available pursuant to certain state's laws.
