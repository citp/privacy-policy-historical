**With whom does ACN share the information it gathers or tracks?**

ACN Newswire does not release personal information about individual subscribers to outside parties. However, ACN does share personal information with its customers and global offices for the purpose of providing users with high quality, localized service. This process often includes sending the personal information across international borders. ACN is not responsible for the content or the privacy policies of websites to which it is linked. 

**What security procedures are in place to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information under the Company's control?**
