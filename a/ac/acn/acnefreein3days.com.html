      The following is the map used to make links on the header 
      Each 'area' tag has a 'href' attribute. Set the 'href' equal
      to the page you wish it to link to.  For example, if you
      want the 'Home' button to link to 'home.html', you would replace
      the following line:

      <area shape=rect coords="130,135,235,150" alt="Home" href="#">

      with:

      <area shape=rect coords="130,135,235,150" alt="Home" href="home.html">

      Do not alter any other part of the tag.

<b>WE HAVE AND WILL PROSECUTE ANY VIOLATION OF OUR COPYRIGHT, TO THE FULL EXTENT THE LAW ALLOWS</b>.<br><br>

Universal Marketing Media, Inc. and its website www.acnefreein3days.com strives to offer its visitors the many advantages of Internet technology and to provide an interactive and personalized experience. We may use Personally Identifiable Information (your name, e-mail address, street address, telephone number) subject to the terms of this privacy policy. We will never sell, barter, or rent your email address to any unauthorized third party. Period."<br><br>

<b>How we gather information from users</b><br><br>

How we collect and store information depends on the page you are visiting, the activities in which you elect to participate and the services provided. For example, you may be asked to provide information when you register for access to certain portions of our site or request certain features, such as newsletters or when you make a purchase. You may provide information when you participate in sweepstakes and contests, message boards and chat rooms, and other interactive areas of our site. Like most Web sites, www.acnefreein3days.com also collects information automatically and through the use of electronic tools that may be transparent to our visitors. For example, we may log the name of your Internet Service Provider or use cookie technology to recognize you and hold information from your visit. Among other things, the cookie may store your user name and password, sparing you from having to re-enter that information each time you visit, or may control the number of times you encounter a particular advertisement while visiting our site. As we adopt additional technology, we may also gather information through other means. In certain cases, you can choose not to provide us with information, for example by setting your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but if you do you may be unable to access certain portions of the site or may be asked to re-enter your user name and password, and we may not be able to customize the site’s features according to your preferences.<br><br>

<b>What we do with the information we collect</b><br><br>

Like other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance your visit and deliver more individualized content and advertising. We respect your privacy and do not share your information with anyone.<br><br>

Aggregated Information (information that does not personally identify you) may be used in many ways. For example, we may combine information about your usage patterns with similar information obtained from other users to help enhance our site and services (e.g., to learn which pages are visited most or what features are most attractive). Aggregated Information may occasionally be shared with our advertisers and business partners. Again, this information does not include any Personally Identifiable Information about you or allow anyone to identify you individually.<br><br>

We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on www.acnefreein3days.com to communicate with you about your registration and customization preferences; our Terms of Service and privacy policy; services and products offered by www.acnefreein3days.com or Universal Marketing Media, Inc. and other topics we think you might find of interest.<br><br>

Personally Identifiable Information collected by Universal Marketing Media, Inc./www.acnefreein3days.com may also be used for other purposes, including but not limited to site administration, troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce transactions, administration of sweepstakes and contests, and other communications with you. Certain third parties who provide technical support for the operation of our site (our Web hosting service for example) may access such information. We will use your information only as permitted by law. In addition, from time to time as we continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner with other companies or businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets. We may also disclose your information in response to a court order, at other times when we believe we are reasonably required to do so by law, in connection with the collection of amounts you may owe to us, and/or to law enforcement authorities whenever we deem it appropriate or necessary. Please note we may not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in such cases.<br><br>

Other features available on our site may offer services operated by third parties and may use cookies or other technology to gather information. Universal Marketing Media, Inc./www.acnefreein3days.com does not control the use of this technology by third parties or the resulting information, and is not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties.<br><br>
