You don’t have to give us your personal information. However, in order to buy from our website as well as use it, you will need to provide us with this information. If you don’t want to, that’s okay!

However, if you do share with us your personal information, we anonymize it. This information is used for data analysis and to improve our website.

## Who has access to your information?

The information you provide will not be shared to third parties. We also do not sell your information for marketing purposes.

However, we do share your information with Third Party Service Providers that work on our behalf. When we do, we only disclose the information that is absolutely necessary for the purpose of completing their tasks. Here are the categories of providers: 

  * Payment service providers (in order to process your payment)
  * Professional service providers (This includes marketing and advertising agencies)
  * Analytics (The information provided is anonymous so they cannot identify you)



## Your choices/Opt-out

Our users are given the opportunity to ‘opt-out’ of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for the information. Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter or promotional materials may opt-out of receiving these communications by replying to unsubscribe in the subject line in the email or email us at [info@acprail.com](mailto:info@acprail.com).

Users of our site are always notified when their information is being collected by any outside parties. We do this so our users can make an informed choice as to whether they should proceed with services that require an outside party, or not.

## How you can access and update your information

If a user’s personally identifiable information changes, or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user’s personal data provided to us. This may be done by emailing us at [info@acprail.com](mailto:info@acprail.com).

## Keeping your information

Since we sell products on behalf of our partners (train operators), we are required to hold on to your personal information for a minimum of 7 years for legal and audit purposes. This information never includes your payment information. Your payment information is only used during billing purposes. Since we use a payment service provider (World Pay), we never have access to that information. 

## Security precautions in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of your information

This website takes every precaution to protect our users’ information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line.

When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry, SSL (Secure Sockets Layer.) While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just ‘surfing’.

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users’ information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment.

If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email to [webmaster@ACPRail.com](mailto:webmaster@ACPRail.com).
