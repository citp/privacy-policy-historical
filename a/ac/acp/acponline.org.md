ACP web sites send all visitors a cookie (small computer file) that contains a unique serial number. Each time our web server receives a request for a page, it checks to see if the cookie is present, which enables us to determine the traffic patterns of visitors as well as to identify repeat visitor traffic.

_Advertising_

We and our third party providers use the information collected by cookies and other technologies as described above, to understand how to make our website and services more available and user-friendly to our customers and members as well as to provide you with advertising that may be of interest to you.

Other Third-party vendors use cookies to serve ads based on users' past visits to ACP Online, Annals.org and other ACP sites. Learn how you can opt out of such advertising. **We do not serve interest-based advertising to users we identify as using our websites from EU internet protocol (IP) addresses.
