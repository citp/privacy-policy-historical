**What information is collected and how is it used when I visit Acorn Online?**  
Our Site automatically recognizes the home server of visitors. We may also employ a third-party tracking service that enables enhancement to major search engine marketing programs. We may use this information to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer the Site or sites of our affiliated companies. In addition, we may aggregate information on the pages that you access or visit and use the information to improve the content of our Site. 

We only collect personal information that is relevant to the purpose of the Site. This information allows us to provide you with a customized and efficient experience. We receive and store information you submit to us through our Site or provide to us in any other way. You can choose not to provide us with certain information (as addressed below), but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features. For example, if you make a purchase using a credit card, we will need to collect information such as your credit card number and billing address to complete that transaction. 

We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. Our authorized agents automatically receive and record certain "traffic data" on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, cookie information (see below), and the page you requested. We use this information to help diagnose problems with our servers, analyze trends and administer the Site. We may also collect and display the total counts that a page has been viewed. Certain third-party programs are available to help you to visit websites anonymously. While we will not be able to provide you with a personalized experience if we cannot recognize you, we want you to be aware that these programs are available. 

**What are "Cookies" and how are they used?**  
"Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Cookies enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages of the Site are visited and by how many people. We also use cookies to record session information, such as items that consumers add to their shopping cart.
