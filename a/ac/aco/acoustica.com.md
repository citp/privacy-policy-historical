**How do 3rd party credit card processors protect customer information?**

Customers who buy through Acoustica are shopping on a secure server hosted by Regnow and other 3rd party credit card processors that encrypts all of the customer's personal information including name, address and credit card number. Encryption ensures that no one can access or use personal information in an unauthorized manner. 

Regnow’s commerce system was developed in-house with security as its number one priority. This single entry point allows Acoustica/Regnow to maintain the tightest access control - eliminating (rather than closing) the backdoor.
