<p>You are allowed to remove any copyright information and you may modify the themes in any way you wish (php, html, css, images).</p>
<h4 id="support-policy">Support Policy</h4>
<p>Support is provided for any theme purchased from Acosmin for a year after the purchase date. You will be guaranteed access to our support forums, knowledge base and documentation sections. </p>
<p>We do not provide support for:</p>
<ul>
<li>our free themes (except bugs and free updates);</li>

<h4>Theme Updates</h4>
<p>Each time a new version of WordPress is released, we check our themes for compatibility with the new version, and we update them if this is required. Also we update our themes any time we discover a bug or when a new feature has been added to the theme.</p>
<p>All updates and new versions are free of charge for existing customers while their license is active.</p>
<h4>Warranty/Compatibility</h4>
<p>Our products are guaranteed to function on a clean installation of WordPress or when activated without any changes.</p>
<p>We cannot guarantee the compatibility of our themes with all third party software and plugins. If a conflict does arise, we will do our best resolve the situation. Moreover, we cannot guarantee the themes will function correctly after modification to the code, or a failure to install the theme or WordPress properly.</p>
<h4 id="refund-policy">Refund Policy</h4>
<p>All sales are final. No refunds will be given for software that is delivered via digital download from our site. If there is a problem with one of the digital download products or if you experience any difficulty with its download, we will fix the problem.

<h4 id="privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</h4>
<h6>Who we are</h6>
<p>Our website address is: http://www.acosmin.com</p>
<h6>What personal data we collect and why we collect it</h6>
<p>When registering on our Site you may be asked to enter your name, member name, email address, mailing address or other details to help you with your experience.</p>
<p>When you browse our Site, we also automatically receive traffic data registered by the hosting servers, cookies that may share some personal data and your computer’s internet protocol (IP) address. We also use information offered by other external services of traffic analysis, such as Google Analytics.</p>
<h6>Comments</h6>
<p>When visitors leave comments on the site we collect the data shown in the comments form, and also the visitor’s IP address and browser user agent string to help spam detection.</p>
<p>An anonymized string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the Gravatar service to see if you are using it. The Gravatar service privacy policy is available here: https://automattic.com/privacy/. After approval of your comment, your profile picture is visible to the public in the context of your comment.</p>
<h6>Contact forms</h6>
<p>We do not use the information submitted through our contact form for any marketing purposes.</p>
<h6>Cookies</h6>
<p>If you leave a comment on our site you may opt-in to saving your name, email address and website in cookies. These are for your convenience so that you do not have to fill in your details again when you leave another comment. These cookies will last for one year.</p>
<p>If you have an account and you log in to this site, we will set a temporary cookie to determine if your browser accepts cookies. This cookie contains no personal data and is discarded when you close your browser.</p>
<p>When you log in, we will also set up several cookies to save your login information and your screen display choices. Login cookies last for two days, and screen options cookies last for a year. If you select “Remember Me”, your login will persist for two weeks. If you log out of your account, the login cookies will be removed.</p>
<p>If you edit or publish an article, an additional cookie will be saved in your browser. This cookie includes no personal data and simply indicates the post ID of the article you just edited. It expires after 1 day.</p>
<h6>Embedded content from other websites</h6>
<p>Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.</p>
<p>These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracing your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.</p>
<h6>How long we retain your data</h6>
<p>If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so we can recognize and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.</p>
<p>For users that register on our website (if any), we also store the personal information they provide in their user profile. All users can see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time (except they cannot change their username). Website administrators can also see and edit that information.</p>
<h6>What rights you have over your data</h6>
<p>If you have an account on this site, or have left comments, you can request to receive an exported file of the personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to us. You can also request that we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes.</p>
<h6>Where we send your data</h6>
<p>Visitor comments may be checked through an automated spam detection service.</p>
<h6>Our contact information</h6>
<p>You can contact us regarding any privacy concerns or information by using this <a href="http://www.acosmin.com/contact/">contact form</a></p>
<h6>How we protect your data</h6>
<p>Your personal information is stored on secured servers and networks and is only accessible by a limited number of persons who have special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential.</p>
<p>All financial transactions are processed through a payment gateway provider and are not stored or processed on our servers.</p>
<h4>Price Changes</h4>
<p>ACOSMIN reserves the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, prices of all products or renewals, at any time with or without notice.</p>
<h4 id="affiliates">Affiliates</h4>
<p>Affiliates will be paid each month for valid referrals generated from 2 months prior. There is no minimum number of referrals you need to generate before you can get paid. You must have a verified PayPal account.</p>
<p>We do not pay affiliates for unsuccessful transactions. We do not support spamming or the use of fake promotions as an affiliate. Abuse of the Acosmin affiliate program will result in nonpayment and removal from the program. We maintain close vigilance on each transaction and track where all sales are coming from. We do not support dishonest sales tactics. Unacceptable tactics which will result in nonpayment and possible termination include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Advertising coupon codes – including temporary promotional codes, expired codes, inaccurate discounts, or inaccurate payment details of any kind. Any coupon promotions are created for the benefit of our customers, not our affiliates.</li>
<li>Misrepresenting or inaccurately describing Acosmin services, products, brand, or trademark.</li>
<li>Misleading referred users in a manner which implies the inclusion of any product, service, or experience beyond that expressly depicted on acosmin.com.</li>
<li>Affiliates that sign up for the program and refer themselves for a discount on our products.</li>
<li>Fraudulent form leads.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we have any reason to suspect fraud the affiliate will not be paid and the account will be terminated.</p>
