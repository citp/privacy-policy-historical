Details on what data we collect, how we collect it, and how we use it can be found under the appropriate headers below. If you have requests for information or want us to remove any of your stored data, please contact us by your preferred method listed above and we will arrange for that to be done – we respect your right to be forgotten.</p>
<p>If you are an EU resident, please note that by sharing your contact information with us, you consent to use of your personal information to receive communications from our company. We only send communications that we believe will be of interest or use to you. You can opt-out of these communications at any time, for any reason.</p>
<p><strong>Collected Information</strong><br>
The information we collect is gathered from several sources, which include product subscriptions, purchases or registrations, either from print or online forms; reader service cards; website message postings; survey information and direct or indirect purchases via telephone, direct mail, email, and other electronic sources. From these sources we may collect postal addresses, e-mail addresses, telephone numbers, and/or demographic information for those individuals that volunteer such information. For each visitor to our websites, our web server automatically recognizes the visitor’s domain name and IP address only. No other identifiable information is collected unless volunteered. In addition, we collect aggregate information on what web pages visitors visit.</p>
<p><strong>How We Use Collected Information</strong><br>
The information we collect is used to improve the content of our web pages, to customize the content and layout of our pages for each individual visitor, and/or to notify visitors about updates to our website. As part of a subscription, purchase and/or registration agreement, subscribers, purchasers and registrants will be contacted by us through mail, e-mail, and/or phone to communicate with them about their subscription, purchase and/or registration. They will be contacted for renewal, re-qualification, surveys, updates concerning their account profile and special offers related to their subscription, purchase and/or registration. We also use the information to contact them for marketing purposes on behalf of other reputable organizations, but we never share or give-away this collected information.</p>
<p><strong>Standard E-mail Communications</strong><br>
