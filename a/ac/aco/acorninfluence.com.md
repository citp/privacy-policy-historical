Additionally, Your information may be shared with other Users of the Platform, as needed to provide You our services under the Platform. For example, when an Advertiser creates or sends a message, the Advertiser’s first name, last name and company will be visible to selected Influencers who respond to the campaign. When an Influencer receives a message from an Advertiser and accepts the campaign, their blog name and link, URL, first name, last name and social media accounts will be visible to Advertiser.
