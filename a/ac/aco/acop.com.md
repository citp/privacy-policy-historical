**Information We Collect From You **

We collect information from you during the registration process and during the survey process. 

  * During our registration process, we collect your name, address, email address, and the names, date of birth, and gender of those in your household. We also collect the IP address of the computer you used at the time you registered and confirmed your registration 
  * We also gather information on your household – such as dwelling type, education level, gender, income, marital status, ethnicity, occupation, your Internet speed, and computer capabilities – to help us prescreen members for certain surveys.
  * Additional information may also be requested when you participate in surveys, such as your preferences, shopping patterns, and buying behavior. This information is used to pre-screen members for subsequent surveys and you may be invited to take additional surveys based upon your previous survey answers.   
For example, a client may want to do a survey of women age 18 to 55 who do not shop in a mall. We would send a short screening survey to determine which panel members meet our client's requirements.
  * None of the information collected in surveys is  reported by the names or addresses of members. Your individual information is always placed into anonymous, statistical summaries that are used in marketing research. No one outside of Decision Analyst will ever know how you personally answered any of the questions in our surveys.
