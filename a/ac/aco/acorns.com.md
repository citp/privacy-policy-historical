  * to share transaction data with a participating merchant where a transaction occurred as needed for the merchant to confirm a specific transaction occurred or you have earned a particular reward; for example, the date and amount of your purchase and the last 4 digits of your card number so the merchant can verify your purchase with its records if there is a missing or disputed transaction;

  * to provide participating merchants or Empyr aggregated and anonymized information relating specifically to registered card activity solely to allow participating merchants and Empyr to assess the results of their campaign(s);

  * to create a record of the transaction data and thereafter maintain and use data in connection with operating the Local Found Money program;

  * to conduct analysis for the improvement and optimization of the Local Found Money program; and

  * to provide information in order to respond to a request from government authority or a payment organization involved in a transaction with you or a merchant.




If you choose an account with an Acorns debit card and confirm agreement to the Local Found Money Terms, you authorize the sharing, exchange and use of transaction data described above and herein by and among Acorns and Empyr, applicable payment card networks and applicable merchants. See Local Found Money Terms to learn more about the data collection, use, and sharing practices in connection with the Local Found Money program.

 **Cookies / Tracking Technologies**

A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on the Site. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on the Site.

We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” directory.

If you reject cookies, you may still use the Site, but your ability to use some areas of the Site, such as contests or surveys, may be limited.

The use of cookies by our partners, affiliates, tracking utility company, and/or service providers is not covered by our Privacy Policy. We do not have access or control over these cookies. Our partners, affiliates, tracking utility company, and/or service providers use session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate the Site.

We employ (and/or our third-party advertising partner employs) a software technology called clear gifs (sometimes known as web beacons or web bugs), that help us better manage content on the Site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information.

 **Security**

The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information, such as a credit card number or financial information, on our forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).

We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on the Site, please contact us.

 **Changes to this Privacy Policy**

We may update this privacy policy to reflect changes to our information practices. If we make any material changes we will notify you by email or by means of a notice on this Site prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.
