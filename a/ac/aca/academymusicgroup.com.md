## PRIVACY POLICY

This Policy explains what personal information Academy Music Group, (known in this Policy as “ **we** ” or “ **AMG** ”) part of the [Live Nation](http://www.livenation.co.uk/about) family of companies, collect both online (including through apps) and offline and how we use it. Please read it carefully.

Generally, we collect information about you if you create an account, from your purchase of tickets, when you email or call us, or from box office purchases operated or administered by us, and when you use our websites, apps and social media. We use that and other information to provide better services, marketing and support to you and our other customers (including by analysing your information to provide you with a personalised experience).

When you, for example, create an account, purchase tickets, download one of our apps or contact us on the phone, we may ask your consent to use your information for certain purposes. Your choices about how we use information are described here.

AMG works together with various organisations to bring you the events you love.  We call these organisations our Event Partners and these range from, for example, the authorised ticket agents who sell tickets on our behalf, the venues in which our events are held or the artists who we promote. The ticket agents or venues may share your information with us, for the purposes described in this privacy policy. For more detail about how we collect your information click here.

AMG is responsible for the processing of your personal information in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998.
