PRIVACY POLICY – COOKIES          **       **

Cookies are texts strings which act as computer markers sent by a server (the Website service in this case) to the user's device (normally an Internet browser) when the user accesses a given page of a website. Cookies, which may also be set by different websites to the one the user is visiting (“third party cookies”), are automatically stored by the browser and retransmitted to the server which generated them each time the user accesses the same web page. In this manner, for example, cookies facilitate access to several web pages in order to improve the user's browsing (or allow storage of pages visited or other specific information, such as the most frequently consulted pages, connection errors, etc.), or allow profiling. For easy and complete use of a website, the user should therefore configure their browser to accept these cookies.

Browsers are often set to accept cookies automatically. However, users can change the pre-set configuration, to disable or delete cookies (each time or once and for all), although this could prevent optimal use of certain areas of the website. It is also possible to check the cookies modes and types stored on your browser by changing its cookie settings.

** These cookies allow the Website to remember your choices (such as the language or your geographic location) and propose them again on subsequent accesses, in order to provide better and customised services (they can be used to propose similar contents to those you have requested in the past, for instance).
  2. **Profiling cookies:  
** These cookies are used to send advertising messages and services in line with the preferences you have shown.
