The decision to provide this information is optional; however, if you elect not to provide such information, you may not be able to access certain content or features on the Site.

**Non-Personal Information**

**Cookies**

Academy of Art University utilizes cookies (a small file containing a string of characters that uniquely identifies your Web browser). Most Web browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you may reset your Web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, certain features of the website may not work if you delete or disable cookies. Certain Service Providers of Academy of Art University may use cookies in connection with the services they perform on the University’s behalf. Academy of Art University or its authorized service providers may use “remarketing” techniques to target messaging to you on third party web sites, which means that, by using cookies (as detailed above), your browser will anonymously (without including any personally identifiable information) inform the third party sites that you are a student at Academy of Art University so that you will receive authorized messaging from us or our authorized service providers on those third party sites and across the internet. You may opt-out of being tracked for such purposes by either enabling the “do not track” feature of your web browser.

**How Personal and Non-Personal Information is Used**

Non-Personal Information and Personal Information are used for University purposes only, including, but not limited to, processing applications, contacting visitors who indicate they would like to receive additional information from Academy of Art University and processing all other forms submitted through the site, etc. Academy of Art University will not sell, share, or rent Personal Information to third parties for their use, nor will the University otherwise disclose Personal Information to such third parties, without your express permission or as expressly disclosed in this Privacy Policy. From time to time, the University might establish a business relationship with other persons or entities whom the University believes to be trustworthy (“Service Providers”). These Service Providers receive the information reasonably necessary for them to perform services for Academy of Art University. Unless otherwise required by law, Academy of Art University does not disclose any Personal Information to third-parties; however, the University reserves the right to make exceptions, such as when it is believed that an emergency, illegal activity or some other reasonable basis exists for notifying or providing such information to the appropriate authorities.

**Security**

Information collected is stored on servers Academy of Art University manages, using standard security procedures and practices to protect information from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification or disclosure. However, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

**Deceased Student Record Handling & Awarding of Posthumous Degrees**

**Release of Deceased Student Records**

Education records are no longer protected under FERPA after a student’s death; consequently, the stewardship of records pertaining to a deceased individual is not a FERPA issue but a matter of institutional policy. During the first year after the death of the individual is recorded, Academy of Art University will release the educational records to family members and agencies contributing to the tuition payments of the student. Following the initial year, records will be provided to any individual upon request.

**Awarding of Posthumous Degrees**

The family or other interested parties of the deceased student may initiate a request for a posthumous degree through the Office of the Registrar’s Completion Committee. The committee will review the request and may recommend to the President the award of a posthumous degree, delivered to the family of the deceased. Posthumous degrees may be awarded when the student had satisfactorily completed at least two-thirds (2/3) of all coursework towards a degree and was actively enrolled at the time of death. Under special circumstances, the President or designee may grant the awarding of a posthumous degree or certificate for a student who has completed less than two-thirds (2/3) of the degree coursework. Petitions for a posthumous degree may be initiated at any time – there is no limit to how much time has transpired between the student’s passing and the request.

Effective Date: 3/7/2011
