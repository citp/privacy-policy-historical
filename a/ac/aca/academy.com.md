# Privacy Policy | Academy

This Privacy Policy (this "Policy") provides you with information related to how Academy, Ltd. d/b/a Academy Sports + Outdoors and its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively "Academy") collects, uses, protects, and discloses your personal information and non-personal information that is made available to Academy through various means, including information you provide to Academy when visiting one of our retail locations, when using our websites (including websites that may be operated on our behalf by our partners and service providers), and information we receive electronically from your computer and from other sources, including other websites, browsers, survey responses, marketing or research institutes and the like. Academy operates Academy.com, but may also from time to time operate other websites for limited purposes such as surveys or promotions (for example, academysurvey.com). These sites are collectively referred to in this Policy as “Sites” or, individually as a “Site.”

Academy is committed to treating your personal information (such as name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, and payment card information) with certain care. Academy does not share customer personal information (including e-mail addresses) outside of our subsidiaries and affiliates other than as set forth in this Policy.

At Academy, we strive to limit access to your personal information to only those persons and individuals who use it for the purposes set forth in this Policy. Any third parties to whom we provide personal information as set forth in this Policy are required to keep that information secure and confidential.

  


### How Academy Collects Personal Information/Categories of Personal Information Collected

Academy may receive information from its customers and Site visitors in several ways, including information submitted on our Sites or in our stores, and information collected by our partners or service providers. For example, you may choose to participate in a survey that requests certain transaction information (such as information from a store receipt) as well as your survey responses.

  
When you visit one of our Sites or stores, we may ask you for personal information so that we can provide you with the products, services, or information that you have requested and so that we may provide you with further communications and carry out the functions described in this Policy. For example, we may request and receive personal information from you when you:   


  * apply for a job;
  * apply for credit;
  * register for and use an online account with us (for example, your name and e-mail address);
  * place an order with us, or request that an item be shipped to you or someone else (for example, information necessary to process and fulfill your order, including your name, shipping and billing addresses, e-mail address, and credit card or other payment-related information);
  * request information from us (for example, your request and information we need to respond to your inquiry);
  * express an opinion in an online forum, respond to user polls, or enter any contests;
  * complete a survey about Academy or any of the products it offers; 
  * communicate with us in person, via e-mail, or using available online tools

  


### Additional Information Collection/Cookies, Web Beacons and Online Tools

Academy uses technology used by many major websites to gather information about devices used to access the Sites. This may include a computer's IP address, browser, domain and operating system information, or other information about the programs installed on or used by the device. This technology may also provide information about other pages accessed from or viewed from the device, and identification or verification information provided to our Site by such devices. This information can be obtained through the use of commonly used or standard data collection tools such as web server logs, cookies and web beacons, as well as from the use of digital identification tools. Cookies are pieces of information that Sites or other sites may transfer to your computer. Such information is helpful in enabling Academy and our partners and service providers to enhance your shopping experience and tailor our Sites and messages to your needs and preferences. Web beacons are small strings of code that may be used along with a cookie. Server logs, digital identification tools and cookies also assist us by identifying the types of browsers and operating systems used most by visitors to our Sites, information about the applications or programs used by such systems. Collectively, these technologies provide us with information such as how visitors found our Site(s) (for example, via a search engine, directory, other website, etc.) and move through the Sites, as well as information about site usage and browsing history. All of this information enables us to improve the Sites and tailor them to individual Site visitor needs and preferences.

At any time, you can disable the use of cookies in your browser and still have access to most of the information on most of our Sites. However, some features and functionalities may not work if you disable cookies. For example, you may not be able to access your account information (although you will still be able to call or e-mail us), receive customized content, participate in certain surveys or forums, or make purchases through the Sites

  


### Advertising, Analytics, and Online Tracking

Academy may use third-party advertising and analytics service providers to serve ads to you when you visit certain of our Sites or other websites (including on social media), and to analyze the use of our Sites and the effectiveness of our marketing efforts. These service providers may collect non-identifiable information about your visits to our website, and your interactions with our products, services, and your reaction to our marketing communications (such as what you do when you receive a marketing communication from us). Such non-identifiable information does not include your name, address, e-mail address or other personal information.

Academy and our service providers may collect personally identifiable information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services, and third parties may similarly collect such information, including when you visit our Sites. Our Sites currently do not respond to web-browser “do-not-track” or other similar mechanisms. Please note that not all tracking will stop even if you delete cookies.

  


### Your Account

If you set up an account for use on one of our Sites, we will collect information from you as necessary to support your use of the account and to process transactions you make using the account. In addition, when you create an account, you will be required to provide your e-mail address and create a password. It is your responsibility to maintain the confidentiality and security of your e-mail address and password. In the event your password is lost or stolen it is your responsibility to notify us by calling 800-922-2336 or by [Clicking Here](https://academy.custhelp.com/app/ask). You remain responsible for all actions taken using your account until you provide us with such notice and we have a reasonable opportunity to deactivate your account.

You may review the personal information that Academy has about you and change it by making a request to our Contact Center at 800-922-2336 or by [Clicking Here](https://academy.custhelp.com/app/ask).

  


### How Academy Uses Your Personal Information

As described above, we use your personal information to fulfill your requests or satisfy any other purpose for which you provided information to us. We also use that information to: perform our everyday business; identify fraud; perform legal compliance operations; provide you with notices; analyze the quality of our products and services; analyze the usage and effectiveness of our marketing efforts; and provide you with advertising, content, and marketing that we believe may be of interest to you (including advertisements that may be served to you elsewhere on the Internet).

Academy also may combine your information with other information to create aggregate or summary reports, and we may provide data in aggregate form to other parties for marketing, advertising, and other purposes. If Academy provides information to non-affiliates in aggregate form, we will not disclose any personal information concerning specific customers. We may also use and disclose information gathered through our Sites for research and analytics purposes, as well as to help detect fraud, or, in the case of surveys you fill out through one of the Sites, to help detect other inappropriate survey responses.

  


### How Academy Shares Information

In order to operate our Sites and our retail stores, and provide you with the products and services you have requested, as well as ads and information that we believe may be of interest to you, we occasionally need to share information with third parties and with our subsidiaries and affiliates. We may share your information within our family of companies, including with subsidiaries and affiliates to allow uses of that information that are described in this Policy. For example, we may transmit your personal information to third-party service providers who assist us in processing orders and payments, shipping products, sending catalogs, performing surveys, conducting sweepstakes, processing job applications, sending e-mails and newsletters, and helping us decide whether to extend credit to you via arrangements that we may have with credit card issuers. We have agreements with these third-party service providers directing them to protect your privacy by implementing similar security measures to those we employ and using your information only as authorized by Academy. In addition to our service providers, we also may provide information (for example, postal addresses, e-mail address, and telephone numbers) to certain outside companies and marketing partners so they can let you know about products or services that might be of interest. If you do not wish to receive such contact, please notify Academy by using our [Online Form](https://academy.custhelp.com/app/ask).

We may also share your information upon your request, or when we believe it is permitted or required by law, or, in connection with a business acquisition of an Academy entity or one of our service providers, your information held by that entity may be transferred to an acquiring entity.

  


### How Academy Secures and Protects Your Information

Academy takes information security very seriously, and protecting your personal information is an important priority. When you place an order through one of our Sites, we use several physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards designed to help make your information secure. For example, Academy.com may employ such industry-standard technology such as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and encryption technology that works with all Internet browsers to provide a recognized high-level of security for online transactions. However, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

Academy also has satisfied its requirements under the Payment Card Industry ("PCI") security standards, which protects your credit card information by ensuring that it is processed, stored, and transmitted in a secure manner. We use your personal information to fulfill your orders and requests, and we do not retain your credit card information. We currently use a third-party processor for credit card information, so you provide you information directly to that processor, not to us.

Academy uses your personal information gathered on our Sites and in our stores to fulfill your orders and requests.

If you are still unsure about the security of your information traveling across the Internet, you can place an order with us by calling our Customer Service Department toll-free at 1-888-922-2336 Monday through Saturday, between 7:00am and 10:00pm CT and Sunday, between 8:00am and 8:00pm CT.

  


### How Academy Treats Your E-mail and Postal Communications

When visiting Academy's retail stores or our Sites, you may provide personal information and choose to receive e-mail and/or SMS text updates, invitations, product announcements, or other information from us. We may use a third -party e-mail service provider to send e-mail communications from Academy about our products and services. Academy requires its third-party service providers to use your personal information only for e-mail services requested by Academy and to keep your information secure and confidential. At any time, you can choose to remove your name from our e-mail list by:

  


  * using the Unsubscribe link at the bottom of each e-mail sent by Academy;
  * using our online form;
  * sending a "stop" message to 22369 to unsubscribe from SMS text messaging; 
  * contacting Customer Service at 1-888-922-2336



Please note that we will separately obtain express or implied consent from you before contacting you whenever we are required to do so by law (such as the Canadian “anti-spam” law or the Telephone Consumer Protection Act). If you sign up for our Mobile Offers, terms and conditions, including disclosure of dialing technology and that consent is not a requirement for purchase, are provided with any invitation to register.

If you provide us with your postal address while in one of our stores, on our website, or through other means, you may receive periodic advertisements, circulars, or other promotional materials from us. If you do not wish to receive postal mailings from Academy, or third-party organizations, please notify Academy by using our [Online Form](https://academy.custhelp.com/app/ask). Please provide us with your name and postal address, and identify which lists you wish to be removed from, so that we can be sure your information is deleted from the appropriate mailing lists.

  


### Children’s Privacy

Consistent with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, Academy does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information of children under the age of thirteen (13). You may not use our Sites or provide information to us if you are under the age of 13. If Academy becomes aware that information has been collected about a person under the age of 13, we will remove and permanently delete that information as soon as reasonably possible. If you are a parent or guardian who believes that your minor child under the age of 13 has submitted personal information or other information to us, please contact us. Once we verify that you are the parent or legal guardian, we will cooperate with you to discuss what, if any, personal information we have collected about your child and how that information may have been shared or used.

  


### California Minors

If a California resident who is under 18 chooses to express an opinion in an online forum or otherwise post information for others to view on our Site, those opinions and information can always be removed by the minor who posted them by simply following the instructions posted on the forum. Note that deleting your own content does not completely or comprehensively remove the opinions and information because third parties may have made copies and/or posted them elsewhere.

  


### Your California Privacy Rights

California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits Site visitors who are California residents to request that we not share your personally identifiable information with third parties if we know or have reason to know that the third parties use the personally identifiable information for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. For their protection, we exercise this right on behalf of our California customers and require third parties hired by Academy to keep all personally identifiable information related to California customers secure and to not permit any use of personally identifiable information for direct marketing or any other purposes not authorized by Academy.

  


### Social Media

Academy maintains social media pages and accounts (including through Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, YouTube, and Instagram). Actions you take in connection with social media pages may be reflected in a manner visible to others; for example, if you “Like” us on Facebook or post a comment, others may be able to see that you have done so. The collection and use of information on any of our social media pages is governed by the privacy policy of the applicable social media site or service.

We may receive personal information from a social media page when you connect through a social media feed, post content, or otherwise interact with us using social media tools. For example, we may receive basic Facebook account information through our Facebook Page(s). Also, when you “like,” “subscribe to,” or send a “tweet” to us through social media, we may receive your username, handle, and any other available personal information from the social media site. All information received from social media sites may be used by us in the same manner and for the same purposes as described in this Policy with respect to similar information we obtain through our Site, including to allow us to send and tailor messages that we believe may be of interest to you. We may use certain custom audience tools to display interest-based content or ads to you while you are using social media.

  


### Legally Required Disclosures

If Academy receives a subpoena, court order, or other legal process requesting your personal information, Academy may, in its sole discretion, disclose your personal information pursuant to such legal process without providing any notice to you.

  


### Other Websites

Sites may contain links to other websites that are not under our control, and conversely, other websites that are not under our control may contain links to our Sites. Those websites have their own policies regarding privacy and security, and we encourage you to review such policies while visiting each site. Academy.com is not responsible for the privacy practices, security, or content of linked websites. Academy provides these links solely for the convenience of our customers and Site visitors.

  


### Updates to Privacy Policy

Academy reserves the right to change, supplement or update this Policy. We will alert you to these changes by noting the date that this Policy was last updated at the beginning of the Policy. Any changes will be effective only after the effective date of the change and will not affect any dispute arising prior to the effective date of the change. We encourage you to review this Policy from time to time to make sure that you understand how Academy may gather, secure, use, and share your personal information. Your continued use of our Sites and patronage of Academy's retail stores constitutes your agreement to and acceptance of the Policy and any changes to it.

  


### Additional Rights

Applicable laws may give you additional rights that are not described in this online privacy policy.
