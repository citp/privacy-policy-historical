**3.** **Additional Information Collection/Cookies, and Online Tools**

Academy uses generally available technology, such as web server logs, cookies, web beacons, other digital identification tools, and tracking technologies (collectively, “Technology”), to receive information about how users access our Websites or otherwise interact with us digitally. For example, Academy uses Technology to receive information about how users found our Website(s) and navigate and use our Websites. All of this information enables us to improve your digital experience. 

Technology also helps Academy and its Partners to enhance and personalize your shopping experience and our communications with you. Information received by Academy includes your device's IP address, physical location, browser, domain, or operating system, the address of a referring website, the path you take through our Websites, browsing history and other information about your time interacting with us digitally.

**4.** **Advertising, Analytics, and Online Tracking**

Academy may use Partners for advertising and analysis, including interest-based advertising (IBA) (also known as Online Behavioral Advertising). Interest-based advertising is tailored to your interests and appears on our Websites, in emails or other communications from Academy and its Partners, and on other websites (including on social media). 

Our Partners may use Technology to receive both personal and non-personal information about your digital experience with Academy. 

The information received by Academy and Academy’s Partners based upon your digital activities may be supplemented with information from other sources so that we can improve your shopping experience. 

Academy and its Partners may also receive personal information about your digital activities over time and across third party websites or online services. Third parties may employ their own Technology in order to similarly receive such information, including when you visit our Websites and Digital Platforms. This Policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, tracking technologies used by a non-Partner third party.

**8.** **How Academy Shares Information**

In order to operate our Digital Platforms and our retail stores, and provide you with the products and services you request, as well as ads and information that we believe may be of interest to you, we occasionally need to share information with Partners. For example, we may transmit your personal information to Partners who assist us in processing orders and payments, shipping products, sending catalogs, performing surveys, conducting sweepstakes, processing job applications, or sending e-mails and newsletters. We may also share information provided to us within our family of companies, including with subsidiaries and affiliates to allow uses of that information that are described in this Policy. Academy may provide your information in aggregated form (not identifying specific customers) to Partners for marketing, advertising, and other everyday business purposes. In addition, we may provide information (for example, postal addresses, e-mail address, and telephone numbers) to Partners for them to communicate with you about products or services.

Additionally, we transmit personal information to third party credit card issuers to facilitate their decision whether to extend credit. We have agreements with these credit card issuers Partners requiring them to protect your _privacy_ by implementing appropriate security measures and using your information only as authorized by Academy. If you do not wish to receive these communications from Academy’s Partners, please contact Academy’s [Customer Care](https://academy.custhelp.com/)[.](https://academy.custhelp.com/)

We may also share your information upon your request, when we believe it is permitted or required by law, or in connection with a business acquisition of an Academy entity or one of our service providers (i.e. your information may be transferred to an acquiring entity).

**9.** **How Academy Secures and Protects Your Information**

Academy takes information security seriously, and protecting your personal information is an important priority to us. When you place an order through one of our Digital Platforms, we use appropriate physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to help secure your information. You are responsible for any security measures on the device or application you use to access Academy’s Digital Platforms. However, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure regardless of the security measures employed by Academy or you. 

Academy satisfies the Payment Card Industry (" **PCI** ") security standards and requirements, which protect your credit card information by ensuring that it is processed, stored, and transmitted in a secure manner. We use your personal information to fulfill your orders and requests. We use a third-party processor for credit card transactions. Your credit card information is sent directly to that processor without being stored on Academy systems.

In addition to using our Websites to place an order, you may place an order with us by calling Customer Care toll-free at 1-888-922-2336, between 7:00 a.m. and 12:00 a.m. Central Time.
