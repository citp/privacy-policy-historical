Academy of Financial Trading Website Privacy Statement 

Academy of Financial Trading (AFT) is committed to protecting your privacy and takes its responsibility regarding the security of customer information very seriously. Our website Privacy Statement sets out what information we collect, how we collect it, what we do with it and how we protect this information. Any personal data is collected and processed in accordance with Irish and EU data protection laws. 

**Collection of Personal Data:**

In order to facilitate the provision of education, we collect personal details from you together with information we learn about you from your use of our website. These details may include (where applicable) your name, address, telephone number, e-mail and IP addresses, credit/debit card or other payment details. To provide location-based services we may collect, use, and share precise location data, including the real-time geographic location of your computer or device through GPS, Bluetooth, and your IP address, along with crowd-sourced Wi-Fi hotspot and cell tower locations. This location data is collected anonymously, unless you provide consent. You may withdraw consent to AFT and our partners’ collection, use, transmission, processing and maintenance of location and account data at any time by not using the location-based features and turning off the Location Services settings (as applicable) on your device and computer. 

Your data may be used for the following purposes: providing products and services you request, contacting you regarding your course, credit or other payment card verification/screening, legal purposes, statistical and marketing analysis, systems testing, customer surveys, customer relations communications and offering you services and products we believe may interest you.

**Sharing information about you:**

We follow strict security procedures in the storage and disclosure of student information.

We may disclose your information to trusted contracted companies who act as "data processors" on our behalf for the purposes set out in this Privacy Statement. AFT has transfer agreements in place with all entities to which it transfers data for processing on its behalf. The agreements provide for specific and limited processing of user data in service of AFT’s operations and have been prepared so as to meet the requirements of Irish and EU law.

We may also pass your information on to government authorities or enforcement bodies for compliance with legal requirements.

AFT operates businesses in multiple jurisdictions, some of which are not located in the European Economic Area (EEA). While countries outside the EEA do not always have strong data protection laws, we will ensure that AFT and our services providers process your information in a secure manner and in accordance with this Privacy Statement.

You may be able to access third party social media services through our website or before coming to our website. When you are registered with your social service account, we will obtain the personal information you choose to share with us through these social media services pursuant to their privacy settings in order to improve and personalize your use of our website. This may include a list of friends and reviews of other users in your network. We may also use social media plugins on our website. As a result your information will be shared with your social media provider and possibly presented on your social media profile to be shared with others in your network. Please refer to the privacy policy of these third-party social media providers to find out more about these practices.

We understand the importance of taking extra precautions to protect the privacy and safety of children. Accordingly, children under 16 will not be permitted to open an AFT account. We will take reasonable steps to delete any AFT account or information created by a child under 16, as soon as we learn about it.

All payment details are transmitted over a secure connection (Secure Socket Layer-SSL) across dedicated network infrastructure (Multiprotocol Label Switching-MPLS) and stored in compliance with Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS).
