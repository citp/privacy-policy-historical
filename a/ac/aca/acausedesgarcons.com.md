Sophisticated users who use the Sturb App in an unauthorized manner, or other users who change their location while you remain in the same location, may use this information to determine your exact location and may be able to determine your identity.  Please note: even if you choose to hide your Distance Information, the Sturb App will continue to sort and display your profile based on your relative distance from other users, so your Distance Information may still be approximated by other users.
