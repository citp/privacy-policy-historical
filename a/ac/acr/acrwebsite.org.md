# Association For Consumer Research Website Privacy Policy | ACR

**This policy was last updated on August 21,2004**

The Association for Consumer Research (“ACR”) has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our strong commitment to privacy. ACR is deeply committed to respecting and protecting your right to privacy and takes your privacy seriously. We have very strict privacy policies and we strive to keep your personal and financial information secure. To that end, we have prepared this privacy policy to disclose and describe our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website.

Most of all, we value your privacy . We do not sell, rent, loan, or give your email address or other personal information to anybody and will never do so.

**Collection of your Personal Information**

You can visit most pages on our site without giving us any information about yourself. But sometimes we do need information to provide services that you request, and this privacy policy explains data collection and use in those situations. Please read the complete ACR privacy policy below in conjunction with our [Terms and Conditions](https://web.archive.org/web/20171212032525id_/http%3A//www.acrwebsite.org/web/about-website/terms-of-use.aspx).

This privacy policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information that we collect when you are on our site, and when you use our services.

  * We pledge to hold all information you provide to us in absolute privacy.
  * We will NEVER sell or rent your name or personal information to any third party without your express permission.
  * We NEVER sell or rent our mailing list.
  * Only authorized employees may access your information.
  * All employees are required to adhere to our strict privacy policies and any employee who violates the privacy policy is subject to termination and other disciplinary measures, up to being criminally prosecuted for their violation.

  
**Use of Your Personal Information**

If you decide to become a member, you will receive a short series of orientation emails from ACR. From time to time, members may receive notification of new services, changes to policies or price adjustments. We will not send you other email at the address you provide, except for infrequent communications to resolve issues that may arise with your own ACR account. More routine announcements are made in our periodic newsletter, rather than via email.

Our site uses cookies to save your username and password if you become a member. This means you don't have to re-enter these items each time you visit our site. You can always delete this cookie from your computer.

Additionally, we use session variables to aid in the development of various features on the site. These session variables disappear after 20 minutes or when the user exits a browser. Thus, this information is not stored for any reason other than as indicated.

We may also use personal information in a manner that does not identify you specifically nor allow you to be contacted but does identify certain criteria about our users in general. For example, we may inform third parties about the number of registered users, number of unique visitors, and the pages most frequently browsed.

Aside from these uses of user information - and we have no knowledge of this information except at an anonymous level - we do not sell, nor plan to sell any user information to anyone.

**Protection of Children's Personal Information**

ACR is a general audience site and does not knowingly collect any personal information from children. While our website may be viewed by children, we do not wish to receive data from children. ACR encourages parents and guardians to spend time online with their children and to participate in the interactive activities offered on the sites their children visit. No information should be submitted to, or posted at, the ACR web site by visitors under 18 years of age without the consent of their parent or guardian.

**Links to Third Party Sites**

This website contains links to other web sites that are not controlled by ACR ("Third Party Sites"). Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. The ACR Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by this website.

**Changes to this Privacy Policy**

ACR will occasionally update this privacy policy. When we do, we will also revise the "last updated" date at the top of the privacy policy. For material changes to this statement, ACR will notify our users by placing prominent notice on the site.
