HOW WE COLLECT OTHER INFORMATION

We and our third party service providers may collect other Information in a variety of ways, including:

– Through your browser: Certain information is collected by most browsers, such as your Media Access Control (MAC) address, computer type (Windows or Macintosh), screen resolution, operating system version and Internet browser type and version. We use this information to ensure that our Site functions properly.

– Using cookies: Cookies are pieces of information stored directly on the computer that you are using. Cookies allow us to collect information such as device type, browser type, time spent on the Site, pages visited and other browsing history, language preferences and usernames. We and our service providers use the information for security purposes, to facilitate navigation, display information more effectively, and to personalize your experience while visiting the Site, as well as for online tracking purposes. We can recognize your computer to assist your use of our site. We also gather statistical information about the usage of the site in order to continually improve the design and functionality, understand how customers use the site and to assist us with resolving questions regarding the Site.

– If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to automatically decline cookies, or be given the choice of declining or accepting the transfer to your computer of a particular cookie (or cookies) from a particular web site. Information about the procedure you are required to follow in order to disable cookies can be found on your Internet browser provider’s web site. If cookies are disabled, however, not all features of the site may operate as intended.

– Using pixel tags and other similar technologies: Pixel tags (also known as web beacons and clear GIFs) may be used in connection with some Site pages and HTML-formatted email messages to, among other things, track the actions of Site users and email recipients, measure the success of our marketing campaigns and compile statistics about Site usage and response rates.

– IP Address: Your “IP Address” is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). An IP Address is identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever a user visits the Site, along with the time of the visit and the page(s) that were visited. Collecting IP Addresses is standard practice on the Internet and is done automatically by many web sites. We use IP Addresses for purposes such as calculating Site usage levels, helping diagnose server problems, and administering the Site.

– From you: Information such as your location, as well as other information, such as your preferred means of communication, is collected when you voluntarily provide this information. Unless combined with personal Information, this information does not personally identify you or any other user of the site.

– By aggregating information: Aggregated Personal Information does not personally identify you or any other user of the site, (for example, we may aggregate Personal Information to calculate the percentage of our users who have a particular telephone area code).

HOW WE USE AND DISCLOSE OTHER INFORMATION

Please note that we may use and disclose other Information for any purpose, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law. If we are required to treat other Information as Personal Information under applicable law, then, in addition to the uses listed in the “How We Collect Other Information” section above, we may use and disclose other Information for all the purposes for which we use and disclose Personal Information.

In some instances, we may combine Other Information with Personal Information (such as combining your name with your geographical location). If we combine any Other Information with Personal Information, the combined information will be treated by us as Personal Information as long as it is combined.

THIRD PARTY SITES

This Privacy Policy does not address, and we are not responsible for, the privacy, information or other practices of any third parties, including any third party operating any site to which this Site contains a link. The inclusion of a link on the Site does not imply endorsement of the linked site by us or by our affiliates.
