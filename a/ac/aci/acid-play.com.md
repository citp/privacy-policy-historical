# Privacy Policy

Your privacy is important to us so we limit the information we keep about you.

### Information We Collect

Acid-Play allows you to submit your views in the form of user reviews. Before submitting these user reviews we ask that you give your name. We will store and publicly display the name you enter. We suggest using an alias if you don't want personal information published.

In order to provide you with a list of similar games for every game you view on Acid-Play, we collect and store a one way encoded version of your IP address when you view any review page. One way encoding ensures that your IP address can't be extracted from our database.

These companies may use information (not including your name, address email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, email us.

We use a third party traffic analysis company to help us better understand how you use Acid-Play. This company uses a cookie that collects anonymous traffic data. If you would like more information please email us.
