# Our Privacy Policy

   
---  
  
## Your Privacy Is Important To Us! 

Our privacy policy is simple.

We do not share your personal information with any other organizations or individuals. We keep all information you provide to us, no matter how or why you provide it (ex., becoming an affiliate, ordering our products, etc.) completely confidential, and use it only for the purpose that you intended (ex., sending you your post order receipt).

Only those employees with relevant business duties (ex., support staff) may access personal information, and only to perform their duties. They are subject to dismissal for any privacy violation.

We promise never to provide any information about our subscribers, customers or affiliates to any third party, except of course in the unusual event should we be required to do so by law.

We do use cookies, but only to facilitate tracking of the order fulfillment processes. We do not collect or combine any information that you provide to us with any other demographic information from any other sources. We do not use third party tracking services such as DoubleClick. In other words, we have no way of knowing that you are you. Your visit is entirely private and anonymous.

Please contact our customer support line at [support@acidalkalinediet.com](mailto:support@acidalkalinediet.com) for assistance. If applicable, please include **your ClickBank Confirmation Number** in your email subject.
