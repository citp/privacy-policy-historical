# ACS Privacy Policy | ACS

**General** This Privacy Statement (“Statement”) describes the online privacy practices for ACS websites maintained by Affiliated Computer Services, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“ACS”). It also describes our privacy practices related to certain personal information that ACS receives in the United States from the European Union and Switzerland (see the “Safe Harbor” section below).

By using our sites you agree that your use is subject to the terms of this Statement and you consent to the collection, use and storage of your information by ACS in accordance with this Statement and as may be more specifically explained on each website. ACS may change this Statement at any time and will display the changes here in the form of a new Statement. Because your use of this website after changes have been posted indicates your agreement with those changes, we encourage you to visit this Statement on a regular basis. If you are not comfortable with using this website in accordance with this Statement, please exit immediately.

You may have accessed this ACS website as a result of a link from another ACS site. This Statement applies to all ACS websites linked to this site except where more specific information is provided on the linked site with respect to the collection, use and storage of personal information.

**What Personal Information May Be Collected**

ACS may collect personal information about you when you use our websites; place orders for products or services; request information such as quotes, newsletters, promotional materials or services from ACS; participate in surveys or promotional activities; seek information about employment opportunities or apply for a position; or participate in other activities on our sites. The personal information we collect may include name, physical address, telephone number, email address and other personal information that you choose to provide. For certain activities, such as when you order a product or service, we may ask for your payment card information, driver’s license number, social security number or equivalent national identification number and date of birth. If you express an interest in employment with ACS, we may ask you to provide your resume/CV and other relevant information.

When you visit our site we may collect information through the use of a "cookie". A cookie is a small file that a website can send to your browser and then is stored on your computer. This type of technology is designed to tell us when you reenter our site, where you visit within our site, and the type of browser you use. You are not required to accept any cookie we might use, although some areas of a site may not be operational without the use of cookies. You can disable cookies on your computer by changing the settings in your browser. The information collected helps us identify data relating to usage and trends, address any problems with site administration, and to further improve this site. We also may automatically collect certain information relating to you, such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address, Internet service provider, type of operating system, the time and date you accessed the Site, the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) from which you arrived at our site and, if you browse away from our site by clicking on a link on our site, the URL you click on.

We do not require you to provide your Social Security Number on our site unless a secure connection is used or the SSN is encrypted. We also do not require you to enter your SSN to access our sites without requiring additional authentication.

**How Personal Information May Be Used**

The information we collect may be used to facilitate your use of our site and improve the operation of the site; respond to and fulfill any requests you make for products, services or other support from ACS; communicate with you about the products, services and promotional offers available from ACS or our business partners. We also may use the information to implement terms and restrictions associated with purchases you make or separate contracts you enter into with ACS, if any. Finally, if you express an interest in employment opportunities with ACS we will use any information submitted, such as a resume/CV, to evaluate candidates for employment purposes. Other uses of information may be evident from the particular site or point at which we collect the information.

ACS will retain personal information collected for as long as it is needed to fulfill the purpose for which the information was collected or as required by applicable law.

**Sharing of Personal Information with Third Parties**

ACS will not sell or give your personal information to third parties for their use for purposes unrelated to ACS without your permission, except as noted in this Statement or on our websites.

ACS may share personal information about you with our subsidiaries and affiliated companies. We also may share personal information with our suppliers, contractors and agents who perform functions on our behalf, with other third party business partners, or in connection with products and services offered by ACS or a request made by you. On occasion when ACS transfers personal information to one of those third parties for purposes of responding to a request from you, that third party may need to furnish the information to an unaffiliated party for further assistance.

ACS may disclose your personal information as we consider necessary to comply with the law or requests by governmental authorities, in connection with litigation, dispute resolution, or administration of this Statement or a possible violation of this site's Terms of Use or the rights of ACS or a third party. In addition, ACS may disclose or receive personal information in connection with a possible sale, purchase, merger or other reorganization of a business.

**Communications**

From time to time ACS or our business partners may send you marketing communications regarding products and services that can be purchased directly from ACS. For some communications you can choose to receive them or opt-out by using the checkbox on the web form. If you receive marketing communications from ACS and wish to discontinue them, please contact the sender as identified in the email or you may contact ACS through the ACS website.

**Security**

To protect the personal information we receive, ACS uses certain security measures designed to guard against the loss, misuse and alteration of that information. It should be recognized, however, that we cannot guarantee that transmission of data over the Internet will be absolutely secure. Due to the open nature of the Internet the information you provide may be in environments that do not have adequate security measures and may be accessed and used by persons other than those intended. As a result, while protection of your personal information is important to us, ACS is not able to ensure the security of information you transmit to us and you assume the risk of any third party obtaining that information. Upon receipt of your information ACS will strive to ensure its security on our systems.

ACS may use Social Security Numbers in connection with the sale or licensing of products and services. We use security measures designed to protect the confidentiality of the SSNs while in ACS’ possession and control. No unlawful disclosure of SSNs is permitted. Contracts with clients, suppliers or other third parties may contain additional requirements relating to the protection of SSNs. ACS will comply with all applicable laws relating to the use, access and disclosure of SSNs.

**Links to Other Websites**

Our websites may contain links to other sites, not maintained by ACS. If you choose to access those sites, please review the privacy statement applicable to each site. The links to other sites are made available as a convenience to you and ACS is not responsible for the privacy policies and information collection practices of those sites.

**ACS Client Web Sites**

In the course of providing services to its clients, ACS may operate websites for certain clients that involve the collection, use and retention of personal information. For example, if you are a health plan member, health plan provider, a patient or other individual who does business with an ACS client, ACS may collect, use and maintain personal information in order to provide you with services on behalf of the ACS client. Those activities are conducted by ACS under a contract between ACS and the client. This Statement is not intended to modify the terms of the contract between ACS and the client. If you have questions about the handling of your personal information that are not addressed on the specific website through which ACS conducts those activities on behalf of the client, please use the contact information listed on that site or communicate with the ACS client.

**Global Presence**

ACS has employees, clients and suppliers in many countries around the world. The management, operational and technical processes and systems used by ACS may involve transfer of information across borders. For example, personal information that ACS obtains may be sent to systems outside the country in which you initially provided the information, and it may be processed and stored in a different country, including jurisdictions that may not have data privacy laws that provide protection equivalent to such laws in the country in which you reside. By your use of this site you consent to the transfer of your personal information outside of your country to any other country. Regardless of the location from which you provide your personal information to ACS through its websites, ACS will take steps to handle it in a secure manner in accordance with this Statement and all applicable laws.

**Children**

ACS does not market its products or services to children under thirteen years of age and does not wish to collect personal information from children.

Specifically, ACS may receive and process European Personal Information about client contacts and other visitors to this website who purchase, or may purchase, products or services from ACS on behalf of their companies (“Client Contact Data”).

ACS also receives certain European Personal Information about client employees, beneficiaries, dependents, customers and others in connection with the provision of information technology, business process management, and related services to our clients (“Client Controlled Data”). ACS acts as a data processor with respect to the handling and processing of the Client Controlled Data, and in accordance with our client’s instructions. ACS has no contractual relationship with the individuals concerned.
