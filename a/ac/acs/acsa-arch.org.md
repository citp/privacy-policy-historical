# Privacy Policy

ACSA takes privacy issues seriously and wants our members and website users to be aware of the types of information we collect and what we do with it. These privacy practices pertain to our website and our database.

**I. Changes**

We update our Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes to it, we will provide users notice through our website, or by other means, to provide the opportunity to update settings in response to the changes. Users’ continued use of our website after we publish or send a notice about our changes to these terms means that users are consenting to the updated terms. 

**II. Website**

The Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture (ACSA) website is controlled and operated in whole or in part by the ACSA from its offices within the United States. Users outside of the United States who access the ACSA website do so at their own risk and are responsible for compliance with applicable local laws. 

**III. Intellectual Property**

ACSA reserves all of its intellectual property rights over the Code and Content published or transmitted through its websites. Users may not modify or use the Content or Code received from these sites for any purpose other than those permitted.

**IV. Supply and Use of User and Member Data**

All website user data and all data about ACSA members are obtained through normal business practices, including but not limited to mailing list sign-up, membership applications, online purchases, and event registrations. Data collected through ACSA’s website include data provided by ACSA users (user data) as well as data stored in ACSA’s databases collected through ACSA’s membership activities (member data). 

**A. What Information Do We Collect?**

**1\. Overview**  
Users and members must register to obtain any product or service (tangible or virtual) offered by the ACSA. Some products and services also require ACSA membership. Registration may require a valid mailing address be submitted to appropriately fulfill a product or service request. Online registration requires a valid email be provided because an online profile is created during the registration process.

As outlined below, ACSA may ask for additional demographics such as race, age, sex, birth date, and education. 

Users purchasing a product or service online are asked to provide a credit card number. ACSA does not store credit card information after the transaction is complete.  However, it does maintain a reference number provided by its credit card gateway. ACSA follows Payment Card Industry (PCI) standards for all sales.

**2\. ACSA Faculty and Supporting Member Data**  
ACSA collects demographic and professional information about our members—that is, individual faculty at ACSA full and affiliate member schools and Supporting category members of the ACSA. 

Because the large majority of ACSA members have an appointment at an ACSA member architecture education program, we have collected membership information about faculty, staff, and administrators from the programs themselves. The source for this information may be the school's faculty, staff, or administrators, or public sources of information, such as the university website. ACSA collects other information directly from our individual members and from website users. Below are three categories of information that we collect and who is able to change or access this information. 

**a.** **Faculty Appointment Information Supplied by Member Program**  
Due to our membership structure, ACSA relies on program administrators (i.e., deans, directors, chairs, department heads, etc.) to identify faculty and staff members and supply information about their appointment to the architecture program (e.g., full-time, part-time, tenured/nontenured, etc.). The program’s head administrator receives online access to the program’s roster of faculty in our database. The head administrator is able to add or delete faculty members from the roster, and can add and change data about these faculty and staff members. If a member believes the academic appointment information is erroneous, please contact the membership department at ACSA, [membership@acsa-arch.org](mailto:membership@acsa-arch.org).

**b. Optional Demographic Data**  
ACSA collects demographic information from website users and members. This information is supplied by the individual user or member on a voluntary basis and may include, but may not be limited to, race, ethnicity, LGBT status, and disability status. The optional demographic information supplied by an individual will remain confidential within ACSA’s uses, as described below. 

**c. Optional Professional Information**  
ACSA also collects optional information on the professional background of faculty and administrators. This information includes, but may not be limited to, courses taught, research and practice expertise, licensure status, terminal degree, and faculty appointment information such as rank, time commitment, and various roles within an architecture education program. 

**3\. Contact Information**

ACSA members may maintain multiple addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers with the organization; one of these should be identified as the primary contact information for correspondence with the organization. 

**4\. Website Logs**

ACSA website usage logs generate non-identifying site usage data, such as the number of hits and visits to our sites. This information is used for internal purposes by technical support staff to provide better services to the public and may also be provided to others. However, the statistics contain no personal information and cannot be used to gather such information. Site information is used to confirm participation in the ACSA programming and may be used to advise participants of the numbers of visitors who come to our site from their sites. No personal information is collected.

Web servers keep track of the pages visited on the ACSA websites and the amount of time spent on those pages. ACSA only uses this information for statistical purposes, to find out which pages users find most useful and to improve the website.

**5\. Cookies**

A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to a user’s browser from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. ACSA uses what is referred to as Essential or Required Cookies to support the basic functionality of the site (e.g., login, authentication, authorization, cart, etc.). Our websites are not set up to track, collect, or distribute personal information not entered by visitors. Users can still access ACSA’s website with a browser set to reject cookies. 

**B. How Do We Use Your Information?**

**1\. Email and Mail Contacts**

a. All electronic communications from ACSA adhere to the CAN SPAM Act. 

b. ACSA Use. ACSA maintains an email contact list for weekly ACSA Update mailings as well as other electronic correspondence. Individual users either add themselves to this list by signing up to receive emails, or their emails are provided by the program administrator to identify them as members. In cases where ACSA receives new-member contact information from a member program administrator, the new member is contacted and asked to confirm they are willing to receive regular mailings from ACSA. 

c. Third Party Use. ACSA occasionally makes the mailing addresses of its members and users available to third parties. Members and users may opt out of being included on these lists at any time by logging in to "My ACSA" and checking the appropriate box on the Contact Info tab. ACSA does not release email lists of its members, although individual email addresses may be accessed through the members-only faculty directory.   


**2\. Online Directories**

a. ACSA maintains online directories of schools and individual members. Information provided in these directories has been provided by the program administrators of the schools or voluntarily by individuals themselves. 

b. Individuals already included in a directory may opt out of being included by contacting ACSA by email at [membership@acsa-arch.org](mailto:membership@acsa-arch.org). 

**3\. Research**

a. ACSA will make use of the data collected about its individual users and members and about its schools for the purposes of analysis and publication of information about architectural education and practice. ACSA may also analyze its user and member data for internal purposes. 

b. Demographic data will not be released on an individual basis and will be reported only in aggregate. Access to individual demographic data is restricted to ACSA staff for internal purposes. 

c. Professional information and information about faculty appointments may be disclosed through online directories.  


d. ACSA may combine other external data about architecture schools, faculty, and other individuals with ACSA’s own data for research purposes. 

**C.** **Commitment to Data Security**

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, ACSA has implemented the appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online and by paper.

The portions of our Web site requiring login or data entry by Web users are protected by SSL. All paper applications are scanned and maintained in a secure server environment. 

**D. Commitment to GDPR Compliance**

ACSA is committed to complying with the terms and spirit of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the comprehensive European Union data privacy law, effective May  2018\. We are taking steps to communicate with our partners and vendors about GDPR compliance, and we continue to work to ensure that our products, services, and contractual commitments are brought into compliance. Steps we are taking to ensure compliance include 

·       Reviewing and updating third-party software and service agreements vendors and contracts 

·       Auditing email and newsletter lists to determine how consent was granted and taking appropriate steps accordingly 

·       Evolving our database systems to allow for appropriate data portability and data management 

ACSA will continue to monitor GDPR compliance and other privacy-related regulatory laws, regulations, and guidelines, and will adjust our practices accordingly.
