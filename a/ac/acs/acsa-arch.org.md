“Personal Data” is any information that enables us to identify you, directly or indirectly, by reference to an identifier such as your name, identification number, location data, online identifier or one or more factors specific to your physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity.

#### A. How We Collect Personal Data

Personal Data That You Voluntarily Provide to Us. It is ACSA’s policy to collect personal data you voluntarily submit to ACSA. We may collect and process Personal Data through normal business practices. These include but are not limited to:

1\. Telephone and in-person interactions at events where ACSA staff and volunteers are present.

2\. Website interactions, including but not limited to: mailing list sign-up; online profile updates; membership applications; online purchases; online submission of materials for conferences, competitions, publications, and awards; and event registrations.

3\. Data about faculty and staff at our member schools, contributed by faculty and staff at these schools member schools, or collected via public sources, such as university websites.

_Information Received from Other Sources._ We may receive information about you from publicly available and third-party databases or services that provide information about schools, professionals, and companies, and combine this data with information we already have about you. This helps us to update, expand, and analyze our records, identify new potential members, and provide products and services that may be of interest to you.

We use the foregoing information in the form of summary statistics to help us make our website more useful to our visitors, such as assessing what information is of most and least interest.

#### B. What Information Do We Collect?

##### 1\. Overview

Users and members must register to obtain any product or service (tangible or virtual) offered by the ACSA. Some products and services also require ACSA membership. Registration may require a valid mailing address be submitted to appropriately fulfill a product or service request. Online registration requires a valid email be provided because an online profile is created during the registration process.

As outlined below, ACSA may ask for additional demographics such as race, age, sex, birth date, and education.

Users purchasing a product or service online are asked to provide a credit card number. ACSA does not store credit card information after the transaction is complete. However, it does maintain a reference number provided by its credit card gateway. ACSA follows Payment Card Industry (PCI) standards for all sales.

##### 2\. ACSA Faculty and Supporting Member Data

ACSA collects demographic and professional information about our members—that is, individual faculty at ACSA full and affiliate member schools and Supporting category members of the ACSA.

Because the large majority of ACSA members have an appointment at an ACSA member architecture education program, we have collected membership information about faculty, staff, and administrators from the programs themselves. The source for this information may be the school’s faculty, staff, or administrators, or public sources of information, such as the university website. ACSA collects other information directly from our individual members and from website users. Below are three categories of information that we collect and who is able to change or access this information.

**a. Faculty Appointment Information Supplied by Member Program**  
Due to our membership structure, ACSA relies on program administrators (i.e., deans, directors, chairs, department heads, etc.) to identify faculty and staff members and supply information about their appointment to the architecture program (e.g., full-time, part-time, tenured/nontenured, etc.). The program’s head administrator receives online access to the program’s roster of faculty in our database. The head administrator is able to add or delete faculty members from the roster, and can add and change data about these faculty and staff members. If a member believes the academic appointment information is erroneous, please contact the membership department at ACSA, membership@acsa-arch.org.

**b. Optional Demographic Data**  
ACSA collects demographic information from website users and members. This information is supplied by the individual user or member on a voluntary basis and may include, but may not be limited to, race, ethnicity, LGBT status, and disability status. The optional demographic information supplied by an individual will remain confidential within ACSA’s uses, as described below.

**c. Optional Professional Information**  
ACSA also collects optional information on the professional background of faculty and administrators. This information includes, but may not be limited to, courses taught, research and practice expertise, licensure status, terminal degree, and faculty appointment information such as rank, time commitment, and various roles within an architecture education program.

##### 3\. Contact Information

ACSA members may maintain multiple addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers with the organization; one of these should be identified as the primary contact information for correspondence with the organization.

##### 4\. Cookies
