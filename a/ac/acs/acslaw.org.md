# Privacy Policy | American Constitution Society

ACS is sensitive to online privacy concerns. Among our organization's central goals is the protection of individual rights and liberties, including privacy.

**Browser information collected on the website**  
Like most website operators, ACS analyzes its website logs to improve the value of this website. Our Internet hosting provider reports to us statistics about page views, unique views, unique visitors, repeat visitors, frequency of visits and peak-volume traffic periods. We do not use this service to gather, request, record, require, collect or track any Internet users' personally identifiable information. 

**Privacy of e-mail lists**  
ACS maintains e-mail lists to inform interested parties about our various activities. However, ACS does not share addresses on such lists with any third parties. ACS also compiles the names of potential new members and attendees at our events, and may share such information with organizations potentially co-sponsoring any particular event.

**Collection and use of personally identifiable information**  
This site enables users join or contribute to ACS, and in the process of doing so you may be requested to provide your name, mailing address, e-mail address, telephone number and biographical information such as your place of employment and educational background. This site does use "cookies" (small data files placed on your computer by our server) to store such information, but only to that information you choose to supply, and never to share with third parties. ACS does not sell or otherwise disclose such personal information outside our organization.
