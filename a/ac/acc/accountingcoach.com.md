  4. **Emailing a friend about our website**  
On some pages we allow you to email a friend who might be interested in certain pages of our website. We ask you to supply your email address so when your friend wants to reply to the email, the reply comes to you, and not to us.

  5. **Tracking and statistics**  
We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals.
