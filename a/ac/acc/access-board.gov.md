# Privacy Statement

Thank you for visiting the Access Board's website and reviewing our privacy policy. Our privacy policy is clear: We will collect **no** personal information about you when you visit our website unless you choose to provide that information to us. Here is how we handle information about your visit to our website:

### Information Collected and Stored Automatically

You do not have to give us personal information to visit our site. If you do nothing during your visit but browse through the website, read pages, or download information, we will gather and store certain information about your visit automatically. This information does **not** identify you personally. We automatically collect and store **only** the following information about your visit:

  * the Internet domain (for example, "xcompany.com" if you use a private Internet access account, or "yourschool.edu" if you connect from a university's domain) and IP address (an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web) from which you access our website;
  * the type of browser (including brand and version) and operating system used to access our site;
  * the date and time you accessed our site and the amount of time spent on our site;
  * the pages you visited; and
  * if you linked to our website from another website or through a search engine, the address of that website or the name of search engine.



We use this information to make our site more useful to visitors and to learn about the number of visitors to our site and the types of technology our visitors use. We do **not** track or record information about individuals and their visits.

### If You Send Us Personal Information

Our website permits you to send us information through several on-line forms. These forms allow you to:

  * sign up to receive our free newsletter by mail or by e-mail ([see form](https://web.archive.org/web/20051214052017id_/http%3A//www.access-board.gov/news/Access%20Currents/General.cfm));
  * order publications ([see form](https://web.archive.org/web/20051214052017id_/http%3A//www.access-board.gov/po1.cfm)); or
  * file a complaint under the Architectural Barriers Act ([see form](https://web.archive.org/web/20051214052017id_/http%3A//www.access-board.gov/enforcement/form-email.htm)).



Forms for subscribing to our mailed newsletter request the necessary mailing information. This information is entered into an Access Board database used only for the distribution of Board publications. Forms to receive our newsletter by e-mail or e-mail news updates request an e-mail address. This information is added to e-mail distribution lists maintained by the Board and used only for these purposes. We do not request or store any information other than the mailing or e-mailing information requested in our forms. The Board does not collect information for commercial marketing.

The Access Board is responsible for enforcing the Architectural Barriers Act (ABA), which requires access to facilities designed, built, altered, or leased with Federal funds. The Board enforces this law through the investigation of complaints filed by the public about the lack of access to a facility. Our enforcement regulations prohibit us from disclosing the identity of complainants without their written permission.We do not create individual profiles with the information you provide or give it to any private organizations.

The only other means of submitting information to us is by sending us an e-mail message. A posted [e-mail directory](https://web.archive.org/web/20051214052017id_/http%3A//www.access-board.gov/contact.htm) lists the various Access Board mailboxes noted on our website. If you choose to provide us with personal information in an e-mail message, we will use such information only to respond to your message and to get you the information you have requested. However, comments which are e-mailed to the Board in response to notices of proposed rulemaking are placed in a docket for public inspection at the Board’s office and may be posted on the Board’s website as well.

### Links to Other Sites

Our website has links to many other Federal agencies and non-commercial sites. Once you link to another site, you are subject to the privacy policy of the other site. See our [directory](https://web.archive.org/web/20051214052017id_/http%3A//www.access-board.gov/links.htm) of links to other sites.
