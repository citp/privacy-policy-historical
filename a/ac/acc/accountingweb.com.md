# AccountingWEB Privacy Policy

It is the policy of AccountingWEB, Inc. to respect and protect the privacy of our users. We will not sell our subscriber list to any third party, nor will we willfully provide any individual information of any of our subscribers to any vendor, supplier, advertiser or potential advertiser, without the express permission of our users. AccountingWEB Inc. does collect personal information on our subscribers, and uses it to better profile our subscribers so they can have a much more meaningful experience while visiting our site. That information is kept confidential, and only AccountingWEB staff has access to the database that includes that information.

On occasion subscribers will post questions, answers or commentary on our site, and their individual names will be published next to their comments. Beyond that, no firm information or other contact information will be published unless the user publishes it him or herself.

**Information Collection and Use**  
We collect information from our users at several different points on the web site - this is for customer service and billing purposes; we also collect data from our users so that we can customize the site according to individual selections. AccountingWEB is the sole owner of the personal information collected from this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others.

**Registration**  
In order to receive our email alerts, users have to complete a registration form. During registration a user is required to give contact information (such as name and email address). This information is used to contact the user about the services on our site for which they have expressed interest. It is optional for the user to provide demographic information (such as income level and gender), and unique identifiers, but encouraged so we can provide a more personalized experience. 

**Order Forms**  
Occasionally we request information from users on our order forms. Users have to provide contact information (such as name and delivery address) and financial information (such as credit card number and expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fulfill customer orders. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the user.

**Cookies**  
A cookie is a small text file written to a user’s hard drive that contains information about the user. The cookies do not contain any personal information about users. Once the user closes his or her browser, the cookie simply terminates. The use of cookies is now widespread. The reason we use cookies is to save our users time on the site (so that users do not have to log in with a password more than once); and also so that we can personalize a user's experience of the site. If a user sets up his browser to reject the cookie, he or she may still use the site.

Some of our business partners use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies.

**Log Files**  
We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track users' movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.

**Links**  
This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that AccountingWEB is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of these third party sites. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.

**Newswires**  
If a user wishes to subscribe to our newswires, we ask for contact information such as name and email address.

**Surveys& Contests**  
From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose any information requested. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and delivery address), and demographic information (such as zipcode, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the functionality of the site.

**Mail-A-Friend**  
If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask them for the friend’s name and email address. AccountingWEB will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site.

**Security**  
This web site takes every precaution to protect our users’ information. When users submit sensitive information via the web site, the information is protected both online and off-line.

When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, as will be the case for most of the time that a user is browsing the web.

If you make a purchase from our site, the information obtained during your visit, and the information that you give such as your credit card number and contact information, is provided to the merchant of record. These merchants have separate privacy and data collection practices. AccountingWEB has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies.

If you have any questions about the security at our web site, you can send an email to [service@accountingweb.com](mailto:service@accountingweb.com)

**Correcting/Updating Personal Information**  
If a user’s personally identifiable information changes (such as the zipcode), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will try to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user’s personal data provided to us. This can usually be done at the [personal profile page](https://web.archive.org/profile) or by sending an email to [service@accountingweb.com](mailto:service@accountingweb.com)

**Notification of Changes**  
If our privacy policy changes, we will post those changes on our Homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy statement under which the information was collected.
