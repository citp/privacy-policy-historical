## Privacy Policy

**Your Privacy Is Important to Us**  
Since this site was launched in 2004, we have NEVER sent out unsolicited emails, unless a Forum member account has a security issue or other problem. If you received a mailing from us, your email address is either listed with us as someone who has expressly shared this address for the purpose of receiving information in the future (“opt-in”), or you have registered with our Forum, have responded to an auction or survey, or otherwise have an existing relationship with us. We respect your time and attention by controlling the frequency of our mailings.

**How We Protect Your Privacy**  
We use security measures to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of data used by our system. We do not sell, lend, or license the names and addresses of our Forum members to any third parties.

**Sharing and Usage**  
We will never share, sell, or rent individual personal information with anyone without your advance permission or unless ordered by a court of law. Information submitted to us is only available to employees managing this information for purposes of contacting you or sending you emails based on your request for information and to contracted service providers for purposes of providing services relating to our communications with you.

**How to Opt-Out of Email Distribution**  
We normally never send out unsolicited email except to Forum members who request notification. If you have opted in to receive one of our email newsletters, you can remove yourself from the distribution list. Group emails contain an easy, automated way for you to cease receiving email from us, or otherwise change your communication preferences. If you wish to do this, simply follow the instructions at the end of any email.

**Network Advertising and Cookies**  
Some of the advertisements in this site are delivered through advertising networks. Commonly, networks use the DoubleClick DART cookie to provide tracking on ad performance. Third party vendors may use cookies to serve ads based on a user’s prior visits to this website. When users visit a partner’s website and either view or click on an ad, a cookie may be dropped on that end user’s browser. The data gathered from these cookies will be used to help better serve and manage ads on the publisher’s site(s) and across the web. Users can opt out of some, but not all, of these cookies in one location at the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out website at www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp .
