**Information Collection and Use**  
We collect information from our users at several different points on the Website - this can be for registration, login, customer service and billing purposes, and also so that we may customise the Website according to individual selections. Sift Media is the sole owner of the personal information collected from this Website.

Your details are never sold or rented to any third parties. However, where your details are requested in order to download documents from our sponsors, you agree that such details will be provided to the sponsor.

**Registration**  
In order to access the full range of content and features on the Website, and also to receive our regular email bulletins, we require users to complete a member registration form. During registration a user is required to give contact information (such as name, email address, and selected information about the company that you work for).

It is optional for the user to provide certain demographic information (such as income level and gender), however we encourage the full completion of the registration form so that we can refine our editorial content and provide a more personalised experience.

**Order forms**  
We sometimes may request additional information from users on order forms. Users have to provide contact information (such as name and delivery address) and financial information (such as credit card number and expiry date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fulfill customer orders. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the user.

**Cookies  
** A cookie is a small text file written to your hard drive that contains information about your account on this Website. Cookies do not contain any personal information about users. Once you close your browser, the cookie simply terminates. We use cookies so that we can personalise your experience of the Website. If you set up your browser to reject the cookie, you may still use the Website, however you may be requested to log in repeatedly to access some of the content or features available. Some of our business partners use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers). We have no access to or control over these cookies.

**Links**  
The content on the Website may include links to third party external sites. You agree that we cannot be held liable for the content, nature or reliability of any third party links.

**Surveys & competitions  
**From time-to-time the Website will request information from users via surveys or competitions.

Information requested may include contact information (such as name and delivery address), and demographic information (such as postcode or company turnover).

Contact information will be used to notify the winners and to award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the functionality of the Website.
