# AccessData® Privacy Statement | AccessData

AccessData Group respects your preferences concerning the treatment of personal information that we may collect from your association with us.  We use your information to support and enhance our relationship with you; for example, to process your subscription or purchase, provide service and support, and update you about product releases and details, service and company news and offerings with you. We do not sell your personal information.  We only share your personal data for marketing purposes outside AccessData Group with your consent, as required by law or to protect AccessData Group, its customers, or the public, or with companies that help AccessData Group fulfill its obligations with you (such as shipping companies).  At any time you may contact AccessData Group with any privacy questions or concerns you may have.  You also may ask at any time to see the data you have given us and request correction or deletion.  We strive to ensure a high level of security and confidentiality. We’ve developed our privacy policy from industry standards, and local, national, and international laws and requirements.  All privacy practices and methods described in this policy apply only insofar as permitted by the applicable standards, laws and requirements.   
**Information Collected**  
During the sales process, or through trade shows, marketing events, and other activities, AccessData Group may collect information from you.  For example, we request information from you when you: 

  * Register on accessdata.com 
  * Request a demo disk
  * Request a quotation or information 
  * Register for a webinar, seminar, or other informational event 
  * Place an order 
  * Participate in a sweepstakes or other promotional offer
  * Subscribe to a newsletter or a mailing list 
  * Request assistance from AccessData Group 



We may ask you for your name, address, e-mail address, type of business, and credit card information, as well as other similar personal information.

**How We Use Your Information**  
The information you provide will be used to support your relationship with AccessData Group.  Among other things, your information may be used to alert you to product upgrades or special offers, and to market or sell AccessData Group products or services to you.  Your information may be combined with information collected about you by AccessData Group or third parties, with information that is collected about you from public records, or with information that AccessData Group may acquire from third parties.

**Data Sharing and Transfer**  
Information regarding you (such as name, address and phone number) or your order and the products you purchase will not be given or sold to any outside organization for its use in marketing or solicitation without your consent.  In addition, occasionally AccessData Group will share contact information, such as name and address, with third parties with whom we have partnered to provide specific services to AccessData Group, or services on behalf of AccessData Group. 

In addition, AccessData Group may be required to disclose your information in connection with law enforcement, fraud prevention, regulation, and other legal action or if AccessData Group reasonably believes it is necessary to do so to protect AccessData Group, its customers, or the public. 

AccessData Group is an expanding business, and like other companies, we sometimes acquire or divest business units.  As part of such transfers, we may convey the business assets of the particular business unit, including information that you have supplied.

**Changing Your Account Information**  
We will occasionally update this Privacy Statement to reflect changes in our services and customer feedback.  When we post changes to this Statement, we will revise the “last updated” date at the top of this Statement.  If we make significant changes to our Statement, we may also notify you by other means, such as sending an email or posting a notice on our corporate website.  We encourage you to periodically review this Statement to be informed of how AccessData Group is protecting your information.   
If you wish to provide us with additional information, change the information we have on file for you, or delete personal information you have previously provided to us, please email us at [legal@accessdata.com](mailto:legal@accessdata.com)

**Data Security and Responsibility**  
AccessData Group takes seriously the trust you place in us.  To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, to maintain data accuracy, and to ensure the appropriate use of the information, AccessData Group utilizes reasonable and appropriate physical, technical, and administrative procedures to safeguard the information we collect.  AccessData Group retains data only as required or permitted by local law and while it has a legitimate business purpose. 

AccessData Group is committed to keeping the data you provide us secure and will take reasonable precautions to protect your information from loss, misuse or alteration.  Vendors, contractors, or partners of AccessData Group who have access to your information in connection with providing services for AccessData Group are required to keep the information confidential and are not permitted to use this information for any other purpose than to carry out the services they are performing for AccessData Group. 

Your information will generally be stored in our AccessData Group databases, which are located in the United States.  For easier processing of e-mail communications, or other marketing purposes, however, your information may be sent, usually on a temporary basis, to countries outside the United States. AccessData Group data protection standards are the same, regardless of where your information is stored.

**Cookies**  
A cookie is a small file stored on a user’s hard drive containing information about that user.  AccessData Group uses cookies on its website to improve your user experience; for instance, you can retain your website password in a cookie to make logging in easier.  Our cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.  Our website does not collect or store your personal information in cookies, and a user may reject the use of cookies and still use portions of our website.

**Web Beacons**  
Web Beacons are small pieces of code placed on a web page to monitor the behavior and collect data about the visitors viewing a web page.  For example, web beacons can be used to count the users who visit a web page or to deliver a cookie to the browser of a visitor viewing that page.   We may use web beacons on this site from time to time for this and other purposes. 

**Safe Harbor Privacy Policy**

AccessData Group complies with the U.S.–E.U. Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.–Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data from European Union member countries and Switzerland. AccessData has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view the certification for AccessData Group, Inc., visit <http://www.export.gov/safeharbor>.  

This AccessData Safe Harbor Privacy Policy describes how we handle personal information (1) collected by AccessData, our customers, and other business partners located in the European Economic Area (the EEA), which may then be transferred to AccessData in the United States; and (2) received from companies that use AccessData’s services who operate in the EEA and processed by AccessData in the United States on behalf of the company. This Safe Harbor Privacy Policy supplements the [AccessData Privacy Policy](http://www.accessdata.com/privacy-statement).

_**Notice and Choice**_  
To the extent permitted by the Safe Harbor Frameworks, AccessData reserves the right to process personal information in the course of providing professional services to our clients without the knowledge of individuals involved. Where we collect personal information directly from individuals in the EU and/or Switzerland, we inform them about the types of personal information we collect from them, the purposes for which we collect and use it, and the types of non-agent third parties to which we disclose that information. We also inform those individuals about the choices and means, if any, we offer individuals for limiting the use or disclosure of their information.

For sensitive personal information, AccessData will give individuals the opportunity to affirmatively and explicitly (opt-in) consent to the disclosure of the information to a non-agent third party or the use of the information for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual.

**Disclosures and Transfers**  
AccessData will not disclose an individual’s personal information to third parties, except when one or more of the following conditions is true:

  * We have the individual’s permission to make the disclosure;
  * The disclosure is required by law or professional standards;
  * The disclosure is reasonably related to the sale or disposition of all or part of our business;
  * The information in question is publicly available;
  * The disclosure is reasonably necessary for the establishment or defense of legal claims; or
  * The disclosure is to another AccessData entity or to persons or entities providing services on our or the individual’s behalf (each a “transferee”), consistent with the purpose for which the information was obtained, if the transferee, with respect to the information in question: 
    * is subject to law providing an adequate level of privacy protection;
    * has agreed in writing to provide an adequate level of privacy protection; or
    * subscribes to the Principles.



Permitted transfers of information, either to third parties or within AccessData, include the transfer of data from one jurisdiction to another, including transfers to and from the United States of America. Because privacy laws vary from one jurisdiction to another, personal information may be transferred to a jurisdiction where the laws provide less or different protection than the jurisdiction in which the information originated.

**Information collected by AccessData, corporate customers and business partners**  
AccessData may receive personal information from our corporate customers and other business partners in the EEA, such as name, email address, company name, title, postal address, telephone number, and preferences regarding our applications, websites, and services. Any personal information sent to us may be used by AccessData and their agents and business partners for the purposes described at the time the information was collected. If you agree to receive email or telephone marketing from us, personal information we receive will also be used for those purposes, as described in the [AccessData Privacy Policy](http://www.accessdata.com/privacy-statement). If we plan to use personal information for a purpose that is incompatible with these purposes or if we plan to disclose personal information to a kind of company not described here, we will seek your consent to such uses or disclosures.

**Agents and service providers**  
AccessData may work with other companies to help us deliver our services to you on our behalf. In some cases, these companies will have access to some of your personal information in order to provide services to you on our behalf. They are not permitted to use your information for their own purposes. AccessData requires that its agents and service providers that have access to personal information received by AccessData from the EU or Switzerland subscribe to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles, be subject to the EU Privacy Directive or another adequacy finding, or enter into a written agreement that requires them to provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by the relevant Safe Harbor Principles.

**Security**  
AccessData uses reasonable physical, electronic, and administrative safeguards to protect your personal information from loss, misuse, or unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.

**Data integrity**  
AccessData takes reasonable steps to ensure that your personal information we process is accurate, complete, and current by using the most recent information provided to us.

**Information processed by AccessData on behalf of a company using an AccessData service**  
AccessData provides services to companies ([learn more](http://www.accessdata.com/services)). As part of providing these services, AccessData may receive and process your personal information if you are a customer of one of these companies. AccessData acts on the instructions of these companies and uses reasonable physical, electronic, and administrative safeguards to protect this personal information from loss, misuse, or unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.   
Companies that use an AccessData service are responsible for complying with all other obligations in relation to the personal information they may collect from you. AccessData requires the company using AccessData’s services, in which personal information is received by AccessData from the EU or Switzerland, subscribe to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles, be subject to the EU Privacy Directive or another adequacy finding, or enter into a written agreement that requires them to provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by the relevant Safe Harbor Principles.

**Enforcement**  
AccessData utilizes the self-assessment approach to assure its compliance with our privacy statement. AccessData periodically verifies that the policy is accurate, comprehensive for the information intended to be covered, prominently displayed, completely implemented, and in conformity with the Principles. We encourage interested persons to raise any concerns with us using the contact information below. We will investigate and attempt to resolve complaints and disputes regarding use and disclosure of personal information in accordance with the principles contained in this policy.

**Changes or updates**  
This policy may change from time to time as permitted under the Safe Harbor program.

**Limitation on Application of Principles**  
Adherence by AccessData to these Safe Harbor Principles may be limited (a) to the extent required to respond to a legal or ethical obligation; (b) to the extent necessary to meet national security, public interest or law enforcement obligations; and (c) to the extent expressly permitted by an applicable law, rule or regulation.

Periodically, we may send you information about our various products and services, or other products and services we feel may be of interest to you.  If you do not want to receive such information, simply contact us at the email address set forth below.
