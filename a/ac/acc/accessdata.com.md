**Safe Harbor Privacy Policy**  
AccessData complies with the U.S.-E.U. Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data from European Union member countries and Switzerland. We have certified that we adhere to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view our certification, visit <http://www.export.gov/safeharbor>. 

This Safe Harbor Privacy Policy describes how we handle personal information (1) collected by us, our customers, and other business partners located in the European Economic Area (the “EEA”), which may then be transferred to us in the United States; and (2) received from companies that use our services who operate in the EEA and processed by us in the United States on behalf of the company. This Safe Harbor Privacy Policy supplements the AccessData Privacy Statement found at: <http://accessdata.com/privacy-statement>.

**Notice and Choice**  
To the extent permitted by the Safe Harbor Frameworks, we reserve the right to process personal information in the course of providing professional services to our clients without the knowledge of individuals involved. Where we collect personal information directly from individuals in the EU, and/or Switzerland, we inform them about the types of personal information we collect from them, the purposes for which we collect and use it, and the types of non-agent third parties to which we disclose that information. We also inform those individuals about the choices and means, if any, we offer individuals for limiting the use or disclosure of their information.

We will offer individuals the opportunity to choose (opt-out) whether their personal information is (a) to be disclosed to a non-agent third party, or (b) to be used for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual.

For sensitive personal information, we will give individuals the opportunity to affirmatively and explicitly (opt-in) consent to the disclosure of the information to a non-agent third party or the use of the information for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual.

**Disclosures and Transfers**  
In cases of onward transfers of information to third parties, we will obtain assurances from third party business partners (agents) that they will safeguard personal information consistent with our policies (for example, a contract obligating the third party to use at least the same level of protection as is required by the relevant Safe Harbor Principles). 

We will not disclose an individual’s personal information to third parties, except where one or more of the following conditions is true:

  * We have the individual’s permission to make the disclosure;
  * The disclosure is required by law or professional standards;
  * The disclosure is reasonably related to the sale or disposition of all or part of our business;
  * The information in question is publicly available; 
  * The disclosure is reasonably necessary for the establishment or defense of legal claims;
or 
  * The disclosure is to another AccessData entity or to persons or entities providing services on our or the individual’s behalf (each a “transferee”), consistent with the purpose for which the information was obtained, if the transferee, with respect to the information in question:
    * is subject to law providing an adequate level of privacy protection;
    * has agreed in writing to provide an adequate level of privacy protection; or 
    * subscribes to the Principles.



Permitted transfers of information, either to third parties or within AccessData, include the transfer of data from one jurisdiction to another, including transfers to and from the United States of America. Because privacy laws vary from one jurisdiction to another, personal information may be transferred to a jurisdiction where the laws provide less or different protection than the jurisdiction in which the information originated.

**Information Collected by AccessData, Corporate Customers and Business Partners**   
We may receive personal information from our corporate customers and other business partners in the EEA, such as name, email address, company name, title, postal address, telephone number, and preferences regarding our applications, websites, and services. Any personal information sent to us may be used by us and our agents and business partners for the purposes described at the time the information was collected. If you agree to receive email or telephone marketing from us, personal information we receive will also be used for those purposes, as described in the AccessData Privacy Statement. If we plan to use personal information for a purpose that is incompatible with these purposes or if we plan to disclose personal information to a kind of company not described here, we will seek your consent to such uses or disclosures.

**Agents and Service Providers**   
We may work with other companies to help us deliver our services to you on our behalf. In some cases, these companies will have access to some of your personal information in order to provide services to you on our behalf. They are not permitted to use your information for their own purposes. We require that our agents and service providers that have access to personal information received by us from the EU or Switzerland subscribe to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles, be subject to the EU Privacy Directive or another adequacy finding, or enter into a written agreement that requires them to provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by the relevant Safe Harbor Principles.

**Security**  
We use reasonable physical, electronic, and administrative safeguards to protect your personal information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.

**Data Integrity**  
We take reasonable steps to ensure that personal information we process is accurate, complete, and current by using the most recent information provided to us.

**Information Processed by AccessData on behalf of a Company Using an AccessData Service**  
We provide services to companies (learn more at www.accessdata.com/services). As part of providing these services, we may receive and process your personal information if you are a customer of one of these companies. We act on the instructions of these companies and uses reasonable physical, electronic, and administrative safeguards to protect this personal information from loss, misuse, or unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.

Companies that use an AccessData service are responsible for complying with all other obligations in relation to the personal information they may collect from you. We require that the company using our services, in which personal information is received by us from the EU or Switzerland, subscribe to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles, be subject to the EU Privacy Directive or another adequacy finding, or enter into a written agreement that requires them to provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by the relevant Safe Harbor Principles.

Individuals whose information we hold may request, and we will provide, access to the information and the opportunity to correct, amend or delete that information where it is inaccurate, except where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks posed to the individual’s privacy in the case in question, or where the rights of persons other than the individual would be violated.

**Access**  
See Changing Your Account Information above in the AccessData Privacy Statement.

**Enforcement**  
We have put in place mechanisms to verify our ongoing adherence to these privacy principles. Please contact us at [legal@accessdata.com](mailto:legal@accessdata.com) with any questions or concerns regarding the use or disclosure of personal information.

We will investigate and attempt to resolve complaints and disputes regarding the use and disclosure of personal information by reference to the principles contained in this Safe Harbor Privacy Policy. We have selected the European Data Protection Authorities Panel and the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commission as our external dispute resolution mechanism in the event that a complaint cannot be resolved internally.

We utilize the self-assessment approach to assure our compliance with this Safe Harbor Privacy Policy. We periodically verify that this Safe Harbor Privacy Policy is accurate, comprehensive for the information intended to be covered, prominently displayed, completely implemented, and in conformity with the Principles. We encourage interested persons to raise any concerns with us using the contact information below. We will investigate and attempt to resolve complaints and disputes regarding use and disclosure of personal information in accordance with the principles contained in this Safe Harbor Privacy Policy.

**Changes or Updates**

Adherence by AccessData to these Safe Harbor Principles may be limited (a) to the extent required to respond to a legal or ethical obligation; (b) to the extent necessary to meet national security, public interest or law enforcement obligations; and (c) to the extent expressly permitted by an applicable law, rule or regulation.
