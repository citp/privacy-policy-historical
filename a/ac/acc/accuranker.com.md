## Frequently Asked Questions​

Can I Upgrade My Account?

Yes, you can upgrade your account at any time. The remainder will automatically be accounted for on your new invoice. This applies to both monthly and annual subscriptions.

AccuRanker has a huge infrastructure and capacity. We can upgrade your account to fit all your needs, whether you need to track a few thousand or a few hundred thousand.

How Accurate is Your Data?

AccuRanker has servers in every country that we support, meaning we deliver 99.9% accurate data, both globally and at the local level.

Can I Import Data From My Previous Tool?

Yes – AccuRanker supports data import from numerous tools, see the complete list here. If your current provider isn’t listed, please contact support for assistance.

Will AccuRanker increase the price of my subscription?

No, AccuRanker will not force you to pay more for your subscription in the future. If the price of our subscriptions rises, it will only affect you if you decide to upgrade or downgrade your plan. Your current plan will always stay the same.

If I cancel my subscription or my trial runs out, what will happen to my account?

Your account settings, domains and keyword data will still be in the account, but it will be inaccessible until your subscription is eventually re-activated. We will also stop updating your rankings during this time.

Can I get a discount on my AccuRanker subscription?

No, the prices on our pricing page are the best we can offer and are therefore non-negotiable (unless you want to pay more 😉 ). This is to provide full transparency, as well as saving you time from having to negotiate with us to find the best price. The more keywords you track, the lower the price per keyword. This is also reflected in the pricing.

Can I jump from a monthly to a yearly subscription later on (and vice versa)?

Yes, you are able to manage this in the AccuRanker platform under the Account tab.

Do you have a refund policy?

Yes, if you are not satisfied with your purchase, AccuRanker has a 14 day refund policy from the initial purchase. To request this, simply write to us in the chat or at hello@accuranker.com.

Does AccuRanker charge more if I need to add more users?

No, with exception of the Basic plan (e.g. 500 keyword plan). From 1,000 keywords and above all AccuRanker plans include unlimited users
