We request information from the user on our order form. Here a user must provide contact information (like name and shipping address) and financial information (credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customer's orders. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the user.   
  
We may partner with another party to provide specific services. When the user signs up for these services, we will share names, or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services. **These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services.**   
  
From time to time our site may request information from users via contests or surveys. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and address), and demographic information (such as gender, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. We do not share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers.
