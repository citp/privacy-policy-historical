**AccountWarehouse.com Privacy Policy**

The AccountWarehouse.com website and all other related services are products of AccountWarehouse.com, LLC, a Texas limited liability company (“AccountWarehouse.com,” “we,” or “us”). We take your privacy very seriously. How we will handle information we learn about you depends upon what you do when using the website located at [www.AccountWarehouse.com](http://www.accountwarehouse.com/) (“Site”). We strive to make all choices you (“you,” “User,” or “Users”) make while using our Site as transparent as possible. We also hold the security of your personal information as our top priority. This policy will cover personally identifiable information and other information that may or may not be anonymous that you provide us through use of the Site (“Privacy Policy”). All other information given to us is outside the scope of this policy. This policy will explain what information is collected, how that information is used and/or shared, how the information is protected, and how you can control your privacy while using the service. We reserve the right to make changes to this policy at any time and will update these terms on our website when we do so. 

**_Information AccountWarehouse.com Collects_**

In administering the Site, we may collect your Personal Information and non-Personal Information. Personal Information is information, that by its very nature, can be tracked back to you (“Personal Information”). Some example of this type of information includes your name, address, email address, and billing information. Non-Personal Information, on the other hand, is information that is considered insufficient to be able linked back to the original User. ****

_Personal Information Provided to AccountWarehouse.com by Users_

On the Site, all transactions are performed as if you are a guest and you do not need to create an account. To facilitate these transactions, however, you will be required to enter certain Personal Information including, but not limited to, your name, email address, address, billing information, game profile username, and game profile password. You may also screenshots, notes, and other similar information during regular use of the Site. 

**_Information Automatically Collected by AccountWarehouse.com_ **

Like other websites or apps, we also may collect and store information that is generated automatically as you navigate through our Site. We may collect information about your visit from the browser on your computer or mobile device including but not limited to the time and date you access the Site, IP address, cookies, and the pages you request — to analyze trends, administer the Site, track navigation of the site, deliver relevant advertisements and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use (note that IP addresses are not linked to Personal Information). We use this information to improve understanding of customer needs and provide relevant services. To automatically collect information, we use various technologies including: 

Cookies. Cookies are small data files that a website you visit may save on your hard drive that usually includes an anonymous unique identifier. The cookie does not personally identify the user; it merely identiﬁes the computer with which the user accesses the Site. Unless a user voluntarily identiﬁes himself or herself (through registration, for example), the Site will not be able to ascertain the identity of the user, even if a cookie is assigned to a user’s computer. The only personal information a cookie can contain is information supplied by a user. A cookie cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive, pass on computer viruses, or capture your e-mail address. The Site uses cookies for user authentication, keeping track of your preferences, promotional campaigns that require user identification, keeping track of our audience size and traffic patterns, and in certain other cases. You can configure your browser to accept cookies, reject cookies or notify you when a cookie is being used; however, if you do so it may render your computer unable to take advantage of the personalized features enjoyed by other users of the Site. Cookies allow us to provide better security on the Site, to customize the content, to track purchases, and to keep the Site working properly. 

Pixel Tags. We use "Pixel Tags" (also referred to as clear Gifs, Web beacons or Web bugs). Pixel tags are tiny graphic images with a unique identifier, similar in function to Cookies, that are used to track online movements of web users. In contrast to Cookies, which are stored on a computer’s hard drive or web browser, Pixel Tags are embedded invisibly in web pages. Pixel Tags also allow us to send email messages in a format that users can read, and tell us whether emails have been opened to, in part, ensure that we are sending only messages that are of interest to our users. We may also use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to a user. 

Log File Information. When you use AccountWarehouse.com, our servers may automatically record certain information that your device sends whenever you visit any website and use certain apps. These server logs may include information such as your web or app request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, browser language, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform type, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser. 

Threat Detection. We use certain third party service providers to provide threat detection, user authentication and fraud prevention services. These service providers may automatically collect certain information about your visits to the Site and the device you use to connect to our Site, in order to monitor for potential threats or bad actors. This information may include, among other things, your IP address and your device’s unique device identifier. 

Information Collected from Other Sources. We may supplement the information we have about you with information received from other sources including from our pages on social networking sites, the social networking sites themselves, and from commercially available sources (e.g., data brokers and public databases). The information we receive may include demographic data such as age, gender and income level, your interests and purchase data and other information that is necessary or useful to assist our marketing efforts or for user verification, authentication, fraud detection or to comply with regulatory requirements. 

Third Party Analytics. We use a number of third party service providers, such as Google Analytics, to help analyze how users use our services (" **Analytics Companies** "). These Analytics Companies use Cookies to collect information such as how often users visit our Site, what pages they visit, and what other sites they used prior to coming to our Site. We use the information we get from Analytics Companies only to improve our Site. 

**_How We Use Your Data_**

  * contact you regarding a transaction;

When we share data with third-party services that support our delivery of the Site, we require that they protect your Personal Information to the same standards we do. We do reserve the right to disclose Personal Information when we believe that doing so is reasonably necessary to comply with the law or law enforcement, to prevent fraud or abuse, or to protect our legal rights. 

Please see below for how we may share your Personal and non-Personal Information. 

**_Sharing of Personal Information_**

When you send information through the Site, you are granting us permission to use and take other actions regarding such information, to provide the Site. We do not share, sell, rent or otherwise distribute this information to others, except as disclosed in this Privacy Policy. We may share your information with third parties outside of AccountWarehouse.com under the following circumstances:

Please bear in mind that whenever you voluntarily make your Personal Information available for viewing by third parties online – for example through comments and participation in forums or through email – that information can be seen, collected and used by others besides us. We cannot be responsible for any unauthorized third-party use of such information. 

**_Sharing of Non-Personal Information and Aggregate Data_ **

AccountWarehouse.com may share with third parties your non-Personal Information and related aggregated data for any legitimate business purposes, including for reporting, research, or advertising. Because this form of data does not identify particular users, these third parties will not be able to contact you based solely on this data. For example, we may share aggregated usage data from our Users or may share IP addresses or general demographic information of our users to provide anonymous aggregated data to business partners about the volume of use on the Site and the opportunities in which Users are most interested. 

**_How We Protect All of Our Data_**

All information submitted to AccountWarehouse.com will be stored on our servers. We will use industry standard measures, including encryption where appropriate. However, as eﬀective as the reasonable security measures we implement may be, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that information supplied will not be intercepted while being transmitted over the Internet. Therefore, any information you transmit to us is sent at your own risk. 

By using the Site or providing Personal Information to us, you agree that we may communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues relating to your use of the Site. If we learn of a security system’s breach, we may attempt to notify you electronically by posting a notice on the Site or sending an email to you.

We are under no obligation to store such Personal Information indefinitely and disclaim any liability arising out of, or related to, the destruction of such Personal Information. In addition, you should be aware that it is not always possible to completely remove or delete all of your information from our databases without some residual data because of backups and other reasons.

Regardless of your choices regarding promotional communications and updates regarding content we may send you administrative messages regarding transactions or other similar communications, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them.
