# McGraw Hill's AccessEngineering - The Library of Engineering

  


When you subscribe to AccessEngineering, register for a trial subscription, or register for individual access to the site, we collect certain personal information, such as your name, address, and e-mail address. We use this information to process your order and for administration of your subscription. Your e-mail address is added to our electronic mailing list so that, from time to time, we can send you information about new features, additions, and changes to our Web site. If you do not want to receive e-mail alerts, you may indicate this on your registration form, and you can change this at any time by logging into My DEL and updating your profile information, or by contacting Customer Service by e-mail at [OnlineCustomer_Service@mcgraw-hill.com.](mailto:OnlineCustomer_Service@mcgraw-hill.com)

Also, AccessEngineering may occasionally make subscriber information available to other units within The McGraw-Hill Companies as well as to selected outside companies whose products or services we feel may be of interest to you. 

If you are an individual user, you may also review and request changes to your profile information online at any time by logging into My DEL, or by contacting Customer Service by e-mail at [OnlineCustomer_Service@mcgraw-hill.com.](mailto:OnlineCustomer_Service@mcgraw-hill.com)

**AccessEngineering** makes use of a type of **cookie** called a **"session" cookie. Cookies** are small bits of data that we send to your computer. We use them to improve your user experience. We use them to keep track of the fact that you have signed in so that you don't have to continually enter your user name and password as you move around the site. This type of cookie is removed as soon as you log out or close your browser. 

An **IP address** is a number that's automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the Web. Web servers — the big computers that "serve up" Web pages — automatically identify your computer by its IP address. We collect IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, to report aggregate information to our institutional customers, and to audit the use of our site. When visitors request pages from AccessEngineering, our servers log the visitors' IP addresses. We do not normally link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that a user's session will be logged, but the user remains anonymous to us. We can and will use IP addresses to identify a user when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our house rules or terms of service or to protect our service, site, customers, or others. 

Please be assured that we take your concerns about privacy quite seriously, and we intend to take every reasonable effort to protect it. To that end, The McGraw-Hill Companies has developed a comprehensive customer privacy policy. If you'd like more information about our use of customer data, please review The McGraw-Hill Companies Customer Privacy Policy at [http://www.mcgraw-hill.com/privacy.html.](http://www.mcgraw-hill.com/privacy.html)
