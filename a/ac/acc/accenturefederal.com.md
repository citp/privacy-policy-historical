Accenture attaches great importance to your right to privacy and the protection of your personal data. We want you to feel secure that when you deal with Accenture, your personal data are in good hands.

Accenture protects your personal data in accordance with applicable laws and our data privacy policies. In addition, Accenture maintains the appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal data against unauthorized or unlawful processing and/or against accidental loss, alteration, disclosure or access, or accidental or unlawful destruction of or damage thereto.

The following sections provide further details as to how Accenture processes your personal data:

  * Which categories of personal data do we collect and how do we process such personal data?
  * For which purposes and on which legal basis do we use your personal data?
  * Will we share your personal data with third parties?
  * What about sensitive data?
  * What about data security?
  * Where will your personal data be processed?
  * How long will your personal data be retained by us?
  * Which rights do you have with respect to the processing of your personal data?



### Which categories of personal data do we collect and how do we process such personal data?

We collect personal data of our employees, potential employees, clients, suppliers, business contacts, shareholders and website users. If the data we collect are not listed in this privacy statement, we will give individuals (when required by law) appropriate notice of which other data will be collected and how they will be used.

Specifically, the personal data we collect include the categories of personal data described in the sections “How do we use personal data when you visit Accenture’s website?”, “How do we use cookies (and other tracking technologies)?”, “How do we use personal data when you visit our offices?” and “How do we use personal data for marketing purposes?”, as well as any other categories of personal data referred to in this privacy statement or in other statements you have received.

Except for certain information that is required by law, your decision to provide any personal data to us is voluntary. You will therefore not be subject to adverse consequences if you do not wish to provide us with your personal data. However, please note that if you do not provide certain information, we may not be able to accomplish some or all of the purposes outlined in this privacy statement, and you may not be able to use certain tools and systems which require the use of such personal data.

If you provide us with personal data of another person (for instance, a potential employee/referral), you are responsible for ensuring that such person is made aware of the information contained in this privacy statement and that the person has given you his/her consent for sharing the information with Accenture.

The above-mentioned categories of personal data have been obtained either directly from you (for example, when you provide information to sign up for a newsletter or register to comment on a forum website) or indirectly from certain third parties (for example, through our website’s technology). Such third parties include our affiliates, public authorities, public websites and social media, suppliers and vendors.

### For which purposes and on which legal basis do we use your personal data?

Accenture uses your personal data only where required for specific purposes. Please click here for (i) a list of the purposes for which Accenture uses your personal data and (ii) an overview of the legal basis for each such purpose.

Undertaking data analytics, i.e. applying analytics to business operations and data to describe, predict and improve business performance within Accenture and/or to provide a better user experience. (more details on how we run analytics on our website can be found in our [cookies policy](https://web.archive.org/us-en/company-cookies-similar-technology)).

Justified on the basis of our legitimate interests for ensuring the proper functioning of our business operations.

Justified on the basis of our legitimate interests for ensuring that we can conduct and increase our business.

Where the above table states that we rely on our legitimate interests for a given purpose, we are of the opinion that our legitimate interests are not overridden by your interests, rights or freedoms, given (i) the transparency we provide on the processing activity, (ii) our privacy by design approach, (iii) our regular privacy reviews and (iv) the rights you have in relation to the processing activity. Please [contact us](mailto:websitedataprivacy@accenture.com?cc=ACN-websitedataprivacy@accenture.com "Mail to Website Data Privacy. This opens a new window.") if you wish to obtain further information on this balancing test approach.

We will process your personal data for the purposes mentioned above based on your prior consent, to the extent such consent is mandatory under applicable laws.

We will not use your personal data for purposes that are incompatible with the purposes of which you have been informed, unless it is required or authorized by law, or it is in your own vital interest (e.g. in case of a medical emergency) to do so.

### Will we share your personal data with third parties?

We may transfer personal data to our service providers, professional advisors, public and governmental authorities or third parties in connection with a (potential) corporate or commercial transaction. Such third parties may be located in other countries. Before we do so, we shall take the necessary steps to ensure that your personal data will be given adequate protection as required by relevant data privacy laws and Accenture’s internal policies.

Unless you are otherwise notified, any transfers of your personal data from within the European Economic Area (EEA) to third parties outside the EEA will be based on an adequacy decision or are governed by the standard contractual clauses (a copy of which can be obtained through the contact information included below). Any other non-EEA related transfers of your personal data, will take place in accordance with the appropriate international data transfer mechanisms and standards.

### What about sensitive data?

We do not generally seek to collect sensitive data (also known as special categories) through this site or otherwise. In the limited cases where we do seek to collect such data, we will do this in accordance with data privacy law requirements and/or ask for your consent.

The term "sensitive data" refers to the various categories of personal data identified by data privacy laws as requiring special treatment, including in some circumstances the need to obtain explicit consent from you. These categories include racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious, philosophical or other similar beliefs, membership of a trade union, physical or mental health, biometric or genetic data, sexual life or orientation, or criminal convictions and offences (including information about suspected criminal activities).

### What about data security?

We maintain organizational, physical and technical security arrangements for all the personal data we hold. We have protocols, controls and relevant policies, procedures and guidance to maintain these arrangements taking into account the risks associated with the categories of personal data and the processing we undertake.

We adopt market leading security measures to protect your personal data. This includes (without being limitative):

  * We hold an ISO27001 certification, which indicates that we adhere to the highest and strictest information security standards. This is a security standard awarded by the British Standards Institution (“BSI”) that serves as international certification that Accenture adheres to the highest and strictest standards. This certification is the only auditable international standard that defines the requirements for an Information Security Management System (“ISMS”), and confirms that Accenture’s processes and security controls provide an effective framework for protecting our clients’ and our own information.
  * We have a global Client Data Protection (“CDP”) program in place which governs the stewardship of client information and systems entrusted to us. 
  * We have regular penetration testing performed by a third party provider, which continues to show the strength of our technical defenses.



Regarding your use of our websites, you should understand that the open nature of the internet is such that information and personal data flows over networks connecting you to our systems without security measures and may be accessed and used by people other than those for whom the data are intended.

### Where will your personal data be processed?

As a global organization with offices and operations throughout the world, personal data we collect may be transferred or be accessible internationally throughout Accenture's global business and between its entities and affiliates.

Any such transfers throughout Accenture’s global business take place in accordance with the applicable data privacy laws and in accordance with our Binding Corporate Rules (“BCR”).

Our BCR reflect the standards contained in European data privacy laws (including the General Data Protection Regulation). Having our BCR means that all our group entities which have signed up to our BCR have to comply with the same internal rules. It also means that your rights (see “Which rights do you have with respect to the processing of your personal data?”) stay the same no matter where your data are processed by Accenture.

Any Accenture entity located outside the European Union will for the purposes of compliance with data privacy laws be represented by Accenture PLC.

### How long will your personal data be retained by us?

We will retain your personal data only for as long as is necessary. We maintain specific records management and retention policies and procedures, so that personal data are deleted after a reasonable time according to the following retention criteria:

  * We retain your data as long as we have an ongoing relationship with you (in particular, if you have an account with us).
  * We will only keep the data while your account is active or for as long as needed to provide services to you.
  * We retain your data for as long as needed in order to comply with our global legal and contractual obligations.



### Which rights do you have with respect to the processing of your personal data?

You are entitled (in the circumstances and under the conditions, and subject to the exceptions, set out in applicable law) to:

  * Request access to the personal data we process about you: this right entitles you to know whether we hold personal data about you and, if we do, to obtain information on and a copy of that personal data.
