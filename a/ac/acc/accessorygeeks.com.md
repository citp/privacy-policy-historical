The Geeks behind the scenes of AccessoryGeeks.com come from various corners of the world with different cultures and backgrounds but the one thing that stands universal between us is our geekdom. Each of us embrace what it means to be a Geek and the values this sub-culture instills. We Geeks enjoy sharing our knowledge and expertise with others as well as deepening our connections with the community and customers alike. Whether it's a WoW raid, Halo war, or an intense discussion about which Superhero has the best gadgets, we've got our bases covered. Hey, we'll even tell you which cell phone case best accents your Friday night outfit. And in case (pun totally intended) you were wondering: Black never goes out of style.

Like Superman or Iron Man, we at AccessoryGeeks.com have a backstory that makes us the company we are today. No, we didn't come from a planet in a galaxy not so far away, but we did stem from the turn of the 21st century when sleek cell phones were still an X-files luxury. 2004 marked our explosion onto the worldwide web and it was with gusto that we took the reins of the internet so we could provide top quality products and service to those in need of cell phone accessories & other electronic device accessories. Still going strong, AccessoryGeeks.com continues to strive to bring the ultimate package in terms of great customer service, quality products, and a promise to uphold the values that make up a Geek.

Being a Geek isn’t just about the latest and greatest in technology. Being a Geek is about being passionate and sharing your knowledge with the world! We’ve been privileged enough to have our vision covered by the likes of CNET, iPhone Life Magazine, CBS News, KFI Radio, the New York Times and Forbes and look forward to sharing our Geeky values with more of the world as well as helping to make it a better place. AccessoryGeeks.com works closely with [Lifehouse Ministry](http://www.lifehouseministryoc.com/), [AADAP](http://www.aadapinc.org/), and the [Hadley Hope Foundation (Niemann-Pick Type C Disease)](http://www.hadleyhope.com/).

We Geeks know better than anyone that technology moves at a rapid pace (who else can't wait for the mass production of hoverboards?) and so that's why we work to keep up with newest of the new. In fact, when we figure out where to put the flux capacitor in our Delorean, not even the future will be far from our grasp! Keeping up with the times allows AccessoryGeeks.com to carry a wide variety of products to help you accessorize your mobile devices. iPads too! You can expect to find some of the latest accessories at everyday low prices along with FREE shipping to the United States & Canada. And let's face it: who doesn't like free shipping?

Need help with a product or have a concern? You don't need a Bat-signal to call for help, simply reach out to our super-team of customer service representatives and we'll do everything we can to make sure your needs are met. If there is something that needs attention, a product you would like to see, or questions you have that need answers, please get in contact with us! You can leave us a message here on [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/AccessoryGeeks), e-mail us at: [cs@accessorygeeks.com](mailto:cs@accessorygeeks.com) or call us toll free at **1-866-GEEKS-93 (1-866-433-5793) Monday through Friday 8am-4pm PST.**

**What makes him A Geek?**

If there’s one person who has a passion for all things in the cell phone market, it’s David. He started AccessoryGeeks.com back in 2004 so he could bring everyone’s mobile device needs to one centralized location: the internet. His enthusiasm helps shape the culture at AccessoryGeeks.com, allowing others to share in his vision and allowing employees to work in an environment that encourages their inner geek. David continuously pulls resources together to make sure the geeks, the products, and the site are all up to date with the latest in the market. When he’s not running around the office, David channels his inner-geeks through video games that echo the firearms enthusiast inside of him. You can bet there’ve been Nerf wars around Geek HQ because of this.
