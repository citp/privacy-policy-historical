It is important to know that all information we possess may be included in the sale of our business, or a portion of our business, to a third party.

Our Privacy Policy is dynamic. Except in the case of an emergency, or to remedy a typographical error, if we make changes, we will provide you with thirty days prior written notice. After the thirty-day period has passed, you will be deemed to have accepted the changes. If the changes we make materially alter your ability to use the Services, you may terminate the affected Services by providing us with written notice of your intent to terminate, and setting out the reasons the change has materially affected your use of the Services. If we determine that the change has had this effect, you will be entitled to terminate the Services without charge or penalty.

This Privacy Policy only applies to information provided to us. The Services may incorporate Third Party Products, as defined in the Terms of Service. To the extent this incorporation is transparent to you, the privacy policies of the providers of Third Party Products have been incorporated into this Privacy Policy. However, if a customer has the option of choosing a Third Party Product, or incorporates it into the Services on its own, those privacy policies are specifically excluded from this Privacy Policy. It is a your obligation to determine how the privacy policies of Third Party Products not covered by this Privacy Policy affect their information, and that of their customers.
