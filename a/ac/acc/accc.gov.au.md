## Introduction

The Commission's objective in maintaining an active and expanding Internet website is to improve communication with the community at large, specifically to: 

  * make it possible to quickly provide information about its activities and 
  * encourage feedback from you. 



Because privacy is an important issue for many users of the Internet the Commission has formulated the following statement to reassure visitors to its website that it understands those concerns. If you have any queries or concerns about the Commission's website privacy statement and/or its more general privacy policies please contact [the webteam (opens in new window) ](https://web.archive.org/content/maintain/create/index.phtml?contentTypeName=acccWebFeedback&informationSpaceItemId=tag.AcccFeedbackInternet&inPop=1&returnUrl=.)

## Relevant legislation

Most Commonwealth government agencies and their personnel are governed by the Australian Government Privacy Act 1988 and the Australian Government Crimes Act 1914. Personnel who are mainly Australian Government public servants work at the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. In addition, some private sector consultants work at the Commission under contracts with terms and conditions by which they agree to comply with the Information Privacy Principles in the Privacy Act relevant to their work.

## Scope

This statement applies to all users who access the Commission's website.

## Accountability

The Australian Government Privacy Act 1988 and the Australian Government Crimes Act 1914 may provide redress mechanisms and sanctions if users of the Commission's website suffer loss or damage as a result of a breach of those Acts by the Commission.

Users inquiring about their rights and remedies for breaches of privacy can access detailed information at the [Australian Privacy Commissioner's website](http://www.privacy.gov.au/privacy_rights/index.html).

## Secure transmissions

This website does not provide facilities for the secure transmission of information across the Internet. Users should be aware that there are inherent risks transmitting information across the Internet. 

## Cookies

A cookie is a piece of data that a website can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your computer as an anonymous tag that identifies your computer but not you. The ACCC website uses cookies to better serve you when you return to the website. You can set your browser to notify you before you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it. You can also set your browser to turn off cookies. If you do so, however, some pages in the site may not work properly.

Cookies can be either "persistent" or "session" based. Persistent cookies are stored on your computer, contain an expiration date, and may be used to track your browsing behaviour upon return to the issuing website. Session cookies are short-lived, are used only during a browsing session, and expire when you quit your browser. 

Like all modern websites which provide dynamic and personalised information, the ACCC website, [http://www.accc.gov.au](http://www.accc.gov.au/), uses both kinds of cookies to provide a rich and session based experience.  

Cookies are used to enable the Commission to track users browsing patterns in order to provide statistical information to improve the usability of the website.

## Complaints/inquiries

Many areas of the Commission's website offer the opportunity for people to submit queries and/or complaints or ask to be added to particular mailing addresses. If you use those facilities we will not obtain personally-identifying information about you unless you choose to provide it. 

If you wish to make a complaint or inquiry to one of our offices you can do so by sending an email, by writing, telephoning or faxing us. All of the necessary contact details are on this website.

In the case of complaints we require information such as your name, organisation and address so that we can contact you to discuss the matter. If you don't wish to give this information by email you should use one of the other means of contacting us. While the risk of anyone intercepting and misusing information transmitted by email is usually very low you should be aware that a determined individual with the right skills may be able to do this. If you prefer, you can contact us using one of the phone numbers or addresses provided in the [Contacts page](https://web.archive.org/content/index.phtml/itemId/3634).

## Data storage, security, use and disclosure

Under the Australian Government Privacy Act, Information Privacy Principle 4 regulates storage and security of personal information. Privacy Principles 9, 10 and 11 regulate the use and disclosure of personal information.

The Commission generally does not use information it collects from its website for any other purpose than to improve its website services or to respond to complaints, inquiries or feedback.

No data collected from the site will be disclosed to a third party except where it is legally required, such as in the investigation of a criminal offence, and in compliance with a search warrant or subpoena.
