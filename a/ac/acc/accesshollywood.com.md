# AccessHollywood - Inside Access - Privacy Statement

**Privacy Policy**   
Your privacy on the Internet is important to us. As part of the operation of our site, we gather certain types of information about our users, and we would like to explain the types of information we gather, what we do with it and how to correct or change the information.

 **Information Collected By This Site**   
We collect two types of personally identifying information from users: personal data (such as names and e-mail addresses), and aggregated data (such as information about traffic patterns on the site, for example how many users log on the site on a daily basis).

 **Personal Data**   
Personal data is collected when users provide personal data to the site, for example in registering for electronic newsletters or other membership services, answering surveys, purchasing items from the site, sending email to the site, and registering for contests and other promotional opportunities. Also, we collect the e-mail addresses of users who post messages to their message boards and chat areas.

 **Aggregated Information**   
Aggregated information, such as which page users access or visit, and information volunteered by users (such as survey information and/or site registrations) is collected through various methods. For example, we collect IP addresses. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the Web. Web servers, the computers that "serve up" Web pages, automatically identify your computer by its IP address, and when you request a page from a website, its servers log your IP address.

We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, although your session will be logged, you will still remain anonymous to the site. We collect IP addresses for the purposes of system administration and data aggregation provided to advertisers, regarding the volume of use on the site.

 **Use Of Cookies**   
Our site also uses "cookies" to collect information. A cookie is a small data file which is used by most major websites to write into your hard drive for record-keeping purposes when you visit them. Cookies allow websites to measure activity on their site and to improve your user experience, for example by remembering your passwords and viewing preferences, thus allowing you to visit various member-only parts of the site without re-registering.

Cookies are used by our site to measure activity on the site and make improvements and updates based on which areas are popular and which are not. We do not use cookies to retrieve information from your computer that was not originally sent in a cookie. Except for personal information voluntarily provided by you (i.e. during membership registration or a contest), we do not use information transferred through cookies for any promotional or marketing purposes, and that information is not shared with third parties.

You may occasionally get cookies from advertisers on the site, which is standard on the Internet. These cookies are outside the control of our site, and are not subject to our privacy policy. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you'd prefer, you can set yours to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. However, it is possible that some parts of the site, such as the member-only areas and shopping, contest and game areas, will not function properly if you do so.

 **Use Of Information Collected By Our Site**   
Our site uses both the personal and aggregated information collected for multiple purposes. The information is used to improve the content of the site, to customize the content and/or layout of the site for each individual user and to notify users about updates to the site or promotional offers and opportunities that we believe will be of interest to you. We share all the information collected from the site with third parties for both advertising and promotional purposes.

Personal information collected by this site may be shared with other NBC-owned or controlled entities. With your permission, we may also share personal information collected on the site with prescreened third parties for marketing or promotional purposes. We will provide users with an opportunity to decline this service when such information is requested from you online. In addition, in the event we plan to post any such information on the site (for example, if you are the winner of a contest) we will either notify you of this possibility when you provide the information and/or, if possible, when the information is posted.

Personal information may also be shared only if necessary with third parties who provide technical services to the site or host portions of the site, who will share or disseminate this information only if necessary to perform these services. If you object to the use of personal information provided by you for any reason, you may stop that use by modifying your registration information. Also, if you have registered as a member through the online registration system and have subscribed to one or more e-mail newsletters or other services and do not want to receive such e-mail from them in the future, please discontinue your subscriptions.
