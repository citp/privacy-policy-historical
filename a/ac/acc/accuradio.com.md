We sometimes use this non-personally identifiable information to improve the design and content of our site. We may also use this information in the aggregate to analyze site usage, and that information may be shared with our advertisers and clients.

Third party advertising

AccuRadio.com utilizes several advertising services such as Google AdSense, Fastclick, and Advertising.com. These companies may use cookies and automatically collected information about your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide advertisements that may be of interest to you. The information they use is not personally identifiable, and does not contain your name, email address, physical address, or phone number.

In addition, AccuRadio.com does not condone advertisers who attempt to install spyware or other kinds of malware onto your system, advertisers who make false claims to collect personal information, or advertisers who utilise sound or "browser takeover" methods in the advertisements themselves. Though they will occasionally slip through, rest assured that we do our best to prevent these kinds of advertisements from being displayed on our site.
