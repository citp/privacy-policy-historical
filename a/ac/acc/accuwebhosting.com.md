If the changes we make materially alter your ability to use the Services, you may terminate the affected Services by providing us with written notice of your intent to terminate, and setting out the reasons the change has materially affected your use of the Services. If we determine that the change has had this effect, you will be entitled to terminate the Services without charge or penalty.

This Privacy Policy only applies to information provided to us in connection with the Services. The Services may include products and services from third-party providers (Third-Party Products). Unless they are optional, Third-Party Products are covered by this Privacy Policy.
