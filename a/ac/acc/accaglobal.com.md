# ACCA privacy and data protection policy | ACCA | ACCA Global

### Introduction

1.1 This data protection notice provides information on how the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants and its affiliated entities (together 'ACCA') use personal data relating to their customers (also referred to in this notice as 'you'), including:

  * ACCA members, affiliates, registered students and potential students
  * subscribers to ACCA magazines
  * individual contacts from employers of students and members and
  * registrants for continuing professional development training courses.



A list of ACCA affiliated entities relevant to this notice and their activities is set out in the appendix to this notice.  


### 2 What personal data will ACCA collect and why?

2.1 _Administration of membership records_

ACCA will hold personal data relating to members, affiliates and registered students in order to administer membership or student membership with ACCA and comply with its regulatory obligations. Details may include name, contact details, membership ID numbers, nationality, date of birth, dates of affiliation, membership or fellowship, and details of payments, queries and complaints.

It is also voluntary for members, affiliates and registered students to provide ACCA with details of ethnic origin, in order for ACCA to review equality or opportunity of treatment.

2.2 _ACCA Connect_

Calls made to ACCA's customer call centre may be recorded for training and record-keeping purposes. Recordings may be used to monitor the quality of the assistance given and to verify the matters discussed.

2.3 _Communications (including marketing)_

ACCA may use your contact details to send you registration or information packs, recruitment materials, surveys, questionnaires, invitations regarding ACCA-based consultations, details of ACCA courses and events or to notify you of any updates and changes to ACCA's products and services.

ACCA may also carry out mailings on behalf of third parties (without disclosing your details to such third parties), subject to obtaining your consent. Consent may be requested on your ACCA registration form or separately by ACCA.

Please let us know if you do not wish to receive (or wish to change the way in which you receive) any of the above materials (see How to access or update your details below).

2.4 _Training and employment_

Training and examinations: Details of your training, attendance, tuition providers, examination and course results will be used to administer courses and exams and to monitor the pass rates and performance of tuition providers as well as ACCA students. Please note that some examinations may be taken electronically.

ACCA Exchange: This is a service offered to large employers and tuition providers. It enables them to upload details of the ACCA students whom they employ and/or are training, and monitor examination status and results. ACCA requires such employers and tuition providers to obtain your consent before including your details on this service.

ACCA Experience: This is a facility enabling registered students to upload CVs and other details about themselves. Potential employers may view the uploaded information other than the students' names, and may notify ACCA of any student whom they wish to contact. We will ask your permission before sending details to a potential employer using this tool.

Continuing professional development (CPD) courses: ACCA offers CPD training courses for both members and non-members and will need to hold contact details and attendance records in order to administer such courses.

2.5 _Professional Conduct_

ACCA holds records of enquiries, investigations and complaints relating to members and registered students (or prospective and former students). Such matters may be sensitive in nature and ACCA restricts internal access to information to those teams responsible for investigating and resolving the relevant matters. However, please be aware that disciplinary hearings and outcomes may be made public.

2.6 _Publications_

We will use your name, mailing and/or email address and payment details in order to manage subscriptions to ACCA's publications, including  _Student Accountant_ , finance matters, teach accounting, accounting link and accounting & business magazines. Please contact ACCA if you wish to change the format in which you receive such publications, eg electronically or in hard copy (see How to access or update your details below).

2.7 _Benevolent Fund_

Certain additional information may be collected from members and dependants who are beneficiaries of the ACCA Benevolent Fund. More information on use and disclosure of your data will be provided to you if you apply for the Fund.

2.8 _  IP addresses_

We collect information about the Internet Protocol (IP) addresses of all visitors to the site which helps us monitor the level of activity and the service we provide.  An IP address is an identifier for a  any computing device capable of connecting to the internet on a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (“TCP/IP”) network, such as the Internet. Networks use the TCP/IP protocol to route information based on the IP address of the destination. In other words, an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Internet, allowing Internet servers to locate and identify your computer. Computing devicesrequire IP addresses in order for users to communicate on the Internet, browse and shop, and to make sure messages get from one device to another and that the messages are understood.

### 3 How will ACCA collect your information?

3.1 We will collect data directly from you (for example from registration forms, change of details forms, at fairs and events and via our website) and will create some data internally (eg when we assign you a member ID or determine examination results).

3.2 We may also collect some data from external sources. For example:

  * employers and tuition providers may provide ACCA with relevant information on members and students employed by and/or training with them;
  * ACCA's service providers (eg examiners and invigilators) will send ACCA information relevant to the service they are providing. See also paragraph 5.1 below; and
  * members of the public may provide information to ACCA in relation to complaints and/or investigations.



### 4 Where will your data be held?

4.1 ACCA's main information systems are located within the European Economic Area and accessed by ACCA's customer services teams within the UK.

4.2 If you are an overseas member or student, your information may be accessed by ACCA's local offices in that country and local records may be maintained (subject to local legislation).

### 5 Will your data be disclosed to any third parties?

5.1 Service providers: ACCA uses a number of third-party service providers in order to carry out the activities described above, for example, to send you mailings or operate or administer exams. ACCA requires such service providers to use your personal data only for the purpose of the relevant service.

5.2 Joint scheme partners: In some countries, ACCA operates joint qualification schemes with third parties. Both ACCA and the joint scheme partner will need to share information with each other in order to operate the scheme.

5.3 ACCA Exchange: Certain information, such as your name and examination results, will be shared with employers and tuition providers who receive this service, subject to obtaining your consent - see paragraph 2.4 above.

5.4 Tuition provider results service: Some tuition providers subscribe to an ACCA 'results service' under which they may access examination results of the students they have trained in order to monitor their pass rate performance. Your tuition provider is required to inform you separately if they use your data in this way.

5.5 Continuing professional development (CPD) accredited employers: ACCA may liaise with employers who are accredited for CPD purposes to verify your employment with them and/or to validate their accreditation as a CPD provider.

5.8 Verification of details and employment assistance: if you are a student, subject to obtaining your consent, ACCA may provide relevant details to recruitment agencies, employers and educational or professional bodies (eg other accountancy bodies) for the purposes of assisting you to find appropriate employment once qualified or verification of membership, training and qualification details.
