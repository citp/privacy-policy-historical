1   Introduction
1.1 This data protection notice provides information on how the Association of Chartered Certified
    Accountants and its affiliated entities (together "ACCA") use personal data relating to their
    customers (also referred to in this notice as "you"), including:
         ACCA members, affiliates, students, potential students and technicians;
         subscribers to ACCA magazines;
         individual contacts from employers of students and members; and
         registrants for CPD training courses.
     A list of ACCA affiliated entities relevant to this notice and their activities is set out in the
     appendix to this notice.
2   What personal data will ACCA collect and why?
2.1 Administration of membership records
    ACCA will hold personal data relating to members, affiliates and students in order to administer
    membership or student membership with ACCA and comply with its regulatory obligations.
    Details may include name, contact details, membership ID numbers, nationality, date of birth,
    dates of affiliation, membership or fellowship, and details of payments, queries and complaints.
    It is also voluntary for members, affiliates and students to provide ACCA with details of ethnic
    origin, in order for ACCA to review equality or opportunity of treatment.
2.2 ACCA Connect
    Calls made to ACCA's customer call centre may be recorded for training and record-keeping
    purposes. Recordings may be used to monitor the quality of the assistance given and to verify
    the matters discussed.
2.3 Communications (including marketing)
    ACCA may use your contact details to send you registration or information packs, recruitment
    materials, surveys, questionnaires, and details of ACCA courses and events.
    ACCA may also carry out mailings on behalf of third parties (without disclosing your details to
    such third parties), subject to obtaining your consent. Consent may be requested on your
    ACCA registration form or separately by ACCA.
    Please let ACCA know if you do not wish to receive (or wish to change the way in which you
    receive) any of the above materials (see How to access or update your details below).
2.4 Training and employment
    Training and examinations: Details of your training, attendance, tuition providers, examination
    and course results will be used to administer courses and exams and to monitor the pass rates
                                                                                                     1


    and performance of tuition providers as well as ACCA students.            Please note that some
    examinations may be taken electronically.
    ACCA Exchange: This is a service offered to large employers and tuition providers. It enables
    them to upload details of the ACCA students whom they employ and/or are training, and monitor
    examination status and results. ACCA requires such employers and tuition providers to obtain
    your consent before including your details on this service.
    ACCA Experience: This is a facility enabling students to upload CVs and other details about
    themselves. Potential employers may view the uploaded information other than the students'
    names, and may notify ACCA of any student whom they wish to contact. ACCA will ask your
    permission before sending details to a potential employer using this tool.
    CPD courses: ACCA offers CPD training courses for both members and non-members and will
    need to hold contact details and attendance records in order to administer such courses.
2.5 Professional Conduct
    ACCA holds records of enquiries, investigations and complaints relating to members and
    registered students (or prospective and former students). Such matters may be sensitive in
    nature and ACCA restricts internal access to information to those teams responsible for
    investigating and resolving the relevant matters. However, please be aware that disciplinary
    hearings and outcomes may be made public.
2.6 Publications
    ACCA will use your name, mailing and/or email address and payment details in order to
    manage subscriptions to ACCA's publications, including student accountant, finance matters,
    teach accounting, accounting link and accounting & business magazines. Please contact ACCA
    if you wish to change the format in which you receive such publications, eg electronically or in
    hard copy (see How to acess or update your details below).
2.7 Benevolent Fund
    Certain additional information may be collected from members and dependants who are
    beneficiaries of the ACCA Benevolent fund. More information on use and disclosure of your
    data will be provided to you if you apply for the fund.
3   How will ACCA collect your information?
3.1 We will collect data directly from you (for example from registration forms, change of details
    forms, at fairs and events and via ACCA's website) and will create some data internally (eg
    when we assign you a member ID or determine examination results).
3.2 We may also collect some data from external sources. For example:
        employers and tuition providers may provide ACCA with relevant information on members
         and students employed by and/or training with them;

         relevant to the service they are providing. See also paragraph 5.1 below; and
        members of the public may provide information to ACCA in relation to complaints and/or
         investigations.

    shared with employers and tuition providers who receive this service, subject to obtaining your
    consent – see paragraph 2.4 above.

    monitor their pass rate performance. Your tuition provider is required to inform you separately if
    they use your data in this way.

    purposes to verify your employment with them and/or to validate their accreditation as a CPD

    to be published within appropriate publications, such as Accountancy Age and the Financial
    Times in the UK.
5.8 Verification of details and employment assistance: if you are a student, subject to obtaining
    your consent, ACCA may provide relevant details to recruitment agencies, employers and
    educational or professional bodies (eg other accountancy bodies) for the purposes of assisting
    you to find appropriate employment once qualified or verification of membership, training and
    qualification details.
5.9 Professional advisers and legal authorities: ACCA may disclose your personal data to its
    professional advisers, legal authorities or other third parties in order to investigate complaints
    and disciplinary matters, to exercise or defend its legal rights or otherwise where required by
    law.
                                                                                                      3
