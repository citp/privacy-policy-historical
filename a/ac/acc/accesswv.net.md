How We May Use or Disclose Your Health Information
We may use your health information, or disclose it to others, for a number of different
reasons. This notice describes these reasons. For each reason, we have written a brief
explanation. We also provide some examples. These examples do not include all of the
specific ways we may use or disclose your information. But any time we use your
information, or disclose it to someone else, it will fit one of the reasons listed below. We
may also enter into agreements with business partners to perform any or all of the tasks
we describe below. The business partner may use or disclose your health information in
the same manner as if we were doing it directly, and any agreement we enter with a
business partner will require that your privacy be protected the same as if AccessWV
were using or disclosing the information directly.
1. Treatment. We may use your health information to provide you with medical care and
services. This means that our employees, staff, students, volunteers and others whose
work is under our direct control may read your health information to learn about your
medical condition and use it to help you make decisions about your care. We will also
disclose your information to others to provide you with options for medical treatment or
services. For instance, we may use health information to identify members with certain
chronic illnesses, and send information to them or to their doctors regarding treatment
alternatives.
2. Payment. We will use your health information, and disclose it to others, as necessary
to make payment for the health care services you receive. For instance, our customer
service administrator or claims processing administrator may use your health information
to help pay your claims. And we may send information about you and your claim
payments to the doctor or hospital that provided you with the health care services. We
will also send you information about claims we pay and claims we do not pay (called an
                                                                                           2


“explanation of benefits”). The explanation of benefits will include information about
claims we receive for the policyholder and each dependent enrolled together under a
single contract or identification number. Under certain circumstances, you may receive
this information confidentially: see the “Confidential Communication” section in this
notice. We may also disclose some of your health information to companies with whom
we contract for payment-related services. For instance, if you owe us money, we may
give information about you to a collection company with which we contract to collect
bills for us. We will not use or disclose more information for payment purposes than is
necessary.
3. Health Care Operations. We may use your health information for activities that are
necessary to operate this organization. This includes reading your health information to
review the performance of our staff. We may also use your information and the
information of other members to plan what services we need to provide, expand, or
reduce. We may also provide health information to students who are authorized to receive
training here. We may disclose your health information as necessary to others with whom
we contract to provide administrative services or health care coverage. This includes our
administrative services partner (PEIA), and its third-party administrators, lawyers,
auditors, accreditation services, and consultants, for instance.
4. Legal Requirement to Disclose Information. We will disclose your information
when we are required by law to do so. This includes reporting information to government
agencies that have the legal responsibility to monitor the state health care system. For
instance, we may be required to disclose your health information, and the information of
others, if we are audited by state auditors. We will also disclose your health information
when we are required to do so by a court order or other judicial or administrative process.
5. Public Health Activities. We will disclose your health information when required to
do so for public health purposes. This includes reporting certain diseases, births, deaths,
and reactions to certain medications. It may also include notifying people who have been
exposed to a disease.
6. To Report Abuse. We may disclose your health information when the information
relates to a victim of abuse, neglect or domestic violence. We will make this report only
in accordance with laws that require or allow such reporting, or with your permission.
7. Law Enforcement. We may disclose your health information for law enforcement
purposes. This includes providing information to help locate a suspect, fugitive, material
witness or missing person, or in connection with suspected criminal activity. We must
also disclose your health information to a federal agency investigating our compliance
with federal privacy regulations.
8. Specialized Purposes. We may disclose the health information of members of the
armed forces as authorized by military command authorities. We may disclose your
health information for a number of other specialized purposes. We will only disclose as
                                                                                          3


much information as is necessary for the purpose. For instance, we may disclose your
information to coroners, medical examiners and funeral directors; to organ procurement
organizations (for organ, eye, or tissue donation); or for national security, intelligence,
and protection of the president. We also may disclose health information about an inmate
to a correctional institution or to law enforcement officials, to provide the inmate with
health care, to protect the health and safety of the inmate and others, and for the safety,
administration, and maintenance of the correctional institution.
9. To Avert a Serious Threat. We may disclose your health information if we decide
that the disclosure is necessary to prevent serious harm to the public or to an individual.
The disclosure will only be made to someone who is able to prevent or reduce the threat.
10. Family and Friends. We may disclose your health information to a member of your
family or to someone else who is involved in your medical care or payment for care. This
may include telling a family member about the status of a claim, or what benefits you are
eligible to receive. In the event of a disaster, we may provide information about you to a
disaster relief organization so they can notify your family of your condition and location.
We will not disclose your information to family or friends if you object.
11. Research. We may disclose your health information in connection with medical
research projects. Federal rules govern any disclosure of your health information for
research purposes without your authorization.
12. Information to Members. We may use your health information to provide you with
additional information. This may include sending newsletters or other information to your
address. This may also include giving you information about treatment options,
alternative settings for care, or other health-related options that we cover.
Your Rights
1. Authorization. We may use or disclose your health information for any purpose that is
listed in this notice without your written authorization. We will not use or disclose your
health information for any other reason without your authorization. If you authorize us to
use or disclose your health information in additional circumstances you have the right to
revoke the authorization at any time. For information about how to authorize us to use or
disclose your health information, or about how to revoke an authorization, contact the
person listed under “Whom to Contact” at the end of this notice. You may not revoke an
authorization for us to use and disclose your information to the extent that we have taken
action in reliance on the authorization. If the authorization is to permit disclosure of your
information to an insurance company, as a condition of obtaining coverage, other law
may allow the insurer to continue to use your information to contest claims or your
coverage, even after you have revoked the authorization.
2. Request Restrictions. You have the right to ask us to restrict how we use or disclose
your health information. We will consider your request. But we are not required to agree.
                                                                                            4


If we do agree, we will comply with the request unless the information is needed to
provide you with emergency treatment. We cannot agree to restrict disclosures that are
required by law.
3. Confidential Communication. If you believe that the disclosure of certain
information could endanger you, you have the right to ask us to communicate with you at
a special address or by a special means. For example, you may ask us to send
explanations of benefits that contain your health information to a different address rather
than to your home. Or you may ask us to speak to you personally on the telephone rather
than sending your health information by mail. We will agree to any reasonable request.
4. Inspect and Receive a Copy of Health Information. You have a right to inspect the
health information about you that we have in our records, and to receive a copy of it. This
right is limited to information about you that is kept in records that are used to make
decisions about you. For instance, this includes claim and enrollment records. If you want
to review or receive a copy of these records, you must make the request in writing. We
may charge a fee for the cost of copying and mailing the records. To ask to inspect your
records, or to receive a copy, contact the person listed under “Whom to Contact” at the
end of this notice. We will respond to your request within 30 days. We may deny you
access to certain information. If we do, we will give you the reason, in writing. We will
also explain how you may appeal the decision.
5. Amend Health Information. You have the right to ask us to amend health
information about you which you believe is not correct, or not complete. You must make
this request in writing, and give us the reason you believe the information is not correct
or complete. We will respond to your request in writing within 30 days. We may deny
your request if we did not create the information, if it is not part of the records we use to
make decisions about you, if the information is something you would not be permitted to
inspect or copy, or if it is complete and accurate.
6. Accounting of Disclosures. You have a right to receive an accounting of certain
disclosures of your information to others. This accounting will list the times we have
given your health information to others. The list will include dates of the disclosures, the
names of the people or organizations to whom the information was disclosed, a
description of the information, and the reason. We will provide the first list of disclosures
you request at no charge. We may charge you for any additional lists you request during
the following 12 months. You must tell us the time period you want the list to cover. You
may not request a time period longer than six years. Disclosures for the following reasons
will not be included on the list: disclosures for treatment, payment, or health care
operations; disclosures for national security purposes; disclosures to correctional or law
enforcement personnel; disclosures that you have authorized; and disclosures made
directly to you.
7. Paper Copy of this Privacy Notice. You have a right to receive a paper copy of this
notice. If you have received this notice electronically, you may receive a paper copy by
contacting the person listed under “Whom to Contact” at the end of this notice.
                                                                                            5
