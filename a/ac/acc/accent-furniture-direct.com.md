**Security**  
This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users’ information. 

When you send sensitive information (such as your credit card number) to us via our order form that information is encrypted and protected with SSL, the current industry-standard encryption protocol. When you are on such an SSL-protected page, a picture of a closed lock appears at the bottom or top of some Web browsers. At other times this lock appears open. Another way to tell if you are on a secure page is to look at the address or URL of the page. (Look in the address box or right-click on the page and select "Properties".) These secure SSL-encrypted pages have URLs that start with _https://_ instead of _http://_.
