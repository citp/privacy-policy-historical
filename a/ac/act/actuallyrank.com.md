LinkitPro.com does not collect or obtain any personal or contact information about its users without their express, prior permission.

Users can, at their option, opt to join the LinkitPro.com email newsletter. LinkitPro.com uses a reputable, CAN-SPAM compliant newsletter management service. LinkitPro.com only sends email communications to users who specifically request information about affiliate marketing or internet business.

If a user of the LinkitPro website becomes a customer, then they will also be subscribed to the customer announcement list - which they can also unsubscribe from or manage from the LinkitPro customer dashboard.

If a subscribed user wishes to unsubscribe from the newsletter for any reason, he or she may do so instantly by following the automated unsubscribe link, located in the footer of every email.

The data collected by our newsletter system will be used for marketing purposes related to topics on affiliate marketing, internet business or similarly relevant content.

The data will not be shared, sold, rented or distributed to any other party for any reason.

The only exception to this is if LinkitPro.com is sold to a third-party, at which time data may be transferred to the new owner. Subscribed users will promptly be made aware of any such activity before any data is transferred, and will be given sufficient time to unsubscribe if they choose not to have their information transfered to the new ownership.

**Collected Information - Involuntary**

LinkitPro.com uses audience re-targeting technology to reach out to previous visitors, via traditional, non-invasive advertising, as they use other popular websites. This occurs when users load our website, and our re-targeting technology loads a tracking cookie onto the users browser.

To opt-out and unsubscribe from our re-targeting campaigns, all you have to do is clear any cookies associated with LinkitPro.com, or our 3rd party advertising services, which may include ClickCertain, Adroll, and ReMarketingStats. For easy instructions on how to remove cookie files, please see [this 3rd party tutorial.](http://www.aboutcookies.org/default.aspx?page=2)

The only additional information collected involuntarily from all visitors is basic geographic, referral, on-site navigation patterns and IP information for the purpose of tracking our website traffic statistics. We use this data in order to improve our website & user experience, as well as measuring the effectiveness of our advertising & marketing efforts.

Data is not evaluated on a "user by user" basis, but rather in the aggregate on a mass scale. We look at the overall patterns based on the statistical information collected from thousands of visitors.

The data is collected (and stored) by our preferred & reputable traffic analysis service. The data is stored securely and is not publicly available. Only LinkitPro.com (ownership & staff) can access this statistical data, without exception.

This data is collected through the use of a simple javascript script on each page of LinkitPro.com, and does not interfere with or affect the user's internet browsing program whatsoever.

LinkitPro.com does NOT use spyware, viruses, trojans or otherwise any invasive, objectional methods to increase incoming traffic, or otherwise for any other purpose.
