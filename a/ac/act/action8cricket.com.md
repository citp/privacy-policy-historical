### Real Cricket Score

The sport of cricket attracts plenty of eyeballs across the world and is particularly popular in the Asian sub-continent, home to more than one fifth of the world's population. Cricket's marquee tournament, the World Cup, is only next to the Football World Cup and the Summer Olympics in terms of viewers across the world. We at RealCricketScore.com love the game as much as you do and we've tried our best to make this site a one stop resource for live cricket scores and cricket news.
