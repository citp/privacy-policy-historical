purchase of its stock or all or substantially all of its assets, we
will share the information with the acquiring company.</p>
<p> Furthermore, Active Search Results will not sell or disclose your
personally identifiable information as customer lists to anyone. Nor
will we share with anyone personally identifiable information about you
in any manor.</p>
