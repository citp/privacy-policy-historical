 **Your Order**

**E-mails About Your Order **

After you place your order, you will receive e-mails about your order. Below are examples of e-mails you might receive:

* **Your order has been received.** This e-mail confirms that we have received your order. It includes your order number. Keep this e-mail for your records.  
* **Order Status.** This e-mail informs you that an item from your order is not available for immediate shipment and will ship when it is available. Your credit card is charged when the item is shipped.  
* **Your order has shipped.** This e-mail confirms that your order or part of your order has shipped. You may receive multiple e-mails depending on the items you selected. The arrival time of your order depends on the shipping method selected and your shipping location.  
* **About your order.** There are a few reasons why you would receive this e-mail, including: difficulty in processing your order, inability to ship to the address provided, duplicate order, cancellation of order. Should you receive a notice like this, please call a Customer Service Specialist immediately so the problem can be addressed.

**Order Status **

Check the status of your most recent orders by visiting our [ Order Tracking](http://www.ups.com/tracking/tracking.html) page. This is the easiest and fastest way to get the most current information regarding your Action Envelope orders.

When you click on [ Order Tracking](http://www.ups.com/tracking/tracking.html), you will be prompted to log in with your e-mail address and password. An order summary page will provide you with detailed information about your current order or past orders. After your order is shipped, your tracking number, if available, will be displayed. Depending on the shipping company, you can click on the tracking number to view the delivery status of your order. A shipping company may not have the ability to track a number for up to 24 business hours.

**Cancellations **

Occasionally, orders or parts of an order are cancelled by our system for various reasons. Some reasons are:

* Item(s) not available.  
* Difficulty in processing your payment information.  
* Cannot ship to address provided.  
* Duplicate order was placed.  
* Cancelled due to a customer request. 

If your order is cancelled, you will receive an notice regarding your order via e-mail which will explain the reason for the cancellation. You will not be billed for any cancelled items. If you are interested in alternative products, please contact us by e-mail for a recommendation.

 **Safety, Security, and Privacy**

**At Action Envelope, we are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the security of the information you submit to us. We want your use of the Action Envelope web site, and the services we offer, to be productive and safe. Action Envelope's Privacy Policy illustrates our commitment to your privacy and security.**

*  Information Action Envelope collects from you.  
*  How does Action Envelope use the information it collects?  
*  With whom does Action Envelope share the information it collects?  
*  Our links to other sites.  
*  Action Envelope's "Opt Out" policy.  
*  How to correct/update your personal information.  
*  How to delete/deactivate your information from our database.  
*  Action Envelope web site security.  
*  How you can help keep your information secure?  
*  Your Consent.  
*  Glossary.

* When you register at Action Envelope, we request your name, email address, phone number, postal address, ZIP Code, state, and country. We use this data to manage registrations, and, when you place an order, to contact you about your order and to print your return address on Action Envelope envelopes.  
* We may use your email address, mailing address and/or phone number to contact you regarding new product offerings and other aspects of your use of the Action Envelope web site. If, however, you do not wish to receive such communications, you have the ability to "opt-out" at any time.  
* In order to take payment for your order, we collect credit card information. To maintain the highest level of security, your credit card information is encrypted using  secure sockets layer (SSL) technology. SSL is secure server software that protects against any unauthorized access. Action Envelope uses your credit card information for the sole purpose of accepting payment for your order.  
* From time to time, we may ask you to answer surveys regarding current or future Action Envelope products. Participation in these surveys is always optional. Survey responses are only used in the aggregate, and are never linked to an individual. While our survey data is primarily for use within Action Envelope only, we may occasionally share the aggregate survey data with our development partners (e.g. web design, advertising and marketing agencies) in order to facilitate new product development.  
* We may occasionally have a special relationship with another company, an entity that we think of as a marketing partner. By this we mean that a portion or version of our web site is integrated into our partner's web site or is integrated with our partner's content or branding. In such a circumstance, because we are jointly presenting our web site with our partner, and because the partner is referring customers to Action Envelope, we may agree to share information with the partner as part of our formal contract with that partner, including confidentiality and use obligations and restrictions regarding how the partner may use the information. In these instances where Action Envelope and a partner jointly promote Action Envelope's Services, Action Envelope may provide the partner certain personal information, such as the name, address, and username as a result of the joint promotion of Action Envelope. We only share this information for users coming to Action Envelope from a partner web site. Again, at the point of registration, you have the option to "opt-out" of receiving emails or promotional materials. If you have linked to Action Envelope through a marketing partner as described here, the web page you view will be co-branded with the marketing partner. If you would like information about the information use and practices of a marketing partner, Action Envelope recommends that you view the 

 policy of the marketing partner.

**Tracking Information**

Like most every web site, the Action Envelope web site records certain tracing information any time someone visits the site. For every web page that is viewed, our web server records an IP address, the operating system, browser version and the name of the page that was viewed. This information is not linked to any specific user and is used in the aggregate to maintain and improve the Action Envelope web site.

**Cookies**

A cookie is a small piece of information that is stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Action Envelope uses cookies to track your order process without having to re-verify your password on each page of the site. Rather than storing this information on Action Envelope's server, the cookie is stored in your computer and is activated only when you visit the Action Envelope site. Your privacy and security are not compromised when you accept a cookie from the Action Envelope web site. No one can access the information except Action Envelope.

**Links to Other Sites **

Our web site contains links to sites developed by other companies and organizations. Please be aware that these sites' privacy policies may differ from ours.

**"Opt Out" Policy **

By default, we do not send Action Envelope users any unsolicited email. We only send notifications of product updates, etc., if a user has specifically requested this information. The choice of whether or not to receive these notifications can be changed at any time bysending an email to [support@actionenvelope.com](mailto:support@actionenvelope.com)

**Updating Your Information **

All of your personal information can be corrected or updated at any time by visiting the "My Account" section of the Action Envelope site.

**Deleting/Deactivating Your Information **

At present, we do not have a function to delete/deactivate Action Envelope accounts. We expect to implement this feature in the future.

**Action Envelope Website Security **

The Action Envelope web site uses secure sockets layer (SSL) to encrypt the transfer of sensitive information, such as your account password and billing information, from your web browser to our web server. 

The same SSL protocol also acts to authenticate the www.Action Envelope.com site and prevent unauthorized "hackers" from masquerading as the Action Envelope site. This is accomplished through a "digital certificate", which is an unforgeable electronic "identity card". 

If another website attempts to falsely identify itself as www.Action Envelope.com, your web browser will display a warning indicating that there is a problem with the digital certificate for www.Action Envelope.com. Do not log in to the Action Envelope site if you see any such warning.

**How You Can Help Keep Your Information Secure  **

The most important step you can take to keep your information secure is to keep your password secure. Do not give your password to other people and avoid choosing "easily guessed" passwords (e.g. any single word in the dictionary, proper names of people and places easily associated with you, etc.). Change your password immediately if you suspect someone has been accessing your account without your permission (click on the "Profile" section of the Action Envelope web site after logging in). If for any reason you suspect a security violation has occurred, please immediately send an email to [support@actionenvelope.com](mailto:support@actionenvelope.com) with a description of the situation. 

**Your Consent **

In addition to the circumstances described above, Action Envelope may disclose or release information when we, in good faith, believe that doing so is reasonably necessary to (i) comply with the law, (ii) enforce or apply the terms of any of our user agreements, or (iii) protect the rights, property or safety of Action Envelope, our users, or others. By using our web site, you consent to the collection and use of information by Action Envelope as described in this Privacy Policy. If we decide to change our policy, we will post those changes here so you will always know what information we gather, how we use it and under what circumstances we disclose it. 

If you have any questions regarding Action Envelope's privacy policy and practices, please direct them to the [ Action Envelope Support Team](mailto:support@actionenvelope.com).

**Aggregate **

When a site states that they collect information in the aggregate, they mean for summary purposes only. For example, sites that collect  IP addresses "in the aggregate" do so to answer such questions as: "How many people from America Online visited our site last week?"

**Cookies **

Cookies are small pieces of information that a web site stores in your computer. Temporary, or session, cookies only last as long as your browser is running. Persistent cookies are stored on your hard disk (they take up very little space). Sites often use cookies to identify repeat visitors and offer them personalized service, or to simply associate data with a particular visitor, like a shopping cart.

**IP Address **

When you are connected to the Internet, your computer has a unique Internet ID called an IP address. Most people that connect through a dial-up service, such as America Online, get a different IP address each time they login. Others logging in from work or school might have a permanently assigned IP address, called a static IP address. It is difficult or impossible for a web site to collect personal information about you (i.e., your name, email address, etc.) from your IP address alone, although a static IP Address can be used to identify a little bit more about you (i.e. your company name, or university name).

**SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) **

SSL is a communication protocol that accomplishes two things: 

1\. It allows your web browser to verify that a web site you're visiting is actually the site that you think it is (and not some site posing as another).   
2\. It lets your web browser and a web server communicate with each other (i.e. pass web pages back and forth) in a completely secure fashion through the use of very strong encryption techniques. This encrypted communication makes it impossible for anyone else to see any information passed between your web browser and our web server.

On WebTV, press the "INFO" button on the keyboard (select the "Options" button and then select "INFO" on the small remote). If the "Security Details" button is displayed, the page is secure. Select this button for more information. 

 **Upload Center Help** **File formats we accept**

**You can use our Image Upload Center to send Action Envelope your images and text to be printed on your envelopes. You can send us text, logos, and all other information that we will need in order to print your envelopes. The quality of your file will determine the quality of the printing, so if you have any questions about the way a file will print, please call customer service and a representative will be happy to assist you.**

**We accept the following file formats:**  
*** EPS  
* TIF  
* HIGH RES GIF

* TXT  
* PDF  
* PNG**
