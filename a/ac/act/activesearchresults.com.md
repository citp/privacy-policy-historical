Double Opt-In Process
    

  
1) When members submit their website address and email address to ASR's Search Engine they are creating an account with ASR. This is considered registering with ASR.   
2) ASR then sends an email requesting that the new member a) confirm their email address, b) asks permission to activate their account and c) asks permission to allow ASR to send additional emails.   
3) Acknowledgment of this email by clicking on the confirmation link flags the member as being "Double Opted-In".   
4) Members who do not "Double Opt-In" are never sent email campaigns from ASR.
