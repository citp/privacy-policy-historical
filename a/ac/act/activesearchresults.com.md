What Information Does Active Search Results Collect From You?
  
    

You can visit our site and use most of our services without having to tell us who you are or reveal any personally identifiable information to us. There are, however, times where we do collect personally identifiable information in order to fulfill your request.

Whenever you visit Active Search Results, our web server logs automatically receive and record anonymous information from your web browser including your IP Address, Active Search Results information, the Active Search Results page(s) you request, the time spent on each web page and any search terms you query.

Active Search Results uses this anonymous information to customize your experience on our site, to show you more relevant advertising messages, and to improve our services in general. For example, when you use Active Search Results' Search Engine, Active Search Results can collect aggregate information such as the web pages visited and the time spent on each page. This information allows other users to benefit from the quality searches you perform, ultimately receiving the most relevant, pertinent information. We ordinarily do not attempt to link this information to a specific person.

If Active Search Results is acquired by another company whether through merger or purchase of its stock or all or substantially all of its assets, we will share the information with the acquiring company.

Furthermore, Active Search Results will not sell or disclose your personally identifiable information as customer lists to anyone. Nor will we share with anyone personally identifiable information about you in any manor.
