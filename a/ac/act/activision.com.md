Activision uses cookies on its Web site. A "cookie" is a small bit of record-keeping information that Web sites often store on a user's computer. Cookies do not include people's names, e-mail addresses, or other information that is personally identifiable; they are used only to quickly identify your computer and to "remember" things about your visit, which will allow us to speed up your activities and save time you might otherwise normally have to spend during your visit. You can disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent to your computer.

We also keep track of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. An IP address is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer every time you log on to the Internet.

The information you submit to our Web site is collected and used by Activision as set forth above.

From time to time, however, Activision may employ third-party vendors, such as Digital River, to collect personal information on Activision's behalf.

Digital River, for instance, fulfills all purchases made from the online store at http://store.activision.com. When requesting these services, you may be asked to supply your name, billing and mailing addresses, email address, credit card number and valid expiration date. Although these third-party vendors, not Activision, collect the personal information you provide when requesting such services, Activision still requires that they adhere to Activision's stated privacy policies. This means that third-party vendors such as Digital River will never share your personal information with other third parties _**except for providing Activision with your name, address, email address and the product(s) ordered.**_
