**What information does Activision collect?**

Activision only collects personal information from you on a voluntary basis. When you submit personal information to Activision, it will usually take the form of: (1) customer service; (2) shopping at our online store; (3) demo downloads; and/or, (4) online submission of your resume for job openings. The information we collect may include personal information such as your name, email address, phone number, and home address. In addition, we may collect demographic information such as your age, gender and interests. 

  * _Customer Service_

In order to provide you with the best possible customer service, Activision may collect some personal information from you including your name, e-mail address and birth date. This information will be used only for the purpose of solving your customer support inquiry and will be saved for twelve (12) months in the event additional customer support requests arise.

  * _Online Store_

Activision’s on-line store is managed by Digital River. In order to purchase goods and/or services from our on-line store, you will need to provide Digital River with a valid credit card number and expiration date, in addition to name, mailing address, phone number and e-mail address. Digital River has agreed to use any personal information collected in this manner only for the purpose of completing the transaction and shall take adequate and appropriate measures to assure the confidentiality, security, and integrity of this personal information in a manner consistent with this Online Privacy Statement and Activision’s privacy practices and data security policies. 

  * _Demo Downloads_

Visitors interested in downloading demonstration versions of Activision games with an ESRB rating of "M" (Mature) will need to provide a valid credit card number and expiration date. Such information will be used only for the purpose of verifying age, and will be deleted from our database immediately after such verification.

  * _Resumes_

Activision allows for the online submission of resumes. Personal information collected from resumes will be used solely for the purpose of accepting and evaluating candidate submissions for job postings. This information may be shared within the company.




Whatever the activity may be, we will only collect information to the extent deemed reasonably necessary to fulfill your requests and our legitimate business objectives.

**What happens if I refuse to provide my personal information?**

If you do not want to submit personal information when requested, you will not be able to (1) purchase at our online store and/or (2) download demos of games with "M" ratings. In addition, your refusal to submit personal information may limit our ability to respond to your customer support inquiry in a timely fashion. However, you do not need to provide personal information to Activision in order to use our Web site. 

**Does Activision use cookies, track IP Addresses or use other passive means to collect information?**

Activision uses cookies on its Web site. A "cookie" is a small bit of record-keeping information that Web sites often store on a user’s computer. Cookies do not include people’s names, e-mail addresses, or other information that is personally identifiable; they are used only to quickly identify your computer and to "remember" things about your visit, which will allow us to speed up your activities and save time you might otherwise normally have to spend during your visit. You can disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent to your computer.

We also keep track of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. An IP address is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer every time you log on to the Internet.

**Who is collecting my personal information and how will it be used?**

The information you submit to our Web site is collected and used by Activision as set forth above.

From time to time, however, Activision may employ third-party vendors, such as Digital River, to collect personal information on Activision’s behalf. These third parties provide internal support to Activision.com by operating some of the services we provide you including free email services and online product fulfillment. Digital River, for instance, fulfills all purchases made from the online store at http://store.activision.com. When requesting these services, you may be asked to supply your name, billing and mailing addresses, email address, credit card number and valid expiration date. Although these third-party vendors, not Activision, collect the personal information you provide when requesting such services, Activision still requires that they adhere to Activision’s stated privacy policies. This means that third-party vendors such as Digital River will never share your personal information with other third parties _**except for providing Activision with your name, address, email address and product(s) ordered**_.

**With whom does Activision share my personal information?**

At this time, Activision does not share your personal information with _outside_ third parties.

**Can I choose how my personal information is used?**

If you do not want Activision to reply to your customer support inquiry, you may opt-out from receiving a response by contacting us at [privacypolicy@activision.com](mailto:privacypolicy@activision.com), or by regular mail at Activision, 3100 Ocean Park Boulevard, Santa Monica, CA 90405, ATTN: Business and Legal Affairs/Privacy Policy. We will be happy to honor your request. 

**How do I access my personal information?**

If for any reason you wish to view, correct or delete the personal information collected about you, please send an email to [privacypolicy@activision.com](mailto:privacypolicy@activision.com), or write to us at Activision, 3100 Ocean Park Boulevard, Santa Monica, CA 90405, ATTN: Business and Legal Affairs/Privacy Policy. We will be happy to review, update or remove information as appropriate.

**Does Activision collect personal information from children under 13?**

We do not collect or store any personally identifiable information such as name, address, or email address from children under 13.

We recognize a special obligation to protect personal information obtained from young children. We urge parents to instruct their children to never give out their real names, addresses, or phone numbers, without permission, when on-line. No information should be submitted to Activision by children 12 and under. Children under the age of 17 and over the age of 12 should encourage their parents to review this privacy policy and to contact us if they would like to evoke our opt-out policy or to raise any concerns.

**What safeguards does Activision use to protect my personal information?**

Activision ensures data quality, such as the accuracy of information obtained from our website visitors. Activision has also taken steps to assure that all information collected will remain secure and in its original form, i.e. free from any alteration. Access to all personal information is strictly controlled. In addition, we take reasonable steps to assure that third parties who collect personal information on our behalf provide sufficient protection of personal information.

**How do I ask a question or file a complaint?**
