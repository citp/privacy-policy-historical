		<h2>ActiveTrail is committed to personal privacy and the ethical use of email business and marketing communications.</h2>

		This statement discloses the privacy practices of ActiveTrail™  under the auspices of The CommerceAge Group.

		<h2>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
			<ul>
		<li>		All ActiveTrail customers have signed a strict contract in which they guarantee that all users in their lists have explicitly requested to receive email from their company (opt-in procedure).  Opt-in procedures are checked by ActiveTrail prior to any engagement with a new customer.  ActiveTrail will take all necessary steps including legal actions against any customer that is found in breach of the engagement contract.</li>

		<li>		All ActiveTrail customer account information is held in strict confidence.  We <b>do not</b> sell or share our customer list with any other entities.</li>

Such personally-identifiable information will only be stored if you voluntarily provided such information and opted to receive email from the sending company.</li>

		<li>		You may unsubscribe at any time from any of the mailing lists held on our system. Any emails sent from our system will always contain an unsubscribe auto-remove link.  Unsubscribing from any list will ensure you will never receive anymore email from that specific list.</li>

		<h2>Email and Direct Response Contact</h2>
