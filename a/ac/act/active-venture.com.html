      <p><font size="2" face="verdana, arial, helvetica" color="#003366"><b>Information
      Collection and Use</b></font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="verdana, arial, helvetica">Active-Venture is the sole
      owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent
      this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this
      statement. We collects information from our users at several different points on our
      website.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="verdana, arial, helvetica" color="#003366"><b>Registration</b></font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="verdana, arial, helvetica">In order to provide the
      services requested by the user and access to certain section of this site, a user
      must complete the registration form. During registration a user is required to give
      their contact information (such as name and email address). This information is used
      to contact the user about the services on our site for which they have expressed
      interest. It is optional for the user to provide demographic information (such as
      income level and gender), and unique identifiers (such as social security number),
      but encouraged so we can provide a more personalized experience on our site.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="verdana, arial, helvetica" color="#003366"><b>Order</b></font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="verdana, arial, helvetica">We request information from
      the user on our order form. Here a user must provide contact information (like name,
      contact number, and email address) and financial information (like credit card
      number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill
      customers orders. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact
      information is used to get in touch with the user.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="verdana, arial, helvetica" color="#003366"><b>Cookies</b></font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="verdana, arial, helvetica">A cookie is a piece of data
      stored on the users hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a
      cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our
      site. Once the user closes their browser, the cookie simply terminates. For
      instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the user would not have to log in a
      password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If a user rejects
      the cookie, they may still use our site. The only drawback to this is that the user
      will be limited in some areas of our site. Cookies can also enable us to track and
      target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="verdana, arial, helvetica">Some of our business partners
      use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers). However, we have no access to or
      control over these cookies.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="verdana, arial, helvetica"><font color="#003366"><b>Log</b></font>
      <font color="#003366"><b> Files</b></font></font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="verdana, arial, helvetica">We use IP addresses to analyze
      trends, administer the site, track users movement, and gather broad demographic
      information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally
      identifiable information.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="verdana, arial, helvetica" color="#003366"><b>Sharing</b></font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="verdana, arial, helvetica">We may share aggregated
      demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any
      personal information that can identify any individual person. We use an outside
      credit card processing company to bill users for products and services. These
      companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for
      any secondary purposes.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="verdana, arial, helvetica">We partner with other parties
      to provide specific services. When the user signs up for these services, we will
      share names, or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to
      provide these services. These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable
      information except for the purpose of providing these services.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="verdana, arial, helvetica" color="#003366"><b>Links</b></font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="verdana, arial, helvetica">This web site contains links
      to other sites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy
      practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave
      our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects
      personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to
      information collected by this Web site.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="verdana, arial, helvetica" color="#003366"><b>Security</b></font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="verdana, arial, helvetica">This website takes every
      precaution to protect our users information. When users submit sensitive
      information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="verdana, arial, helvetica">When our registration/order
      form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that
      information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the
      industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the
      bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer
      becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just surfing.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="verdana, arial, helvetica">While we use SSL encryption to
      protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect
      user-information off-line. All of our users information, not just the sensitive
      information mentioned above, is restricted in our office. Only employees who need
      the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing staff or a
      customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable
      information. Our employees are regularly notified and/or reminded about the
      importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers
      information is protected.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="verdana, arial, helvetica" color="#003366"><b>Special
      Offers</b></font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="verdana, arial, helvetica">We send all customers a
      confirmation email for every order and provide you username and password to access
      your domain name. Established customers will occasionally receive information on
      products, services, special deals, and a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy
      of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications.
      Please see our choice and opt-out below.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="verdana, arial, helvetica" color="#003366"><b>Site and
      Service Updates</b></font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="verdana, arial, helvetica">We also send the user site and
      service announcement updates. Customers are not able to un-subscribe from service
      announcements, which contain important information about the service. We communicate
      with the user to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to
      their account via email or phone.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="verdana, arial, helvetica"><font color="#003366"><b>Correction/Updating
      Personal Informat</b></font>ion</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="verdana, arial, helvetica">If a users personally
      identifiable information changes (such as your zip code), or if a user no longer
      desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove
      that users personal data provided to us. This can usually be done by emailing our
      Customer Support</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="verdana, arial, helvetica" color="#003366"><b>Choice/Opt-out</b></font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="verdana, arial, helvetica">Our customers are given the
      opportunity to opt-out of having their information used for purposes not
      directly related to our site at the point where we ask for the information.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="verdana, arial, helvetica">Customers who no longer wish
      to receive our newsletter or our recommendations of new products may opt-out of
      receiving these communications by replying to unsubscribe in the subject line in the
      email or contact us at <a href="http://support.active-venture.com/"><u>
      http://support.active-venture.com</u></a>.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="verdana, arial, helvetica">Users of our site are always
      notified when their information is being collected by any outside parties. We do
      this so our users can make an informed choice as to whether they should proceed with
      services that require an outside party, or not.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="verdana, arial, helvetica" color="#003366"><b>Notification
      of Changes</b></font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="verdana, arial, helvetica">If we decide to change our
      privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Homepage so our users are always
      aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if
      any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable
      information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we
      will notify users by way of an email. Customers will have a choice as to whether or
      not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in
      accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.</font></p>
