			<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
         <p>We are committed to protecting your  privacy. Any information we collect will be  kept under technological lock and key, and used only to help you find the right  insurance. Below you'll find our official privacy policy.</p>
<h2>Web Site Privacy Policy</h2>
         <p>This is the privacy policy  ("Privacy Policy") for the Actualized.org site (the "Site"). This Privacy Policy sets  forth our policies regarding the collection, use and disclosure of certain  information relating to your use of the Site. Your use of this Site signifies  your understanding and acceptance of the terms of this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is incorporated  into, and part of, the Terms and Conditions, which govern your use of the Site in general.<br>
         </p>
         <h3>Age Requirement for Use of Site</h3>
         <p>This Site is not intended for use by persons under the age  of 16 years old. You must be 16 years old or older to provide any personal  information to the Site, or to us through the Site.</p>
         <h3>Domicile Requirement for Use of the  Site</h3>
         <p>You represent and warrant that you  are domiciled in the United States.<br>
         	</p>
         <h2>1.&nbsp; Collecting Information</h2>
           <h3>Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
           <p>
           The Site may request and collect certain personally identifiable information  including, but not limited to, Application Data and other personal information  contained in User Submissions, through various means such as online forms,  online applications, e-mail and comments submitted to the Site. Such  information collected through the Site may include financial information,  health-related information, and other sensitive information. </p>
         <p><em>Other than as set forth in this Privacy Policy, and unless given permission  by you to do so, we will not sell or disclose your personally identifiable  information to third parties.</em></p>
         <h3>Non-Personally Identifiable Information </h3>
         <p>We may also collect certain non-personally identifiable information via the  Site, such as Site usage activity and preferences, also known as demographic or  profile data.</p>
         <h3>Why must you give so much personal information? </h3>
         <p>Insurance companies establish their rates using a variety of criteria. Since we  deal with hundreds of companies, we must ask you questions required by all of  them to determine the most competitive match for you. <br>
         </p>
         <h3>Notice of Consumer Report Practices</h3>
         <p>In some cases, insurance companies  may need to obtain additional background information about you. As an example  Consumer reports may be ordered in connection with your insurance  application. These reports provide information that may assist in determining  your eligibility for insurance and the price you may be charged. Consumer  reports may also be used for updates, renewals or extensions of this  insurance. The insurance company may also obtain and use a credit-based  insurance score based on information contained in your credit report.&nbsp;The  insurance company may use a third party in connection with the development of  the insurance score.</p>
			<h3>Site Technology</h3>
         <p>As with many Web sites, we may use "cookies" and/or other technology  (e.g., web bugs, e-mail bugs, clear GIFs, web beacons and tracker GIFs) in the  Site or in our communications with you to enhance the functionality of the Site  and to make your transactions and other activities more convenient and  efficient (collectively, "Tracking Technologies"). These technologies  may vary, but in some cases may involve a small file stored locally on the  computer used to access the Site, and may be used by us to store and collect  information relating to your viewing and use of the Site and our  correspondences with you. You may set your web browser software not to accept  cookies, but, if so, certain functionality of the Site may be affected. We may  collect your IP (Internet Protocol) address to help diagnose problems with our  server, administer our Site and identify our users. We may also use such  technologies to remember user preferences or minimize the need for you to  re-enter information.</p>
         <p>Third parties (including, but not limited to, software vendors, advertisers and  fulfillment companies) may also use Tracking Technologies by or through the  Site. We have no control over what information such third parties track or  collect, and we have no responsibility or liability for any tracking, data  collection or other activities of such third parties.</p>
         <h2>2. Usage and Sharing</h2>
         <p>We use information collected on and through this Site for a variety of purposes  in the course of business and as otherwise set forth herein. For example, such  information may be used to process your applications to receive quotations or  to send you information about our and our affiliates' products and services and  other information and materials that may be of interest to you. This  information may also be used to evaluate what portions of the Site are more  popular than others, determine where visitors came from, where they go, and how  long they stay on a particular page, or the Site in general. We may match  information collected from you through different means or at different times,  and use such information along with information obtained from other sources,  including third parties.</p>
         <p>Application Data may be forwarded to insurance agents, discount program  representatives, brokers and/or companies who may contact you with a quote by  email, telephone, postal mail or other forms of communication. We are not responsible,  and shall not be liable, if an agent, broker, discount program representative  or company to whom we forward your Application Data violates our Privacy Policy  or their own privacy policy, if any.</p>
         <p>We may disclose your personal information to companies that perform technology  or marketing services for us for their use in performing such services. We may  transfer, sell or assign aggregate, non-personally identifiable information  about Site usage to third parties. We may transfer, sell or assign personal  information to third parties as a result of a sale of all or substantially all  of our assets relating to this portion of our business or in connection with a  merger, consolidation, change in control, reorganization or liquidation. We  also reserve the right to disclose any information concerning you if required  by law or to protect or defend our rights or the rights or well-being of our  users or if you are involved (or are reasonably suspected to be involved) in  any illegal activity, even without a subpoena, warrant or court order.</p>
         <h2>3. Security</h2>
         <p>The application form on the Site supports encryption to help protect the  security of your transfer of data to the Site. Although we will take all  reasonable security precautions regarding information stored on the Site, due  to the open nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that any information  stored on our servers, or transmitted to or from a user, will be free from  unauthorized access, and we disclaim any liability for any theft or loss of,  unauthorized access or damage to, or interception of any data or  communications. By using the Site, you acknowledge that you understand and  agree to assume these risks.</p>
         <h2>4. Consent to Processing</h2>
         <p>By providing any personal information to this Site, you fully understand and  unambiguously consent to the transfer of such personal information to, and the  collection and processing of such personal information in, the United States  and other countries or territories.</p>
         <p>By submitting this information you are authorizing Brokers, Agents, discount  program representatives and/or Insurance Professionals in the Actualized.org network to contact you directly with quotes via telephone,  fax, and email, regardless of the presence of your phone number(s) on any local  or national no-call list.</p>
         <h2>5. Links</h2>
         <p>This Site may contain links or references to other Web sites outside of our  control. Please be aware that we have no control over these sites and our  privacy policy does not apply to these sites.</p>
         <h2>6. Your Acceptance of this Policy</h2>
         <p>By using this Site, you signify your acceptance of our Privacy Policy. If you  do not agree to this policy, please do not use our Site. We reserve the right,  at our discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions from this policy  at any time so visitors are encouraged to review this policy from time to time.  Your continued use of our Site following the posting of changes to these terms  means you accept these changes.</p>
