      <h4>Our Commitment to Privacy</h4>
        <p>Our Privacy Policy was developed as an extension of our commitment to combine 
        the highest-quality products and services with the highest level of integrity 
        in dealing with our clients and partners. The Policy is designed to assist 
        you in understanding how we collect, use and safeguard the personal information 
        you provide to us and to assist you in making informed decisions when 
        using our site and our products and services. This statement will be continuously 
        assessed against new technologies, business practices and our customers' 
        needs.</p> 
      <h4>What Information Do We Collect?</h4>
        <p>When you visit our Web site you may provide us with two types of information: 
        personal information you knowingly choose to disclose that is collected 
        on an individual basis and Web site use information collected on an aggregate 
        basis as you and others browse our Web site.</p>
      <h4>1.  Personal Information You Choose to Provide</h4>
      <h5>Credit Card Information</h5>
        <p>If you choose to purchase products or services from us or our partners, you 
        may need to give personal information and authorization to obtain information 
        from various credit services. For example, you may need to provide the 
        following information:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Name</li>
        <li>Mailing address</li>
        <li>Email address</li>
        <li>Credit card number</li>
        <li>Home and business phone number</li>
        <li>Other personal information (i.e. mother’s maiden name)</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Email Information</h5>
        <p>In addition to providing the foregoing information to our partners, if you 
        choose to correspond further with us through email, we may retain the 
        content of your email messages together with your email address and our 
        responses. We provide the same protections for these electronic communications 
        that we employ in the maintenance of information received by mail and 
        telephone.</p>
      <h4>2.  Web Site Use Information</h4>
        <p>Similar to other commercial Web sites, our Web site utilizes a standard technology 
        called "cookies" (see explanation below, "What Are Cookies?") and Web 
        server logs to collect information about how our Web site is used. Information 
        gathered through cookies and Web server logs may include the date and 
        time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at our Web site, and the 
        Web sites visited just before and just after our Web site. This information 
        is collected on an aggregate basis. None of this information is associated 
        with you as an individual.</p>
      <h5>How Do We Use the Information That You Provide to Us?</h5>
        <p>Broadly speaking, we use personal information for purposes of administering our 
        business activities, providing customer service and making available other 
        products and services to our customers and prospective customers. Occasionally, 
        we may also use the information we collect to<b> </b>notify you about 
        important changes to our Web site, new services and special offers we 
        think you will find valuable. The lists used to send you product and service 
        offers are developed and managed under our traditional corporate standards 
        designed to safeguard the security and privacy of our customers’ personal 
        information. As a customer, you will be given the opportunity, at least 
        once annually, to notify us of your desire not to receive these offers.</p>
        <p><strong>What Are Cookies? </strong>Cookies are a feature of Web browser software that 
        allows Web servers to recognize the computer used to access a Web site. 
        Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored by a user’s Web browser 
        on the user’s hard drive. Cookies can remember what information a user 
        accesses on one Web page to simplify subsequent interactions with that 
        Web site by the same user or to use the information to streamline the 
        user’s transactions on related Web pages. This makes it easier for a user 
        to move from Web page to Web page and to complete commercial transactions 
        over the Internet. Cookies should make your online experience easier and 
        more personalized.</p>
      <h5>How Do We Use Information We Collect from Cookies?</h5>
      <p>We use Web site browser software tools such as cookies and Web server logs 
        to gather information about our Web site users’ browsing activities, in 
        order to constantly improve our Web site and better serve our customers. 
        This information assists us to design and arrange our Web pages in the 
        most user-friendly manner and to continually improve our Web site to better 
        meet the needs of our customers and prospective customers.</p>
      <p>Cookies help us collect important business and technical statistics. The information 
        in the cookies lets us trace the paths followed by users to our Web site 
        as they move from one page to another. Web server logs allow us to count 
        how many people visit our Web site and evaluate our Web site’s visitor 
        capacity. We do not use these technologies to capture your individual 
        email address or any personally identifying information about you although 
        they do permit us to send focused online banner advertisements or other 
        such responses to you.</p>
      <h5>Sharing Information with Affiliates</h5>
      <p>From time to time you may notice offers from outside companies advertised on 
        our Web site. We take measures to select product or service providers 
        that are responsible and afford privacy protections to their customers. 
        However, we cannot make any representations about the practices and policies 
        of these companies.</p>
      <h5>Sharing Information with Strategic Partners</h5>
      <p>We may enter into strategic marketing alliances or partnerships with third 
    parties who may be given access to aggregate information about our customers 
    in general.&nbsp; <b>At no time</b> will personal information such as your 
        name, address, telephone number and email be disclosed to anyone. In connection with strategic marketing alliances or 
        partnerships, we will retain all ownership rights to the information, 
        and we will not share information regarding your social security number 
        or other personal financial data.</p>
      <h5>Notice of New Services and Changes</h5>
	<p>Occasionally, we may also use the information we collect to notify you about 
        important changes to our Web site, new services and special offers we 
        think you will find valuable. As our client, you will be given the opportunity 
        to notify us of your desire not to receive these offers by clicking on 
        a response box when you receive such an offer or by sending us an email 
        request at <a href="mailto:customerservice@activeforever.com" class="bodylink">CustomerService@ActiveForever.com</a>. 
        </p>
      <h5>How Do We Secure Information Transmissions?</h5>
      <p>When you send confidential personal credit card information to us on our Web 
        site, a secure server software which we have licensed encrypts all information 
        you input before it is sent to us. The information is scrambled en route 
        and decoded once it reaches our Web site.</p>
      <p>Other email that you may send to us may not be secure unless we advise you that 
        security measures will be in place prior to your transmitting the information. 
        For that reason, we ask that you do not send confidential information 
        such as Social Security or account numbers to us through an unsecured 
        email.</p>
      <h5>How Do We Protect Your Information?</h5>
      <p><b>Information Security</b>. We utilize encryption/security software to safeguard the 
        confidentiality of personal information we collect from unauthorized access 
        or disclosure and accidental loss, alteration or destruction.</p>
      <p><b>Evaluation of Information Protection Practices.</b> Periodically, our operations 
        and business practices are reviewed for compliance with corporate policies 
        and procedures governing the security, confidentiality and quality of 
        our information.</p>
      <p><b>Employee Access, Training and Expectations.</b> Our corporate values, ethical standards, 
        policies and practices are committed to the protection of customer information. 
        In general, our business practices limit employee access to confidential 
        information, and limit the use and disclosure of such information to authorized 
        persons, processes and transactions.</p>
      <h5>How Can You Access and Correct Your Information?</h5>
      <p>You may request access to all your personally identifiable information that 
        we collect online and maintain in our database by emailing <a href="mailto:customerservice@activeforever.com" class="bodylink">CustomerService@ActiveForever.com</a>.</p>
      <h5>Do We Disclose Information to Outside Parties?</h5>
      <p>We may provide aggregate information about our customers, sales, Web site 
        traffic patterns and related Web site information to our affiliates or 
        reputable third parties, but this information will not include personally 
        identifying data, except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy.</p>
      <h5>What About Legally Compelled Disclosure of Information?</h5>
      <p>We may disclose information when legally compelled to do so, in other words, 
        when we, in good faith, believe that the law requires it or for the protection of our legal rights.</p>
      <h5>What About Other Web Sites Linked to Our Web Site?</h5>
      <p>We are not responsible for the practices employed by Web sites linked to 
        or from our Web site nor the information or content contained therein. 
        Often links to other Web sites are provided solely as pointers to information 
        on topics that may be useful to the users of our Web site.</p> 
      <h5>Secure Transfer of Information</h5>
      <p>All information gather and transferred on ActiveForever.com is secure, so you can shop online in confidence. ActiveForever.com uses a 128-bit SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption on all pages colleting private information (i.e. credit card data, email addresses, etc).</p>
