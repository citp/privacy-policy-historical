##### Your Rights

We respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws. 

As described in this notice, if you are using the Site through one of our partners (e.g. the organisation organising an action) then we are the processor of your Personal Information and our partner is the data controller. In such cases, if you want to exercise any data protection rights above or have questions or concerns about how your personal information is handled by Action Network as a processor on behalf of our partners, you should contact the relevant partner that has contracted with Action Network, and refer to their separate privacy notices. 

Because Action Network has a limited ability to access Personal Information our partners submit to the Site or that you submit to the partner on the Site, if you wish to make your request directly to Action Network, please provide the name of the partner who submitted your Personal Information to the Site or who you submitted Personal Information to on the Site. We will refer your request to that partner, and will support them as needed in responding to your request within a reasonable timeframe.

If you are a visitor from the EEA, you have the following data protection rights:

  * If you wish to **access, correct, update or request deletion** of your personal information, you can do so at any time by contacting the partner who you wish to delete your personal information, or by contacting us at [support@actionnetwork.org](mailto:support@actionnetwork.org) with the name of the partner and we will forward your request to them, as described above.
  * In addition, you can **object to processing** of your personal information, ask us to **restrict processing** of your personal information or **request portability** of your personal information. Again, you can exercise these rights by contacting the partner who controls your personal information, or by contacting us at [support@actionnetwork.org](mailto:support@actionnetwork.org) with the name of the partner and we will forward your request to them, as described above.
  * Similarly, if we have collected and process your personal information with your consent, then you can **withdraw your consent** at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
  * You have the **right to complain to a data protection authority** about our collection and use of your personal information. For more information, please contact your local data protection authority. For UK users, this is the [Information Commissioner's Office](https://ico.org.uk/). Contact details for data protection authorities in the EEA, Switzerland and certain non-European countries (including the US and Canada) are available [here](http://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/structure/data-protection-authorities/index_en.htm).



##### Visitors from Outside the United States

The Site’s offices and data processing equipment are located in the United States. If you visit the Site from another country, please be aware that information you provide to us or that we obtain through your use of the Site may be transferred to and processed in the United States and will be subject to United States law. United States privacy and data protection laws may not be equivalent to the laws in your country of residence. 

We have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your Personal Information will remain protected in accordance with this Notice. These safeguards include implementing the European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of Personal Information with our third-party service providers and partners, which require all parties to protect personal information they process from the EEA in accordance with European data protection law. Further details can be provided upon request.

##### Information Retention

We retain Personal Information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested, to provide our partners with a service they have requested, or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements). 

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your Personal Information, we will either delete or anonymise it at our partner’s request or, if this is not possible (for example, because your Personal Information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

Where we our processing Personal Information on behalf of one of our partners are we are a data processor we will process Personal Information as instructed by our partner.

##### Legal Basis For Processing Personal Information (For Visitors From The EEA)

If you are a visitor from the EEA, our legal basis for collecting and using the Personal Information described above will depend on the Personal Information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.

For all the data where Action Network is acting as processor, our partner makes that determination.

Where Action Network is acting as a controller, we will normally collect Personal Information from you only (i) where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you, (ii) where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your rights, or (iii) where we have your consent to do so. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you.

If we collect and use your Personal Information in reliance on our legitimate interests, this interest will normally be to operate the Site and service, communicating with you as necessary to provide our services, improving our platform, undertaking marketing, or for the purposes of detecting or preventing illegal activities. 

If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your Personal Information, please contact us using the contact details provided under the "Contact Us" heading below.

##### Children Under Age 13

We encourage parents to monitor their children's Internet usage and to caution them about the dangers of sharing Personal Information on the Internet. Although we welcome children under age 13 to visit the Site with parental supervision, children under age 13 should not visit the site on their own and should not submit any Personal Information to the Site. We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under age 13. If we learn that we have collected any Personal Information from a child under age 13 without verifiable parental consent, we will delete that information from our database as soon as possible.

##### Changes to the Privacy Notice

The Action Network may update the Notice at any time to reflect changes in our practices. If we modify the Notice, we will place a prominent notice on the Site and/or send a notice to the primary email address provided in your registration with the Site or take other appropriate measures to inform you, consistent with the significance of the changes we make. As part of any modification of the Notice, we will update the "last revised" date at the top of this Notice.
