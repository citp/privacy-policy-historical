#### Legal Terms

The Action Network, which operates www.actionnetwork.org and our other websites and mobile applications that link to that web address ("the Site"), takes your privacy very seriously. This policy is intended to inform you about how the Action Network gathers information from you when you visit the Site, uses and discloses that information, and how you can control the use and disclosure of your information, so you can make an informed decision about using the Site.

##### Scope

You acknowledge that the Action Network has no control over such third party websites and will not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to have been caused by or in connection with the use of or reliance on any content, advertising, products, or other materials on or available from such websites, nor from any information that you provide to such websites or that such websites collect from you. 

The Policy applies to the collection and use of personal information, which means information that identifies, describes, or is capable of being associated with, a particular individual, including, but not limited to, an individual's name, address, email address, telephone number, Social Security Number, passport number, driver's license or state identification card number, education, employment, employment history, bank account number, credit card number, debit card number, or any other financial information ("Personal Information"). 

Personal Information does not include "aggregate" information, which is data collected about the use of the Site or about a group or category of services or users, from which individual identities or other Personal Information has been removed. The Policy does not restrict or limit the Action Network's collection and use of aggregate information.

If you disclose any information in comment boards, discussion pages or elsewhere on the Site, it becomes public information and can be read, collected, or used by others. Please exercise caution when disclosing any Personal Information, and refrain from publicly disclosing direct contact information such as your mailing address, phone number, or email address.

##### Online Petitions, Events, and Forms

In addition, when you take action through the Action Network for petition organized by a third party, information you submit through the Site as part of the form filling process will be made available to such third party. The Action Network has no ability to control, and shall have no responsibility for, how such third party uses your information it so obtains.

  * Demographic data, such as age, gender and interests

##### How We Use Collected Information

We may use the collected information in various ways:

The Action Network will only make Personal Information about users available to third parties as described below:

  * To give third parties who have created actions the information of users who have filled out those actions
  * To trusted third parties including vendors, consultants, and volunteers employed to perform Site-related services, including database management, maintenance services, analytics, data processing, and email and text message distribution. These third parties have access to users' Personal Information only to perform these tasks on our behalf, and on the condition that they will maintain the confidentiality of all Personal Information.
  * To investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety or other rights and interests of any person, violations of the site's Terms of Use, or as otherwise required by law.

We may share aggregate information with third parties to help us develop content or services.

To customize your experience on this Site and to simplify the Site's registration process, we provide you with the opportunity to access or interact with third-party services, such as Facebook, Twitter, and Google Plus. When you connect to the Site through these third-party services, we may share Personal Information about you with these third-party service providers and they may share Personal Information about you with us. 

We may use data that we receive from these third-party service providers to:

  * Create relationships automatically within the Site (e.g., replicate Twitter relationships with other Site users)
  * Suggest relationships (e.g., suggest you connect with Facebook friends)
  * Populate a list of potential friends to whom you can send emails
  * Enhance and personalize your experience on the Site (e.g., import your profile picture, identify stories that are popular in your network, what your friends are saying about an article)



We may provide Personal Information to third-party service providers to:

  * Identify stories on which you have commented/which you have "liked" on the Site
  * Identify events that you have indicated you will attend



Note that if the Action Network discloses personal information (including a user's name, address or email) to a third party for direct marketing purposes, under California law Action Network must allow California users to request certain information about the disclosure. The California statute excludes from the definition of direct marketing the use of personal information (a) by bona fide tax exempt charitable or religious organizations to solicit charitable contributions, or (b) to raise funds from and communicate with individuals regarding politics and government. Our understanding is that the Action Network does not intend to disclose users' personal information to third parties for direct marketing purposes as defined in the statute.

##### Cookies

As is standard practice on many websites, we may set and access cookies, web beacons, Flash cookies, and other technologies on your computer. Please note that third parties, such as ad networks, advertising agencies, advertisers, and audience segment providers, may also set and access cookies, web beacons, Flash cookies, and other technologies on your computer when you visit the Site.

Cookies are small amounts of information stored in files within your computer's browser. Web sites can access only the cookies that they have stored on your computer. For example, if Acme computer company stores a cookie on your browser, Acme may access its own cookie but not that of another company.

The Action Network uses cookies for the following purposes:

  * To help us recognize you as a previous visitor and save and remember any preferences that may have been set while you were visiting the Site. For example, we may save your login information so you don't have to sign in every time you visit the site;
  * To help us customize the content you see when you visit the Site;
  * To help measure and research the effectiveness of our interactive online content, features, and other communications; and To track Site analytics and use, and to improve Site services.



We may also use web beacons (known as clear GIFs, web bugs, pixels, or action tags). These technologies are strings of code that deliver a tiny graphic image on a web page or in an email. Web beacons can recognize certain types of information on your computer such as cookies, the time and date a page is viewed, and a description of the page on which the web beacon is placed.

We use web beacons for various tracking purposes, like determining whether or not you are logged into the Site and whether or not you are connected to a third-party service.

Third parties also may use web beacons on the Site to receive auditing, research, and reporting information, or to understand your interests and select and deliver to you advertisements that are tailored to your interests.

Some of the Site's third-party partners may use Flash cookies, otherwise known as local shared objects (LSOs), to track user behaviors in various ways. LSOs keep collections of cookie-like data stored in a directory on a user's computer, and are installed through Adobe's Flash video player.

##### Collection of Information by Third Parties

Third party vendors, such as Google DoubleClick, Yahoo Tremor and 24/7 RealMedia, may automatically collect information about your visits to this and other websites, your IP address, your ISP, and the browser you use to visit the Site. They may collect this information using cookies, clear gifs, or other technologies. These third parties may use this information to place ads on other websites or to better understand the usage and visitation of the Site and other websites tracked by these third parties. This Policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, cookies, clear gifs or other technologies used by these third parties, and we encourage you to check the privacy policies of advertisers and/or ad services to learn about their use of cookies and other technologies.
