# ActionSprout Privacy Policy | ActionSprout Help Center

This privacy statement describes how we collect and use the personal information you provide on our site. It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information and how you can access and update this information.

#### Our Commitment To Privacy

Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.

#### The Information We Collect and How We Use It

In order to provide services to you, we may collect the following types of information:

**Information you provide** : When you participate in an ActionSprout campaign we will store and save the information you provide or authorize Facebook to provide. This information may include personally identifiable information such as your name, postal address, email address, etc.

**Cookies** : When you access files on the website, one or more cookies will be sent and stored on your computer. These cookies are used to save certain preferences on the website and identify you on future visits.

**Log information** : All information sent by your web browser and computer when you visit the website may be stored by our servers. This information may include your IP address, browser type, URL accessed, cookie information, the date and time of your request, and other information that may uniquely identify you.

#### Choices For Personal Information

You can choose to limit the storage of cookies on your computer when accessing the website. Limiting or prohibiting cookies from being stored on your computer may affect the usability of the website services.

#### Information Sharing

Information collected about you may be shared with third parties to facilitate the serving of advertising on the website. Some of these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) may use technology such as cookies and web beacons and may collect additional information about you.

ActionSprout provides an online service that collects information about you on behalf of other third parties. ActionSprout makes this information available to the third parties that have created the campaign running on ActionSprout’s servers. This information can include any information you provide along with other personal information that we collect and that is accessible through permissions you grant to our applications on the Facebook, Twitter, and other platforms.

By completing an action you are explicitly opting in for communications from the organization who is running the action and any partners they may authorize to send correspondence to people who have opted in for communications from them.

#### Our Commitment To Data Security

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.

#### Our Commitment To Children’s Privacy

Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.

#### How You Can Access Or Correct Your Information

Information that is not accessible online can be modified or deleted by sending us a request using the contact procedure in this policy. We may decline to process requests that we find are unreasonable. To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.

#### Changes To This Privacy Policy

This privacy policy may change from time to time. We will post any changes to the privacy policy on this page.
