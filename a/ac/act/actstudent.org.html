<h2>
Policy Update</h2>
<p>
ACT has updated its privacy policy as part of its continuous improvement efforts. The updated policy takes effect on March&nbsp;31, 2015. Individuals or organizations accessing the ACT website or participating in ACT assessments, programs or services after March&nbsp;31 will be covered by the updated policy.</p>
<p>
ACT has consolidated its data policies and practices into a centralized policy. The ACT Privacy Policy applies to the online and offline collection of data and outlines what information ACT collects, how ACT uses personally identifiable information, and when it discloses information consistent with ACT’s mission. The Privacy Policy provides a transparent and detailed description of ACT’s data policies and procedures.</p>
<p>
View the previous <a href="2014-act-privacy-policy.html">ACT Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
<h2>
Scope of this Policy</h2>
<p>
At ACT, Inc. we recognize the importance of protecting the privacy of personally identifying information and believe that use and sharing of it is important to our mission of “Helping people achieve education and workplace success.”</p>
<p>
This policy explains how ACT collects, uses, maintains, shares, and protects your information when you visit ACT websites that provide a link to this privacy policy (collectively, the “Site”), as well as when you provide your personally identifying information to us offline when you participate in ACT’s assessments, programs, and services.</p>
<h2>
Children’s Privacy</h2>

<h2>

When you voluntarily register for or take an assessment, or access ACT programs and services, you provide personally identifying information to us. If you do not provide mandatory personally identifying information, such as name, gender, address and date of birth, you may not be able to complete certain online transactions, or access or benefit from certain ACT assessments, programs, or services.</p>
<h2>
Marketing by Others</h2>
<p>
ACT honors your preferences with regard to sharing your personally identifying information with other organizations for their marketing purposes. You will be given the choice prior to having your personally identifying information shared with these other organizations for their marketing purposes.</p>
<h2>
Cookies and Web Beacons</h2>
<p>
When you access the Site, certain non-personally identifying information is automatically logged. This information may include your operating system, screen settings, Web browser software, and referring website, if any. It is used for system improvement and administration, security, statistical analysis purposes, and other internal business purposes.</p>
<p>
The Site may use service providers for analytics purposes. These providers collect information about you anonymously and report website trends without identifying individual visitors. These service providers use their own cookies to track visitor interactions. Website owners can view a variety of reports containing aggregate information about how visitors interact with their website so they can improve their website. ACT does not control the cookies and their use may be governed by the privacy policies of the service providers employing these cookies.</p>
<p>
Cookies are small text files that a website can send to a user’s browser for storage on the hard drive. Cookies can make use of the Web easier by saving and administering status, preferences, and other user information. Cookies used by the Site do not contain your personally identifying information.</p>
<p>
The Site also may use Web beacons, which are small strings of code that deliver a graphic image on a Web page or in an email message for the purpose of transferring data. ACT may use cookies and Web beacons to route users through the Site, customize users’ experiences on the Site, to help us send you information about programs and services, and to improve the Site.</p>
<p>
Most browsers are set to accept cookies but users can change the setting to block cookies. Although disabling cookies will not interfere with your ability to access the Site, users will need to accept cookies to use certain services on the Site, including test registration. Users can disable the ability of Web beacons to capture information by blocking cookies.</p>
<h2>
Links and Websites</h2>
<p>
The Site may contain links to non-ACT affiliated websites. ACT does not control the privacy policies or practices of these websites. You should review the privacy policy of the non-ACT affiliated website before providing any information through these websites. ACT is not responsible for the content or practices of any linked non-ACT affiliated websites, and provides these links solely for the convenience and information of visitors to the Site.</p>
<h2>
Choice, Opt-Out, and How ACT Responds to Do Not Track Signals</h2>
<p>
ACT strives to provide you with choices about our use of your personally identifying information.    As a user of the Site, as well as for offline purposes, you decide whether to proceed with activities that request personally identifying information. However, if you do not provide the requested information you may not be able to complete certain online transactions, have access to, or benefit from certain ACT assessments, programs, or services.</p>
<p>
ACT occasionally uses your personally identifying information to contact you regarding ACT assessments, programs, and services.  You will be provided instructions on how to opt out of receiving further marketing communications by email. If you opt-out of receiving these marketing communications, note that you will still receive program-related messages and similar transactional communications by email about your registration for an ACT assessment or other services and programs in which you participate.</p>
<p>
With respect to the Site and Do Not Track Signals, ACT conducts conversion tracking with other websites such as Twitter and Facebook to collect data for purposes of tracking your use of ACT advertisements on those websites. We also target ACT’s advertisements on social media websites, such as Facebook and Twitter. This means that after visiting our Site, if you later log into Facebook or Twitter, an ACT advertisement may appear.  To learn more about your choices regarding online tracking, please visit these sites:</p>

<li><a href="http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/Browser/DoNotTrack/Default.html" target="_blank">http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/Browser/DoNotTrack/Default.html</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>
Access and Correction of Personally Identifying Information and Closing Your Account</h2>
<p>
If you need to update your contact information (address, email address and/or telephone number), please contact ACT Customer Service at 1-800-498-6065 or <a href="mailto:customerservices@act.org">customerservices@act.org</a>.</p>
<p>
For other requests to access, update, correct, or delete your personally identifying information, or request that ACT close your web account, contact ACT’s Data Protection Official listed below.</p>
<p>
ACT will seek to meet all requests to delete personally identifying information unless it is required to be retained for contractual or legal reasons as described in this privacy policy.  Please be aware that all assessment scores are maintained by ACT indefinitely and closing your account does not delete your assessment scores.</p>

<h2>
Retention of Information</h2>
<p>
ACT will retain your information for as long as is necessary to fulfill any of the uses identified in this privacy policy or to comply with applicable legal, regulatory, or court orders.</p>
<h2>
Security and Confidentiality</h2>
<p>
Protecting the personally identifying information through the use of reasonable administrative, physical and technical safeguards is important to ACT. We use secure sockets layer (SSL) transmission, a protocol for establishing a secure connection for transmitting your personally identifying information. ACT has security protocols and measures in place to protect your personally identifying information from unauthorized access, alteration, and unlawful disclosure.</p>
<p>
In the course of business, ACT may collect or ask that you disclose your Social Security number.  To the extent practicable, ACT protects the confidentiality of all information we collect, including Social Security numbers. Accordingly, ACT prohibits the unlawful disclosure of personally identifying information, including Social Security numbers, and limits access to Social Security numbers. When ACT disposes of personally identifying information, we take reasonable measures to protect against unauthorized access to the information.</p>
<h2>
Changes to this Policy</h2>
<p>
ACT reserves the right to modify this privacy policy at any time. If ACT makes material changes to this privacy policy, the changes will be posted on this Site to alert you.</p>
