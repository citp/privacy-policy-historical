Please read on to learn how we collect and use information obtained from this website. By visiting the ActivTrak.com website and domain name, or otherwise accessing any other linked pages, features, content, products, services or applications offered from time to time by ActivTrak in connection therewith (collectively, the “Website”), you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy. If you do not accept such practices and policies, you may not use the Website.

If you have any questions about our Privacy Policy or the Terms and Conditions, contact us at support@bgrove.com

## SCOPE OF PRIVACY POLICY

This Privacy Policy governs ActivTrak’s treatment of personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) that ActivTrak gathers when you access the Website and when you use ActivTrak’s services or applications. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that ActivTrak does not own or control, or to individuals that ActivTrak does not employ or manage.

## PERSONAL INFORMATION

The information we gather from customers enables us to personalize and improve our services. We collect the following types of information from our customers:

## Personal Information You Provide to Us

We may receive and store any information you enter on our website or provide to us in any other way. The types of Personal Information we collect include without limitation your full name, email address, IP address, browser information, username, and any other information necessary for us to provide our services. You may choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of some features. The Personal Information you provide may be used for such purposes as responding to your requests for certain services, customizing the content you see, and communicating with you about new services.

## Personal Information Collected Automatically

We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with our Website or use our services. ActivTrak automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, cookie information, and the page you requested.

Generally, our service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our Website and its components, similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show. ActivTrak only uses this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often customers use parts of the Website or services so that we can make the Website appealing to as many customers as possible, and improve those services. As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our customers, collectively, use our Website or services. We may share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use the Website or services, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal online experience. Again, ActivTrak never discloses aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally.

## Information collected by ActivTrak Agent

In order to use the service, you will be required to download and install a software application onto computers that you wish to monitor as part of the service. This software, ActivTrak Agent, collects information about the user’s use of the computer that may extend beyond the information collected as part of registration, including without limitation user behavior data such as application usage, website visits, screenshots and idle time. Every account has it’s own unique agent associated with it. An ActivTrak Agent created for you will only report data to your account.

ActivTrak Agent is not a keystroke-logging application it does not record any keystrokes or mouse movements.

Information collected by ActivTrak Agent will only be available to registered users on your ActivTrak account. Administrative users have the ability to delete data that is collected by ActivTrak Agent, and no copy will be retained by the company.

## Email Communications

We often receive a confirmation when you open an email from ActivTrak if your computer supports this type of program. ActivTrak uses this confirmation to help us make emails more interesting and helpful. We also compare our customer list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our customers.

When you receive marketing and promotional email from ActivTrak, you may opt out of receiving further e-mails of those types by following the included instructions to unsubscribe. ActivTrak may send you administrative and customer service-related email messages for which you may not be given the option to unsubscribe. For example, you may receive messages about your account, the provisioning of requested services, system status update messages, and service and security announcements which are mandatory. If you no longer wish to receive administrative and customer-service-related email messages, you must deactivate your ActivTrak account.

## Information from Other Sources

For purposes such as improving personalization of our service, we may receive information about you from other sources and add it to your account information. For instance, as part of the configuration of ActivTrak, your account administrator may provide information about you, in order to help you make best use of our system.

## Cookies

In order to provide you with thorough and personalized service, ActivTrak uses “cookies” to keep and occasionally track information about you.
