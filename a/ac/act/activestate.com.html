<span class="heading">ActiveState Web site Privacy Statement</span>
<br><br>
<span class="subheading">Information Collection and Use</span>
<p>ActiveState is the sole owner of the information collected on this site.  We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways that differ from those disclosed in this statement.  ActiveState collects information from our users at several different points on our website.</p>

<span class="subheading">Security</span>
<p>This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information.  When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, their information is protected both online and offline.  
When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL.  While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to unlocked or open, when you are just "surfing".</p>

<span class="subheading">Order</span>
<p>We request information from the user on our order form.  Here, users must provide contact information (e.g. name and shipping address) and financial information (e.g. credit card number, expiration date).  This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customers' orders.  If we have difficulty processing an order, this contact information is used to contact the user.</p>

<span class="subheading">Cookies</span>
<p>A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive, containing information about the user.  Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site.  For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the user would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site.  If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site.  The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in some areas of our site.  For example, the user will not be able to make fully utilize our mailing list subscription tools.  Cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site. </p>

<span class="subheading">Log Files</span>
<p>The servers we use to run our website generate standard traffic log files.  We use these files to prepare aggregate traffic statistics for our site.  There is no personally-identifiable information in these log files.  We use IP addresses and cookie values to analyze trends, administer the site, track users' movements, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.</p>

<span class="subheading">Suppliers</span>
<p>We use an outside company to ship orders, and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. </p>

<span class="subheading">Links</span>
<p>This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that ActiveState is not responsible for the privacy practices of other such sites.  We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information.  This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by the ActiveState Web site. </p>

<span class="subheading">Newsletter</span>
<p>If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask for contact information such as name and email address. </p>

<span class="subheading">Surveys &amp; Contests</span>
<p>From time to time, our site requests information from users via surveys or contests.  Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice of whether or not to disclose this information.  Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code and age range).  Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes.  Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. </p>

<!--

<span class="subheading">Tell-A-Friend</span>
<p>If a user elects to use our referral service to inform a friend about our site, we ask them for the friend's name and email address.  ActiveState will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site.  ActiveState stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email.  The friend may contact ActiveState at [INSERT URL] to request the removal of this information from our database. </p>

-->

<span class="subheading">Mailing lists</span>
<p>Users may be offered the option of subscribing to relevant mailing lists at the time of purchase, for reasons of user convenience only. We send all new mailing list subscribers a welcome email to verify subscription information. We use some ActiveState mailing lists to post announcements regarding products, services, promotions, and a newsletter.  It is not necessary to subscribe to any ActiveState mailing list to use our Web site or buy our products.</p>
 
<span class="subheading">Requested services and product trials</span>
<p>We communicate with the user to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account via email or phone.   We also send expiration reminder notices by email to users who have obtained a trial license for one of our products.</p>

<span class="subheading">Choice/Opt-in</span>
<p>Our users are given the opportunity to "opt-in" to having their information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for the information.  For example, our order form has an "opt-in" mechanism so users who buy a product from us and who want to receive marketing material, can add their email address to our lists.  We only add users to our lists when they expressly agree to be added.</p>
Users of our site are always notified when their information is being collected by any outside parties.  We do this so our users can make an informed choice as to whether they should proceed with services that require an outside party, or not. <p></p>

<span class="subheading">Notification of Changes</span>
<p>If we change our privacy policy, we will post notification of those changes on our Homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under which circumstances, if any, we disclose it.  If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email.  Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.</p>

<span class="subheading">Questions</span>
<p>If you have questions about this privacy statement, please email <a href="mailto:website-feedback@ActiveState.com">website-feedback@ActiveState.com</a>.</p>
