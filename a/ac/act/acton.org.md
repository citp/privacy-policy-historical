# Privacy Policy & Terms of Use | Acton Institute

## **Information Collected By acton.org**

When you interact with The Acton Institute for the Study of Religion and Liberty (“The Acton Institute” or “Acton”) through acton.org and other Acton sites, we may collect information from you, as further described below.

As part of the operation of The Acton Institute's main web site, acton.org, and other Acton sites, we gather certain types of information from users. Since your privacy is important to us, we would like to explain the types of information we gather, what we do with said information, and how to correct or change the information.

The Acton Institute does not sell your information.

**Information You Provide:** We collect two main types of information from users and donors: information voluntarily provided when you register for email updates, newsletters, and events, or make a donation. This may include but is not limited to personal data such as name, zip code, email address, mailing address, and demographic information. The second type of data collected is anonymized, aggregated data such as information about traffic patterns on acton.org (for example, how many users visit acton.org on a daily basis).

  * **Automatic collection -**  When you interact with us through one of our websites, we receive and store certain information on usage patterns. We may store such information or such information may be included in databases owned and maintained by affiliates, agents, or service providers. Acton may use such information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to our site.
  * **Aggregated information -**  Aggregated information, such as which pages users visit, is collected through various means. One of these ways is through an IP address, a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you access the Internet. Web servers, the computers that "serve up" Web pages, automatically identify your computer by its IP address. When you request a page from an Acton website, our servers log your IP address. Acton does not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, so although your session will be logged, your session will remain anonymous to us. Acton logs IP addresses for the purposes of system administration only. In an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of our websites, we may conduct research on our user and donor demographics, interests and behavior based on the information collected. This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate, anonymized basis, and we may share this aggregate data with our affiliates, agents, and partners. We may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our mission, products, events, and services to current and prospective supporters and donors, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.
  * **Use of Cookies -** Acton uses cookies to automate the process of logging on to certain areas of acton.org and sub-sites. A cookie is a small data file stored on your computer that contains a single, randomly assigned user ID number. By recognizing this ID number, Acton sites can automatically provide you with the personalized content for which you requested. Cookies can neither read any other files on your computer, nor damage your computer. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you'd prefer, you can set your browser to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. You can disable cookies by changing your browser settings. Further information about how to disable cookies can be found on your Internet browser provider's website. We may use third party web site analytic tools such as Google Analytics, HubSpot, and Parse.ly, among others, on our websites that employ cookies to collect certain information concerning your use of our websites. Additionally, some of the third-party analytics tools we use also set “tracking pixels” to record log data such as open rates for emails. We encourage you to research the aforementioned tools’ privacy policies if you are concerned about their handling of information.



## **How we use your information**

We use the information you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If you provide information for a certain reason, we may use the information in connection with the reason for which it was provided. For instance, if you sign up for an email newsletter, we will use the information to send you said newsletter. If you contact us by email, we will use the information you provide to answer your question or resolve your problem. Also, if you provide information in order to obtain access to Acton products, events, or services, we will use your information to provide you with access to such products/events/services and to monitor your use of such products/events/services. Acton and its affiliates may also use your information collected through our websites to help us improve the content and functionality of our sites, and to better understand our users and donors. The Acton Institute may use this information to contact you in the future to tell you about products, events, and services we believe will be of interest to you. If we do so, each marketing communication we send you will contain instructions permitting you to "opt-out" of receiving future marketing communications. In addition, if at any time you wish not to receive any future marketing communications or you wish to have your name deleted from our mailing lists, please contact us as indicated below.

If you are a parent or guardian of a child under the age of 13 and believe he or she has disclosed personal information to us please contact us at [privacy@acton.org](mailto:privacy@acton.org). For residents of the EEA, where processing of personal information is based on consent, Acton will not knowingly engage in that processing for users under the age of consent established by applicable data protection law. If we learn that we are engaged in that processing with such users, we will halt such processing and will take reasonable measures to promptly remove applicable information from our records.

The Acton Institute encourages parents and guardians to spend time with their children online and to be fully familiar with the sites visited by their children. In general, acton.org will not contain content that is reasonably considered unsuitable for children.

## **Links to other sites**

This Privacy Policy applies only to Acton websites. Acton websites may contain links to other websites not operated or controlled by us. The policies and procedures described in this Privacy Policy do not apply to aforementioned sites. The links from Acton websites do not imply that we endorse or have reviewed the aforementioned sites.

## **Data retention**

We generally retain personal data for so long as it may be relevant to the purposes identified herein. To dispose of personal data, we may anonymize it, delete it or take other appropriate steps. Data may persist in copies made for backup and mission continuity purposes for additional time.

## **Security**

The Acton Institute understands the need for user privacy and access to user data is strictly limited and can only be accessed by specific individuals who have the necessary credentials and qualifications. We take reasonable steps to protect the information provided to us from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no Internet or email transmission is ever fully secure or error free. Please keep this in mind when disclosing any information via the Internet.

## **Your data rights**

You can unsubscribe from certain emails by clicking the “unsubscribe” link they contain. You can opt out from certain cookie-related processing by changing the proper settings in your browser. Individuals in the European Economic Area, Canada, Costa Rica and some other jurisdictions outside the United States have certain legal rights to obtain confirmation of whether we hold personal data about them, to access personal data we hold about them, and to obtain its correction, update, amendment, or deletion in appropriate circumstances. They may also object to our uses or disclosures of personal data, to request a restriction on its processing, or withdraw any consent, though such actions typically will not have retroactive effect. They also will not affect our ability to continue processing data in lawful ways.

  * **How do I object or restrict the manner in which Acton processes my personal data?** You have a right to ask us to stop using or limit our use of your personal data in certain circumstances—for example, if we have no lawful basis to keep using your data, or if you think your personal data is inaccurate.
