		any of those sites, your information is governed by their privacy policies. 
		We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any Web site you visit.
		 
		<h2 class="subhead-legal greywarm">Cookies</h2>
		
		A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous 
		unique identifier that is sent to your browser from a web site's computers 
		and stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies are required to use the 
		Act-On Site. We use cookies to assist in delivering the Service and to 
		provide a positive and personalized user experience. Our persistent

		that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what 
		content is effective.  Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, 
		similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements 
		of Web users.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer 
		hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size 
		of the period at the end of this sentence. We may tie the information 
		gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information.

		As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store 
		it in log files.  This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser 
		type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time 
		stamp, and clickstream data.  
		<p>
		We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, 
		to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic 
		information about our user base as a whole.  
		</p><p>
		We do link some of this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information. 
		This allows us to deliver a better experience by reducing the amount of data that needs to be 
		entered when filling out forms, downloading gated content, completing surveys, etc.  
		 
		</p><h2 class="subhead-legal greywarm">Behavioral Targeting/ Re-Targeting</h2>

		We partner with a third party ad network to either display advertising on our Web site or to

		sites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests.  If you wish to not have
