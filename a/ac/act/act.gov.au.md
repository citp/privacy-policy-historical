## Privacy Statement for ACT Government

The Australian Capital Territory Government has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to protecting personal privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this web site: [www.act.gov.au](http://www.act.gov.au/)

##  Cookies

Our site uses cookies to allow customers to switch between the "text only" and full graphic versions of the site.

> ### What is a cookie?
> 
> A cookie is piece of information that is sent to a browser to allow the browser to remember information. This means that if you visit a site and make a decision and a cookie is set, then next time the site is visited, it will remember what decision you made previously.
> 
> ### How does this relate to the ACT Government Web Server?
> 
> For the users who are visually impaired or do not want to view the ACT Government Web Server with graphics, a text only version is available. In order to ensure that all pages on the server are viewed in text only format, a cookie must be set to record the decision. If this were not the case, then every time a new page was selected, it would appear initially in graphical format and the text only version would need to be selected each time.
> 
> The only personal information that is recorded is that the text only version was chosen. This information is stored on your computer. Cookies can be removed at any time from your hard drive.
> 
> Please note, the text only version cannot be viewed without accepting the cookie.
