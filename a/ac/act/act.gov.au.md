## Personal information

Personal information is defined as information about an individual whose identity is apparent or reasonably identifiable.

No personal information is collected _automatically_ through this website. All personal information collected and/or stored must be voluntarily provided by you.

Access Canberra will only collect personal information about you when you voluntarily participate in an activity that asks for information, such as:

  * Sending an enquiry or feedback
  * Participating in a survey
  * Making a booking
  * Undertaking a payment or other transaction
  * Creating an account
  * Opting in to communication or subscription services



Access Canberra will collect personal and financial information (e.g. postal address and invoice numbers) where you choose to provide this information. The information requested in each case is required to complete the transaction. The information collected through the online version of the transaction is equivalent to the information collected using the alternate channels such as through an [Access Canberra Shopfront](https://www.accesscanberra.act.gov.au/app/answers/detail/a_id/23).

If you choose not to provide personal information when completing one or more of these activities, you may not be able to complete that activity. If you choose not to participate in these activities, your choice will in no way affect your ability to browse these websites and online facilities.

## Use of Your Personal Information

Personal information you provide when sending an enquiry or feedback, participating in surveys, making a booking, undertaking a payment or transaction, creating an account, or opting in to communication or subscription services is strictly used only for the purpose it was collected and where extra information is required in order to provide the service you have requested.

Access Canberra may use your contact details to respond appropriately, for example to advise receipt, address issues you identify, or to seek action from another government agency or other organisation.

Survey information is used only for the purpose designated.

If Access Canberra asks you for personal information in order to provide you with a service that you have requested then you will be informed how that personal information will be used if you choose to give it to us. Where your information will be shared with another government agency or other organisation, a link to the relevant agency or organisation's privacy policy will be provided.

Access Canberra will not share information about you with other government agencies or other organisations without your permission unless:

  * it is necessary to provide you with a service that you have requested;
  * it is required or authorised by law;
  * where permitted general situations exist, such as to lessen or prevent a threat to life, health or safety; to assist with the location of a missing person; or to investigate suspected unlawful activity or serious misconduct relating to our functions;



## Storage and Security of Your Personal Information
