YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

When you participate in a competition or offer we typically collect your name, address, telephone number, email address and date of birth. Sometimes other information may be collected which usually relates to the offer in which you participate. The information is collected so that we can fulfill the service we are providing to you which includes passing your information to the Partner providing the information and/or competition in which you are interested. Also you are giving your permission for us to share your information with third parties including Optical Express (Westfield) Limited who provide products or services which we think will be of interest to you, which may be unrelated to the offerings on this Site.

  


When you participate in a competition and/or enquire about an offer you are agreeing to receive promotional offers from ActiveYou.co.uk, the partner company sponsoring the competition/offer and possibly third parties based in the UK, EEA, USA or Canada. These promotional offers could be sent to you by email, in the post, by telephone or by text message. Please be aware that these countries have less stringent data security standards than those of the UK, and that by signing up on this site you are agreeing to the transfer of your information to those countries. You also agree for your information to be passed to a tracing company to be used for their products & services. 

If you would prefer not to receive promotions in the future, you can unsubscribe at any time. Please see how to unsubscribe below.
