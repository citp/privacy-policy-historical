					<h2>Active-Domain - Privacy Statements</h2>
                              <h5>Information Collection and Use</h5>
					<p>Active-Domain is the sole owner of the information 
					collected on this site. We do not sell, share, or rent this 
					information to others in ways different from what is 
					disclosed in this statement. We collects information from 
					our users at several different points on our website.</p>
					<h5>Registration</h5>
					<p>In order to register domain names and access certain 
					sections of this site, a user must complete a registration 
					form. During registration a user is required to give their 
					contact information (such as name and email address). This 
					information is used to contact the user about the services 
					on our site for which they have purchased/subscribed. The 
					types of personal information collected at these pages 
					include but not limited to the following:</p>
					<p style="margin-left: 40px">Name<br>
					Address<br>
					Email Address<br>
					Phone Number<br>
					etc.</p>
					<h5>Order </h5>
					<p>We request information from the user on our order form. 
					Here a user must provide contact information (like name, 
					contact number, and email address) and financial information 
					(like credit card number, expiration date). This information 
					is used for billing purposes and to fill customer's orders. 
					If we have trouble processing an order, this contact 
					information is used to get in touch with the user.</p>
					<h5>Cookies</h5>
					<p>A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard 
					drive containing information about the user. Usage of a 
					cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable 
					information while on our site. Once the user closes their 
					browser, the cookie simply terminates. If a user rejects the 
					cookie, they may still use our site. The only drawback to 
					this is that the user will be limited in some areas of our 
					site. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the 
					interests of our users to enhance the experience on our 
					site.</p>
					<p>Some of our business partners may use cookies on our site 
					(for example, advertisers). However, we have no access to or 
					control over these cookies.</p>
					<h5>Log Files </h5>
					<p>We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the 
					site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic 
					information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked 
					to personally identifiable information.</p>
					<h5>Sharing</h5>
					<p>We may share aggregated demographic information with our 
					partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal 
					information that can identify any individual person. We use 
					an outside credit card processing company to bill users for 
					products and services. These companies do not retain, share, 
					store or use personally identifiable information for any 
					secondary purposes.</p>
					<p>We partner with other parties to provide specific 
					services. When the user signs up for these services, we will 
					share names, or other contact information that is necessary 
					for the third party to provide these services. These parties 
					are not allowed to use personally identifiable information 
					except for the purpose of providing these services.</p>
					<h5>Links</h5>
					<p>This web site contains links to other sites. Please be 
					aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices 
					of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when 
					they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of 
					each and every web site that collects personally 
					identifiable information. This privacy statement applies 
					solely to information collected by this Web site.</p>
					<h5>Security </h5>
					<p>This website takes every precaution to protect our users' 
					information. When users submit sensitive information via the 
					website, your information is protected both online and 
					off-line.</p>
					<p>When our registration/order form asks users to enter 
					sensitive personal information, that information is 
					encrypted through SSL. While on a secure page, such as our 
					order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such 
					as Mozilla Firefox or Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes 
					locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 
					'surfing'.</p>
					<p>While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive 
					information online, we also do everything in our power to 
					protect user-information off-line. All of our users' 
					information, not just the sensitive information mentioned 
					above, is restricted in our office. Only employees who need 
					the information to perform a specific job (for example, our 
					billing staff or a customer service representative) are 
					granted access to personally identifiable information. Our 
					employees are regularly notified and/or reminded about the 
					importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to 
					ensure our customers' information is protected.</p>
					<h5>Special Offers </h5>
					<p>We send all customers a confirmation email for every 
					order completed and provide you username and password to 
					access your domain name. Established customers will 
					occasionally receive information on products, services, 
					special deals, and a newsletter. Out of respect for the 
					privacy of our users we present the option to not receive 
					these types of communications. Such request can be made by 
					contacting our Sales Department at
					<a href="http://support.domainpanel.com" rel="nofollow">
					http://support.domainpanel.com</a>.</p>
					<h5>Site and Service Updates </h5>
					<p>We also send the user site and service announcement 
					updates. Customers are not able to un-subscribe from service 
					announcements, which contain important information about the 
					service. We communicate with the user to provide requested 
					services and in regards to issues relating to their account 
					via email or phone. </p>
					<h5>Correction/Updating Personal Information</h5>
					<p>If a user's personally identifiable information changes 
					(such as your address or phone number), or if a user no 
					longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a 
					way to correct, update or remove that user's personal data 
					provided to us. This can usually be done by contacting our 
					Customer Support at <a href="http://support.domainpanel.com" rel="nofollow">http://support.domainpanel.com</a>.</p>
					<h5>Notification of Changes </h5>
					<p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post 
					those changes on this page so our users are always aware of 
					what information we collect, how we use it, and under 
					circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we 
					decide to use personally identifiable information in a 
					manner different from that stated at the time it was 
					collected, we will notify users by way of an email. 
					Customers will have a choice as to whether or not we use 
					their information in this different manner. We will use 
					information in accordance with the privacy policy under 
					which the information was collected.</p>
