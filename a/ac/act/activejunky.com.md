AJ may use third-parties (such as network advertisers) to serve advertisements on the AJ website, and we may use traffic measurement services to analyze traffic on the AJ website. Network advertisers are third-parties that display advertisements based on your visits to the AJ websites and other websites you have visited. This practice is sometimes called “behavioral advertising.” 

Third-party ad serving allows AJ and third-parties to target advertisements to you for products and services that may interest you (behavioral advertising). AJ’s third-party ad network providers, the advertisers, the sponsors, and/or traffic measurement services may set and access their own cookies and other Tracking Technologies on your computer. For example, the Google Trusted Store badge displayed on some of our Websites is served to you through the use of cookies. Cookies may also track certain behavioral information regarding users of your computer via a Device ID. These third-party cookies and other tracking technologies (e.g., clear GIFs, pixels) are set to, among other things: 

  * help deliver advertisements to you for products or services that may be of interest to you,
  * prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times, and
  * help us and the third parties understand the usefulness to you of the advertisements that have been delivered to you.

Any images (or any other parts of a web page) served by third-parties in association with third-party cookies may serve as web beacons which enable third-parties to carry out the previously described activities. 

Third-party cookies, web beacons, and other third-party tracking technologies are governed by each third-party’s specific privacy policy, not this one. 

AJ may use a variety of companies to serve advertisements on the AJ websites.
