To provide our services, we may collect your personal information in various ways. We explain the ways below and provide, in square brackets, the lawful bases for each as obliged by the EU GDPR.

**1\. Browsing our website:**

  * Log files: When you browse our website, our services automatically receive and store information from your browser such as your IP address and the pages you visit. This information is stored in log files for up to 2 days. We may use this information to defend our servers against abuse, troubleshoot technical problems and understand how our platform is used. _[Legal obligation GDPR Article 6(1)(c)] [Legitimate interests GDPR Article 6(1)(f)]_
  * Analytics: To improve the website for our visitors and Members, we collect anonymized and aggregated (grouped) information (such as pages viewed, length of visit, browser and device). The data is stored for up to 5 years. It helps us to know what you like, so we can provide more! _[Consent GDPR Article 6(1)(a)] [Legitimate interests GDPR Article 6(1)(f)]_
  * Cookies: Like most websites, our website uses cookies. We use some necessary cookies, and some statistical cookies. Where necessary (for the statistical cookies) we ask for consent. You can find out what cookies are, how we use them and how you can control and/or remove them on our Cookie Policy page, which is an integral part of this Privacy Statement. _[Legitimate interests GDPR Article 6(1)(f)] [Consent GDPR Article 6(1)(a)]_



**2\. Creating an account:**

  * The first step in becoming a Member is creating an account on the website by providing your name and email address. We store these on our servers. If you become a Member, we store your information as long as your Membership lasts and as long as we are legally required. If you don't become a Member, we delete your information automatically after 7 days. _[Contract GDPR Article 6(1)(b)]_



**3\. Purchasing a Membership:**

  * When you become a paid Member, our shopping card provider stores necessary information such as your name, email address, country (self-certified) and IP Address. We do not store your credit card or bank details ourselves as we use payment processors for security, but we are legally required to keep a record of these transactions for at least 6 years after the end of the financial year that you joined up in and, for EU citizens, for 10 years (to comply with EU Digital VAT policy). You can find more details about our shopping card provider and payment processors below. _[Contract GDPR Article 6(1)(b), [Legal Obligation GDPR Article 6(1)(c)]_



**4\. Subscribing to the newsletter:**

  * When you sign up for our newsletter you give us your email address through one of our forms, and then confirm your request by clicking a link in a confirmation email. We use a newsletter service (details below) which stores your email address and IP address as well as information such as whether you open a newsletter or click on a link, which helps us to provide a better newsletter service. _[Consent GDPR Article 6(1)(a)] [Legitimate interests GDPR Article 6(1)(f)]_



**5\. Contacting us:**

  * When you contact us via email, we will save your message and contact details in order to provide support. _[Legitimate interests GDPR Article 6(1)(f)]_
  * When you contact us via our Help Desk, our service provider stores your name (if provided), email address and IP address so that we can respond to you promptly and efficiently. _[Legitimate interests GDPR Article 6(1)(f)]_
