# ACE Cash Express, Inc. General Information

ACE America’s Cash Express wants every customer, associate and vendor to know how we protect a customer’s financial privacy. This policy exists so that everyone can understand what our business practices are in handling the nonpublic personal information that is provided to ACE. 

First and foremost, our main guiding principle on privacy is: **ACE does not disclose any** **nonpublic personal information about our customers to any company that does not have a marketing agreement with ACE or is not affiliated with ACE, except as permitted or required by law.** That means we do not sell customers names, addressees, phone numbers or any other information to phone solicitors, sales organizations, mailing lists, database marketers or others who would pay ACE money for access to our customers’ records. 

ACE may disclose  nonpublic personal information to companies or financial institutions with which we have joint marketing agreements or have been hired by us to perform marketing services. We believe that sharing information with a small group of companies that can help ACE provide new and better services and products is a benefit to all our customers. These include companies like Travelers Express, and Goleta National Bank.

ACE has one privacy policy for consumers that applies to all of ACE’s brands, locations, companies, and subsidiaries.

ACE’s policy applies to all nonpublic personal information about a customer that is obtained by ACE in connection with providing a consumer a financial product or service for personal, family, or household purposes. Our policy will continue to cover nonpublic personal information we may collect during the course of the customer relationship with ACE as well as after the relationship has ended.

ACE depends on a variety of sources of information to meet our obligation of providing efficient and appropriate levels of service. We get and store nonpublic personal information from:

            -The initial contact with a consumer where nonpublic personal information is provided on new customer cards, applications, and account set-up screens. This information may include the customer’s name, address, phone and other information provided to us.

            -Customer transaction activity that is recorded with us or affiliates which creates a file of frequency of visits, most recent transaction, check size, phone requests, services purchased and other retail transaction information.

            -Consumer reporting agencies.

ACE has systems that provide secure retention of all customer records. ACE protects the security and privacy of all nonpublic personal information by restricting access and following security standards and procedures to protect against unauthorized use.

ACE does not disclose any nonpublic personal information about our customers to any company that does not have a marketing agreement with ACE or is not affiliated with ACE, except as permitted or required by law.

ACE may disclose nonpublic personal information, as described above, to companies or financial institutions with which we have joint marketing agreements or have been hired by us to perform marketing services.
