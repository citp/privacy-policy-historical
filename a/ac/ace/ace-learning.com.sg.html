                         <br>
                         <p>
We collect several types of information about visitors to this Website and/or users of our services.  We may collect this information either directly when you provide it to us or automatically as you navigate through the Website.
						</p>
                        <br>
   <p>(a) <span style="text-decoration:underline">Personally Identifiable Information</span>.  "Personally Identifiable Information" refers to information by which you may be personally identified, such as your name, email address, or school.  We will collect and process such data about you when you register for a service/create an account, subscribe to a newsletter, submit feedback, enter a contest, fill out a survey, or send us a communication.  When ordering products or services on the Website, you may also be asked to provide a credit card number and other payment-related information.  You may also provide information to be published or displayed (<strong>"posted"</strong>) on public areas of the Website (such as blogs, forums, message boards, and the like), or transmitted to other users of the Website using "sharing" features (<strong>collectively, "User Contributions"</strong>).  Your User Contributions are posted on and transmitted to others at your own risk.  We cannot control the actions of other users of the Website with whom you may choose to share your User Contributions.  Depending upon the activity, some of the information we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some as voluntary.  If you do not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular activity, you will not be able to engage in that activity.  We do not collect more personally identifiable information than is reasonably necessary for a child to participate in an activity on the Website.  If you are a school and you use the ACE-Learning.com service for children under the age of 13, you are responsible for obtaining consent from the parents/legal guardians of each child you wish to allow to participate in using any ACE-Learning.com service.  A child using the service will be able to participate in certain activities on the Website such as taking online educational and informational courses.
   </p><br>
<p>
   (b) <span style="text-decoration:underline">Non-Personally Identifiable Information</span>.  We may collect, or our third party ad server and/or content server may collect, certain Non-Personally Identifiable Information, that does not by itself identify a specific individual.  Such information tells us about your equipment, browsing actions, the resources that you access and use on the Website, your Internet Protocol ("IP") address, operating system and browser type.  We use your IP address to diagnose problems with our servers, software, to administer our Website and to gather demographic information.  Our third party ad servers will provide us with summary, but not individual, reports that will tell us how many ads were presented and clicked upon at our Website.  The information that we collect automatically is "statistical" in nature.  It helps us to deliver a better and more personalized service to users, by enabling us to estimate usage patterns, customize our Website according to your individual preferences, and speed up your searches.
   </p><br>
<p>
   (c) <span style="text-decoration:underline">Device Information</span>.  When you download our mobile application and use our services, we automatically collect information on the type of device you use and the operating system version, so we know the best application version to provide you with.  We do not ask you for, access or track any location based information from your mobile device at any time while downloading or using our Mobile Application or services.
</p><br>

 <p class="consultant_name">2.   WHERE WE STORE DATA</p><br>
<p>
The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination in Singapore.  It may also be processed by staff operating outside Singapore who works for us or for one of our service providers.  Such staff maybe engaged in, among other things, the fulfillment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services.  By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing.  ACE-Learning.com will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
</p><br>

 <p class="consultant_name">3.   HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</p><br>
<p>
We use information held about you in the following ways:
</p><br>
    <ul class="careers">
            <li>To ensure that content from our Website is presented in the most effective manner for you and for your computer</li>
    <li>To provide you with information, products or services that you request from us or which we feel may interest you, where you have consented to be contacted for such purposes</li>
    <li>To carry out our obligations arising from any contracts entered into between you and us, including for billing and collection</li>
    <li>If you pay for a service using a credit card, we will transmit your credit card data to the appropriate credit card company and/or credit card payment processing company</li>
    <li>To allow you to participate in interactive features of our service, when you choose to do so</li>
    <li>To notify you about changes to our service</li>
    <li>In any other way we may describe when you provide the information</li>
        </ul><br>
<p>If you are an existing customer, we will only contact you by electronic means (e-mail or SMS) with information about goods and services similar to those, which were the subject of a previous sale to you.</p><br>

<p>If you are a new customer, and where we permit selected third parties to use your data, we (or they) will contact you by electronic means only if you have consented to this.</p><br>

<p>If you use the Contact Us form on our site, we will respond to your inquiry and delete the information provided after your request has been fulfilled.</p>
<br>
 <p class="consultant_name">4.   DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION</p><br>
<p>
We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy.  We do not sell, trade, rent or disclose your information to others, except as provided herein:
</p><br>
<p>
(a) We provide some of our services through contractual arrangements with services providers and other third parties. Our service partners and we use your Personally Identifiable Information to operate our websites and to deliver services.  For example, we must release your credit card information to the card-issuing bank to confirm payment for products and services purchased on this Website; release your address information to the delivery service to deliver products that you ordered; and provide order information to third parties that help us provide customer service.  We will encourage our service partners to adopt and post privacy policies.  However, the use of your Personally Identifiable Information by our service partners is governed by the privacy policies of those service partners, and is not subject to our control.</p><br>
  <p> (b) We will disclose Personally Identifiable Information in the following circumstances:</p><br>
<ul class="careers">
           <li>If it is required by law enforcement or judicial authorities, or to cooperate with a law enforcement investigation; </li>
<li>If we have a good faith belief that we are required or permitted to do so by law or legal process; </li>
<li>To protect the rights, reputation, property or safety of ACE-Learning.com or others; </li>
<li>To defend or enforce our rights or your obligations; </li>
<li>If the disclosure is required by mandatory professional standards; </li>
<li>To a 3rd party with your prior consent to do so; or </li>
<li>If we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to enforce or apply our Website Policies, or any contracts or agreement that may exist between you and ACE-Learning.com. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</li>
       </ul><br>

<p>(c) In the event that ACE-Learning.com decides to sell all or part of its stock or assets or enter into a merger, we reserve the right to include Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information among the assets transferred to the acquiring or surviving company.</p><br>

  <p> (d) We may provide Non-Personally Identifiable Information about our customers' sales, traffic patterns, and related Website information to third party advertisers, but these statistics do not include any Personally Identifiable Information.</p><br>

<p>   (e) Parent's are able to consent to the use of their child's Personal Information without having to consent to the Website's disclosure of the child's Personal Information to third parties, as we do not share personal information of children under the age of 13 with any third parties (other than those service partners who help us provide the ACE-Learning.com service to you).</p><br>

 <p class="consultant_name">5.   UPDATING OR CORRECTING YOUR PERSONALLY IDENTIFYING INFORMATION</p><br>

<p>You may change any of yours or your child's Personally Identifiable Information online by logging into "ACE-Learning Account" in accordance with instructions posted elsewhere on this Website.</p><br>

You may ask to have the information on yours or your child's account deleted or removed and request that we no longer have contact with your child; however, because we keep track of past transactions, you cannot delete information associated with past transactions on this Website.

</p><br>
<p>

</p><br>
<p>
We do not send unsolicited commercial e-mails ("spam"), buy or sell e-mail lists, or use purchased or harvested e-mail lists.  We offer commercial e-mail recipients the opportunity to opt-out of further communications in every email.  Please note that we may not include the opt-out information in non-commercial e-mails (i.e., e-mails concerning your order, the Website Terms and Conditions of Use, etc.).
