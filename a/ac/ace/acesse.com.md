# ACESSE MARKETING PRIVACY POLICY

                        ACESSE MARKETING PRIVACY POLICY
Last Updated: January 1, 2014
Acesse Marketing strives to offer its visitors the many advantages of Internet technology and to provide an
interactive and personalized experience. We may use Personally Identifiable Information (your name, e-
mail address, street address, telephone number) subject to the terms of this privacy policy. We will never
sell, barter, or rent your email address to any unauthorized third party.
How we gather information from users
How we collect and store information depends on the page you are visiting, the activities in which you elect
to participate and the services provided. For example, you may be asked to provide information when you
register for access to certain portions of our site or request certain features, such as newsletters or when
you make a purchase. You may provide information when you participate in sweepstakes and contests,
message boards and chat rooms, and other interactive areas of our site. Like most Web sites, Acesse
Marketing also collects information automatically and through the use of electronic tools that may be
transparent to our visitors. For example, we may log the name of your Internet Service Provider or use
cookie technology to recognize you and hold information from your visit. Among other things, the cookie
may store your user name and password, sparing you from having to re-enter that information each time
you visit, or may control the number of times you encounter a particular advertisement while visiting our
site. As we adopt additional technology, we may also gather information through other means. In certain
cases, you can choose not to provide us with information, for example by setting your browser to refuse to
accept cookies, but if you do you may be unable to access certain portions of the site or may be asked to
re-enter your user name and password, and we may not be able to customize the site’s features according
to your preferences.
What we do with the information we collect
Like other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance your visit and deliver more individualized
content and advertising. We respect your privacy and do not share your information with anyone.
Aggregated Information (information that does not personally identify you) may be used in many ways. For
example, we may combine information about your usage patterns with similar information obtained from
other users to help enhance our site and services (e.g., to learn which pages are visited most or what
features are most attractive). Aggregated Information may occasionally be shared with our advertisers and
business partners. Again, this information does not include any Personally Identifiable Information about
you or allow anyone to identify you individually.
We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on Acesse Marketing to communicate with you
about your registration and customization preferences; our Terms of Service and privacy policy; services
and products offered by Acesse Marketing and other topics we think you might find of interest.
Personally Identifiable Information collected by Acesse Marketing may also be used for other purposes,
including but not limited to site administration, troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce transactions,
administration of sweepstakes and contests, and other communications with you. Certain third parties who
provide technical support for the operation of our site (our Web hosting service for example) may access
such information. We will use your information only as permitted by law. In addition, from time to time as
we continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner with other companies or
businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets. We may also
disclose your information in response to a court order, at other times when we believe we are reasonably


required to do so by law, in connection with the collection of amounts you may owe to us, and/or to law
enforcement authorities whenever we deem it appropriate or necessary. Please note we may not provide
you with notice prior to disclosure in such cases.
Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements
Acesse Marketing expects its partners, advertisers and affiliates to respect the privacy of our users. Be
aware, however, that third parties, including our partners, advertisers, affiliates and other content providers
accessible through our site, may have their own privacy and data collection policies and practices. For
example, during your visit to our site you may link to, or view as part of a frame on a Acesse Marketing
page, certain content that is actually created or hosted by a third party. Also, through Acesse Marketing
you may be introduced to, or be able to access, information, Web sites, features, contests or sweepstakes
offered by other parties. Acesse Marketing is not responsible for the actions or policies of such third parties.
You should check the applicable privacy policies of those third parties when providing information on a
feature or page operated by a third party.
While on our site, our advertisers, promotional partners or other third parties may use cookies or other
technology to attempt to identify some of your preferences or retrieve information about you. For example,
some of our advertising is served by third parties and may include cookies that enable the advertiser to
determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before. Other features available on our site
may offer services operated by third parties and may use cookies or other technology to gather information.
Acesse Marketing does not control the use of this technology by third parties or the resulting information,
and is not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties.
You should also be aware that if you voluntarily disclose Personally Identifiable Information on message
boards or in chat areas, that information can be viewed publicly and can be collected and used by third
parties without our knowledge and may result in unsolicited messages from other individuals or third parties.
Such activities are beyond the control of Acesse Marketing and this policy.
Children
Acesse Marketing does not knowingly collect or solicit Personally Identifiable Information from or about
children under 13 except as permitted by law. If we discover we have received any information from a child
under 13 in violation of this policy, we will delete that information immediately. If you believe Acesse
Marketing has any information from or about anyone under 13, please contact us at the address listed
below.
Acesse Marketing reserves the right to change this policy at any time. Please check this page periodically
for changes. Your continued use of our site following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you
accept those changes. Information collected prior to the time any change is posted will be used according
to the rules and laws that applied at the time the information was collected.
Governing law
This policy and the use of this Site are governed by Navada law. If a dispute arises under this Policy we
agree to first try to resolve it with the help of a mutually agreed-upon mediator in the following location:
Clark County, Nevada. Any costs and fees other than attorney fees associated with the mediation will be
shared equally by each of us.
If it proves impossible to arrive at a mutually satisfactory solution through mediation, we agree to submit
the dispute to binding arbitration at the following location: Clark County, Nevada, under the rules of the
American Arbitration Association. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitration may be entered in
any court with jurisdiction to do so.


Acesse Marketing is controlled, operated and administered entirely within Nevada. This statement and the
policies outlined herein are not intended to and do not create any contractual or other legal rights in or on
behalf of any party.

investigate all evidence submitted to us. Should you be deemed in violation of such policies, we reserve
the right to immediately terminate any active accounts to your name, and all rights in association to these
accounts shall be revoked.
Our definition of SPAMMING include, but not limited to direct or indirect email transmissions to any email
address that did not provide consent to receive information from you, advertisements in newsgroups,
message boards, and forums that are unrelated in subject matter and/or have specific policies that disallow
advertisements, as well as unsolicited messages on instant messenger programs and chat rooms.
Organizations, groups or individuals, including but not limited to affiliates, promoters, or joint venture
partners, are not exempt from this policy, even if it is to promote Acesse Marketing. Those found in violation
of this No-SPAM policy will be held liable for damages, lost money and wages. Moreover, we will take any
legal action necessary to protect our name and entity, including but not limited to notifying the FTC and the
appropriate authorities.

domains, web sites, programs, products, services, or anything related to our entity Acesse Marketing,
please report all such activity to Acesse Marketing.
