<p><span class="ghei_placeholder" id="placeholder_58031">We collect various kinds of information to help us better serve our customers and visitors to our website:</span></p>
<ul style="padding-bottom:0px !important;">
<li><span class="ghei_placeholder" id="placeholder_58032">Internet Protocol (IP) Addresses.  For each visitor accessing or using our Service or browsing our website, our web server automatically recognizes and stores the visitor's IP address (the internet protocol address of the visitor's computer) to determine which areas of our website are being visited and how long each visitor spends there. This information helps us understand visitors' traffic patterns through our Service and website so that we can enhance the overall usability of our website. Your computer provides this information automatically each time you log on, unless you have activated blocking technology available in some browsers.</span></li>
<li><span class="ghei_placeholder" id="placeholder_58033">Device Information.  We may collect device-specific information, such as your hardware model, operating system version and unique device identifiers. We may also collect and store information (including personal information) locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser web storage (including HTML 5) and application data caches.</span></li>
<li><span class="ghei_placeholder" id="placeholder_58034">Cookies.  Like many websites today, we may employ a standard technology called cookies to collect information about how you use our website in order to provide you with a better experience by measuring which areas of our website are of the greatest interest to you or to remember you when you return to visit us. We have no desire or intention to infringe on your privacy while you visit our website. Most browsers will allow you to erase cookies from your computer’s hard drive, block acceptance of cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. You can choose to set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the choice of rejecting or accepting the cookie.
Cookies may also be used by third party ad-serving companies when they place ads on our website, and these cookies help control which ads are shown. These ad-serving companies may use cookies to collect non-personally identifiable information from you. Advertisers use this information to target the ads and measure their impact.
</span></li>
<li><span class="ghei_placeholder" id="placeholder_58035">Personal Information.  While we do not generally require that you provide us with individually identifiable information in order to visit, access or use our website, at times we may ask you to provide us with personal information that is associated with individually identifiable information, such as your e-mail address, name, mailing address, telephone number, credit card number, demographic information, or persistent identifier (such as user name and password). Providing us with this information allows you to make purchases, register products, receive support, correspond with us, participate in online surveys, subscribe to mailing lists or newsletters, or register for special purchase discounts.
We do not require you to provide sensitive personal information (such as information about your health, political or religious beliefs, criminal offences alleged or committed, or sexual orientation), and request that you do not provide us with such information. Any such information you do provide voluntarily to us will be used only in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

We want to use this data to tailor your experience at our website and with us generally. We do not collect or use the personal information which you submit for any unrelated purposes, other than when obligated or permitted by local laws to do so without informing you in advance.</span></p>
<p><span class="ghei_placeholder" id="placeholder_58042">Unless you instruct us otherwise (as described below), we will send you information about our various product upgrades, special offers and other new products and services from Acer that we feel may be of interest to you. Only Acer (or agents working on behalf of Acer) will send you these direct mailings. If you do not want to receive such mailings, simply tell us when you give us your personal information. You may also opt-out of receiving future mailings at any time by contacting Acer; see the opt-out section below.</span></p>
<p><span class="ghei_placeholder" id="placeholder_58043">We may also use your information to comply with laws or to defend ourselves in claims under such laws, or when necessary to exercise Acer’s legitimate business interests and needs, in which case special care is taken to safeguard your rights and to ensure any use of your personal information is fair, lawful and proportionate.</span></p>
<p><span class="ghei_placeholder" id="placeholder_58044">To the extent permitted by law, the information you provide may be accessed, processed or stored by, or transferred to, any member of the Acer group of companies (or their subcontractors) at locations around the world, including those located in countries where you do not live. These locations include countries that do not have laws protecting the use of personal information. A list of Acer entities (and their respective registered offices) that may receive your data in those locations and become data controllers of that data can be found at <a href="http://www.acer-group.com/officelist.html" target="_blank">www.acer-group.com/officelist.html</a>. This use may continue even if they cease to be a member of the Acer group of companies. All of the Acer companies that receive your personal information will use it in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</span></p>
<p><span class="ghei_placeholder" id="placeholder_58045">Acer will not share your personal information with any outside organization for its use in marketing or solicitation without your consent. Your information may be shared with Acer’s agents or contractors for the purpose of providing services, processing transactions or performing statistical analysis for an Acer company. For example, if we need to ship something to you, we must share your name and address with a shipping company. We only provide third party agents or contractors with the minimum amount of information needed to complete the requested services or transaction.</span></p>
<p><span class="ghei_placeholder" id="placeholder_58046">Your information may also be disclosed to third parties where we are legally required or entitled to do so, for example in response to a request from a government or regulatory authority or in connection with potential legal proceedings. Acer is not responsible for the actions of any government or regulatory authority with respect to your information or data.</span></p>
<p><span class="ghei_placeholder" id="placeholder_58047">If we merge with, or any part of the Acer group is acquired by, another business (or enter into discussions concerning the same) we may share your information with such a business and its advisers; however, if we do so, we will ensure steps are taken so that your rights in relation to your information continue to be protected.</span></p>
