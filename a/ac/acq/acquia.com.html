Thank you for visiting Acquia, Inc.’s (“Acquia”) Internet web site located at the URL: <a href="http://acquia.com" title="http://acquia.com">http://acquia.com</a> (“Site”). This Privacy Policy details certain policies implemented throughout Acquia governing Acquia’s use of personally identifiable information about users of our Site and users of our services and/or software that is available for download on this Site.</p>
<p><strong>Privacy Policy Updates</strong><br>
Due to the Internet’s rapidly evolving nature, Acquia may need to update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If so, Acquia will post our updated Privacy Policy on our Site located at <a href="http://acquia.com/about-us/legal/privacy-policy" title="http://acquia.com/about-us/legal/privacy-policy">http://acquia.com/about-us/legal/privacy-policy</a> and post notice of the change so it is visible when users log-on for the first time after the change is posted so that you are always aware of what personally identifiable information we may collect and how we may use this information. Acquia encourages you to review this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes. Your continued use of this Site and/or continued provision of personally identifiable information to us will be subject to the terms of the then-current Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong><br>
You can generally visit our Site without revealing any personally identifiable information about yourself. However, in certain sections of this Site, we may invite you to participate in surveys, questionnaires or contests, contact us with questions or comments or request information, participate in chat or message boards, or complete a profile or registration form. Furthermore, we require you to complete a registration form to access certain restricted areas of the Site, to use certain services and when you download any software. Due to the nature of some of these activities, we may collect personally identifiable information such as your name, e-mail address, address, phone number, password, screen name, credit card information and other contact information that you voluntarily transmit with your on-line and in-person communications to us and personally identifiable information that you elect to include in your chart and message board postings.</p>
<p>In addition, we may collect information about the performance, security, software configuration and availability of customer web sites in an automated fashion as part of the services if you have opted-in to allow us to collect such information.</p>
<p>We may use your personally identifiable information to register you to use our services or download software or other content, contact you to deliver certain goods, services or information that you have requested, provide you with notices regarding goods or services you have purchased, provide you with notices regarding goods or services that you may want to purchase in the future, verify your authority to enter our Site and improve the content and general administration of the Site and our services.</p>
<p>If you install and use the “Acquia agent” and “Acquia site information” modules within the Acquia Drupal software and connect your installation of Acquia Drupal to our Acquia Network service, these modules will report to us, and we will collect, your IP address, operating system type and version, web server type and version, php version, database type and version, version of the services, modifications to the Drupal code, information regarding the availability of your website (e.g. if your website is live or down), website user statistics such as the number of nodes, number of users and number of comments.  The foregoing information will be linked to your personally identifiable information and user accounts and we may use the foregoing information to better provide technical support to you and our customers and to improve our services.</p>
<p>If you install and use the Mollom spam blocking module within Acquia Drupal and connect your installation of Acquia Drupal to Mollom service delivered through the Acquia Network service, our third party service provider, Mollom BVBA, may collect, analyze, and store information about you and your site visitors and content submitted by your site visitors for anti-spam and quality monitoring purposes as set forth in Mollom’s privacy policy available at <a href="http://mollom.com/web-service-privacy-policy" title="http://mollom.com/web-service-privacy-policy">http://mollom.com/web-service-privacy-policy</a>.</p>
<p>If you submit information to our web site, our third party service provider, Mollom BVBA, may collect, analyze, and store information about you and the content you submit for anti-spam and quality monitoring purposes as set forth in Mollom’s privacy policy available at <a href="http://mollom.com/web-service-privacy-policy" title="http://mollom.com/web-service-privacy-policy">http://mollom.com/web-service-privacy-policy</a>.</p>
<p>If you choose to contact us by e-mail, we will not disclose your contact information contained in the e-mail, but we may use your contact information to send you a response to your message. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may publicly disclose the content and/or subject matter of your message, therefore, you should not send us any ideas, suggestions or content that you consider proprietary or confidential. All e-mail content (except your contact information) will be treated on a non-proprietary and non-confidential basis and may be used by us for any purpose.</p>
<p><strong>Employment Opportunities</strong><br>
We may provide you with a means for submitting your resume or other personal information through the Site for consideration for employment opportunities at Acquia.

<p><strong>Children’s Privacy</strong><br>
Acquia recognizes the privacy interests of children and we encourage parents and guardians to take an active role in their children’s online activities and interests. This Site is not intended for children under the age of 13. Acquia does not target its services or this Site to children under 13. Acquia does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies and GIFs</strong><br>
We may use small text files called cookies to improve overall Site experience. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s hard drive containing information about the user. Cookies generally do not permit us to personally identify you (except as provided below). We may also use clear GIFs (a.k.a. “Web beacons”) in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened by recipients.</p>
<p>Additionally, when using the Site, we and any of our third party service providers may use cookies and other tracking mechanisms to track your user activity on the Site and identify the organization or entity from which you are using the Site. If you register with the Site, we, and our third party service providers, will be able to associate all of your user activity with your personally identifiable registration information. We will use such user activity information to improve the Site, to provide context for our sales and support staff when interacting with you and customers, to initiate automated email marketing campaigns triggered by your activity on the Site and for other internal business analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Aggregate Information</strong><br>
The Site may track information that will be maintained, used and disclosed in aggregate form only and which will not contain your personally identifiable information, for example, without limitation, the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, browser type, External Web Sites (defined below) linked to and IP addresses. We may analyze this data for trends and statistics in the aggregate, and we may use such aggregate information to administer the Site, track users’ movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.</p>
<p><strong>Disclosure</strong><br>
We will not sell your personally identifiable information to any company or organization, except we may transfer your personally identifiable information to a successor entity upon a merger, consolidation or other corporate reorganization in which Acquia participates or to a purchaser or acquirer of all or substantially all of Acquia’s assets to which this Site relates. We may provide your personally identifiable information and the data generated by cookies and the aggregate information to parent, subsidiary or affiliate entities within Acquia’s corporate family, partner entities that are not within Acquia’s corporate family and vendors and service agencies that we may engage to assist us in providing our services to you. For example, we may provide your personally identifiable information to a credit card processing company to process your payment. Such third party entities may be obligated to protect your personally identifiable information consistent with the terms of this Privacy Policy and/or required to enter into written confidentiality agreements or to be certified by the U.S. Safe Harbor or agree in writing to adhere to its principles. We will also disclose your personally identifiable information (a) if we are required to do so by law, regulation or other government authority or otherwise in cooperation with an ongoing investigation of a governmental authority, (b) to enforce the Acquia Terms of Use agreement or to protect our rights or (c) to protect the safety of users of our Site and our services.</p>
<p><strong>Links to Third Party Sites</strong><br>
The Site may provide links to other Web sites or resources over which Acquia does not have control (“External Web Sites”). Such links do not constitute an endorsement by Acquia of those External Web Sites. You acknowledge that Acquia is providing these links to you only as a convenience, and further agree that Acquia is not responsible for the content of such External Web Sites. Your use of External Web Sites is subject to the terms of use and privacy policies located on the linked to External Web Sites.</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong><br>
We may employ procedural and technological measures that are reasonably designed to help protect your personally identifiable information from loss, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction. Acquia may use encryption, secure socket layer, firewall, password protection and other physical security measures to help prevent unauthorized access to your personally identifiable information. Acquia may also place internal restrictions on who in the company may access data to help prevent unauthorized access to your personally identifiable information.</p>
<p><strong>Updating and Deleting Personally Identifiable Information</strong><br>
Acquia provides you with the ability to review and update the contact information that you provide to us and account information retained by Acquia related to your previous purchase, download or payment activities. If you wish to review and/or update any of the foregoing information, you may access your account and review and update your personally identifiable information or you may contact us at the e-mail, phone or mailing address listed below.</p>
<p>Acquia will also delete the personally identifiable information that you have provided to us: (a) upon your request or (b) upon termination of your Acquia account; provided, however, Acquia will retain a copy in its files of all personally identifiable information, even if removed, in order to resolve disputes or enforce its terms of service.</p>

<p><em>Users Outside of the United States of America</em><br>
Our computer systems are currently based in the United States, so your personal data will be processed by us in the U.S. where data protection and privacy regulations may not offer the same level of protection as in other parts of the world, such as the European Union. If you create a user account with one or both of the Sites as a visitor from outside the United States, by using either Site, you agree to this Privacy Policy and you consent to the transfer of all such information to the United States, which may not offer an equivalent level of protection of that required in the European Union or certain other countries, and to the processing of that information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
