We use information we collect about you to facilitate the provision of our online services and to provide you with a more personalized experience. We have created this Privacy Policy in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to protecting your privacy.

This Privacy Policy sets out AGI’s privacy practices and policies and is intended to comply with the federal government's privacy legislation, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act and applicable provincial privacy laws. By using AGI’s products and services, you agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy.

**Personal Information**

Personal Information is information that identifies you as an individual. It includes information such as your name, address, telephone number, birth date, social insurance number, e-mail address and financial information. We may gather personal information from your credit application, your purchase of goods or services (including through your method of payment), a contest or sweepstakes registration, your visit to our website(s) and your suggestions and feedback. We may also request personal information from time to time in order to enable you to participate in and enjoy various AGI product and service offerings.

**Personal Information Collection and Use by AGI**

We collect information from you directly. For example, we collect information from you when you register on the site, participate in a survey, or fill out a form requesting information from us.

We collect information from you passively. We (or vendors acting on our behalf) use common collection techniques like cookies, and web beacons. This policy describes how and when we use these practices.

We obtain information about you from third parties with whom we work. We may collect information about you from our suppliers, resellers, and other business partners.

We collect and use your personal information and information on your use of our products and services and our web sites (together, the "Information") only: (i) to establish and maintain responsible commercial relations with customers and to provide ongoing services and offers; (ii) to understand customer needs; (iii) to develop, enhance, market or provide products and services; (iv) to manage and develop our business and operations, including customer fulfillment, billing and collection efforts as well as personnel and employment matters; and (v) to comply with any legal and regulatory requirements, including requirements or requests of government agencies or pursuant to a subpoena or other legal proceeding.

AGI's web servers collect general data pertaining to each web site visitor, including but not limited to, the IP address, tracking codes, the domain name, the web page, the length of time spent and the pages accessed while visiting www.acklandsgrainger.com. This may also include GPS locations for some of our mobile applications. We also collect personal information and transactional information provided by companies and web site visitors that purchase products from www.acklandsgrainger.com. This information includes contact information, shipping information, credit cardholder name, and card number/expiration date. We may also retain the content of the communications that are sent to our customer service representatives.

If you choose not to provide the requested Information, or choose to disable the cookies on your browser as explained below, AGI may not be able to offer you some of the personalized products and services that depend on this type of information to function. You may also not have full functionality of the AGI web sites, or review them fully.

We may request you to provide additional Information for security purposes such as identifying you when you call us with respect to your account and services. You do not have to provide it to us, but if you do, it will help us to ensure that we take instructions with respect to your account only from you. If you decide not to provide such information to us, that may limit our ability to take your account instructions from you. If possible we will try to arrange an alternative way to provide service to you.

**What are “cookies” and how do we use them?**

You should also be aware that information and data may be automatically collected through the standard operation of our Internet servers or through the use of "cookies".  “Cookies" are small text files that contain a unique identification number that is transferred from a web site to the hard drive of your computer so that we may: (a) recognize repeat users; (b) track usage behavior; and (c) compile aggregate data that will permit content improvements and targeted advertising. Our cookies do not extract information from your hard disk. You should be aware that we cannot control or prevent the use of cookies or any information obtained through such cookies by advertisers or third party content providers. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, most browsers permit you to disable the cookie feature. However, you are advised that doing so may limit your use of certain features on the AGI web sites.

**Personal Information Disclosure by AGI**  
Your Information, including personal information, may be shared with Acklands-Grainger Inc.'s subsidiaries and parent company, and for customer administration and technological back-up purposes. For such purposes, personal information relating to you may be transmitted outside of Ontario or Canada. Personal information is subject to the laws of the country where it is stored, and as AGI may be storing and processing personal information in the United States, the use and disclosure of your personal information may be subject to the USA Patriot Act.  If you have any concerns in this regard, please contact our Privacy Officer as set out below.

**Who has Access to your Information?**  
Occasionally, we, or any of our suppliers or partners, may host a contest or promotion where it will be your option to enter and your option to provide the requested information. Data collected during a promotion or contest is typically shared with the sponsor or co-sponsor. If you do not want your data to be shared, you can choose not to participate in the promotion or contest.

AGI may disclose, on a confidential basis, to any third party with whom we have business relations, certain relevant information relating to your dealings with us and our products and services. AGI does not sell your Information.

We may provide Information, including customer information, to third parties who purchase assets from AGI where such information is relevant to the assets so sold. In this regard, Information may also be disclosed when required or permitted to do so by law or legal process, or in connection with a sale, transfer or reorganization of our business, in which case we will require that any personal information will continue to be treated in accordance with this policy. Any such disclosure to third parties is made/will be made under a confidentiality agreement with the third party who is required not to disclose or use the Information for any other purpose other than is necessary to fulfill the agreement with AGI.

Please note that AGI’s web sites may contain links to other sites and may occasionally allow other sites to be co-branded with AGI.

You should make every effort to read the individual privacy policies of the partners, advertisers or co-sponsors before accessing any such web site or providing any personal information to any such web site.

We reserve the right to conduct statistical analyses of your behavior and characteristics in order to measure interest in and use of AGI’s products and services, AGI’s proposed products and services, the AGI web sites and the Internet and to provide suppliers with Information such as the number of purchasers of their products or services. We will provide only aggregated data from these analyses to third parties.
