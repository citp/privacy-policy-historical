## What  Personal Information About Users Does acx.com Gather?

The information we learn from users helps us personalize and continually improve  your experience at acx.com. Here are the types of information we gather. 

  * **Information You Give Us:** We receive and store any information you enter on our Web site or give us in any other way. [Click here](https://web.archive.org/help/200502800#200502810) to see examples of what we collect. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing features for you, improving our site, and communicating with you. 
  * **Automatic Information:** We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many Web sites, we use "cookies," and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses acx.com or advertisements and other content served by or on behalf of acx.com on other Web sites. [Click here](https://web.archive.org/help/200502800#200502820) to see examples of the information we receive. 
  * **E-mail Communications:** To help us make e-mails more useful and interesting, we often receive a confirmation when you open e-mail from acx.com if your computer supports such capabilities.We also compare our user list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our users.
  * **Information from Other Sources:** We might receive information about you from other sources and add it to our account information.

## What About Cookies?

  * Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and to provide features such as personalized greetings.
  * The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the Web site of its manufacturer. However, because cookies allow you to take advantage of some of acx.com's coolest features, we recommend that you leave them turned on.

## Does acx.com Share the Information It Receives?

Information about our users is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. We share user information only as  described below and with Audible, Inc.’s parent corporation Amazon.com, Inc. and the subsidiaries it controls. 

  * **Third-Party Service Providers:** We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from user lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing credit card payments, fulfilling orders, and providing customer service. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. 
  * **Business Transfers:** As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy stores, subsidiaries, or business units. In such transactions, user information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the user consents otherwise). Also, in the event that acx.com, Audible, Inc., or substantially all of either of their respective assets are acquired, user information will of course be one of the transferred assets. 
  * **Protection of acx.com and Others:** We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our [Conditions of Use](https://web.archive.org/help/conditions-of-use/200485440) and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of acx.com, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from users for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Notice. 
  * **With Your Consent:** Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about you might go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.

## What About Third-Party Advertisers and Links to Other Websites?

Our site may include third-party advertising and links to other Web sites. We will not provide any personally identifiable user information to these advertisers  or third-party Web sites.

These third-party Web sites and advertisers, or Internet advertising companies working on their behalf, may use technology to send (or "serve") the advertisements that appear on our Web site directly to your browser. They may automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (also known as action tags or single-pixel gifs), and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. We do not have access to or control over cookies or other features that they may use, and the information practices of these advertisers and third-party Web sites are not covered by this Privacy Notice. Please contact them directly for more information about their privacy practices. In addition, the [Network Advertising Initiative](http://www.networkadvertising.org/) offers useful information about Internet advertising companies (also called "ad networks" or "network advertisers"), including information about how to opt-out of their information collection.

acx.com may also display personalized third-party advertising based on personal information about users, such as their activities on acx.com. [Click here](https://web.archive.org/help/200502800#200502830) for more information about the personal information that we gather. Although acx.com will not provide any personal information to advertisers, advertisers (including ad-serving companies) may assume that users who interact with or click on a personalized advertisement meet their criteria to personalize the ad (for example, users in the northeastern United States who bought or browsed for audio books about  vampires).
