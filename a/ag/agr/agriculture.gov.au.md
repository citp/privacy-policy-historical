# Privacy - DAFF

The Australian Government Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (DAFF) provides the following privacy statement in accordance with the [Guidelines for Federal and ACT Government Websites](http://www.privacy.gov.au/topics/technologies) issued by the [Office of the Privacy Commissioner.](http://www.privacy.gov.au/)

#### Personal Information

DAFF, through its website, invites people to provide personal information through feedback forms, subscription forms, or for other specified purposes. The information will only be used for those purposes originally intended.

Personal details will not be transmitted to other agencies or used for commercial purposes, and will not be disclosed outside the required area without your consent. No attempt will be made to identify users or their browsing activities.

The only exception will be, in the unlikely event of an investigation, where a law enforcement agency exercises a warrant to inspect DAFF log files.

#### Security

This site adheres to Commonwealth Government Internet security standards, including the Defence Signals Directorate guidelines.

If you choose to pay for a service or product using the secure credit card payment facility available at this site you will be asked to provide your credit card details. Credit card details are encrypted from the moment they are entered into an electronic form on this website. All other information entered into an electronic form will be encrypted upon submission to the Department.

DAFF stores credit card details only until the Industry standard charge back period has expired (currently 10 months).

Note: There is an inherent risk associated with the use of an insecure public network such as the World Wide Web. A user's transactions (including emails) may be viewed, intercepted, corrupted or modified by, or otherwise disclosed to, a third party. The Commonwealth cannot guarantee the security or integrity of any transaction over such a network, including personal or other private information transmitted via email to or from a Department email address (X@daff.gov.au). The Commonwealth is not liable in connection with the transmission of any such information (including as a result of negligence).

If you prefer to use an alternative means of delivery, you can send the information via the Department's normal communications methods; i.e. mail, phone or fax. If you take this approach, please make it clear which part of the website you are responding to.
