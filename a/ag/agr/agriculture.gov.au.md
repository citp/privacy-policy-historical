## Our obligations under the Privacy Act

This privacy policy sets out how we comply with our obligations under the [_Privacy Act 1988_](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Search/privacy%20Act%201988) (Privacy Act). As an Australian Government agency, we are bound by the Australian Privacy Principles (APP) in the Privacy Act which regulate how government agencies collect, use, store and disclose personal information, and how individuals may access and correct personal information held about them.

## Personal information

Personal information is defined in s 6(1) of the Privacy Act as ‘information or an opinion about an identified individual, or an individual who is reasonably identifiable:

  * whether the information or opinion is true or not, and
  * whether the information or opinion is recorded in a material form or not’.



What constitutes personal information will vary, depending on whether an individual can be identified or is reasonably identifiable in the particular circumstances. For example, personal information could include:

  * a name or address
  * bank account details
  * photos or videos
  * information about an individual’s mannerisms, their opinions or where they work.



Note: information does not have to include an individual’s name to be personal information. For example, in some cases, a date of birth and post code may be enough to identify a person.

## Sensitive information

Sensitive information is a subset of personal information with additional requirements under the Privacy Act.

Sensitive information is defined in the Privacy Act as information or an opinion about an individual’s racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, membership of a political association, religious beliefs or affiliations, philosophical beliefs, membership of a professional or trade association, membership of a trade union, sexual preferences or practices, or criminal record that is also personal information; health information about an individual, genetic information about an individual, biometric information that is to be used for the purpose of automated biometric verification/identification and biometric templates.

## How you can complain about the treatment of your personal information and how the complaint will be handled

You can make a complaint if you believe the department has breached the APPs or mishandled your personal information.

Privacy breaches can be caused by a variety of factors, affect different types of personal information and give rise to a range of actual or potential harm to individuals, agencies and organisations. Consequently, there is no single way of responding to a privacy breach. Each breach will need to be dealt with on a case-by-case basis. All complaints and alleged breaches will be investigated by a privacy officer and the complainant will be advised of the outcome.

The department’s privacy officers will investigate:

  * concerns that the personal information contained in a record of a client, stakeholder or departmental officer has been mishandled
  * any complaints and/or allegations about a breach of the APPs, and
  * all privacy-related matters referred from the Privacy Commissioner within the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC).



In the first instance, any privacy concerns or complaints should be reported to the department’s privacy team. This can be done by:

Phone: 02 6272 3933  
Email: [privacy@agriculture.gov.au](mailto:privacy@agriculture.gov.au)  
Mail: Privacy, Department of Agriculture, PO BOX 858, Canberra ACT 2601.

If you are unhappy with the department’s response or reply, you also have the option of contacting the Privacy Commissioner within the OAIC. The Privacy Commissioner can be contacted on:

Phone: 1300 363 992  
Email: [enquiries@oaic.gov.au](mailto:enquiries@oaic.gov.au)
