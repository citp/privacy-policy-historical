### Scope

At Agendize ("Agendize"), protecting your privacy is very important to us. We treat your personal information with the utmost respect and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy explains how personal information about you may be collected, used, and or disclosed as a consequence of your activities on a website using Agendize technology. We urge you to read it carefully and to print a copy for your records.

By submitting any information through the use of a website which uses Agendize technology (an "Agendize website & services") or by otherwise accessing our site, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and consent to the policies and practices described for the collection, use and or disclosure of personal information and you expressly consent to the collection, storage, use and or disclosure of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy.

### Data Collection

The type of personal information that is protected varies from one jurisdiction to another but generally includes any information concerning an identifiable individual, such as name, address, telephone number, age, sex, marital status and nationality, etc. Personal information may not, however, include certain types of business or employment related information. It generally does not, for example, include the name, title, business address or telephone number of an employee of an organization. Such information is not usually considered personal information.

You may visit an Agendize website at any time without submitting personal information. When you visit such website, or when you visit third-party websites providing content that uses Agendize services, data is saved on our servers in an anonymous format, such as, for example, connection information, statistics on page views, traffic to and from the Agendize website & services, and ad data. Also saved is the identification of the website that you arrive from, the website that you proceed to from our site, and your IP address. In collecting this information, no personal data is associated with you. We may share such data in an anonymous format with third parties, including, but not limited to, vendors that support the operation of our website and services, and entities involved in the delivery of advertisements.

We do, however, require some information, which may include personal information, so that you can actively use the features of the Agendize website & services. Once you provide Agendize or the owner of the Agendize website (hereinafter "us" or "we") with your required personal information, you are no longer anonymous. In providing us with your personal information, you consent to the transfer and storage of such information on our servers, in order to serve you.

Once you are registered, we may some or all of the following personal information:

  * email address and physical contact information, including but not limited to your name, address, date of birth and telephone number;
  * all transactional information based on your activities on the Agendize website;
  * any correspondence sent to us; and
  * other supplemental information from third parties who are permitted to communicate such information to us.



The database containing your personal information will be assigned to the owner of the Agendize website & services.

Apart from the preceding, we do not collect, use or disclose your personal information without your consent except where required or allowed by law. We do not knowingly solicit information from children and we do not knowingly market our services to minors. Your personal information is located on a server situated in Montréal, Québec, Canada. We will take reasonable steps to ensure that your personal information is as accurate, complete and up-to-date as is appropriate for its purpose.

  * resolve disputes, collect fees and troubleshoot problems;
  * prevent potentially prohibited or illegal activities; 
  * inform you about our services, targeted marketing, service updates and promotional offers; and
  * compare information for accuracy and verify it with authorized third parties.



We agree to protect the confidentiality of your personal information as much as reasonably possible while doing so.

We routinely update personal information to fulfill the purposes for which the information was collected, as outlined in this Privacy Policy. You expressly consent to our routinely updating your personal information and, where appropriate, soliciting such updates from you.

Without limiting the above, in an effort to respect your privacy, we will not otherwise disclose your personal information to law enforcement, government officials or other third parties without a subpoena, court order or substantially similar legal procedure, except where we believe, in good faith, that the disclosure of such information is necessary to prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss or to report suspected illegal activity.
