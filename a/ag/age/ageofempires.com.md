### _Age of Empires Online_ Privacy Statement

Last updated: January, 2010 

Microsoft Corporation is committed to protecting your privacy while delivering software that brings you the performance, power, and convenience you desire in your personal computing. This privacy statement explains many of the data collection and use practices of _Age of Empires Online_. This is a preliminary disclosure and is not intended to be an exhaustive list. It does not apply to other online or offline _Age of Empires Online_ sites, products, or services.

### Collection and Use of Your Information

_Age of Empires Online_ collects IP address, browser type and language, referring Web site addresses and other data about your device that does not identify you. We may also collect information about your usage of the _Age of Empires_ service, such as number of times you sign into and signoff from the Service; game interactions on the Service; content you purchase on the Service; and game-score statistics. The information we collect from you will be used by _Age of Empires Online_ to enable the features you are using and provide the service(s) or carry out the transaction(s) you have requested or authorized. It may also be used to analyze, improve and promote _Age of Empires Online_ products and services.

In order to offer you a more consistent and personalized experience in your interactions with _Age of Empires Online_ , information collected through one _Age of Empires Online_ service may be combined with information obtained through other Microsoft services. We may also supplement the information we collect with information obtained from other companies. Except as described in this statement, personal information you provide will not be transferred to third parties without your consent. We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, such as packaging, sending and delivering purchases and other mailings, answering customer questions about products or services, processing event registration, or performing statistical analysis of our services. We will only provide those companies the personal information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.

Age of Empires Online may access or disclose information about you, including the content of your communications, in order to: (a) comply with the law or respond to lawful requests or legal process; (b) protect the rights or property of Microsoft or our customers, including the enforcement of our agreements or policies governing your use of the services; or (c) act on a good faith belief that such access or disclosure is necessary to protect the personal safety of Microsoft employees, customers, or the public. We may also disclose personal information as part of a corporate transaction such as a merger or sale of assets.

Information that is collected by or sent to Microsoft Corporation by _Age of Empires Online_ may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Microsoft or its affiliates, subsidiaries, or service providers maintain facilities. Microsoft abides by the safe harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union, the European Economic Area, and Switzerland.

The privacy details for each _Age of Empires Online_ feature, software or service listed in this privacy statement describe what additional information is collected and how it is used.

### Gamertags

Age of Empires Online uses an Xbox Live account with its associated nickname called a gamertag, to identify you in the game online. This is the same gamertag used on the Xbox LIVE service, on the Zune service, and Games for Windows Marketplace. You can choose your gamertag when you create your Xbox LIVE account using _Age of Empires Online_ , the Xbox.com website or the Xbox 360 console. Because the gamertag may be publicly displayed, you should not use personal information as your gamertag. Gamertags will be shown to other players when you are signed in to _Age of Empires Online_ or any other Xbox LIVE service.

### Anti-Cheating

In order to create a fair gaming experience for all users by detecting cheating, _Age of Empires Online_ will periodically collect the following information about your computer when you sign on via a personal computer: Your IP address, operating system and other non-personally identifiable operating system and driver state information. In addition, _Age of Empires Online_ may also collect information about other software running on your computer that, based on Microsoft’s analysis, is suspected to be used for cheating. Microsoft will use this information to protect the security of the Service and may take enforcement action against your LIVE account; however, we will not use this information in any way which disables any other software running on your computer.

### Privacy Settings and Data Sharing

You can view or edit your personal information, including billing and account information, privacy settings, and data sharing preferences by accessing My Xbox on the Xbox 360 console or on the Xbox.com website. The privacy controls, which are found in the Online Safety section of My Xbox, allow you to apply controls to profile sharing, game history, online video and music statuses, friend lists, voice data collection and Kinect sharing.

### Parental Consent and Family Settings

Age of Empires Online applies Xbox LIVE Parental Consent and Family Setting controls. If you have children that use _Age of Empires Online_ , you can set up child accounts during account creation using the family settings features. Children 17 and younger cannot create an account for _Age of Empires Online_ without parental consent. The parental consent process includes the collection and verification of a credit card number to determine that the owner of the parent account is an adult. Parents can customize child account privacy and activity settings based on their comfort level or accept the age-specific defaults already in place. You can visit Family Center under My Xbox on the Xbox.com website or the Xbox 360 console to view default privacy settings based on age-buckets. We will not knowingly ask children under the age of 13 to provide more information than is reasonably necessary to provide our services. If we change this privacy statement in a way that expands the collection, use or disclosure of a child's personal information for which the parent has previously consented, the parent will be notified and we will obtain the parent's additional consent prior to implementing the change with respect to that child.

### In-Game Chat

Age of Empires Online uses the Xbox LIVE chat functionality and associated features such as the ability to mute or block chat from another online user or restrict chat usage to a defined group of online friends. In game chat is controlled by the Online Safety and Privacy settings found under My Xbox on the Xbox 360 console and on the Xbox.com website.

### Security of your information

Age of Empires Online is committed to helping protect the security of your information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, we store the information you provide on computer systems with limited access, which are located in controlled facilities.

### Changes to this Privacy Statement

We will occasionally update this privacy statement to reflect changes in our products, services, and customer feedback. When we post changes, we will revise the "last updated" date at the top of this statement. If there are material changes to this statement or in how _Age of Empires Online_ will use your personal information, we will notify you either by posting a notice of such changes prior to implementing the change or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to periodically review this statement to be informed of how _Age of Empires Online_ protects your information.
