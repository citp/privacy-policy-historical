### 2. Your privacy is important to us

We keep your information safe.  We aim to be clear and open about what we do with it.

We understand that your privacy is important to you, and we value your trust. That’s why we protect your information and aim to be clear and open about what we do with it.

### 3. What information do we collect?

We collect information about you when you interact with us. We may also collect information about you from other people and organisations.

We only collect your personal information when we need it to provide our products and services or to comply with the law. The kinds of information that we collect depends on how you interact with us. Here are some examples.

We collect information when you interact with us using the channels we make available to you – online, through our app, direct contact with our contact centre, social media, and using voice tools (including Amazon Alexa and Google Home).

If you give us personal information about other people, we will assume that they have agreed that you can do this. 

####  Information we collect from others

  * **When you get a quote to apply to open an account with us:** Your credit history information.    
  * **We collect credit-related information from credit reporting bodies about you** when you set up an account with us or when your account is in default.  This information can be found on your credit file, including the fact that you have applied for credit, the amount and type of credit, details of your current and previous credit providers, start and end dates of credit arrangements, and information about listings on your credit file including defaults and court judgments.
  * **We collect credit-related information from other AGL Group companies,** from **public sources,** and from **other third parties** including government agencies such as the Australian Financial Security Authority which manages the National Personal Insolvency Index.
  * **When you use our websites mobile apps and platforms:** Your IP address, device identifiers and information about how you use our websites such as session information and login attempts. We use web analytics services to do this. These services include: Google Analytics, Google AdSense, DoubleClick, Adobe or Microsoft. 
  * **When you participate in market research:** Information about you and your responses from the service provider that conducted the research.
  * **When you engage with our sales partners:** Your name, address and contact details, so we can contact you about products you may be interested in.

Where it is relevant to the role, we may also collect screening check information (such as background, medical, drugs and alcohol, criminal records, bankruptcy, directorship and company checks), and abilities testing, including psychometric testing. 



#### Sensitive information

The Privacy Act protects your sensitive information, such as information about your health or ethnicity. Where we need this information for your account (for example, to ensure continuous service to your property or to assist with translation services), we’ll ask for your permission — except where otherwise allowed by law.

  


### 4. How do we use your information?

We use your information to deliver our products and services, manage our business and comply with the law. We also use your information for other reasons, such as to better understand you and your needs.

We collect and use your information, so we can:

  * confirm your identity
  * provide you with the products and services that you have asked for
  * handle payments and refunds
  * communicate with you about your account
  * manage your credit arrangements with us
  * manage accounts that are overdue, including where we sell debt
  * respond to applications, questions, requests or complaints that you have made to us
  * maintain and update our records and carry out other administrative tasks
  * improve customer experience and do market research 
  * if you are a shareholder, manage your shareholding
  * if you have applied to work with us, assess your application
  * investigate possible fraud and illegal activity
  * comply with laws, including assisting government agencies and law enforcement investigations, and
  * manage our business. 



If we don’t have your personal information, we may not be able to do these things. For example, we may not be able to deliver the products or services you have asked for or respond to your questions.

####  Direct marketing

We may also use your personal information to tell you about products or services that we think you might be interested in. We may send you marketing messages in various ways, including by mail, email, telephone, SMS, and digital marketing including advertising through our apps, websites, social media or third-party websites. 

If you tell us how you would prefer to be contacted, we will contact you in that way where we can. 

If you don’t want to receive direct marketing messages, you can opt out by:

  * filling out a [Do Not Contact form on our website ](https://web.archive.org/help/manage-communication-preferences)
  * contacting our Customer Solutions Team (call 131 245, or see section 9 below), or
  * following the instructions in any marketing communication you receive from us (for example, using the ‘unsubscribe’ link in an email or responding to an SMS as instructed)



Please note that we may still send you important administrative and safety messages even if you opt out of receiving marketing communications.

#### The way we use data 

We’re always working to develop and improve our products and services, and improve our processes to ensure that they and we better meet your needs.

New technologies let us combine information we have about our customers and users with data from other sources, such as third-party websites or the Australian Bureau of Statistics. 

We also collect information about people that does not identify them such as website and advertising analytics, and data from service providers. 

We analyse this data to help us learn more about our customers and improve our products and services. Where we work with partners or service providers to do this, we do not pass on personal information about you.

  


### 5. Who do we share your information with?

We share your information for the purposes set out in section 4, with our service providers, and to comply with the law. When we do this, we take steps to keep your information safe.

We share your personal information with other people and companies where we need to for the purposes set out in section 4. This includes sharing:

  * with our installation, maintenance and fulfillment partners, so they can make installations and maintain products and services that we offer
  * with other energy companies and other companies (like those that own or operate poles and wires) that help us deliver our products and services, or to migrate your service if you change energy providers
  * with credit reporting agencies to process new applications, assess and manage applications for credit, manage overdue accounts, and review your creditworthiness
  * with insurance investigators
  * with people that you have asked us to give your information to, such as your authorised representatives or legal advisors 
  * if you have applied to work with us, with your previous employers to confirm your work history
  * to comply with laws and assist government agencies and law enforcement.



We also share personal information with people and organisations that help us with our business, such as professional advisors, IT support, and corporate and administrative services including mercantile agents (including debt collectors) and debt buyers. We only do this where it’s needed for those services to be provided to us. When we do this, we take steps that require our service providers to protect your information.
