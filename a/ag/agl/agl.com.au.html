<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The Australian Gas Light Company ABN 95 052 167 405 ("AGL", including Agility and all of AGL's related companies) respects and is committed to protect the privacy of our customers, shareholders and other people who we deal with in our business. We are bound by the National Privacy Principles in the Privacy Act 1988. This Privacy Statement outlines how and when personal information is typically collected, stored and distributed by AGL and how we provide for verification and correction.</p>
<p class="more">| <a href="#top">return to top</a> |</p><a name="Customers"></a>
<h3>Customers</h3>
<p>If you are an AGL customer we will have personal information about you for the primary purpose of supplying you with energy and related services. This will include your name, addresses and phone numbers. We have secure systems to keep this information. We collect certain information to help identify you and to assist in keeping your information secure. We may obtain banking, credit card, email or other details as part of making business with us easier for you. We may also collect information to allow us to qualify you for benefits such as a pension number to ensure eligibility for a pensioner discount. If there are special reasons like the Victorian Government sponsored program regarding life support electricity supply, we may with your prior express consent, collect sensitive information such as information about a medical condition. Without contact details we cannot provide services to you. </p>
<p>Usually you or a family or household member will provide us with this information (by telephone, application form or internet application) in order to enable us to service your energy needs in a way that is easiest and most convenient for you. Sometimes a builder, real estate agent, AGL Energy Shop or other person might refer this information to us. If you or your representative contacts us seeking personal information regarding you as a customer, we will seek some verification of your identity based on the information we hold about you.</p>
<p>AGL is committed to keeping your personal information secure and confidential. We have technology and procedures to control and limit access to your information. Most customer information is stored in computer databases owned and operated by AGL which are subject to restricted access and other typical computer systems security arrangements. If you cease to be a customer your records will remain securely stored.</p>
<p>AGL may if necessary disclose your personal information for reasons of law enforcement, energy markets requirements (such as organisations that administer the customer choice energy market), regulatory, safety and public wellbeing. AGL may exchange personal information with credit reference agencies when establishing your account and where an account is in default. AGL seeks to resolve customer service and payment problems through a range of avenues including ombudsmen and issues resolution schemes, liaison with community and government agencies and communication through interpreting services or other representatives of customers. Where this might involve your personal information you will generally be aware of the involvement of these other parties.</p>
<p>AGL provides its service to you with the assistance of related companies, contractors, agents and suppliers. We may need to provide these parties with some of your personal information (typically, your name, address and contact details). AGL takes its obligation to protect your information seriously and we make every effort to deal only with ethical suppliers who share and demonstrate respect for your privacy. If we need to give a contractor access to personal information we will require that it be kept secure and be used for the appropriate purpose.</p>
<p>Examples of contractors and suppliers include the electricity or gas network companies which own or operate the wires or gas pipes to your premises, the companies which print and post or present on the internet bills and other information, meter reading service providers and service contractors who might carry out your connection or repairs. Other types of parties who may, subject to confidentiality and strict control of use, have access to personal information include computer systems support, marketing and business advisers, auditors and individual contractors who assist in our business from time to time.</p>
<p>You may deal with businesses like AGL Energy Shops or AGL accredited service providers like electricians or plumbers. These businesses are independently owned and operated. If these businesses have access to any personal information from AGL, we require them to treat the information with confidentiality and to apply standards consistent with the National Privacy Principles. These businesses may deal with you and have access to your personal information independently of AGL. If you have any concerns regarding the treatment of your personal information by one of our retail or service affiliates please see Access and correction below for information on how to contact us.</p>
<p>AGL aims to provide our customers with a full range of options to meet their energy related needs. We also may give our customers opportunities to receive special offers on other goods and services. If you want your name and contact details removed from our contact list you should contact us on <b>131 245</b>, or by email to <a href="mailto:customer.enquiries@agl.com.au">customer.enquiries@agl.com.au</a>, or by writing to AGL at Locked Bag 1837,&nbsp;St Leonards&nbsp;NSW 2065.</p>
<p>If you have any queries on how we deal with your personal information or you want to inspect our records of your personal information see Access and correction below.</p>
<p class="more">| <a href="#top">return to top</a> |</p><a name="Shareholders"></a>
<h3>Shareholders</h3>
<p>If you are an AGL shareholder we will have personal information about you to help us meet your needs as a shareholder. This could include your name, address, phone number and banking details. This information may be supplied by AGL to you, your stockbroker or some other agent acting on your behalf. AGL contracts Link Market Services Limited to manage our share registry and maintain secure systems to keep this information.</p>
<p>If in accordance with Australian tax laws, you choose to supply your Tax File Number (TFN), we give the relevant advice to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO). We may also provide dividend information to the ATO. AGL maintains TFNs in a secure area on the share register.</p>
<p>AGL is committed to keeping your personal information secure and confidential. We do use related companies, contractors, agents and suppliers to assist us in servicing you. These parties may require access to some of your personal information. In such cases AGL requires these parties to maintain confidentiality and not misuse information. AGL takes its obligation to protect your information seriously and we make every effort to deal only with ethical suppliers who share and demonstrate respect for your privacy. Examples of these parties include the printing and mail-house businesses that produce and distribute annual reports and dividend advices, your bank in respect of direct payments and Link Market Services Limited.</p>
<p>Under Section 173 of Corporations Act 2001, AGL must allow inspection of the Company's share register to any person who applies for it. This register sets out all shareholders' names, addresses and share holdings. We sometimes provide information from the share register to meet the requirements of a requesting party, such as the top 100 shareholders. AGL does not knowingly supply shareholder information for purposes other than information that is considered in the interest of the shareholder, the investor market, brokers, financial journals and market analysts. </p>
<p>We may disclose your personal information to your stockbroker, accountant, a family member or other person who reasonably identifies themselves as authorised. We will generally seek some indication that the party contacting us is you or an authorised agent. If you cease to be a shareholder your records are kept securely by us.</p>
<p>If you have any queries on how we deal with your personal information or if you want to review the personal information we have on you as a shareholder contact <strong>Link Market Services Limited</strong> on <strong>1800 724 514</strong>. </p>

<p class="more">| <a href="#top">return to top</a> |</p><a name="Auditing"></a>
<h3>Site auditing and log files</h3>
<p>We use various tools to analyse log files to summarise user movements. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyse trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>We analyse our web site logs to understand what parts of our web site visitors use most, so that we can look to improving our web site and make it a more useful experience. Our web site logs are not personally identifiable, and we make no attempt to link them with the individuals that actually browse the site.</p>
<p class="more">| <a href="#top">return to top</a> |</p><a name="Newsletters"></a>
<h3>Newsletters and email subscriptions</h3>
<p>If you wish to subscribe to any of our newsletters, subscriptions or promotional communications, we ask for contact information such as name and email address. If you no longer wish to receive our newsletters, subscriptions or promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving these communications at any time.</p>
<p class="more">| <a href="#top">return to top</a> |</p><a name="Other"></a>
<h3>Other information collection and distribution</h3>
<p>AGL sometimes collects other personal information in the course of its business. This occurs in such circumstances as: investor contact lists - potential investors and others interested in the Company can register to receive information; business contact information - contact details we collect and store regarding people we do business with; marketing contact lists - AGL may develop or acquire a marketing contact list such as through competitions or promotions where people are invited to give us personal details; and employment enquiries information - AGL may retain and share through the organisation personal information sent to it by people seeking employment. </p>
<p>AGL will comply with the National Privacy Principles in respect of this personal information including notifying people that we have collected information, the purpose of the collection and how they can contact us about it. </p>
<p>AGL does not normally transfer personal information outside Australia. We seek to monitor contractors so that we are aware if they propose to transfer information outside the country. We cannot control the movement of information which by law we make public, such as details from the share register.</p>
<p class="more">| <a href="#top">return to top</a> |</p><a name="Access"></a>
<h3>Access and correction</h3>
<p>Key personal information concerning you such as your name, contact details and bank or other payment details are subject to your routine review on your energy account or shareholder dividend advice. If any information is incorrect you should advise us by calling the number on the relevant correspondence.</p>
<p>AGL is also committed to providing you with access to your personal information in accordance with the National Privacy Principles. Generally, we will be able to show you all the personal information we hold regarding you. In some circumstances there may be legal or commercial constraints to disclosing some information and, as anticipated in the National Privacy Principles, we may withhold information or subject its review to special processes. </p>
<p>To seek formal access to your personal information you should:</p>
<p>Telephone <b>AGL</b> on <b>131 245</b></p>
<p>or</p>
<p>contact the Privacy Officer<br>Locked Bag 1837<br>St Leonards NSW 2065<br>Email: <a href="mailto:customer.enquiries@agl.com.au">customer.enquiries@agl.com.au</a></p>
<p>If your enquiry is detailed or covers a number of areas of our business we may ask you to complete an Information Request Form which will assist us to fully respond to your enquiry. For your protection you will be asked to provide information that helps us confirm your identity.</p>
<p>A basic enquiry about your customer details or shareholder information will be at no cost. However, where your enquiry involves a more extensive search of our records a fee may be payable to cover our costs in collating information and arranging access.</p>
<p>In many cases we will deal with your enquiry on the telephone. If it is more involved, we will aim to provide you with access to the information within 15 working days. If your enquiry requires additional searching this time may be extended.</p>
<p>If we have information which you want to inspect in person, we will normally provide you with access at a location as convenient as possible to you. To inspect the information we will require you to show photo identification, such as a driver's licence. This is for your security.</p>
<p>We will consider any recommendation by you to change or correct information and advise you of the action taken.</p>
