		PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY.  By using this site, you are 
		deemed to have agreed to this policy.  This Privacy Policy will advise you about 
		how we protect your personal information, and about your choices concerning our 
		use of your personal information. Please read this policy carefully. We may need 
		to change this policy from time to time in order to address new issues and reflect 
		changes on our site. We will post those changes here so please refer back to this 
		policy regularly.
		<br><br>
		If you have any questions or concerns about our privacy policy, please send us an 
		e-mail to: <a href="mailto:AGLRprivacy@aglresources.com?subject=Inquiry from AGLResources.com">AGLRprivacy@aglresources.com</a>.
		<br><br>
		<b>Personal Identification Information</b>
		<br>
		We will collect personal identification information from you only if you 
		voluntarily give it to us.
		<br><br>
		Except as specified in this Section, we will not intentionally disclose any personal 
		identification information about you as an individual user (such as, your full name, 
		street address, telephone number, credit card number or e-mail address) to any third 
		party without your consent or permission.  AGL Resources may share your information 
		with other AGL Resources affiliated companies. Your information may be shared with 
		agents or contractors of AGL Resources in connection with services that these 
		individuals or entities perform for AGL Resources. 
		<br><br>
		We may request personal identification information from you in connection with your 
		use of, or participation in, surveys, registrations, requests for suggestions, and 
		in connection with other activities, services or resources we make available to you.  
		Again, please note that you must voluntarily give this information to us.  If you 
		identify yourself to us by sending us an e-mail with questions or comments, we may 
		use your personal information to respond to your questions or comments.
		<br><br>
		We may also use personal identification information for internal or external 
		marketing and promotional purposes. On occasion, for example, we may send you 
		e-mails to introduce a product or service that we think might be of interest to you. 
		You may choose to "opt-out" of receiving information from us at any time, after you 
		have provided personal identification information, by following the procedures 
		described at the end of this Privacy Policy. Please note, however, that under certain 
		circumstances, if you "opt-out," you may not be eligible for certain benefits for 
		which a name, e-mail address, telephone number or other personal identification 
		information is needed.
		<br><br>
		Additionally, we will release specific information about you to comply with any 
		valid legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute or court order. We 
		will also release specific information in special cases, such as if there is an 
		attempted breach of the security of the AGL Resources site, or a physical threat 
		to you or others.
		<br><br>
		<b>Non-Personal Information And The Use Of Cookie Technology</b>
		<br>
		We may collect non-personal information through the use of either "cookie" 
		technology, IP address tracking or both. Non-personal information is information 
		that does not identify you personally and might include the browser you use, the 
		type of computer, the operating systems, the Internet service providers and other 
		similar information. Cookies are small pieces of information stored on your hard 
		drive, not on the AGL Resources site.  Cookies allow us to personalize your 
		experience at the AGL Resources site by automatically gathering information about 
		the areas you visit on our site and about the links you may select from within 
		our site to other areas of the World Wide Web or elsewhere online.  Cookies also 
		allow you to store your password (in the event one is necessary), without having 
		to constantly re-enter it.
		<br><br>
		We use such information in the aggregate to understand how our users as a group 
		use the services and resources provided on our site.  In this way we know which 
		areas of our site are favorites of our users, which areas need improvement, and 
		what technologies are being used so that we may continually improve our site.
		<br><br>
		We may also share this aggregate statistical information with our partners, 
		suppliers and other third parties. Most browsers are set to accept cookies. You 
		can set your browser to refuse cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being 
		sent. If you do so, please note that some parts of the AGL Resources site may 
		not work properly. 
		<br><br>
		<b>Links To Other Sites and Liability to Third Parties</b>
		<br>
		Users will find advertising or other content on our site that provide links to 
		the sites and services of our partners, sponsors, licensors and other third 
		parties. We do not control the content or links that appear on these sites and 
		we are not responsible for the information or links you may find there.  These 
		sites and services may have their own privacy policies, or no policy at all. We 
		encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third party site or service 
		before providing them with your personal information.  The presence of these 
		links on this website is not intended to imply our endorsement of that site or 
		its goods or services, but to provide a convenient link to relevant sites which 
		are managed by other organizations, companies, or individuals.
		<br><br>
		Although we will use all reasonable efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of 
		your personal identification information, transmissions made by means of the 
		Internet cannot be made absolutely secure.  AGL Resources will have no liability 
		for disclosure of information due to errors in transmission or unauthorized acts 
		of third parties.
		<br><br>
		<b>Security Policy</b>
		<br>
		AGL Resources will make reasonable efforts to keep secure the data you provide us 
		and will take reasonable precautions, such as using a secure server, in an effort 
		to protect your personal identification information from loss, misuse or alteration. 
		Agents or hosting contractors of AGL Resources who have access to your personal 
		identification information in connection with providing services for AGL Resources 
		are required to keep the information confidential and are not permitted to use 
		this information for any other purpose than to carry out the services they are 
		performing for AGL Resources.
		<br><br>
		<b>Choice/Opt-Out</b>
		<br>
		If at any time you would like to stop receiving information from us, you can let 
		us know by sending an e-mail stating your preference to 
		<a href="mailto:AGLRoptout@aglresources.com?subject=Inquiry from AGLResources.com">AGLRoptout@aglresources.com</a>.  
		If you have submitted personal identification information through this website or 
		an interactive advertisement, or if someone else has submitted your personal 
		identification information through this website or interactive advertisement, and 
		you would like to have that information deleted from our marketing databases, 
		please contact us via e-mail at 
		<a href="mailto:AGLRprivacy@aglresources.com?subject=Inquiry from AGLResources.com">AGLRprivacy@aglresources.com</a>, or send 
		a letter to our AGL Resources Privacy Compliance Coordinator at PO Box 4569, 
		Atlanta Georgia 30302. We will then use reasonable efforts to remove your personal 
		identification information from our files, unless we are entitled to retain it 
		pursuant to an agreement that you have entered into with AGL Resources. You may 
		also contact us through either of the above methods to request the personal 
		identification information that AGL Resources has collected about you through its 
		website or interactive advertisements. AGL Resources will use reasonable efforts to 
		supply you with this information and correct any factual inaccuracies in this 
		information. If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact 
		us by email or regular mail as stated above. 
		<br><br>
		<b>Transfer of Business Assets</b>
		<br>
		As we continue to develop our business, we may be acquired, merge with another 
		business, acquire or buy other businesses or assets.  In such transactions, 
		customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets.  In 
		such an event, both personal identification and non-personal information will be 
		one of the transferred assets.  We will provide you with reasonable notice and an 
		opportunity to opt-out prior to the transfer.
		<br><br>
		<b>Your Acceptance of These Terms</b>
		<br>
		By using this site, you accepted our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this 
		policy, please do not use the site. Your continued use of the AGL Resources site 
		following the posting of changes to these terms will mean that you accept those 
		changes.
