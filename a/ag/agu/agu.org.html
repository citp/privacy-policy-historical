<h1>AGU Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>As constituents of AGU we value the ability to set the level at which we will share 
information about ourselves. AGU gathers information at headquarters and in external offices, 
primarily those of editors, about members, authors, and all others who participate in any way 
in the Union’s activities. Every Union officer, volunteer, staff worker, and member who 
has access to these data is charged with respecting the privacy of those who provided it and is 
to act in accord with the following policies.</p>

<h2>Why personal data are collected</h2>

<p>Addresses, phone numbers, e-mail addresses, other contact information, and information 
related to scientific interests are collected from AGU constituents in the course of providing 
services such as subscriptions, meeting registration, and submission of articles, and in various 
other interactions. Such information is required to complete the individual order or deliver the 
service. Other demographic information, such as education and employment data, is collected when 
individuals apply for membership or are suggested for various positions in the Union. Except as 
described below, these data and any other information of a personal nature, such as gender, are 
collected on a purely voluntary basis; furthermore, they are not shared or used in such a way 
that an individual is identified. Principal uses of these data are for internal assessments of 
AGU programs and the membership; additionally, these data, in a consolidated form, may be used 
in publicly distributed statistical descriptions and studies of the AGU constituency.</p>

<p>AGU members may add, correct, or update their personal information through a
<a href="/cgi-bin/membership_services/member_search.cgi">form</a> 
on the AGU Web site or to Member Services by phone at : +1-202-462-6900 
(toll free in North America: 800-966-2481) or by e-mail at 
<a href="mailto:service@agu.org">service@agu.org</a>.</p>

<h2>What personal data are made available</h2>

<p>AGU’s online Membership Directory contains basic contact information and membership 
data including Section and Focus Group affiliations. It is provided to facilitate personal 
communication between members only. The downloading of large numbers of records is forbidden. 
This is a service restricted to members and requires a personal log-in; members share the 
responsibility for the security of their data with others and help ensure it by keeping their 
access codes confidential. The activity in member accounts is also monitored to identify 
patterns inconsistent with permitted personal use. A member account may be temporarily 
inactivated if it appears that it is being misused.</p>

<p>Postal mailing lists may be exchanged with other scientific societies for one-time use. 
Such exchanges are made only if the material to be sent is deemed beneficial to the AGU members 
to be contacted and advances the scientific missions of both societies. Such exchanges are 
reviewed by Section officers, staff and/or Union officers, depending on the nature of the 
message and the distributions they are to be given. Lists for approved mailings may be selected 
by scientific specialty, geographic location, and/or student status. AGU will occasionally mail 
or e-mail a notice on behalf of another organization to selected groups of AGU members. Such 
mailings are subject to the same review process.</p>

<h2>Electronic mail addresses are not shared</h2>

<p>Other demographic data are needed from time to time to help understand such matters as 
membership trends, and gender and age differences with respect to reaction to programs. These 
data are retained to provide a statistical overview of the Union so that the leadership can 
better understand how the population is changing and consider how to meet changing needs. 
Constituents who elect to provide such data may be assured that it will never be made available 
publicly in any form that identifies individuals.</p>

<h2>Opt out</h2>

<p>Any individual may decline to provide information requested by AGU. In this case, AGU will be 
unable to provide services for which such information is needed for security and/or 
identification purposes. A member may request not to be included on any list to be used by an 
organization other than AGU by sending an e-mail to 
<a href="mailto:service@agu.org">service@agu.org</a> 
asking to be excluded from mailing lists exchanged with other societies.</p>

<p>Members may suppress the publication of all or selected elements of their personal information 
in the Membership Directory, and subscribers to any AGU online service can stop the service by 
sending an e-mail message to 
<a href="mailto:service@agu.org">service@agu.org</a>, 
telephoning +1-202-462-6900 (toll free in North America: 800-966-2481), or writing to 
AGU, 2000 Florida Ave. NW, Washington, DC 20009.</p>

<p>It is the intent of AGU policies to ensure that members are kept informed but do not feel 
burdened by what they receive as a “benefit” of membership. The officers of the Union 
and staff welcome comments from members as to the effectiveness of e-mail and mail as a 
communication tool on any specific case.</p>

<h2>Keeping data about individuals secure</h2>

<p>Sensitive demographic information is stored in a separate, secure database that is not 
accessible via the Membership Directory.</p>

<p>Credit card information provided to AGU via its Web site is transmitted via a secure server 
with commercial encryption software. Those not able to use a secure server may opt to place the 
order another way, via phone, fax, or postal mail. To comply with credit card company 
requirements, AGU stores certain information for 3 years from the date of the transaction. 
When requested by the card holder, AGU will retain credit card information for future specified 
uses.</p>

<h2>Cookies</h2>

<p>A “cookie” is a file a Web site stores in a user’s computer for future 
reference. AGU uses cookies to improve some of its services. Individuals may set their browsers 
to reject cookies; however, there are AGU services, like meeting abstract and journal article 
submissions, that will not function unless the user accepts the AGU cookie. For example, when a 
user returns to that AGU service, the cookie will identify the user as a previous visitor. 
Information supplied through an AGU cookie is used only by AGU and not shared with others.</p>

<h2>Links to other sites</h2>

<p>AGU links to other Web sites that are not controlled by AGU. A link from the AGU Web site is 
not an AGU endorsement for any company, organization, or individual. AGU is not responsible for 
the privacy practices or the content of those sites.</p>
