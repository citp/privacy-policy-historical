# AGU - Privacy Policy

AGU respects the privacy of members, users of its services, and visitors to its various Web sites and operates according to the following policies.

Several AGU online services require the user to supply an e-mail address. These addresses are used only for those services; they are not used to update membership records unless so directed by the member. The e-mail addresses are never shared with others. Subscribers to any AGU online service can stop the service by following the instructions for that service or by sending an e-mail message to service@agu.org.

Personal addresses, phone numbers, e-mail addresses, and other demographic information are collected for membership, subscriptions, meeting registrations, submission of articles, and the like. 

Contact information supplied when ordering publications, registering for meetings, etc. is used for internal purposes only and is not shared with others except as required to fulfill an order or service.

AGU’s online Membership Directory is a service restricted to members. It contains basic contact information and membership data. AGU does not sell or rent this information to anyone but does occasionally exchange postal addresses with other scientific societies.

AGU collects credit card numbers only to bill for specific services. These numbers are not kept for future reference or use.

A “cookie” is a file a Web site places in your computer for future reference. AGU uses cookies to improve some of its services. For example, when you return to that AGU service, the cookie will identify you as a previous visitor. Information supplied through an AGU cookie is used only by AGU and not shared with others.. 

AGU links to some other sites. AGU is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of those sites.
