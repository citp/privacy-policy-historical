The purpose of this policy is to inform you about the types of information we gather about you and your child when you visit our site, how we use that information, and your rights regarding our use of the information.

AGKidZone.com and Parents.AGKidZone.com comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). We encourage you to participate in your child's online activities and monitor your child's use of this site. 

**1\. What Is Personally Identifiable Information?**  
Personally identifiable information is information that can identify you or your child as an individual, such as your full name, your email address, or your postal address. Some information, like a first name or age, is personal in nature, but is not personally identifiable information because it cannot be used to identify or contact you or your child. 

**2\. What Information Do You Collect and How Do You Collect It?**  
We will only collect the personally identifiable information that is necessary for you or your child to participate in an online activity. 

We do collect information in a variety of ways, although most of the information we collect is not personally identifiable information. 

  1. **Registration.** When your child registers on our site, we ask that your child create a username. Your child should not use any personally identifiable information as part of his or her username. We will also ask that your child tell us his or her age. Neither the username nor age is personally identifiable information, because it can't be used to contact you or your child or identify her offline. 

We will also ask for your email address, so that we may contact you to explain how we use the information we collect about your child and obtain your permission to do so. 

We will also collect your child's email address for various communications relating to the site. This is personally identifiable information and will not be disclosed except as described below. 

  2. **Contests & Sweepstakes. ** From time to time we may conduct contests or sweepstakes. If your child participates in the contests or sweepstakes, under certain circumstances we may ask you for personally identifiable information such as a postal address and full name if necessary to award prizes. Personally identifiable information obtained specifically for contests and sweepstakes will not be shared with third parties.
  3.  **Surveys and Feedback.** We may collect information in connection with surveys or online activities. We do not collect any personally identifiable information with surveys or feedback requests. Information you or your child provides in connection with feedback or surveys will not be connected with any personally identifiable information we have.
  4.  **Website.** We use technology to collect information about the users on the site. For example, we use cookies, which are pieces of information that are placed on your computer for record-keeping purposes. As you move from page to page at our website, a cookie is the only way that we have of knowing who you are. An activity on one page may depend on what you selected on a previous page. We use a cookie to keep track of your selection. Without cookies, users may be asked to provide the same information repeatedly. Some activities may not function at all. 

You can control cookies from your end. Internet browsers (like Netscape, AOL and Explorer) give you the ability to control the use of cookies. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you prefer, you can set your browser to alert you when cookies are in use. You may set your browser to disable or refuse cookies. You can also erase a cookie that has been placed on your computer by us or by others. If you do not allow cookies to be used in the traditional way, it is possible that some parts of the website will not function as we designed them. 

These techniques may transmit data directly to us, or to third parties we authorize to collect information on our behalf. None of the information collected through these methods is personally identifiable information, nor is it connected to any personally identifiable information about you or your child.

  5.  **Email Communication From Us.** Our site may allow you or your child to sign up to receive newsletters, ecards, and emails from our site, containing special information or offers. In order to sign up for these activities, we will collect your child's first name and email address, and your email address if your child is under 13. If your child is under 13, we will contact you by email to notify you that your child has provided this information to us, to provide you with the opportunity to opt your child out of the collection of the information.
  6.  **Safety and Security.** We may collect your personally identifiable information where necessary for your safety. We may also collect your personally identifiable information for the limited purposes of protecting the security and integrity of the website, taking precautions against liability, or responding to law enforcement. 



**3\. Do You Disclose Personally Identifiable Information To Others?**  
We use all of the personally identifiable information we collect only to provide services related to the website. We do not share any personally identifiable information with third parties for marketing or advertising purposes. We may engage third parties to assist with services related to the website, such as technical and processing services, order or contest fulfillment, and analysis and website performance. These third parties are required to keep the information secure, can only use your information to provide services to us, and cannot use your information for marketing or advertising.

If AG KidZone, or most or all of its assets, is transferred or sold to another entity, all information, including personally identifiable information would be transferred to that entity.

We may also share personally identifiable information with third parties in order to comply with court orders, requests by law enforcement agencies, to enforce our Terms of Service, or to protect, the rights, safety, or property of our website and other users of the website.

**4\. Can Personally Identifiable Information Be Reviewed Or Corrected?**  
You can review the personally identifiable information provided by your child, request corrections to the information, ask that we delete the information from our database, or refuse further collection or use of the information by contacting help@agkidzone.com or by calling 1-866-228-2429.
