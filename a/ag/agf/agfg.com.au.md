# Privacy - Australian Good Food Guide

## Privacy Overview

The Australian Good Food & Travel Guide periodically reviews its Privacy Policy and reserves the right, at its discretion, to modify or remove portions of this policy at any time. The Australian Good Food & Travel Guide considers the responsible use of personal information to be of vital importance. The Australian Good Food & Travel Guide is committed to ensuring that to the best of our ability we meet all the requirements of the National Privacy Principals and the Privacy Act. 

In general, you can visit the Australian Good Food & Travel Guide website without revealing any personal information about yourself. However there are times when information will be collected, such as when you register for competitions or memberships, for billing purposes, appraisals or in connection with community postings such as message boards or feedback to us or to receive information from us. This information may include your name, home or business address and e-mail address. Personal information will only be collected when knowingly and voluntarily submitted. 

The Australian Good Food & Travel Guide may share the information obtained with other organisations with a similar purpose to our own. We will endeavour to limit the use of the information to the purpose for which it was provided.

The Australian Good Food & Travel Guide will seek your permission to send you further communications at the time you provide us with your personal information. If at any time after submitting your personal information to The Australian Good Food & Travel Guide you would no longer like to receive information from us, simply follow the ‘unsubscribe’ directions at the end of any e-mail communications you receive.

No attempt will be made to identify users or their browsing activities except in the unlikely event of an investigation, where a law enforcement agency may exercise a warrant to inspect server logs. The statistics and log files may be preserved indefinitely and used at any time and in any way necessary to prevent security breaches and to ensure the integrity of the information supplied by The Australian Good Food & Travel Guide.

In general on The Australian Good Food & Travel Guide websites, IP addresses (a number that is unique to the computer through which you are connected to the internet) are logged to track a user's session while the user remains anonymous. We analyse this data for certain trends and statistics, such as which parts of our site users are visiting and how long they spend there. In general, we do not link your IP addresses to anything personally identifiable to you. In those limited cases where session information is not anonymous, The Australian Good Food & Travel Guide will provide notice of the practice and an opportunity to 'opt out.'

When The Australian Good Food & Travel Guide receives information about your session or about you, we may also use it for research or to improve our site and the services we offer you.

Once The Australian Good Food & Travel Guide receives information from you via e-mail or any other means, the information is in a secure environment. Your personal information will not be released unless The Australian Good Food & Travel Guide believes in good faith that the law requires it or your permission is granted.
