## AgWeb Privacy Policy

**Your Privacy**

AgWeb.com respects your privacy. Our goal is to be your trusted, objective source of information for the business of farming and ranching. We want you to make the most of our services and feel confident while doing so online. We have a clear privacy policy: we collect no private, personal information unless you voluntarily provide us with such information. This privacy statement explains under what circumstances we may gather your individually identifiable information, how we may use such information, and who may have access that information. This privacy statement also provides you with the instructions and means to "opt-out" of providing personal information that you do not wish to provide and to access, change, or remove any identifying information which may have already been collected.

We believe that your privacy is of the utmost importance, which is why this statement regarding privacy of personally identifiable information provided online conforms to the Federal Trade Commission's fair information practices of notice, choice, access, and security. We hope that you will provide comments on how we can improve our privacy policy so that we may better address and accommodate your needs and concerns. Please provide any comments relating to this privacy policy to: [_feedback@agweb.com_](mailto:feedback@agweb.com)

Please note that this privacy policy applies only to the AgWeb.com web site. More specifically this privacy policy cannot and does not apply to any other companies' or organizations' web sites to which the AgWeb.com web site may link. Such other third party web sites may have different or no privacy policies relating to information provided through those third party web sites. We have attempted to mark each of our web pages with the AgWeb.com trademark so you will always know when you are on the AgWeb.com web site and know where this policy applies.

**Personal Information We Collect Online**

When you visit AgWeb.com, we do not collect any personally identifiable information without your consent. If you are simply perusing our site and have not registered for any of our specific services, we collect no personally identifiable information from you. In order to register for AgWeb.com services, however, we require that you provide us with your first and last name, and address, including state, postal code, country, and email address.

On certain pages within our web site, you are invited to order products and services from AgWeb.com. In order to complete an online order, information such as name, address (including street name or post office box, city, state, and postal code), credit card number, and email address are required. If you prefer not to provide such information online, but are still interested in receiving AgWeb.com products and services, you may call us at: 877.692.4932.

**Surveys and Contests**

From time to time our web site may request information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary. You need not participate in any such surveys or contests. You have the choice of whether or not to disclose any information in response to the survey or contest questions. Information requested may include contact and demographic information. Contact information may be used by AgWeb.com to enhance your use of the AgWeb.com website, for related purposes, and will be used to notify the winners and award prizes of any such surveys or contests.

**How We Protect Your Information**

AgWeb.com is dedicated to the security of your personal information, and we take all commercially reasonable precaution to maintain that protection. To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, to maintain data and information accuracy, and to facilitate the appropriate use of information, we have implemented a variety of encryption and security technologies and procedures to protect information stored in our computer systems from unauthorized access. Moreover, we use physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to protect the personal information we may collect online. We also maintain procedural safeguards that restrict access to your personal information to employees (or people working on our behalf and under confidentiality agreements) who need to know your personal information in order to provide the products and services that you request. Further, encryption technology and tools are used when collecting or transferring sensitive information such as credit card numbers. Additional database content is protected either by means of a two key encryption algorithm Secure Socket Level ("SSL") encryption, and/or behind a firewall using security software.

If you have any questions about the security at AgWeb.com, please contact us by email at: [_feedback@agweb.com_](mailto:feedback@agweb.com).
