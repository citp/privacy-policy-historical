Agoda Privacy Policy

Introduction

Last Updated on 13 February 2013

Agoda.com is owned and operated by Agoda Company Pte. Ltd. ("Agoda" or "we"). The following Privacy Policy describes how we as a data controller collect, use, disclose, and otherwise process personally identifiable information that we collect about individuals ("Personal Data") in connection with the services available from Agoda through the website located at [www.agoda.com](http://www.agoda.com/) ("Site"). References to the Site are deemed to include derivatives thereof, including but not necessarily limited to mobile websites and applications. By visiting the Site, you are consenting to the collection, use, disclosure and processing of your Personal Data as described in this Privacy Policy. All data that we collect and process is stored on servers located in Hong Kong, a country that may not provide an equivalent level of data protection to the laws in your home jurisdiction.

On occasion, Agoda may revise this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in the law, our Personal Data collection and use practices, the features of our Site, or advances in technology. If we make revisions that change the way we collect or use your Personal Data, those changes will be posted in this Privacy Policy and the effective date will be noted at the beginning of this Privacy Policy. Therefore, you should review this Privacy Policy periodically so that you are up to date on our most current policies and practices. Agoda will also prominently post such material changes prior to implementing the change. If you do not agree with any changes or modifications to the Privacy Policy, please do not continue using the Site. You will be deemed to have consented to any modification of the Privacy Policy when you use the Site after the effective date of the modification.

Information We Collect

We collect Personal Data about you that you provide to us while using the Site. Personal Data may include your name, address, phone number, credit card number, e-mail address, hotel name, hotel location and/or length of stay. We also collect non-personally identifiable information, which may be linked to your Personal Data, including your log-in name, IP address, nationality and password, and search preferences related to specific searches.

Protecting Your Personal Data

To prevent unauthorized access, we maintain reasonable physical, electronic and organizational procedures to protect Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, or unauthorized disclosure or access. To protect credit card transactions, Agoda.com currently uses Secure Socket Layer technology to encrypt credit card information during transit.

How We Use the Information We Collect

We use Personal Data and other information collected through the Site to register you with the Site and our Agoda Rewards program as requested by you, to provide you with the requested products and services (mainly to process your reservation), to provide you with information about our products and services on the Site or on other websites and to communicate with you to the extent necessary to provide such requested products and services, and to build features that will make the services available on the Site easier to use. This includes faster purchase requests, better customer support and timely notice of new services and special offers. From time to time, Agoda may contact you to request feedback on your experience in using the Site, to assist us in improving the Site, or to offer special savings or promotions to you as a Site user, where you have indicated your consent to receiving such communications. If you would prefer not to receive notices of special savings or promotions, you may simply opt out from receiving those by replying to Agoda using the hyperlink provided in these notices.

Sharing Your Personal Data

Agoda may share your Personal Data with third parties we employ to perform services on our behalf, such as web hosting services, data analysis, to market our products and services, also on websites of such third parties, to handle credit card transactions and to otherwise provide you with customer service. All such third parties will be under an obligation to maintain the security and confidentiality of the Personal Data, and to process the Personal Data only in accordance with our instructions.

In some cases, Agoda may require that you transact directly with a third party to obtain services, or when you use the Site to reserve a hotel room or obtain another product or service, we may provide your Personal Data to that hotel or other involved third party.

Save for disclosures mentioned in this Privacy Policy or as required by law in any relevant jurisdiction as mentioned below and the disclosure of your Personal Data and information required for completing your booking with the relevant hotel of your choice and the sharing of certain Personal Data with selected partners where relevant (your details will be used for reporting and analysis purposes only), we will not disclose your Personal Data to third parties without your consent. However, we reserve the right to disclose your Personal Data to our affiliated (group) companies (in and outside your home country), including our affiliated (group) companies' employees and our trusted agents and representatives who have access to this information with our permission and who need to know or have access to this information to perform the service requested by you (including customer services) and internal (audit/compliance) investigations.

Agoda may, in compliance with applicable law, disclose Personal Data to protect ourselves against liability, to respond to subpoenas, judicial processes, legitimate requests by law enforcement officials, or as otherwise required or necessary in order to comply with applicable law, or to the purchasers in connection with any sale, assignment, or other transfer of all or a part of our business or company. We may also, in compliance with applicable law, disclose Personal Data to enforce or apply the terms and conditions applicable to our products and services or to protect the rights, property or safety of Agoda, our users or others.

In the situations described above, the recipient of the Personal Data may be located in a jurisdiction that may not provide an equivalent level of data protection to the laws in your home jurisdiction.
