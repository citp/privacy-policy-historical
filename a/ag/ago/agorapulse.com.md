# Privacy policy | Agorapulse

_Last update : July 10, 2011_

Your privacy is important to us, be assured that we are doing our very best to protect it and avoid any misuse or abuse of your personal data. This Policy explains how your personal information is collected, used, and disclosed by AgoraPulse and its Affiliates.

An Affiliate is a Facebook Page Administrator who has installed the AgoraPulse Page Manager on his/her page and have installed one of AgoraPulse’s applications on that Facebook page. You are probably seeing this privacy policy because you have installed, or are about to install, a Facebook application brought to you by one of our Affiliate.

Each Affiliate is bound by this Privacy Policy and commits to respect your privacy as well as we do.

If you have questions or complaints regarding our privacy policy or practices, please contact us at contact@agorapulse.com.

## What information do we collect?

We collect information from you in various ways when you use our applications. Information we may collect includes name, email address, birth date, gender, phone number, etc. At each time information is collected about you, you will be clearly informed about the type of collected information. No personal information will be collected without your explicit consent.

You can always refuse to provide personal information to us or our Affiliates but, most of the time, if you choose so, you will not be eligible to use the application.

The information collected is always collected in order to better address your needs. Spam with uninteresting content is not allowed on AgoraPulse! 🙂

The information we collect will help us and our Affiliate to target messages that are really of interest to you.

Moreover, we respect the laws of the countries we are operating in and require our Affiliates to do the same. In countries where explicit email opt-in is a requirement, an opt-in checkbox is proposed.

In addition, when you visit our website and participate in one of our applications, some information may be automatically collected. For example, it is standard for your Web browser to automatically send information to every website you visit including ours. That information includes your computer’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, access times, browser type and language, and referring website addresse. We may also collect information about your computer’s operating system and information about your usage and activity on our website and applications. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ behaviors and to gather demographic information about our visitors and applications users.

### Cookies

We may automatically collect certain information through the use of “cookies.” Cookies are small data files that are stored on your hard drive by a Web site. Among other things, the use of cookies helps us to improve our website and your experience. We use cookies to see which content and features are most popular, to count the number of computers accessing our Sites, to personalize your experience, and to remember your preferences.

We may link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our website. If your browser is set not to accept cookies or if you reject a cookie, you may not be able to access certain features or services of our applications.

### Web Beacons

We and our Affiliates use web beacons that help us better manage content on our applications. web beacons are electronic images that may be used on our applications. A web beacon may be used on our applications to collect information, deliver cookies, count visits, understand usage and campaign effectiveness.

## Who can access your information?

There are only two companies who can access your information: AgoraPulse and the Affiliate who has installed the application you are participating in. Your information will never be sold or otherwise transmitted to third parties.

## How your information may be used?

AgoraPulse will only use your information for demographic and statistical purposes. We will not use your information to contact you. We will keep your information strictly confidential and will not make any commercial use of it.

The Affiliate who has collected your information within the framework of the use of one of our application will use your information for demographic and statistical purposes.

It may use your information to contact you about a prize you may have won in a sweepstakes or any other type of contest.

It may also use your information to contact you by email to provide you with useful information about the Fan page it is operating.

Finally, it may also use your information for prospect / client relationship management purposes but will only do so in compliance with applicable laws. For that purpose, your information may be imported in the Affiliate’s CRM software to improve its communication with you and the service it may provide you with.

## How is your information secured?

The security of your personal information is important to us. Our applications are all SSL ready as Facebook is progressively deploying SSL on its platform. So when you provide us any information using one of our applications, it will be encrypted if Facebook SSL is running on the concerned page.

AgoraPulse takes reasonable security measures to protect your personal information to prevent loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Please be aware, however, that despite our efforts, no security measures are 100% bulletproof.

## How can you get your information changed or out of AgoraPulse?

You can request modification or deletion of your information at any time by sending an email to contact@agorapulse.com with your first and last name and the URL of your Facebook profile.

Agorapulse may change this Policy from time to time. If we make any changes to this policy, we will change the “Last Updated” date above. We encourage you to review this policy whenever you visit our Sites or use our applications to understand how your personal information is used.
