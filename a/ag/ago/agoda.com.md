Agoda.com is owned and operated by Agoda Company Pte. Limited ("Agoda"). The following Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, disclose, and otherwise process personally identifiable information that we collect about individuals ("Personal Data") in connection with the services available from Agoda through the web site located at **www.agoda.com** ("Site"). By visiting the Site, you are consenting to the collection, use, disclosure and processing of your Personal Data as described in this Privacy Policy. All data that we collect and process is stored on servers located in Hong Kong, a country that may not provide an equivalent level of data protection to the laws in your home jurisdiction.

On occasion Agoda may revise this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in the law, our Personal Data collection and use practices, the features of our Site, or advances in technology. If we make revisions that change the way we collect or use your Personal Data, those changes will be posted in this Privacy Policy and the effective date will be noted at the beginning of this Privacy Policy. Therefore, you should review this Privacy Policy periodically so that you are up to date on our most current policies and practices. Agoda will also prominently post such material changes prior to implementing the change.
