# Privacy Policy | Agora Cyber Charter School

###  **Understand Our Policy Regarding Your Input on Agora's Website**

K¹²'s unique program combines online technology with traditional content and the world's best teaching methods. We, K¹², have established this privacy policy to let you know how we collect and use information that we may gather from you on this website, K12.com, and the websites of our affiliated schools ("affiliates") (these websites collectively are referenced as "Sites" in this policy; all of the Sites are owned and operated by K¹²). This privacy policy discloses how we collect, use, share, and protect information gathered about you on our Sites.

This policy only applies to information that we collect through our Sites and does not apply to information that we may collect from you in other ways (for example, this policy does not apply to information that you may provide to us over the phone, by fax or through conventional mail). In addition, please note that this policy does not apply to your children's educational records—those records are protected by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act and we at K¹² are committed to compliance with that law.

**Non-Personal and Aggregated Information Collected Automatically**

Each time you visit our website, we log non-personal information, such as your IP address, domain name, the name of the Web page from which you entered our website, which pages you visit on our website, and how much time you spend on each page. We use this information to monitor and improve our website and for internal analysis. In particular, we use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the website, and gather information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.

**Use of Cookies**

Our website uses "cookies" to help personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is anonymously placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you. We use cookies to keep track of how you are using the Sites, to tailor Web content to your interests. If you have registered your children for a K¹² virtual program, cookies will speed up and ease your access to the OLS, as defined below, and navigation around the OLS. K¹² cookies do not contain personal information about the parent(s) or children enrolled in K¹² virtual program.

We will not share or sell non-aggregated information contained within cookies to any third party.

You also have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of our Sites or have some of our services on the Sites function properly. If you choose to decline cookies, you will not be able to access the OLS or have your children enrolled in a virtual program.

**Personal Information You Provide**

You can use portions of our Sites without divulging any personal information including your e-mail address. Our Sites do not collect personal information about individuals except when such individuals specifically provide such information on a voluntary basis, for example when you request a catalog, request additional information by contacting us, post a message to a message board, request help, or access and add to or change the information on your account information page on the OLS. When you register your children for a K¹² virtual program or participate in a K¹² virtual program through an affiliate or local school we may collect information regarding you and your children but all such information will be collected over the phone, by fax or through conventional mail. Once you have registered your children for a K¹² virtual program, there is an online service for all such programs (collectively the "OLS"). There will be a personal information page on the OLS that contains some or all of your personal information. You may also be assigned a Member ID and password and may create, at your discretion, a Member ID for your children any time you are logged on to the OLS. The Member ID will be used to recognize you and your children on the OLS portion of the K¹² Site. The Member ID will allow K¹² to recognize: your first and last name; registration ID; type of account, such as teacher, administrator, parent or student (if you created a separate Member ID and password for your children); school affiliation or the K¹² virtual program in which your children are enrolled; integration number; and the e-mail address you provided. The Member ID and the OLS will also allow you to track your children's attendance, school work and testing and to submit relevant portions of same to K¹², its affiliates and/or your local school to track your children's progress and abide by State and/or Federal standards and regulations.

K¹² calls customers to provide information they have requested and to answer questions. Because we only call customers at the telephone numbers they leave for us, K¹² does not call people by generating random or sequential telephone numbers. K¹² may use pre-recorded messages in order to ensure that customers receive the information they requested. Customers do not have to consent to receive calls in order to receive K¹²’s services.

K¹², its affiliates, and/or your local school may use personal information provided by you on your account information page on OLS to contact you about your children's progress, testing or attendance, customer service and quality control procedures. To the extent third party vendors assist K¹² and/or its affiliates in the provision of online products or services, those vendors are provided the minimum amount of data required to perform the tasks for which they have been engaged, have no independent rights to such data, and have agreed to adhere to the K¹² Privacy Policy.

K¹² may use the personal information on your account information page on OLS to provide you with information about new products and services available through K¹². You can request to opt out of receiving such information by making a request in writing to [privacy@K12.com](mailto:privacy@K12.com).

K¹² may share your information with companies that are not affiliated with K¹² but who are interested in sending you information about their products and services. You can request to opt out of the sharing of your personal information to independent third parties by making a request in writing to [privacy@K12.com](mailto:privacy@K12.com).

You can review, edit, and delete the personal information that you have provided to K¹² by making changes to your account information page on the OLS or making a request in writing to [privacy@K12.com](mailto:privacy@K12.com), as applicable. Please be advised that if your children are enrolled in a K¹² virtual program, the deletion of certain of your personal information may result in your children no longer being able to be enrolled in such program or utilize the OLS.

**Personal Information Provided by Parents About Children**

We understand that our student users who are under 13 years of age need special safeguards and privacy protection and it is our intent to fully comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). K¹² does not collect personal information from children online at any point. K¹² only receives personal information about your children directly from you when you enroll your children into a K¹² virtual program. You can review any personal information that K¹² has regarding your children by reviewing your online account information page on the OLS and/or making such a request in writing to [privacy@K12.com](mailto:privacy@K12.com). You can request to opt out your children from the use of personal information by K¹², affiliates and vendors acting on behalf of K¹², by making a request in writing to [privacy@K12.com](mailto:privacy@K12.com). Please be aware that if you make such a request to opt your children personal information out of use by K¹², affiliates or vendors acting on behalf of K¹², your children can no longer continue to be enrolled in a K¹² virtual program or utilize the OLS. Therefore, a request by you for K¹², affiliates, and vendors acting on behalf of K¹² to no longer use your children's personal information will terminate your children's participation in the K¹² virtual program in which they are enrolled and their use of the OLS.

However, K¹² will take steps to assure that the personal information is used in a manner consistent with the K¹² privacy policy under which it was collected. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act protects your children's educational records, in the event of such a transaction or transfer.

**Changes to the Privacy Policy**

We will occasionally amend this Privacy Policy to reflect company and customer feedback. We reserve the right to change, modify, add or remove portions of this policy at any time, and any changes will become effective immediately upon being posted unless we advise you otherwise.
