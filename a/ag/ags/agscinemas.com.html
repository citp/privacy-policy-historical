                      <h3 style="padding-top:15px;">Set up in the bustling southern metropolis of Chennai, AGS Cinemas is the latest venture of AGS entertainment.</h3>
                      <div class="clear"></div>
                      <p>After meeting with overwhelming success in the lines of film production and distribution, the AGS Group decided to make the move into the film exhibition business in 2008-09. Since then, it’s been a journey of identifying the right markets, properties and people to ensure Chennai and Tamil Nadu are given a refreshing cinema going experience.</p>
<p>AGS Cinemas is aiming for unmatched heights among sundry multiplex operators in Chennai. Bursting onto the scenario like a whiff of fresh air with 5 screens, all set to go live, and with 4 more screens in the offing, the company is proud to have signed up properties in the suburbs of the city including the much sought after Old Mahabalipuram Road (OMR). Just the impetus needed to spur the company into expanding its horizon even farther -changing the face of entertainment in Madurai, Coimbatore and Trichy, and that's just to start with. </p>
<p>AGS Entertainment is a venture of Kalpathi Investments Pvt. Limited, an investment firm established by the Kalpathi family in 2007. </p>
