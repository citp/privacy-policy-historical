<h1>Website Privacy policy - Aggreko plc</h1>
<p>The following sets out the Data Protection and Privacy Policy
(the "Policy") for Aggreko plc ("Aggreko") and the manner in which
Aggreko collects, uses and stores personal data and information
submitted to it by its subscribers and/or users of its website
("you") or ("your").&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This policy is to be read in conjunction with
Aggreko's legal statement and in accessing and using Aggreko's
website; you confirm that you have read and understand this Policy
and that you consent to the collection and use of your personal
information and details by Aggreko in accordance with this
Policy.&nbsp; If you wish at any time to withdraw your consent,
please notify the Data Protection Manager of Aggreko at the email
address set out in Section 9 of this Policy.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1. PRIVACY POLICY</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Aggreko is committed to protecting the privacy
of those who use its website, and the confidentiality of any
personal information or details submitted or provided to it by
you.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">2. DATA PROTECTION</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Aggreko is fully registered in the UK under
current data protection legislation.&nbsp; As a company registered
in England, Aggreko is obliged to comply with European and UK data
protection legislation in all its dealings with your personal
information and data.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This website uses Google Analytics to help
analyze how users use the site.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The tool uses "cookies," which are text files
placed on your computer, to collect standard Internet log
information and visitor behaviour information in an anonymous form.
The information generated by the cookie about your use of the
website, including IP address, is transmitted to Google. This
information is then used to evaluate visitors' use of the website
and to compile statistical reports on website activity for
Aggreko.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We will never (and will not allow any third
party to) use the statistical analytics tool to track or to collect
any Personally Identifiable Information of visitors to our site.
Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held
by Google. Neither we, nor Google will link, or seek to link, an IP
address with the identity of a computer user. We will not associate
any data gathered from this site with any Personally Identifiable
Information from any source, unless you explicitly submit that
information via a fill-in form on our website.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">For further information about cookies, visit
the Interactive Advertising Bureau (<a href="http://www.iab.net/">http://www.iab.net/</a>), an industry body
that develops standards and guidelines to support online business
processes. It has produced a series of web pages that explain how
cookies work and how they can be managed.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">3. AGGREKO'S WEBSITE</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Aggreko operates a global website.&nbsp; It
can be found at <a href="http://www.aggreko.com/"><strong>http://www.aggreko.com/</strong></a>
but can also be accessed in certain countries via national domain
name addresses.&nbsp; The Aggreko website is translated into
various languages for accessibility by users in certain
countries.&nbsp; Users should know, however, that Aggreko holds and
manages its website from the United States.&nbsp; This means that
information submitted to the Aggreko website will be transferred to
the United States as explained in paragraph 4 below.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">4. TRANSFER AND STORAGE OF INFORMATION OUTSIDE
THE EEA</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Aggreko is required to tell you if it
transfers or intends to transfer information which it holds about
you to countries outside the European Economic Area ("EEA").&nbsp;
Aggreko currently transfers information outside the EEA in the
following circumstances: (a) to its servers which are currently
located in the United States and which may in the future be located
in another country outside the EEA; and (b) to businesses in the
Aggreko group operating in countries outside the EEA for the
purposes set out in paragraph 3 below.&nbsp; Because Aggreko's
servers are located in the United States, the transfer of all of
Aggreko's data outside the EEA is necessary to enable Aggreko to
operate its website and to provide the products and information
offered.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">By submitting your personal information and
data to Aggreko, you consent to the transfer and storage of your
personal information and data outside the EEA as set out
herein.&nbsp; If you do not wish any of your personal data or
information to be stored or transferred outside the EEA, you may
withdraw your consent to such at any time by notifying Aggreko's
Data Protection Manager at the email address set out in Section 11
of this Policy.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">5. USE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Any personal information or details you
provide to Aggreko on this website, will be treated and kept in
confidence and will not be provided to anyone outside Aggreko's
group of companies, but may be used by Aggreko in the following
ways:-</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">5.1. Where you have provided your contact
details in order to receive information from Aggreko, Aggreko or
members of its group may use your contact information to let you
know about the products or services it offers, (including online
reports and newsletters) and about enhancements or changes to its
website or to enable Aggreko to respond to complaints or to form
management decisions regarding the future development of its
websites.&nbsp; If you indicated your consent on the e-mail
submission page, Aggreko may also use your personal data for future
e-mail mailings in relation to the subject of interest that you
identified on the email contact page or the needs analysis page, in
relation to support, and in relation to new products or services
that may be relevant to you.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">5.2. Where you have provided personal
information for the purposes of employment with Aggreko, Aggreko or
members of its group may use the information submitted on the
CV/resume page of this website for the purposes of processing your
application.&nbsp; Aggreko may also use your personal data to
notify you of job openings within Aggreko which may be of interest
to you.&nbsp; The information you provide on the application form
will be kept on file by Aggreko in our CV management system for a
period of six (6) months from the date of submission.&nbsp; If
after that period no job has been matched to the information you
provided, your personal information will be inactivated on our
database.&nbsp; If you are contacted directly by Aggreko's Human
Resources department after the date of submission of your CV,
Aggreko will be bound by the relevant legislation regarding the
retention of your CV on its database during the period when it is
considering hiring or employing you and if you are employed, during
your employment period.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If you initially agree to Aggreko's use and
storage of your personal information in accordance with this
Section 5, but later wish to withdraw consent, you may unsubscribe
at any time by notifying Aggreko's Data Protection Manager at the
email address set out in Section 11 of this Policy.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">6. SECURITY</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Aggreko has put in place measures to ensure
the security of information it collects and stores about you, and
will use its reasonable endeavours to protect your personal data
from unauthorised disclosure and/or access including through the
use of network and database security measures, but it cannot
guarantee the security of any data it collects and stores.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">7. HYPERLINKS</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Where Aggreko's website provides links to
other websites, it is not responsible for the data protection
policies of such other websites, and you should check the privacy
policies of such other websites if you have any concerns about
them.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">8. RIGHT OF ACCESS</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Under the Data Protection Act 1998, you have
the right at any time in writing to request access to any personal
information or details which Aggreko holds about you.&nbsp; Aggreko
shall comply with your request, in accordance with its obligations
under the Act, provided you have paid to Aggreko the necessary
access fee and Aggreko is satisfied as to your identity.&nbsp; If
after accessing such information you believe any of the personal
data or information that Aggreko holds about you is incorrect,
please provide Aggreko with your correct details and information by
contacting Aggreko's Data Protection Manager at the e-mail address
set out in Section 11 of this Policy.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">9. LEGAL OBLIGATIONS</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Aggreko may have obligations under certain
legislation to check the identity of users of its website and in
such circumstances it may need to make enquiries and obtain
information from you for that purpose.&nbsp; You confirm that all
information you supply to Aggreko will be accurate and you accept
and agree that Aggreko may pass on such information as it considers
necessary to comply with any legal/reporting obligations it has or
may have from time to time.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">10. CHANGES TO THE POLICY</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Aggreko may from time to time post changes to
the Policy. In such instances, Aggreko will post such changes on
this page of its website and Aggreko would invite you to review the
Policy from time to time in order to keep abreast of any changes to
it.</p>
