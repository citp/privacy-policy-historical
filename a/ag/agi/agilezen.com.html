    <div class="article">

  <div><p>Rally Software Development Corp. ("Rally") has created this
privacy statement ("Statement") in order to demonstrate our
commitment to customer privacy. Privacy on the Rally web site (the
"Site") is of great importance to us. Because we gather important
information from our visitors and customers, we have established
this Statement as a means to communicate our information gathering
and dissemination practices. We reserve the right to change this
Statement and will provide notification of the change at least
thirty (30) business days prior to the change taking effect.</p>
<h2>Collected Information</h2>
<p>We require customers who register to use the services
("Services") offered on our Site to give us contact information,
such as their name and e-mail address, and billing information,
such as their credit card number. Rally uses the information that
we collect to set up Services for individuals and their
organizations. We may also use the information to contact customers
to further discuss customer interest in our company, the Services
that we provide, and to send information regarding our company or
partners, such as promotions and events. Customers are invited to
receive periodic communication via email by providing an email
address. Customer email addresses and any personal customer
information will not be distributed or shared with any third
parties other than Rally employees, consultants and
representatives. Customers can opt out of being contacted by us, or
receiving such information from us, at any time by un-checking the
receive email announcements checkbox on the Settings page.</p>
<p>Except as we explicitly state at the time we request
information, or as provided for in the AgileZen Terms of Service or
this Privacy Statement, we do not disclose to any third-party the
information provided. All financial and billing information that we
collect through the Site is used solely to check the qualifications
of prospective customers and to bill for Services. This billing
information is not used by Rally for marketing or promotional
purposes. Rally uses a third-party intermediary to manage the
credit card processing. This intermediary is solely a link in the
distribution chain, and is not permitted to store, retain, or use
the information provided, except for the sole purpose of credit
card processing. Other third parties, such as content providers,
may provide content on the Site but they are not permitted to
collect any information nor does Rally share any user information
with these parties.</p>
<p>Customers of the Service will be using the Site to host data and
information ("Data"). Rally will not review, share, distribute,
print, or reference any such Data except as provided in the
AgileZen Terms of Service, or as may be required by law. Individual
records may at times be viewed or accessed only for the purpose of
resolving a problem, support issue, or suspected violation of the
AgileZen Terms of Service, or as may be required by law. Of course,
customers are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and
security of their user registration and password.</p>
<p>Rally may also collect certain information from visitors to and
customers of the Site, such as Internet addresses. This information
is logged to help diagnose technical problems, and to administer
our Site in order to constantly improve the quality of the Service.
We may also track and analyze non-identifying and aggregate usage
and volume statistical information from our visitors and customers
and provide such information to third parties.</p>
<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>When you interact with the Site we strive to make that
experience easy and meaningful. When you come to our Site, our Web
server sends a cookie to your computer. Cookies are files that Web
browsers place on a computer's hard drive and are used to tell us
whether customers and visitors have visited the Site
previously.</p>
<p>Standing alone, cookies do not identify you personally. They
merely recognize your browser. Unless you choose to identify
yourself to Rally, you remain anonymous to Rally. Cookies come in
two flavors: session and persistent-based. Session cookies exist
only during an online session. They disappear from your computer
when you close your browser software or turn off your computer.
Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you've closed your
browser or turned off your computer. They include such information
as a unique identifier for your browser.</p>
<p>Rally uses session cookies containing encrypted information to
allow the system to uniquely identify you while you are logged in.
This information allows Rally to process your online transactions
and requests. Session cookies help us make sure you are who you say
you are after you've logged in and are required in order to use the
Rally application. Rally uses persistent cookies, that only Rally
can read and use, to identify the fact that you are a Rally
customer or prior Rally Site visitor (whatever the case may be). We
are especially careful about the security and confidentiality of
the information stored in persistent cookies. For example, we do
not store account numbers or passwords in persistent cookies. Users
who disable their Web browsers' ability to accept cookies will be
able to browse our Site but will not be able to successfully use
our service.</p>
<h2>Third-Party Sites</h2>
<p>The Site contains links to other web sites. Rally is not
responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these other
web sites. Customers and visitors will need to check the policy
statement of these others web sites to understand their policies.
Customers and visitors who access a linked site may be disclosing
their private information. It is the responsibility of the user to
keep such information private and confidential.</p>
<h2>Security</h2>
<p>Our Site has security measures in place to help protect against
the loss, misuse, and alteration of the Data under our control. If
your AgileZen plan supports it, Secure Socket Layer (SSL)
technology is used to protect information using both server
authentication and data encryption to help ensure that Data is
safe, secure, and available only to you. Critical information such
as your password and credit card number are always encrypted using
SSL, regardless of whether your plan lists SSL as a feature. Rally
also implements an advanced security method based on dynamic data
and encoded session identifications, and hosts the Site in a secure
server environment that uses a firewall and other advanced
technology to prevent interference or access from outside
intruders. Finally, Rally provides unique user names and passwords
that must be entered each time a customer logs on. These safeguards
help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and
ensure the appropriate use of Data.</p>
<h2>Correcting &amp; Updating Your Information</h2>
<p>You can update your contact information at any time by accessing
the Settings page after you log in. From your dashboard, you can
also update your billing information by clicking the Change Billing
button on the account you would like to update. If you would like
to discontinue service, you can do so by clicking the Cancel button
on the account you wish to cancel.</p>
<h2>Additional Information</h2>
<p>Questions regarding this Statement or the practices of this Site
should be directed to Rally's Security Administrator by e-mailing
such questions to <a href="mailto:security@rallydev.com">security@rallydev.com</a>.</p></div>
