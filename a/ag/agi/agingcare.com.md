**General**  
This Privacy Policy applies to the Agingcare.com website (the "Site") which is operated by AgingCare, LLC ("AgingCare," "us," "our," "we"). The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to inform you about the types of information we gather about you when you visit our Site, how we may use that information, and how we disclose it to non-affiliated third parties including, but not limited to, senior housing and care providers, advertisers and others who have contracted with us (“Third Parties”). By using this Site, you consent to the practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you have questions about this Privacy Policy or the protection of your personal information on our Site, please contact us at [info@AgingCare.com](mailto:info@AgingCare.com). In addition to this Privacy Policy, our services to you are governed by our Terms of Use Agreement. If you do not consent to the provisions set forth in this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use, do not use this Site.

We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally to reflect changes in our services and policies. When we post changes to this Privacy Policy, we also will revise the "last updated" date at the top of the Privacy Policy. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to be informed of how we are protecting your information.

AgingCare provides Personal Information and Non-Personal Information (as these terms are described below) collected on the Site to Third Parties. The privacy policy of Third Parties govern the privacy and data collection of Personal Information by Third Parties including information submitted to Third Parties from this Site. You should review the privacy policy of Third Parties when you visit their site. The provision of your information to Third Parties does not constitute an endorsement of the services of Third Parties by AgingCare. Before working with any Third Parties you should conduct your own investigation of such Third Parties. Your use of Third Parties service is at your own risk.

**Information That We Collect**  
Information we may collect when you visit our Site falls into two broad categories: personal information, and aggregate or non-personal information. "Personal Information" is information that can be used to identify or contact you, such as your name, e-mail address, mailing address, phone number, zip code, credit card number, personally identifiable information, health information, general financial information and any other information provided by or for you, and/or provided by any other person for whom you may be seeking senior housing and/or care services. "Non-Personal Information" is information that does not identify you, and may include, for example, statistical information concerning the web pages on our Site that users most frequent. Our Privacy Policy governs both categories of information, as detailed below.

**Personal Information**  
We may collect and store Personal Information when you use our Site. We may use Personal Information to provide you with services you have requested from us and to provide information to Third Parties who may provide services to you.

Registration Information.To obtain certain materials from our Site, we ask that you become a registered user. Our registration forms will specify the information that you must provide in order to use the particular feature, and the information that you may, at your option, choose to provide or withhold. When you register at our Site, we will use your email address to identify you when providing you access to associated services and materials. When you revisit our Site, your email address will provide this same access to you – or to others you allow to use your email account. You should refrain from providing others with access to your email account or our Site, if you would prefer that they not access the "registration only" portions of our Site. 

Surveys and Questionnaires.If you choose to participate in surveys or questionnaires which from time to time we may post at Agingcare.com, we may ask that, in addition to providing your responses, you also provide contact and other Personal Information. If we link, or combine in any way your responses with your Personal Information, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information under our Privacy Policy. If we separate your responses from, and they are independent of any Personal Information, such that Third Parties reviewing your responses would be unable to link the responses to you or your practice, the responses will be treated as Non-Personal Information under our Privacy Policy. 

Third Party Service Providers.We may disclose, sell or share Personal Information to with Third Parties in order to provide you with the services you have requested. The Third Parties may contact you directly by email, telephone, text, regular mail, in person visits or other means. We do not control how these Third Parties use or disclose your Personal Information. 

Email and Other Direct Communications.You may communicate with us or request information from us, post comments, or provide us with comments and feedback concerning our Agingcare.com Site generally. By communicating with us in these ways, you may provide us with your email address, and other Personal Information. We will handle information that you provide in this manner in accordance with our Privacy Policy for Personal Information. 

**Non-Personal Information**  
We may also collect non-personal information from our online visitors, such as demographic information (your age, gender, income, education, profession, etc.). Non-personal information may also include technical information including your browser type, areas of the Site visited, date and time of access, host or service provided information, and identification of the referring site. If you enable the collection of location information on your device, then we may collect information about your actual location, such as your mobile device’s GPS coordinates. We also may use other technologies to determine your location (such as through the location of nearby Wi-Fi access points or cell towers), or obtain your location information from Third Parties.

When you browse our Site, the choices you make may provide information concerning your interests, and concerning the appeal and efficacy of associated Site features. Information concerning our visitors' activities at Agingcare.com – which pages they visit, and how long they view these pages, for example – is Non-Personal Information. This information does not identify a particular user, but does provide potentially useful data concerning our users' preferences and the efficacy and interest of our Site's features. The manner in which we collect Non-Personal Information is set out below.

Cookies. We collect Non-Personal Information about your use of our Site through cookies and similar Internet technologies. "Cookies" are small text files that a web site can use to recognize repeat users, to facilitate the user's ongoing access to and use of the site, and to compile aggregate data to improve the site and focus advertising. Cookies work as follows: a web site will send a cookie to your browser that uniquely associates your computer with information stored at the site. Your browser places the cookie in its cookies file. When you next access that site on your computer, the site recognizes the cookie, makes the stored information available, and adds new information based on the present visit. 

Disabling Cookies. You may choose not to allow us to collect information in this manner, through cookies. If you wish, you can set your browser software to reject cookies, and most browsers provide instructions for disabling the cookies feature in their "Help" section. Because cookies can be used to provide certain functionality, if you disable your browser’s cookies feature, certain elements of our Site may be unavailable to you. 

Addresses. A so-called "Internet Protocol" (IP) address is associated with your computer's connection to the Internet. We use your computer's IP address to maintain contact with you as you navigate through our Site. We also may use your computer’s IP address to provide you with personalized content. Similar to cookies, your computer's IP address by itself does not identify you personally. We treat IP addresses, therefore, as NonPersonal Information, as provided below. 

Advertisers' Collection of Information. From time to time, we may participate in, partner with, or use advertising networks, such as Third Parties, agencies, technology vendors and research firms who may serve advertisements to you on our Site or manage our advertising on our Site. With Internet technology, it is possible for advertisers, as well as site hosts, to collect information through the use of cookies and other technologies, such as so-called "clear GIF" files.
