**E-mail Address**  
If you should provide Edentity with your email address as part of a subscription or email newsletter sign-up, we will never provide that email address directly to third-party advertisers unless it is clearly mentioned at the time of sign-up or unless you directly provide us with permission to do so. We will deliver email newsletters until you request to unsubscribe or the newsletters are discontinued by us. You will always have the opportunity to unsubscribe and opt-out of future emails at your discretion. Any information submitted to Edentity is kept completely confidential and will not be shared or sold.

The customer's contact information is also used to get in touch with the customer when necessary and will not be shared with other companies without permission. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings. Every newsletter sent by Edentity has an unsubscribe link at the bottom of the letter. Simply click on this link to defer future mailings. Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. This information is never shared with advertisers or other companies. We use this data to tailor our visitor's experience at our site, showing them content which we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences.
