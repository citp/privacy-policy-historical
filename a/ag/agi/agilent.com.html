Cookies allow a web application to respond to you as an individual, but without the need to identify you explicitly. Session cookies are destroyed when you terminate your browsing session by shutting down your browser. Stored cookies often have a predetermined expiration date after which they disappear from your hard drive. Cookies can be removed explicitly through functionality built into most web browsers. You may also set your web browser (e.g. Microsoft Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator) to notify you of cookie placement requests, ask for permission to accept them, or decline cookies completely.

To facilitate the analysis, an ID is assigned to help us uniquely identify you each time you return to our web site. One of the major concerns about stored cookies is the fear that they contain personal information and information identifying you that could be accessed by other web sites. Agilent only stores a randomly chosen unique ID number and a context, both of which are meaningless to others, but help us uniquely identify you.</p>
