   Agisoft. Therefore, Agisoft processes your personal data for the performance of the
   contract and in order to take steps prior to entering into a contract. Agisoft collects your
   identification data, contact data, product related information and payment details in order
   to provide you the software and related services (for example customer support).
    Furthermore, the processing might be necessary for compliance with legal obligations to
    which Agisoft is subject. For example, Agisoft is required to organise the accounting and
    financial reporting.
    Agisoft will also process your personal data if the processing is necessary for the
    purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by Agisoft. In every such case Agisoft will
    consider whether such interests might be overridden by the interests or fundamental

    interest to process your data to help with fraud identification and prevention.
    Agisoft can process your personal data if you have given consent to the processing of
    your personal data for one or more specific purposes. For example, you can choose
    whether you send to Agisoft the Software error related data or not. You have the right to
