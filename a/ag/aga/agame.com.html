    <strong>PRIVACY POLICY</strong>
</p>

<p>
    This privacy policy (hereafter referred to as the "Privacy Policy") is applicable to our websites and to all games
    and other activities that are
    offered by us on or through our websites. (Our websites, all the web pages that are part of the websites, and such
    games and activities are hereafter
    collectively referred to as the "Websites.") SPIL GAMES BV, having its registered office at Arendstraat 23, 1223 RE,
    Hilversum, the Netherlands
    (hereafter referred to as "SPIL"), is the responsible party as referred to in the Dutch Personal Data Protection Act
    (Wet Bescherming
    Persoonsgegevens). SPIL may use affiliates' or reputable third parties' services for the processing of personal data
    collected on or through the
    Websites. By using or accessing our Websites, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>1.&nbsp; </strong>
    <strong>About Our Websites</strong>
</p>

<p>
    1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Websites offer a diverse, current, and exciting mix of online games created by SPIL, as
    well as games created by independent
    developers and SPIL partners. Players can access our Websites to play games without registering; however, they may
    choose to register to create a
    public or semi-public profile and to save games, high scores, and comments on this profile. Also, visitors to the
    Websites will be able to rate games
    and browse for the newly added, top-rated, and most-popular games.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>2.&nbsp; </strong>
    <strong>The Information We Collect</strong>
</p>

<p>
    The information that our Websites collect includes (among others) the following:
</p>

<p>
    <strong>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
    <strong>IP address, Cookies, and Web Beacons</strong>
</p>

<p>
    2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you visit our Websites, our servers automatically save your computer's IP address. IP
    addresses will be collected, along
    with information about the actual web pages that you visit on the Websites. If you arrive at the Websites via a link
    from another website, the URL of
    the linking website and the URL of any website that you link to next will also be collected.
</p>

<p>
    2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, we store certain information from your browser, using "cookies." A cookie is a
    piece of data stored on the user's
    computer and is tied to information about the user. SPIL may use cookies, web beacons (web bugs), or similar
    technologies to enhance and personalize
    your experience on the Websites, including the following:
</p>

<p>
    (a) to operate and improve offerings on the Websites;
</p>

<p>
    (b) to help authenticate you when you are on the Websites;
</p>

<p>
    (c) to remember your preferences and registration information, as applicable;
</p>

<p>
    (d) to present and help measure and research the effectiveness of SPIL's offerings, advertisements, and email
    communications; and
</p>

<p>
    (e) to customize the content and advertisements provided to you through the Websites.
</p>

<p>
    2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SPIL may also use ad network providers to help present advertisements on the Websites. These
    ad network providers use cookies,
    web beacons, or similar technologies to help the presenting, better targeting, and measuring of the effectiveness of
    their advertisements, using data
    gathered over time and across their networks of web pages to determine or predict the characteristics and
    preferences of their audiences. SPIL offers
    some services in connection with other websites. Personal information that you provide to those sites may be sent to
    SPIL in order to deliver these
    services. SPIL processes such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
</p>

<p>
    2.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SPIL may also use third-party payment service providers ("PSP"), offering payment transaction
    services to SPIL in order to sell a
    product or service through the Websites. Whenever you buy something from the Websites (e.g., a virtual game item or
    a subscription for a game
    download), the information that you provide to the PSP is subject to their privacy policies, not ours. You
    explicitly consent that SPIL may provide
    personal information collected from you to a PSP for the purpose of the offering of the payment-transaction service
    whenever you buy something from the
    Website(s) and that such PSP may use such data for (statistical) analysis of payment transactions. SPIL shall be
    allowed to notify a PSP regarding a
    user that engages in (or who a party believes has engaged in) any activity that is illegal, that violates any
    person's rights, or that led to such
    user's suspension or termination of use of the Websites.
</p>

<p>
    2.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SPIL may share demographic information (certain anonymous information about you as a user,
    such as age and country) with certain
    ad network providers to help them deliver more relevant advertisements through their ad networks. The use of
    cookies, web beacons, or similar
    technologies by such third parties as ad network providers is subject to their own privacy policies, not this
    Privacy Policy.
</p>

<p>
    2.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, but you can (re)set your browser to refuse
    all cookies, or to indicate when a cookie is sent. You can opt out of receiving cookies from certain third-party
    advertising networks by resetting your browser. You may also use the following link to the Network Advertising
    Initiatives cookie <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices" target="_blank">opt-out page</a> or the
    link to the <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com" target="_blank">European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA)
    opt-out page</a>. 

    However, keep in mind that some features and services may not function properly if cookies are disabled.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
    <strong>Personal Data, Including Your E-mail Address</strong>
</p>

<p>
    2.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You may choose to register with us for a better game experience and/or to create a public or
    semi-public profile for
    participating in our social gaming network. This includes, for example: overviews of high scores, achievements
    listings, and individual game
    recommendations on the Websites. When you register with us, you provide us with certain personal information, such
    as a username, date and month of
    birth, and your email address. The information you disclose in that respect may also become publicly accessible. We
    provide you with privacy settings
    that restrict other users from accessing your information; namely, our network architecture and your privacy
    settings allow you to make informed
    choices about who has access to your information. We allow you to choose the information you provide to friends and
    networks through our Websites. When
    your privacy settings permit it, other users may be able to see and supplement your profile (e.g., by posting
    comments).
</p>

<p>
    2.8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you decide to disclose information in a public venue or in games, we will consider that
    information as part of the public
    domain. This information will be accessible to any person who uses the Websites.
</p>

<p>
    2.9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We only collect email addresses that were provided to us directly by you. Your email address
    will only be used for the following
    purposes:
</p>

<p>
    (i) the promotion of (new) games;
</p>

<p>
    (ii) service emails (on updates, new design, new features, etc.);
</p>

<p>
    (iii) administrative purposes, such as notification of violation of our <u>Terms of Use;</u>
</p>

<p>
    (iv) delivering messages you have allowed us to pass on (e.g., from other people in your social network).
</p>

<p>
    2.10&nbsp; Without your approval, we will not:
</p>

<p>
    (a) make your email address visible on the Website;
</p>

<p>
    (b) use your email address for purposes other than those described in article 2.9 hereof;
</p>

<p>
    (c) transfer your email address or other personal information to third parties, except in those limited cases as
    described in this Privacy Policy.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>
    <strong>Combination of Personal Data</strong>
</p>

<p>
    2.11&nbsp; For optimizing our services and the Websites, and for the purposes mentioned in this article 2, we are
    entitled to combine your personal
    data (including your email address, as applicable) with other information about you collected by or provided to us.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>3.&nbsp; </strong>
    <strong>To Whom Does SPIL Provide This Information?</strong>
</p>

<p>
    3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SPIL may provide information to any party whose services it engages for the purposes of its
    normal operations (for example, those
    partners who assist us by providing technical or operational facilities for the Websites and so forth). We may also
    supply information to other parties
    if we are required to do so by law or by a ruling handed down by a court of law. SPIL does not provide personal
    details to other parties for
    commercial, advertising, or marketing purposes, except if you explicitly give us permission to do so, or if doing so
    is part of a specific program or
    operation for which you have registered. In such case, you may withdraw your permission at any time.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>4.&nbsp; </strong>
    <strong>Why Do We Collect Information?</strong>
</p>

<p>
    4.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We use personal details and other information to maintain the general and personified content
    and functionality of the Websites.
    In addition, we use personal details to make it possible to accommodate your requests, and so that we are able to
    provide you with service when using
    (one of) our Websites and for the purposes set out elsewhere in this Privacy Policy.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>5.&nbsp; </strong>

</p>

<p>
    5.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your personal data will be stored by SPIL.

    collected by us by clicking on the
    appropriate link in the personal profile.
</p>

<p>
    5.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In general, if you wish to have access to your personal data to correct or delete the

    you, please send a written request to SPIL GAMES BV, Arendstraat 23, 1223 RE, Hilversum, the Netherlands, detailing

</p>

<p>
    <strong>6.&nbsp; </strong>
    <strong>Security</strong>
</p>

<p>
    6.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You post personal data and any other content on the Websites at your own risk and in
    accordance with article 7 ("Your
    Responsibilities") of the Terms of Use. Although we allow you to set privacy options that limit access to such
    personal data and other content, please
    be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We cannot control the actions of other users with
    whom you choose to share your profile
    and information. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that any content you post on the Websites will not be
    viewed by unauthorized persons. We are
    not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Websites. You
    understand and acknowledge that, even
    after removal, copies of personal data or content may remain viewable in cached and archived pages, or if other
    users have copied or stored your
    personal data or content.
</p>

<p>
    6.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have implemented appropriate measures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, to
    maintain data security, and to
    correctly use the information we collect online. Your personal data visible on the Websites (such as any public
    comments posted by you and/or any data
    in your profile) are accessible to third parties, and you acknowledge and agree that such third parties are able to
    copy such information to their own
    websites or other locations. <strong></strong>
</p>

<p>
    6.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your personal data will only be stored for a period necessary for your uses of the Websites
    for the purposes as described in this
    Privacy Policy.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>7.&nbsp; </strong>
    <strong>Miscellaneous</strong>
</p>

<p>
    7.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We reserve the right to amend our Privacy Policy. Amendments will be effective as of the
    moment of publication on the Websites.
    You should check the Websites regularly for amendments.
</p>

<p>
    7.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Internet is a global environment, and using the Internet necessarily involves the
    collection and processing of personal data
    on an international basis. Therefore, by using (one or more of) our Websites, you acknowledge and agree to our
    processing of personal data in this way.
</p>

<p>
    7.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Websites may contain links to other websites. We are not responsible for the privacy
    practices of other websites. We
    encourage users to be aware when they leave our site to read the privacy statements of each and every website that
    collects personally identifiable
    information. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by us.
