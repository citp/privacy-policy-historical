You are under no obligation to provide your personal information to us.  However, without receiving certain information from you, we may not be able to provide our services to you.

#### Who do we disclose your personal information to?

We disclose your personal information for the purpose for which we collect it (for example, to assess your subscription application for the V8 SuperView service or provide you with access to the V8 SuperView service) or where you have consented to us disclosing this information.

However, we cannot guarantee the security of any personal information transmitted to us via the Internet. 

#### Can you access the personal information that we hold about you?

Under the Act, you have a right to access your personal information that is collected and held by us.  If at any time you would like to access or change the personal information we hold about you, or you would like more information on our approach to privacy, please let us know.

To obtain access to your personal information, we may request that you provide us with proof of your identity.  This is necessary to ensure that personal information is provided only to the correct individuals and that the privacy of others is protected.
