Also, other Visa products and websites have their own separate privacy policies. The Visa.com privacy policy does not apply to V.me.</p>

<h2>How we share Personal Information</h2>

<ul>
<li>With merchants you pay through V.me to complete your transactions, resolve disputes, help prevent fraud and provide customer service.

<li>To comply with law or other legal obligations such as responding to subpoenas</li>
<li>To protect our rights or property, or that of our users </li>
<li>To investigate, prevent, or take action regarding potential or suspected illegal activities, fraud, threats to the personal safety of any person, or violations of the V.me terms and conditions </li>
<li>With other companies that are owned by Visa as allowed by law</li>
<li>With a purchaser of Visa (or the majority of its assets)</li>
<li>With your consent</li>
</ul>
<h2>Your Choices</h2>

<p>You can close your V.me account by following the instructions in the Help section of the V.me website. Once your account is closed you will no longer be able to access your account online.

<h2>How you can access and edit your Personal Information</h2>
<p>You can review and edit your Personal Information at any time by logging in to your account.</p>
<h2>How we protect your Personal Information</h2>
<p>Visa uses firewalls and Secure Socket Layers to help protect the Personal Information we collect from you when it is being communicated to us.  Our policies restrict access to Personal Information to those employees and service providers who need to know the information in order to provide you this service. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with applicable privacy and data security laws and regulations.</p>
<h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>We may change this privacy policy at any time by posting an updated privacy policy to the site.  Changes will be effective when you accept the updated privacy policy or 30 days after the “Last Updated” date in the updated privacy policy, whichever comes first.  If you don't affirmatively accept the updated privacy policy, your use of V.me after the 30 day posting period means you are subject to the updated privacy policy.</p>
<h2>How to contact Visa regarding your privacy concerns and questions</h2>
<p>If you have questions or comments about our privacy practices, please email us at askvisausa@visa.com or write to us at: Visa U.S.A. Inc. P.O. Box 194607, San Francisco, CA 94119-4607 Attention: Global Privacy Office</p>
