Cookies are small text files that are sent to a user’s browser by the website visited or when an email is opened. They are used for numerous different purposes, including to remember an individual’s actions and preferences (for example, login data, language, font size, other display settings, etc.), so that the individual does not have to configure them again when visiting again the website, or when moving from page to page within a website. Some operations within a website may not be able to be performed without the use of cookies which, in certain cases, are technically necessary for operation of the website. They may also contain a unique ID code that allows tracking a user’s browsing activities within a website, for statistical or advertising purposes.

Cookies are often divided in two categories, “session cookies” which are automatically deleted when you close your browser, and “persistent cookies” which remain on your device until their pre-set expiration period expires.

When browsing a website, you may receive first party cookies, which are sent by the website or third party cookies, which are sent from websites or web servers other than the website being visited.

### B – Individuals Located in the EEA

Individuals **located in the EEA may have the right to prohibit the use of certain cookies.**

For some types of cookies, the consent of the website user may not be necessary. This is the case for “technical cookies” which are only used to send messages through an electronic communication network, or are needed to provide the user with the service that the user requests: this includes browsing or session cookies, which are used to allow the user to login, and functional cookies, which are used to remember choices made by a user when accessing the website, such as language, fonts, settings, or to remember the products selected for purchase. These cookies are essential for the proper operation of the functions offered by the website.

Some cookies, known as “profiling cookies” are used to create profiles of users, and to send advertising messages to users in line with the user’s preference that may be inferred from the user’s browsing the website. Certain laws, such as laws that apply to individuals in the EEA, may require the affirmative consent of users.

### C – How We Obtain your Consent

We are working on updating our Website to present you with a notice informing you that the Website uses cookies, in accordance with applicable law. That notice will include a link to this Cookie Policy. If the notice contains a request to agree to the use of our profiling cookies, we will use these cookies if you express your consent by clicking on the appropriate box. If you decide to continue through our website after being presented with that notice, without clicking on the appropriate box, we will assume that we do not have your consent to set cookies as described in this Cookie Policy.

Until we have updated the Website to present you with that notice, please send an email to us at [support@vydia.com](mailto:support@vydia.com), stating that you do not consent to our use of the cookies as described in this Cookie Policy.

We also use analytics cookies, which allow us to understand how individuals use the Website and to track traffic to and from the Website, and profiling cookies to observe the user’s activities on the Website to infer the user’s preferences, and send advertising messages in line with these preferences.

### E – Analytics Cookies

We use Google Analytics and Mixpanel, online, web-based, and mobile-based analytics services provided respectively by Google, Inc. ( **“Google”** ) and Mixpanel, Inc.

You can opt-out of Mixpanel’s automatic collection and retention of your data when you use the Services by visiting <https://mixpanel.com/optout>, however, if you get a new computer, install a new browser, erase or otherwise alter you browser’s cookie file (including upgrading certain browsers) you may need to follow the Mixpanel opt-out process again to ensure your opt-out remains valid.

Information collected by the Google Analytics cookie is transmitted to, and stored by, Google in accordance with its privacy practices.
