When you provide personal information through our website, the information may be sent to servers located in the United States and other countries around the world.

  * **Information you provide.** We may collect and store any personal information you enter on our website or provide to us in some other manner, including personal information that may be contained in any video, message or other submission you upload or post to the website.

We also may request information about your interests and activities, your gender and age, and other demographic information.

Similarly, if you use our website to upload, share and/or distribute content (including videos, comments, messages or other submissions), and such content contains personal information about others, such information may be stored in order to allow for such uploading, sharing and/or distribution.

Unless expressly stated otherwise, our website does not provide any personal information to these third parties. This information allows them to deliver targeted advertisements and gauge their effectiveness. Some of these third-party advertising companies may be advertising networks that are members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offers a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies ([www.networkadvertising.org](http://www.networkadvertising.org/)).

**With Whom We Share Your Information**

We want you to understand when and with whom we may share personal or other information we have collected about you or your activities on our website or while using our services.

Personal information. We do not share your personal information with others except as indicated below or when we inform you and give you an opportunity to [opt out](http://vyou.com/user/mysettings?t=tab3) of having your personal information shared. We may share personal information with:

  * **Authorized service providers:** We may share your personal information with our authorized service providers that perform certain services on our behalf. These services may include fulfilling orders, processing credit card payments, delivering packages, providing customer service and marketing assistance, performing business and sales analysis, supporting our website functionality, and supporting contests, sweepstakes, surveys and other features offered through our website.

    * In response to a subpoena or similar investigative demand, a court order, or a request for cooperation from a law enforcement or other government agency; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law. In such cases, we may raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us, in our sole discretion.
    * When we believe disclosure is appropriate in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing; to protect and defend the rights, property or safety of our company, our users, our employees, or others; to comply with applicable law or cooperate with law enforcement; or to enforce our website terms and conditions or other agreements or policies.
    * In connection with a substantial corporate transaction, such as the sale of our business, a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy.



Any third parties to whom we may disclose personal information may have their own privacy policies which describe how they use and disclose personal information. Those policies will govern use, handling and disclosure of your personal information once we have shared it with those third parties as described in this Privacy Policy. If you want to learn more about their privacy practices, we encourage you to visit the websites of those third parties. These entities or their servers may be located either inside or outside the United States.

**Aggregated and non-personal information.** We may share aggregated and non-personal information we collect under any of the above circumstances. We may also share it with third parties to develop and deliver targeted advertising on our websites and on websites of third parties. We may combine non-personal information we collect with additional non-personal information collected from other sources. We also may share aggregated information with third parties, including advisors, advertisers and investors, for the purpose of conducting general business analysis. For example, we may tell our advertisers the number of visitors to our website and the most popular features or services accessed. This information does not contain any personal information and may be used to develop website content and services that we hope you and other users will find of interest and to target content and advertising.

**Notice Regarding User-Generated-Content**

**We do not monitor, screen, or otherwise filter user submissions to the website, nor do we glean or otherwise scrape personal information from any such submissions; however, to the extent that any video, message or other user submission contains personal information (whether name, likeness, address, telephone number or otherwise, and whether such information pertains to the submitter or someone else), such personal information may be viewed by other users of the website.** See "User Submissions", below.

**Third-Party Websites**

There are a number of places on our website or through our services where you may click on a link to access other websites that do not operate under this Privacy Policy. For example, if you click on an advertisement or a search result on our website, you may be taken to a website that we do not control. These third-party websites may independently solicit and collect information, including personal information, from you and, in some instances, provide us with information about your activities on those websites. We recommend that you consult the privacy statements of all third-party websites you visit by clicking on the "privacy" link typically located at the bottom of the webpage you are visiting.

You will not be able to sign in to our website or access any of your personal information after you close your account. However, you can open a new account at any time. If you close your account, we may still retain certain information associated with your account for analytical purposes and recordkeeping integrity, as well as to enforce our terms and condition, collection of fees due, , take actions we deem necessary to protect the integrity of our website or our users, including the prevention of fraud, or take other actions otherwise permitted by law.

**Your Choices About Collection And Use Of Your Information**

  * You can choose not to provide us with certain information. To the extent you make such election, your choice may result in you being unable to use certain features of our website because such information may be required in order for you to register as a member; purchase services or products;, participate in a sweepstakes, survey, contest or promotion; ; ask a question; or initiate other transactions on our website.
  * You may be given a choice when you register on our website as to whether you want to receive newsletters about updates to products, special offers, email messages and/or or types of communications containing special distributions of content by us. At any time you can choose to no longer receive commercial or promotional emails or newsletters from us by clicking on the following link and entering the email address associated with your account: [click here](http://vyou.com/user/mysettings?t=tab3). You also will be given the opportunity, in any commercial e-mail that we send to you, to [opt out](http://vyou.com/user/mysettings?t=tab3) of receiving such messages in the future. It may take up to 10 days for us to process an opt-out request. We may send you other types of transactional and relationship e-mail communications, such as service announcements, administrative notices, and surveys, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them. Please note that, changing information in your account, or otherwise opting out of receipt of promotional email communications will only affect future activities or communications from us. If we have already provided your information to a third party (such as a credit card processing partner or an event provider) before you have changed your preferences or updated your information, you may have to change you preferences directly with that third party.



**Protective Measures We Take With Respect to Your Personal Information**

We take certain security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to help safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure. For example, only authorized employees are permitted to access personal information, and they may do so only for permitted business functions. In addition, we use encryption in the transmission of your sensitive personal information between your system and ours, and we use firewalls to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your personal information.

No system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, searches, or other communications will always remain secure. Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information and should avoid sending personal information through insecure email. Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission’s website at <http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm> for information about how to protect yourself against identity theft.

**User Submissions**

We may provide areas on our websites where you can post information about yourself and others and communicate with others; upload content (e.g. audio files, videos, pictures, blogs etc.); and post comments or reviews of content found on the Website. Such postings are governed by our [Terms and Conditions of Use](http://vyou.com/index/tos). In addition, such postings may appear when searches are executed on the subject matter of your posting or on other websites. Also, any voluntary disclosure by you of personal information on publicly-viewable web pageswill be publicly available and can be collected and used by others. For example, if you post your email address, you may receive unsolicited messages. We cannot control who reads your posting or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily post. We strongly urge you to use a high degree of discretion and caution with respect to your personal information. Once you have posted information, you may not be able to edit or delete such information.

To the extent that we determine such changes are reasonably likely to result in material changes in the way we collect, use, and/or share your personal information, we will notify you by sending an email to the email address you most recently provided us in your account, profile or registration (unless we do not have such an email address), and/or by prominently posting notice of the changes on our website.
