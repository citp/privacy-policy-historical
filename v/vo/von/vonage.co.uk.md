This Privacy Policy expresses our approach to complying with the Data Protection laws that apply in the UK, and applies to the collection of your Personal Information via the Site.

You must not register with Vonage or sign up to any Vonage service available via this Site if you do not accept this Privacy Policy and the Vonage Terms of Service.

### 2\. Your Personal Information and the purposes for which information is used

As a general principle, Vonage will identify the purposes for which personal information is collected at or before the time the information is collected.

_What information will Vonage collect_ : When registering with Vonage you must provide Vonage with the following personal information:

  1. your full name;
  2. your address;
  3. your email address;
  4. current phone number;
  5. credit card details;



Vonage may also collect Personal Information from such third parties as credit bureaus, employers or personal references or other third parties that represent that they have the right to disclose the information.

_Purposes_ : This information and any other information you provide to Vonage via the Site, email or telephone is required in order to provide you with Vonage's services and the relevant equipment required to use Vonage's services. Also to verify your credit status with third party credit agencies and to inform you of any new offers and services which may be of interest to you.

Vonage collects Personal Information only for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, including to provide service(s) and/or products to its Customers:

  1. to maintain commercial relations and to communicate with its Customers (which will include, but not be limited to: billing, collection, support, advertising, promotion, account and credit card verification);
  2. to evaluate Customers' financial status and eligibility for credit;
  3. to identify Customer needs and/or preferences;
  4. to meet legal and regulatory requirements;
  5. to administer and manage its business operations; and
  6. as otherwise required or permitted by law.



### 3\. Limiting use, disclosure and retention

_Sharing and use of Personal Information_ : The over-riding principles Vonage apply are these: 

  1. Vonage, and (where relevant) our credit card processing agents or other third parties we share your information with, will not supply your personal data to a third party for commercial exploitation - thus, you can rest assured that we will not sell the lists of our Customers' email addresses to a third party; and
  2. The only circumstances in which we will provide any of your personal data to a third party for non-commercial purposes are those contained in this Privacy Policy.



_Credit card information_ : There has been a lot of publicity about credit card security on the internet so Vonage has decided to operate a secure server, to process credit card payments. Vonage encrypts Customers' credit or debit card information and authorise payment directly. Vonage may transfer to, process and hold your credit card information in countries either within or outside the European Economic Area in connection with performing Vonage's duties.

_Changes in Vonage's business._ Personal Information may also be disclosed in connection with a sale, transfer or reorganisation of one or more of Vonage's businesses, in which case Vonage will require that any Personal Information will continue to be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy or as otherwise permitted by law.

Personal Information will not be used or disclosed for purposes other than those for which it was collected, except with the consent of you, the individual or as otherwise required or permitted by law. Personal Information will be retained only as long as necessary for the fulfilment of those identified purposes or as otherwise required or permitted by law.

Vonage may disclose a Customer's Personal Information to:

  1. another company for the provision of its services to that Customer;
  2. a person involved in the development, promotion, marketing or enhancement of Vonage services;
  3. a credit checking or collections agency;
  4. emergency services in an emergency situation;
  5. third party affiliates for administrative purposes (for example, Customer billing, support, marketing, etc.); and
  6. any other third party, upon receiving the consent of the Customer or as required by law.



Such disclosures may in some cases be to recipients outside of UK and European Economic Area.

Vonage will retain Personal Information that has been used to make a decision about an individual long enough to allow the individual access to the information after the decision has been made, and, in the event of an access request or a challenge, long enough to exhaust any recourse an individual may have under the law.

When Personal Information that previously has been collected is to be used for a purpose not previously identified, the new purpose will be identified prior to use. Unless otherwise permitted by applicable law, Vonage will obtain the consent of the individual before information is used for that new purpose.

Occasionally, Vonage will communicate to you special bonus and new product offers that we think may be of value to you. Vonage may retain third parties to assist it in marketing such new or additional Vonage products and services to our Customers (and for such purpose may share Personal Information with such third parties) but will not otherwise disclose or make available any Personal Information to any third parties seeking to market their products to Vonage's Customers.

All Vonage Customers have the right to choose not to participate in direct marketing of new products and services from Vonage. If you wish to opt-out of receiving targeted communications from Vonage in electronic, printed or verbal format (other than information included with your monthly bills), simply inform us in writing at Vonage: c/o Privacy Officer, **[privacyofficer@vonage.co.uk](mailto:privacyofficer@vonage.co.uk) **

The Site may provide hyperlinks, which are highlighted words or pictures within a hypertext document that may, when clicked, take you to a third party website not controlled by Vonage. Such hyperlinked third party websites may collect and disclose information in a different way to this Site. Vonage is not responsible for the collection, use, or disclosure of information collected through these third party web sites, and Vonage expressly disclaims any and all liability related to such collection, use, or disclosure.

### 4\. Consent to transfer of Personal Information Overseas

_Place of processing_ : The Personal Information held by Vonage is stored on and processed on computers situated in the United States and (for telephone support) the Philippines.

The knowledge and consent of you, the individual is normally required for the transfer of Personal Information to a destination outside the EEA, subject to certain exceptions. In certain circumstances, Personal Information can be transferred to a destination outside the EEA without the knowledge and consent of the individual.

Personal Information is transferred abroad for the purpose of performing contractual obligations owed by Vonage to you.

_Consent_ : Where required, Vonage will generally seek consent for the use or transfer the information overseas at the time of collection. In certain circumstances, consent with respect to use or disclosure may be sought after the information has been collected but before use (for example, when Vonage wants to use information for a purpose not previously identified).

You may withdraw consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions and reasonable notice. Vonage will inform you of the implications of such withdrawal. In order to withdraw consent, you must provide notice to Vonage in writing.

### 6\. Accuracy and removing your details

Personal Information will be updated as necessary for the purposes for which it is to be collected and used.

Vonage will not routinely update Personal Information unless such a process is necessary to fulfil the purposes for which the information was collected. Personal Information that is used on an ongoing basis, including information that is disclosed to third parties, will generally be accurate and up-to-date to the best of Vonage's knowledge.

### 7\. Safeguards and security

Vonage has invested and deployed a wide variety of technology and security features to ensure the privacy of personal and anonymous information collected by it. In addition, Vonage has implemented strict operations guidelines to safeguard Customer privacy at every level of its organisation. Unfortunately, no system is perfect; therefore, Vonage makes no representations or warranties with regard to the sufficiency of these security measures.

Vonage shall not be responsible for any actual, indirect or consequential damages (or any other damages or liability of any kind whatsoever, whether as a result of negligence or otherwise) that result from a lapse in compliance with this Privacy Policy because of a security breach or technical malfunction. Nothing in this Privacy Policy shall however limit or exclude Vonage's liability in respect of death or personal injury caused by its negligence or for fraud.

Vonage protects all Personal Information regardless of the format in which it is held. The methods of protection include:

  1. physical measures, such as restricted access to offices;
  2. organisational measures, such as security clearances and limiting access on a "need to know" basis;
  3. technological measures, such as the use of passwords and encryption.



### 8\. Accountability

Vonage is responsible for Personal Information under its control and has designated an individual or individuals who are accountable for the organisation's compliance with this Privacy Policy.

Vonage may charge a Â£10.00 fee to cover its costs in providing such data to you.

_Disclosure for legal reasons_ : Vonage reserves the right to communicate such of your Personal Information as it holds to third parties which seek the disclosure of it, and which make a legally compliant request for its disclosure. Vonage also reserves the right to communicate your Personal Information to the relevant authorities if we believe that you are involved in illegal activities or commit any breach of this Privacy Policy, which would justify such disclosure.
