    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>We promise to protect your privacy, according to your rights under the Data Protection Act. The only personal information that we will ever store is what you have voluntarily given to us.</p>

    <p>This website is intended for the use of consumers within the UK.</p>

    <h2>Why do we request personal information?</h2>

    <p>We process and store your personal information so that we can provide you with the services you have requested, such as information, email updates, questionnaires and competitions.</p>

    <p>VoucherHub or our service providers will ask for and store your personal information for the following purposes:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>To directly provide any services you have requested</li>
      <li>To enable third parties to process and manage your information so we can provide the services you have requested</li>
      <li>For security, administrative and legal purposes</li>
      <li>To update and enhance our website and the services we provide</li>
    </ol>

    <p>We will always tell you how we intend to use your personal information whenever we ask for it.</p>

    <h2>Your consent</h2>

    <p>By using our website, you agree to the collection and use of any information you choose to give us, for the purposes we describe above.</p>

    <p>Any personal information you give us will be used strictly in accordance with the Data Protection Act.</p>

    <p>All automated emails that we send include an unsubscribe option so you can opt out of further emails if you wish.</p>

    <p>You have the right to ask VoucherHub for a copy of any personal information we hold about you. The Data Protection Act stipulates that you must request this in writing, and that this may be subject to a fee of up to £10. The address to write to is: The VoucherHub Data Protection Officer, Stateless Systems, Level 4, 330 Little Collins Street, Melbourne, Victoria 3000, Australia.</p>

    <h2>What information do we collect?</h2>

    <p>So we can provide you with the services you have requested, we store information that you choose to give to us in two ways:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Directly from you by details that you enter into the VoucherHub system.</li>
      <li>Indirectly from you by information provided by you web browser and Internet Service Provider (see more information about cookies and IP addresses below).</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>What are cookies?</h2>

    <p>Our website instructs your web browser to store a small amount of data on your computer containing infomation about your visits to our site.  This information includes a unique identifier that is then sent back to us by your browser on subsequent visits.</p>

    <p>We use cookies to improve your experience of using our site by providing you with personalised content.</p>

    <p>Cookies also help to tell us how and when pages in our website are accessed and by whom.</p>

    <p>We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may set cookies and use this information to track your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.</p>

    <p>Cookie technology does not collect personal or identifiable information. Any information collected is in an aggregate, non-identifiable form. The use of cookies is an industry standard, and many major web sites use them to provide useful features for their customers.</p>

    <p>Each web site can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it. But (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a web site to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites.</p>

    <p>You can set your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is added.  You may disable cookies and still access our website but, if you reject all cookies, you might not be able to receive personalised content and your experience might not be as helpful as we'd like.</p>

    <h2>What is an IP address?</h2>

    <p>An IP Address is a code that identifies a particular computer on the Internet. Every computer, whether it is a web server or the computer you're using right now, requires an IP address to connect to the Internet and to allow for routing information from one computer to another over the Internet.</p>

    <p>Each time that you access our website, we store your IP address.  We may use this information to help improve the service that we provide.  For example, we may use IP address information to detect malicious attempts to disrupt our service.</p>

    <h2>Who else might see my personal information?</h2>

    <p>VoucherHub and our agents will not share your personal information with any other company.</p>

    <p>We will share your information when required to do so by relevant legislation, or court orders. And should VoucherHub's services be managed by another company at any point in the future, customer information may be deemed a transferable business asset.</p>

    <h2>What if this Privacy Policy changes?</h2>

    <p>VoucherHub may update this policy at any time. Please <a href="/contact">let us know</a> if you would like to be informed of any updates.</p>

    <h2>Links to other websites</h2>

    <p>We link to other websites for your convenience but these links are in no way an endorsement by VoucherHub. We aren’t responsible for the content of any linked websites, and we recommend that you check their privacy policies.</p>
