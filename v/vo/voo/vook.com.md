**TRACKING INFORMATION**

Tracking information is automatically collected about all visitors to our sites. This information consists of both individual and aggregated tracking information and is automatically gathered using "cookies." A cookie is a small data file containing information, such as a user's login name, that is written to the user's hard drive by a web server and used to track the pages visited.

We use cookies in several ways to track user behavior. Cookies store visitors' preferences and past activity in order to provide better service when visitors return. They are also used to customize the web page content on visitors' browser type or other information that the visitor sends. The information we gather on an individual basis is used for internal purposes only, such as accessing a member's account information. We also use tracking information on an aggregate basis, to track the readership of stories and usage of our products, to analyze traffic patterns on our sites, and to provide anonymous reporting of usage for internal and external clients. In all cases, cookies used by Vook are encoded and contain a unique digital signature to prevent tampering. They do not contain user passwords. We also employ technology that is commonly referred to as "action tags" (also known as "web beacons," "scripts" or "one pixel .gif files") to measure the effectiveness of our advertisements.

In addition to cookies placed by Vook or its agents, as described above, advertisers and third-party advertising vendors, including Google, that serve ads onto our web sites and in our apps and eBooks, and other third party partners may use their own cookies or other tracking technologies for advertising or other purposes. We cannot be responsible for the privacy policies or practices of any such advertisers and vendors. Additionally, third party advertising vendors, including Google, show our ads on sites on the Internet. These companies utilize certain technologies including cookies to deliver targeted advertisements and marketing messages and to collect information about your visit to our sites and other web sites. If you would like more information about this practice or to opt out of having this information used by companies that are part of the Network Advertising Initiative to provide targeted ads, please visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp.

You can control your browser's settings regarding cookies by selecting "Internet Options" or "Preferences" in the menu bar of your browser. This will allow you to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, have your browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or disable cookies altogether. However, because cookies allow you to easily navigate our web sites without having to constantly log in using your User Name and Password, we recommend that you leave them turned on.

  **USE OF THE INFORMATION**

  * If we sell or otherwise transfer substantially all of our assets related to any web site that we own or operate and any product or service that we offer. In that event, we will require such third party to honor our then-current Privacy Policy, until the third party provides you with notice of changes to our Privacy Policy and permits you to exercise any rights you may have under applicable law to limit disclosures of information about you;
  * We may disclose all the information we collect as described above to other companies such as direct marketers to perform marketing services on our behalf, or to third parties with whom we have joint marketing agreements; and
  * We may share with third parties certain pieces of aggregated, non-personal information, such as the number of users who clicked on a particular link or how many users clicked on a particular advertisement. Such information does not identify you individually.



  **SECURITY**

Vook limits access to personal information about you to those employees whom we determine need access to that information to provide products or services to you. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard your personal information. However, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our servers, nor can we guarantee that information that users supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet.

  **YOUR INDEPENDENT RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER COMPANIES**

Please note that this Privacy Policy will not apply to your independent relationships with other companies that from time to time may offer you products and services on Vook's sites. Those companies' privacy policies will govern how they collect, use and disclose personal information that you provide to them. Vook is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of those websites. We encourage you to review the privacy policy of any company before submitting your personal information.

Questions or comments regarding this policy should be directed to the attention of the General Counsel, Vook, Inc. at the address set forth in the contact section of this website.

Vook reserves the right to modify this policy.
