Privacy

At voobys, we respect the privacy of the users of our website and services and are committed to protecting it. We have created this policy to demonstrate our commitment to you and to help you understand it. By visiting the voobys website, you are accepting the practices outlined in this Privacy Policy.

This Privacy Policy covers voobys's treatment of personal information that voobys gathers when you are on the voobys website and when you use voobys services. This policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that voobys does not own or control, or to individuals that voobys does not employ or manage. 

Information Collected by voobys 

we may collect personal information, including email addresses and users interests, when individuals register to use the voobys! website and services, post a link to the voobys website or submit questions, comments or bug reports. We may also, at times, collect our users' IP addresses and information regarding our users' use of our website and services. We may use such IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our servers, track movement within our website and, if necessary, deny service in accordance with our Terms of Service. We may also collect information related to the referring URL, access times and browser type. Unless required by law, we will not share our users' personal information, Internet Protocol (IP) addresses and usage information, except with their consent or in aggregate or anonymous form, with third parties. In order to offer and provide optimized and personalized services, we use cookies to store and sometimes track information about our users. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to a user's browser from a web server and is eventually stored on a user's computer hard drive. 

E-mail Communications

voobys is very concerned about your privacy and we will never provide your email address to a third party without your explicit permission, as detailed in the "Sharing Your Information" section below. voobys may send out e-mails with voobys-related news, products, offers, surveys or promotions. You may also receive notification e-mails from voobys, which inform you of actions (e.g. friend requests) that have been performed on the site. If you do not want to receive e-mail from us, please visit the Email Preferences section of your User Profile and/or follow the instructions contained in the unwanted e-mail message. However, please note that in all cases you will continue to receive all system e-mails (e.g. those regarding forgotten user passwords) and legal notices (e.g. updates to our policies) from us. 

Cookies
