<p>Marchex Inc. ("We" or "Marchex") provides Pay Per Phone Call services in addition to interactive audio and speech content via the phone and the Internet (together, the "Service"). As a pioneer in the Voice-to-Web industry, we use unique personalization components and sophisticated database software to provide advertisers, agencies, publishers and corporations with the best, easiest-to-use service available. Our Privacy Policy is designed to protect your personal data while at the same time giving you the opportunity to share and obtain interesting and useful information. This Privacy Policy describes how we treat information received about you when you visit our Service. Please read the Privacy Policy carefully.</p>
<h4>Information We Collect</h4>
<p>General. When you register as a user of the Service (each, a "User") and at other times, we will collect personally identifiable information from you. The personally identifiable information we collect includes limited personal data such as name, address, phone number and email address. However, we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of thirteen.</p>



<p>Interactive Content. Because Marchex provides an interactive service, other Users may set up order forms, surveys, polls or other mechanisms through which you can be asked to provide certain information. These features are entirely voluntary. If you do not wish to participate, you may hang up at any time. We are not responsible for the disclosure or use of any information collected by other Users through the Service; other Users may not be subject to the Marchex privacy policy.</p>
<p>Usage Information. Our web and phone servers automatically collect usage information when you visit our Service. Website usage information is information about our visitors (unregistered users of the Service) and Users that describes how our Service is used and navigated, including the number and frequency of visitors and Users to each web page and the length of their stays. Website usage information also includes the domain names and/or corresponding IP addresses (a numerical identifier for a computer on the Internet) of those who visit our website. Finally, phone usage information may include caller ID results depending on your local phone company's ability to transmit that information. To disable caller ID transmissions, please contact your local phone company.</p>
<h4>Security</h4>
<p>The personally identifiable information we collect about you is stored in limited access servers. We will maintain appropriate safeguards to protect the security, integrity, and privacy of these servers and of your personally identifiable information. Except as described below, we will not use or intentionally disclose any personally identifiable information about you to any unaffiliated third parties without your consent.</p>
<h4>How We Use Information Collected</h4>
<p>We may combine the personally identifiable information we collect from you when you use the Service with other information about you that is available to us, including survey information, affiliate and third-party website usage information and information from other sources. We may use such information in several ways, including:</p>
<ul><li>To enable us to process and verify purchases, to provide you with the goods and services you have requested, and for the purposes disclosed when you provide the personally identifiable information.</li>
<li>To send Users email notifications of new Service features and topic-based news alerts if they have signed up for these announcements.</li>
<li>To provide you with personalized content.</li><li>To give Marchex employees information that is useful for developing new features and services that meet Users needs.</li>
<li>To conduct market research and to develop specific phone-based information products.</li><li>To improve the content and navigation on our Service.</li>
<li>To alert you about new products and services and special offers.
We may also share such information with our affiliates and other third parties to provide you with goods or services requested by you. 
Finally, we may also use personally identifiable information to enforce our Terms and Conditions of Use or share such information with
<ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman;"><li>the issuer of a criminal or civil subpoena;</li><li>governmental authorities when legally required to do so; or</li><li>governmental authorities investigating a crime. We reserve the right to contact you at any time regarding Service- related problems or questions as well as changes to our Terms and Conditions of Use, our Privacy Policy, or other policies that affect you and your use of our Service.</li>

</ol></li></ul><h4>Your Ability to Opt Out</h4><p>Opt Out. You can notify us that you do not wish to receive information about new products and services and special offers by opting out at the time you enter your personally identifiable information on our website or by emailing us at <a href="mailto:Vs-optout@marchex.com">Vs-optout@marchex.com</a></p>

<h4>Cookies</h4><p>We employ cookie technology to help visitors and Users move faster through the website portion of the Service, and to help advertisers, agencies and networks generate dynamic telephone numbers on the basis of referral pages. When a visitor or User accesses our website and takes advantage of certain features, we place several cookies on that User's computer. A cookie is a string of information sent by a website and stored on your hard drive or temporarily in your computer's memory. This allows the website to recognize you as you move through the website without having to keep asking you for your username and password. We also employ cookie technology to store usernames and passwords to make the login process easier and faster.</p>
<h4>Review and Correction</h4><p>You may review and update the personal information you provide us with as part of the registration process, or unsubscribe from the Service, by accessing your Profile at <a href="http://adtrack.voicestar.com">http://adtrack.voicestar.com</a>.</p>
<h4>Links</h4><p>We may make content from affiliated or other third party resources, including other websites, available to you from links located on the Service. These resources are not subject to our Privacy Policy, and may have their own individual privacy policy. We recommend that you review the privacy policy at each such resource to determine how it protects your privacy.</p>
<h4>Policy Modifications</h4><p>We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post any changes here, so be sure to check back periodically.</p>
