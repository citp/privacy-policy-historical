                      Protecting privacy is not a new endeavor for 
                      our company. 
                      We have a long-standing tradition of recognizing and 
                      protecting the privacy of customers who use our 
                      telecommunications networks. We maintain 
                      strict customer information privacy policies and use 
                      state of the art technologies to safeguard customer 
                      information and communications from unauthorized 
                      intrusions. </p>
                      <p class="bodytext">We recognize that the growth of online services, 
                      including Internet services, has created additional 
                      privacy concerns, particularly for consumers. </p>
                      <p class="bodytext">Online privacy concerns focus primarily on the 
                      protection of "customer identifiable" information 
                      which an individual or other customer reasonably 
                      expects to be kept private. As the term suggests, 
                      "customer identifiable" information is information 
                      that, when associated with an individual identifies 
                      that individual, for example, a customer's name, 
                      address, telephone number, and e-mail address. </p>
                      <p class="bodytext">Some Internet users may also wish to know who can 
                      learn about what they do on the Internet, even when 
                      that online behavior is not directly linked to any 
                      information that identifies an individual. For 
                      example, advertisers may observe whether visitors to a 
                      Web site see or respond to online advertising without 
                      knowing who those visitors are. </p>
                      <p class="bodytext">It is common practice and often a necessity for 
                      companies, governments, or other organizations to 
                      collect customer identifiable information in order to 
                      conduct business and offer services. For example, a 
                      telecommunications provider may collect customer 
                      identifiable information, such as name, address, 
                      telephone number, and a variety of other information 
                      in the course of billing and providing telephone 
                      service to a customer. </p>
                      <p class="bodytext">Some activities on the Internet follow very 
                      familiar patterns. Consumers signing up for an 
                      Internet access service, for example, are usually 
                      asked to provide name, address, telephone number and 
                      credit card and other information that is typical when 
                      the consumer orders a product or service. Similarly, 
                      business Web sites may ask visitors to supply 
                      information about themselves, particularly when 
                      information, services or merchandise are requested, 
                      but often simply to be able to better target the 
                      company's services to the customer's interests and 
                      requirements. </p>

                      some of our Web sites. The advertising companies may

                      associated with a name or e-mail address without the 
                      customer's permission. (This means that advertising 
                      companies may know where your computer goes on the 
                      Internet, but they don't know who you are unless you 
                      tell them.) We do not supply customer identifiable 
                      information to advertising companies or to individual

                      (for example by clicking on an ad), and request

                      be authorizing another company, including an 
                      advertising company, to use information you supply.                      
                      Find out more about the advertising companies that 
                      deliver ads on our Web sites, read their privacy
