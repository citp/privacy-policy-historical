When customers are asked to enter certain sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected through a Secure Socket Layer (SSL). When you access any secured page of VoIP.ms website such as an order form, most web browsers will show a padlock. When locked, the padlock icon on your internet browser (Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.) indicates the console is running in secure mode. In this case, communications between the client platform running the console and the managed computer are encrypted using SSL.

The padlock icon is open when the page you are viewing is not secure. However, VoIP.ms does not make any statement or guarantee on the safety of the information provided to VoIP.ms. Furthermore, you understand that you provide this information to VoIP.ms at your own risk. All customer information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted to VoIP.ms agents, developers, administrators, operations personnel and other qualified employees.

Furthermore, VoIP.ms uses a vast range of electronic, hardware, software and procedural safeguards to protect your personal identifiable information. VoIP.ms uses standard commercially accepted procedures to protect against unauthorized access to its systems. VoIP.ms restricts access to your personal identifiable information to agents, developers, administrators, operations personnel and other qualified employees who are covered by this Policy and who need to know that information to provide services to you or otherwise assist you for a legitimate business reason. We use Secure Sockets Layer (“SSL”) software, which encrypts information you view, enter, or change on our website. This prevents any unwanted access or viewing of your information by third parties.
