# Privacy Policy

[Voip](https://voip.com/) > Privacy Policy

## Privacy Policy

Voip.com respects the privacy of its customers and takes its obligations to protect the privacy of its customers seriously. This policy briefly describes the personally identifiable information that voip.com collects from its customers and prospective customers and the steps that it takes to safeguard such information.

If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should contact our Privacy Team at privacy@voip.com.

Voip.com will not trade, sell, disclose, or otherwise provide to any third party any form of Residential customer identifiable information without the consent of the customer (except as required by subpoena, search warrant, legal process, or when compelled by a lawful body). This includes information obtained from order forms, customer subscription, and from the utilization of the voip.com service. Business customer information may be shared with a third party in order to provide the information or service requested.

## Collection / Use of Information

Voip.com collects and uses identifiable information for billing, provisioning of service, service information, troubleshoot service errors, and to inform customers of changes to the voip.com service. Voip.com uses third parties, such as VISA, MasterCard, and American Express, to process payment information (if necessary). We may disclose the information we collect from you to companies for the specific purpose of marketing voip.com products and services on our behalf. When you request information from voip.com, we may transfer that information within voip.com or redirect your information to the most suitable supplier(s) so that they may provide the information that you requested.

If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct, update, or deactivate it by making the change on our member information page. When a member signs up for service, they can enter the account number of an existing member so that the existing member may be credited with a referral.

## Cookies

A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. We, like most websites, use cookies on this site. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.

We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close you browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file.

If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site, such as contests or surveys, will be limited.

## Security

Security is of paramount concern to voip.com. Voip.com uses a variety of technology and security features (both hardware and software) to ensure the privacy of customer information. Customer information is not available to employees and is hidden from their use. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).

## Communications

Voip.com will not read, listen to or disclose to any third parties private communications that are transmitted using voip.com services except as required by law or in order to ensure proper operation of services. 

## Unlawful Activity

Voip.com may use customer identifiable information to investigate and help prevent potentially unlawful activity or activities that threaten the integrity of service or network integrity or otherwise violate voip.com's Terms of Service. 

## Account Information

Voip.com provides an online account for customers to update account information. The customer is responsible for ensuring that the information on file with voip.com is current and accurate. 

## Children's Privacy Policy

Voip.com does not sell products or services for purchase by children. Voip.com does not knowingly solicit or collect customer identifiable information from children or teenagers under the age of eighteen. In addition, voip.com will not knowingly link to any third party web site that solicits or collects customer identifiable information from minors. 

## Updates

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our homepage.
