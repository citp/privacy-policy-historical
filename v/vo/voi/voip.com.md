Voip.com respects the privacy of its customers and takes its obligations to protect the privacy of its customers seriously. This policy briefly describes the personally identifiable information that voip.com collects from its customers and prospective customers and the steps that it takes to safeguard such information.

Voip.com is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build user's trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. This privacy statement covers the site www.voip.com. Because this Web site wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe.

If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact our Privacy Team at privacy@voip.com. If you do not receive acknowledgement of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should contact [TRUSTe](http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php). TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with us to resolve your concerns.

Voip.com will not trade, sell, disclose, or otherwise provide to any third party any form of customer identifiable information without the consent of the customer (except as required by subpoena, search warrant, legal process, or when compelled by a lawful body). This includes information obtained from order forms, customer subscription, and from the utilization of the voip.com service. 

## Collection / Use of Information

Voip.com collects and uses customer identifiable information for billing, provisioning of service, troubleshoot service errors, and to inform customers of changes to the voip.com service. Voip.com uses third parties, such as VISA, MasterCard, and American Express, to process payment information (if necessary). We will only disclose information necessary to complete a transaction. Voip.com prohibits any third party from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose.

If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct, update, or deactivate it by making the change on our member information page. When a member signs up for service, they can enter the account number of an existing member so that the existing member may be credited with a referral.

## Cookies

## Security

Security is of paramount concern to voip.com. Voip.com uses a variety of technology and security features (both hardware and software) to ensure the privacy of customer information. Customer information is not available to employees and is hidden from their use. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).

## Unlawful Activity

Voip.com may use customer identifiable information to investigate and help prevent potentially unlawful activity or activities that threaten the integrity of service or network integrity or otherwise violate voip.com's Usage Agreement. 

## Account Information

Voip.com provides an online account for customers to update account information. The customer is responsible for ensuring that the information on file with voip.com is current and accurate. 

## Children's Privacy Policy

Voip.com does not knowingly solicit or collect customer identifiable information from children or teenagers under the age of eighteen. In addition, voip.com will not knowingly link to any third party web site that solicits or collects customer identifiable information from minors.
