We will never knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13 without verifiable parental consent.  If you are under the age of 13, please do not provide us with Personal Information of any kind whatsoever.  If we become aware that a user is under the age of 13 and has submitted Personal Information without verifiable parental consent, we will remove his or her Personal Information from our files.

We use appropriate security measures to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of your Personal Information. All pages within our checkout process and areas containing Personal Information are secured using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) technology, which encrypts data between our computer and yours.
