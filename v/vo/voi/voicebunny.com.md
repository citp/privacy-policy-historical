We use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. ("Google"), to collect information about your use of the Site. Google may use cookies to collect information about what content you view, what purchases you make, the social media features you access, what websites you visit immediately prior to visiting the Site, and your system information and geographic information. The information generated by the Google cookies about your use of the Site (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google. The information collected by Google allows us to analyze your use of the Site.

If you visit the Site from a third-party website the third-party website may give you a unique code, cookie or graphic which will uniquely identify you. This will only happen if you link directly from a third party website to the Site. Your activities on the Site while such a code is active may be reported back to the third party website. The presence of a third party navigation bar at the top of any page on the Site is an indication that the third party website may be able to see your activity on the Site.

The Site may include third-party advertising, links to other websites, and other content from third-party businesses. These third-party sites, businesses, and advertisers, or advertising companies working on their behalf, may use web beacons and cookies to measure the effectiveness of their ads, personalize or optimize advertising content and to track users who click on the links made available through the Site. We do not have access to or control over web beacons or cookies that these third parties may use. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these third-party websites. You are encouraged to review the privacy policies of the different websites you visit.

Some third-party advertising companies may provide a mechanism to opt-out of their technology. For more information about the opt out process, you may visit the Network Advertising Initiative website, available at <http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp>.

We may also provide social media features through the Site that enable you to share information with your social networks and to interact with Bunny Inc on various social media sites. Your use of these features may result in the collection or sharing of information about you by these sites, depending on the feature. We encourage you to review the privacy policies and settings on the social media sites with which you interact to make sure you understand the information that may be collected, used, and shared by those sites.

  5. **Additional Privacy Protections for Children Using the Internet.**

  6. **Security.**

We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure your Personal Information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We use appropriate security measures to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of your Personal Information. All pages within our checkout process and areas containing Personal Information are secured using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) technology, which encrypts data between our computer and yours. No computer system is fully secure, however, and there are inherent risks associated with Internet transactions. To make sure your Internet browser is using the latest security features, you may want to download the most recent version of it, which should have full SSL support.
