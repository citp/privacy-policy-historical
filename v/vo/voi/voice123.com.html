We cannot guarantee the privacy or security of your information and therefore we encourage you to evaluate the privacy and security policies of your trading partner before entering into a transaction and choosing to share your information. To help protect your privacy, we allow only limited access to other users' contact and financial information in order to facilitate your transactions. When users are involved in a transaction, they may have access to each other's name, user ID, email address, and other contact and financial information. In all cases, you must give other users the option to remove themselves from your database and the opportunity to review what information you have collected about them.</p><br>
<p>You agree to use user information only for:</p><br>
<p> • Voice123 transaction-related purposes that are not unsolicited commercial messages;<br>
• services offered through Voice123, or<br>

• other purposes that a user expressly chooses.</p>

<strong><p>Cookies/Web beacons</p></strong>
<p>We use "cookies" (small files placed on your hard drive) on certain pages of the Site to help analyze our web page flow, customize our services, measure promotional effectiveness, and promote trust and safety. We link the information we store in cookies to personally identifiable information you submit while on our site in order to customize the user experience.</p><br>
<p>A few important things you should know about cookies are that:</p><br>

<p> • We offer certain features that are only available through the use of cookies.<br>
• We use cookies to help identify you and maintain your signed-in status.<br>
• You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although doing so may interfere with your use of the Sites.<br>
• You may encounter cookies from third parties on certain pages of the Sites that we do not control. (For example, if you view a web page created by another user, there may be a "cookie" placed by that web page.)</p><br>

<p>Third parties (such as our tracking utility and security scanning companies) employ a software technology called Web beacons (a.k.a. clear gifs or Web bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, Web beacons are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. These third parties do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information.</p>
<div class="sep"></div>
<strong><p>No spam, spyware or spoofing</p></strong>
<p>We and our users do not tolerate spam. Make sure to set your Voice123 notification preferences so that we can communicate with you according to your preferences. You are not licensed to add other Voice123 users, even a user who has purchased a service from you, to your mail list (email or physical mail) without their express consent. To report Voice123 related spam or spoof emails to Voice123, please forward the email to <a href="mailto: help@voice123.com">help@voice123</a>.</p>
<div class="sep"></div>

<p><strong>Account Protection</strong></p> 
<p>Your password is the key to your account. Use unique numbers, letters, and special characters and do not disclose your Voice123 password to anyone. If you do share your password or your personal information with others, remember that you are responsible for all actions taken in the name of your account. If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your personal information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately notify Voice123 and change your password.</p>
<div class="sep"></div>
<strong><p>Accessing, Reviewing and Changing Your Personal Information</p></strong>
<p>You can see, review, correct and change most of your personal information by logging into your account at <a href="http://voice123.com">Voice123</a>. Generally, we will not manually modify your personal information because it is very difficult to verify your identity remotely. You must promptly update your personal information if it changes or is inaccurate. Once you make a public posting, you may not be able to change or remove it. Upon your request, we will close your account and remove your personal information from view as soon as reasonably possible, based on your account activity and in accordance with applicable law. We do retain personal information from closed accounts in order to comply with law, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our Terms of Service, and take other actions otherwise permitted by law.</p>
<div class="sep"></div>

<p><strong>Security</strong></p>

<p>The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL/TLS). To learn more about SSL/TLS click here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ssl">Secure Socket Layer technology (SSL/TLS)</a></p>
<br>
<p>Your information is stored on our servers located in the United States. We treat data as an asset that must be protected and use lots of tools (encryption, passwords, physical security, etc.) to protect your personal information against unauthorized access and disclosure. However, as you probably know, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications and other users may abuse or misuse your personal information that they collect from the Site. Therefore, although we work very hard to protect your privacy, we do not promise and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private.</p>
