### 1\. Personal Information

When you register for Voxbone services, we will ask you to provide personal information. The information we collect may be combined with information obtained from other Voxbone services. This information includes your name, private/business address, contact telephone numbers and email address. We may also ask you for other information that relates to the service you are using or ordering. For example, we may need your credit card number to charge you for certain services. We make use of technologies to keep track of your interactions with our sites and services to offer a personalized experience. 

### 2\. Your Choices

You can view and edit your personal information at any time after registration with Voxbone. You can stop the delivery of Voxbone newsletters by following the instructions in the e-mail you receive. You may also request to correct, update or delete your personally identifiable information. Please note, however, that choosing to delete some types of personal information may prevent us from supplying certain services to you as a customer. In order to better protect you and safeguard your information, we take steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections to your information. 

### 3\. Use of information

We use the information we collect to provide the services you request. Your e-mail address is the preferred way for communication. We use the information we collect to inform you of additional features, expanded coverage or other products or services offered by Voxbone. Our services do not include the display of personalized advertising. We do not sell, rent, or lease our customer lists to third parties. Even after termination of the relationship, Voxbone will not disclose your personal information to any third parties without your consent. We may, however, pass on personal information within our internal departments in order to e.g. manage your account and provide support services, as well as to finance for billing and collection purposes.
