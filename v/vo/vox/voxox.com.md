Like You, Voxox does not like unsolicited advertising (spam). Thus, Voxox is ad-free, and we hope to keep it that way.  We have no intention to subject You to advertising, but if for some unforeseen reason we do, we will let You know and update this section.

Except as provided below, Voxox shall not sell, rent, or otherwise share any business or personal information and/or traffic data or communications content to any third party without Your explicit permission, unless it is necessary to comply with the law.  This includes not using Your mobile phone number or other personal information to send You advertising or marketing messages without Your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which You will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out.

Voxox reserves the right to disclose business and personal information to respond to legal requests or to enforce or protect Voxox and it partners’ rights.  This includes disclosing information and/or non-personally identifiable information that Voxox beliefs, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to enforce our Terms of Service, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend itself against a third party claim or allegation, to assist government enforcement agencies, to protect the security or integrity of the Apps, Software, Website and/or its Network, and to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Voxox, our users or others.

Some Voxox products may be white-labeled or co-branded and offered together with or via a partner company.  Thus, Voxox may sometimes share Your personal and traffic data with Voxox partner companies.  Voxox will always require these third parties to take appropriate administrative and technical steps to comply with all necessary laws and protect Your personal information and traffic data with same degree of care and security as they would treat their own most confidential information.

By using Voxox, You consent to both Voxox and the partner company’s use of personal information collected in connection with the white-labeled or co-branded product.

Voxox may provide any data including personal information to any law or government entity legally requesting such information via a subpoena, court order, search warrant, or equivalent, or where in our reasonable belief, an individual’s physical safety may be at risk or threatened.  Voxox will provide all reasonable assistance and information to fulfill such requests and Your consent to such disclosure, as applicable.

Your information may be stored and processed in any country in which Voxox and its partners maintain facilities or offer the Service.  Voxox reserves the right to transfer information globally.  By using Voxox products and this Service, You consent to any such transfer of information.

  7. **In the Event of Merger, Sale or Bankruptcy**



Voxox may merge or be acquired by another business entity or may sell all or substantially all of its assets to an acquirer.  In the event of such merger, acquisition or sale, Voxox will continue to protect Your personal information and send You a notice before Your personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.  Once the merger, acquisition or sale is complete, Voxox may share some or all of Your personally identifiable information with the acquiring company to continue serving You.

In the unlikely event of bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors’ rights generally, we may not be able to control how Your personal information is treated, transferred, or used.

  8. **Communications**



You may use the Service to initiate and receive phone calls or send messages that are partly or fully handled via our partners.  Therefore, any information that You may communicate during such phone calls or in such messages, including any personal information, shall not be deemed private.  Voxox cannot guarantee the security of any information that You disclose or communicate in such communications.  You agree and consent that any information that You communicate is at Your own risk.

You may also use the Service to reply to an incoming phone call with a message like “I’m busy, call me back later” that is sent to their mobile phone number.  Thus, if another person has Your mobile phone number stored in their contact list, they will be able to send You such notifications, unless You have chosen to block the user from being able to place calls to You.

Voxox websites may contain links that will let You leave the Website and access other websites.  Linked websites are not under the control of Voxox and it is possible that these websites have a different privacy policy.  The Voxox Privacy Policy applies solely to business and personal information that is acquired on the Website or through Your use of the Website, Software, Apps and/or Your relationship with Voxox.  Voxox accepts no responsibility or liability for these other websites.
