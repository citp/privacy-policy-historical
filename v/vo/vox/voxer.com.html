                                <p><b>6. RIGHTS OF ACCESS, RECTIFICATION, ERASURE, AND RESTRICTION</b></p>

                                    <p>You may inquire as to whether Voxer is Processing Personal Information about you, request access to Personal Information, and ask that we correct, amend or delete your Personal Information where it is inaccurate. Where otherwise permitted by applicable law, you may contact us at: <a href="mailto:privacy@voxer.com">privacy@voxer.com</a> or use any of the methods set out in this Privacy Policy to request access to, receive (port), seek rectification, or request erasure of Personal Information held about you by Voxer. Please include your full name, email address associated with your Account, and a detailed description of your data request. Such requests will be processed in line with local laws. You can also view your profile in the Products and correct any inaccurate data that appears in your Profile.<br><br>

                                    Although Voxer makes good faith efforts to provide Individuals with access to their Personal Information, there may be circumstances in which Voxer is unable to provide access, including but not limited to: where the information contains legal privilege, would compromise others’ privacy or other legitimate rights, where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the Individual’s privacy in the case in question or where it is commercially proprietary. If Voxer determines that access should be restricted in any particular instance, we will provide you with an explanation of why that determination has been made and a contact point for any further inquiries. To protect your privacy, Voxer will take commercially reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access to or making any changes to your Personal Information.<br><br>

                                    Through the Products, you can also close your account by using the “Deactivate Account” function. If you do so, you will no longer have access to the App. Voxer may retain your personal information even after you have closed your account if retention is reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations, meet regulatory requirements, resolve disputes between users, prevent fraud and abuse, or enforce this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service. We may retain personal information, for a limited period of time, if requested by law enforcement. Voxer’s Customer Service may retain information for as long as is necessary to provide support to users. We will delete your contacts data from our servers. Communications Content that you have sent via the Products will be deleted from your device, but will remain accessible to the recipients of those messages and will not be deleted from their devices or our servers.</p><br>

                                <p><b>7. DATA RETENTION</b></p>

                                    <p>Voxer retains the Personal Information we receive as described in this Privacy Policy for as long as you use our Products or as necessary to fulfill the purpose(s) for which it was collected, provide our Products, resolve disputes, establish legal defenses, conduct audits, pursue legitimate business purposes, enforce our agreements, and comply with applicable laws.</p><br>

                                <p><b>8. SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION</b></p>

                                    <p>Voxer takes reasonable steps to protect personally identifiable information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. We keep your account information and content on a secure server behind a firewall. When you enter sensitive information (such as passwords), we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL) while it is being transmitted. However, you should keep in mind that no Internet transmission is ever completely secure or error-free. In particular, messages sent to or from the Voxer Site and Products may not be secure. We do not accept liability for unintentional disclosure.<br>
