                                <p>Last Updated: March 31, 2015.</p>

                                <p>This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) governs your use of the Voxer website (<a href="../../../index.html">www.voxer.com</a>), other websites owned by Voxer (collectively, the “Voxer Site”), the Voxer Walkie Talkie App,
                                    Voxer Pro App (the “App”) and any other products provided to you (collectively with the App, the “Products”) by VoxerNet LLC (and any entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with Voxer) (collectively
                                    “we,” “us,” “our,” or “Voxer”). If you are a user of the Voxer Business service, your data is subject to the policies of the entity that has contracted with Voxer for that service and not this Privacy Policy; please
                                    contact such entity regarding their policies and practices.</p>

                                    and other registration information. We may use the information you provided us to contact you from time to time to provide you with important information, required notices and marketing promotions. The Products can

                                    <li>As required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process;</li>
                                    <li>When we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request;</li>

                                    remove this content from your device or account, copies of this User Communications Content will remain viewable on the devices of third party users with whom you have communicated and will be stored on our servers
                                    for a period of time. </p>

                                    by choosing your name off of a list of users available via our Products. If you enable “Privacy Mode” in the App, you will no longer be searchable by other users and your information will not be shared in this way.

                                <p>How We Protect Information. Voxer takes reasonable steps to protect personally identifiable information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. We keep your account information
                                    and content on a secure server behind a firewall. When you enter sensitive information (such as passwords), we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL) while it is being transmitted. However,
                                    you should keep in mind that no Internet transmission is ever completely secure or error-free. In particular, messages sent to or from the Voxer Site and Products may not be secure.</p>

                                    to read their privacy policies.</p>
