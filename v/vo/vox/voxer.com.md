This Policy applies to all of Voxer’s operating divisions, subsidiaries, affiliates, and branches, and any additional subsidiary, affiliate, or branch of Voxer that we may subsequently form.

**3\. TRANSPARENCY/NOTICE-TYPES OF PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT**

The types of Personal Information we may collect (directly from you or from Third-Party sources) and our privacy practices depend on the nature of the relationship you have with Voxer and the requirements of applicable law. Some of the ways that Voxer may collect Personal Information include:

  * You may provide Personal Information directly to Voxer through interacting with the Products, participating in surveys, during events such as sweepstakes, and requesting Products, or information.
  * As you navigate the Products, certain passive information may also be collected about your visit, including through cookies and similar technologies as described below.



We endeavor to collect only that information which is relevant for the purposes of Processing. Below are the ways we collect Personal Information and how we use it.

  * **3.1 TYPES OF PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT**
  *   * Voxer collects Personal Information regarding its current, prospective, and former clients, customers, users, visitors, and guests (collectively “ **Individuals** ”).

  

    * **Information You Provide Directly to Us.** When you use the Products or engage in certain activities, such as creating an Account with Voxer, responding to surveys, requesting Products or information, or contacting us directly, we may ask you to provide some or all of the following types of information:
  

      * **Communications with Us.** We may collect Personal Information from you such as email address, phone number or mailing address when you choose to request information about our Products, request a Product demonstration, register for Voxer’s newsletter or a loyalty program that we may offer from time to time, request to receive customer or technical support, or otherwise communicate with us.
      * **Registering Products.** When you register with us and use the App, you generally provide us with Personal Information such as your name, email address, user name, password, phone number and other registration information. Registration with us is mandatory in order to be able to use the App. The App obtains the Personal Information you provide when you download and register for the App. If you choose to register on the Voxer Site, we will receive that registration data as well.
      * **Communications with Third-Parties.** The Products can be used to communicate with others. When you share information, including Personal Information, it will be seen by the recipients. Voice, text and images you create and transmit will be stored on your device, the device of recipients of such communications, and on our servers.
      * **Contacts Data.** To provide you an opportunity to automatically connect with your contacts, we may, with your permission, access and store on our servers Personal Information regarding your contacts, including their names, email addresses, phone numbers, profile image, geographic location and Facebook IDs. In addition, when you invite contacts to use our Products, we will access your address book so you can facilitate the invitation. If you send invitations to your contacts, you represent that all such contacts have consented to receive SMS from you. To better match you with your most important contacts, with your permission, we may also access and store your call and SMS log information from your device.
      * **Location Information.** If you give the App permission to access Location data, the App will collect your GPS location at the time you send a message. A map indicating your location will be available to the recipients of the message. You can disable this feature by turning off the location function in the “Settings” menu of the App or on your phone.
      * **Surveys.** From time to time, we may contact you to participate in online surveys. If you do decide to participate, you may be asked to provide certain information which may include Personal Information. All information collected from your participation in our surveys is provided by you voluntarily. We may use such information to improve our Products, Sites and/or services and in any manner consistent with the policies provided herein.
      * **Posting on the Site.** Voxer may offer publicly accessible pages, blogs, private messages, or community forums. You should be aware that, when you disclose information about yourself in on Voxer’s pages, blogs, private messages, and community forums, the Site will collect the information you provide in such submissions, including any Personal Information. If you choose to submit content to any public area of the Site, such content will be considered “public” and will not be subject to the privacy protections set forth herein.
      * **Registration for Sweepstakes or Contests.** Occasionally, Voxer may run sweepstakes and contests. We ask those who enter in the sweepstakes or contests to provide contact information (e.g., an e-mail address). If you participate in a sweepstakes or contest, your contact information may be used to reach you about the sweepstakes or contest, and for other promotional, marketing and business purposes. All sweepstakes/contests entry forms will provide a way for participants to opt out of any communications that are not related to awarding prizes.
      * **Automatic Data Collection.** We may collect certain information automatically through our Apps or other Products, such as the type of mobile device you use, your mobile device’s device ID, your IP address, your mobile operating system, the type of mobile Internet browsers you use, crash information, information about the way you use the Apps or Products, cookie identifiers, mobile carrier, mobile advertising identifiers, MAC address, Advertiser ID, and other device identifiers that are automatically assigned to your computer or device when you access the Internet, browser type and language, geo-location information, hardware type, operating system, Internet service provider, pages that you visit before and after using the Products, the date and time of your visit, the amount of time you spend on each page, information about the links you click and pages you view within the Products, and other actions taken through use of the Apps or the Products such as preferences.

    * **Information from Other Users of the Apps and Products.** We may collect Personal Information about you from other users of Voxer Products. For example, when a friend provides friend details or contact information, or indicates a relationship with you, Voxer may receive Personal Information such as your name, email address, phone number, profile image, geographic location and Facebook ID. We may use such Personal Information to determine if you use Voxer Products, and to help your contacts find you. 
  

    * **Information from Other Sources.** We may receive information about you from other sources, including through Third-Party services and organizations to supplement information provided by you. For example, if you access our Products through a Third-Party application, such as an App Store or Social Networking Sites (“SNS”) such as Facebook, we may collect information about you from that Third-Party application that you have made public via your privacy settings. If you authorize the activity, Personal Information we collect through App Stores or SNS accounts may include your name, your SNS user identification number, your SNS user name, location, gender, birth date, email, profile picture, your contacts on the SNS, and their profile information and their SNS images.

  * **5.5 COOKIES AND INTERNET-BASED ADVERTISING**

As noted above, you may stop or restrict the placement of cookies on your computer or remove them from your browser by adjusting your web browser preferences. Please note that cookie-based opt-outs are not effective on mobile applications. However, on many mobile devices, application users may opt out of certain mobile ads via their device settings.

The online advertising industry also provides websites from which you may opt out of receiving targeted ads from our data partners and our other advertising partners that participate in self-regulatory programs. You can access these, and also learn more about targeted advertising and consumer choice and privacy, at [www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp](https://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp), or <http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/> and [www.aboutads.info/choices/](https://www.aboutads.info/choices/). You can also choose not to be included in Google Analytics [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-analytics-opt-out/fllaojicojecljbmefodhfapmkghcbnh?hl=en).

To be clear, whether you are using our opt-out or an online industry opt-out, these cookie-based opt-outs must be performed on each device and browser that you wish to have opted-out. For example, if you have opted-out on your computer browser, that opt-out will not be effective on your mobile device. You must separately opt out on each device. Advertisements on Third-Party websites that contain the AdChoices link and that link to this Privacy Policy may have been directed to you based on anonymous, non-Personal Information collected by advertising partners over time and across websites. These advertisements provide a mechanism to opt out of the advertising partners’ use of this information for interest-based advertising purposes.

Where otherwise permitted by applicable law, you may contact us at: [privacy@voxer.com](mailto:privacy@voxer.com) or use any of the methods set out in this Privacy Policy to request access to, receive (port), seek rectification, or request erasure of Personal Information held about you by Voxer.

Although Voxer makes good faith efforts to provide Individuals with access to their Personal Information, there may be circumstances in which Voxer is unable to provide access, including but not limited to: where the information contains legal privilege, would compromise others’ privacy or other legitimate rights, where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the Individual’s privacy in the case in question or where it is commercially proprietary. If Voxer determines that access should be restricted in any particular instance, we will provide you with an explanation of why that determination has been made and a contact point for any further inquiries.
