### How accurate is the personal information we hold about you?

We take all reasonable measures to make sure the personal information we hold is accurate, complete and up to date.

For example, if you change your name or move house.

### Can you access and correct the personal information we hold about you?

Yes, but there may be times where we cannot grant you access to the personal information we hold.
