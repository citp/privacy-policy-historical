# About - Legal - Privacy Policy - Vodafone Australia

Protecting your privacy is a big deal, so we’re strict about how we handle your personal information. This privacy policy outlines how we collect, store, use and disclose any personal information you provide us.

This privacy policy also confirms Vodafone’s obligations under the Privacy Act 1988 (“Privacy Act”) and the Telecommunications Act 1997. 

### What is your personal information?

In this privacy policy, the term ‘personal information’ has the meaning given to it in the Privacy Act. It can include your name, address, telephone number, email address and profession or occupation. If information we collect personally identifies you, or you are reasonably identifiable from it, the information will be considered personal information.

### Why do we collect personal information?

To provide you with mobile services and products (including your phone and broadband), we need to collect some of your personal details. Without this, we’re not allowed by law to provide you with the products and services you want. 

### What personal information do we collect?

  * The information we collect about you depends on the Vodafone products and services you use and subscribe to. It may include:
  * your name, date of birth and contact details including your physical address, email address and telephone number;

These collect information that helps us understand how you use our online products and services and how we can make them more relevant to you. 

We may use a persistent cookie (a cookie that stays linked to your browser) to record your visits so we can recognise you if you visit our website again. It also lets us to keep track of products or services you view so that, with your consent, we can send you news about them.

### Do we disclose your personal information outside Australia?

Vodafone may disclose personal information to other companies in the Vodafone group as well as third party suppliers and service providers located overseas for some of the purposes listed above.

### What security measures do we use to protect your personal information? 

The security of your personal information is a high priority for us. We take all reasonable steps to securely store your personal information so it’s protected from unauthorised use, access, modification or disclosure. This includes both physical and electronic security measures.

### How can you protect your account from unauthorised access?

Anyone who knows your account PIN or online username and password can access your account. You must keep your PIN, username and password secure and only share these details with people you authorise to access and manage your Vodafone account. Vodafone accepts no responsibility for information it discloses to parties who know your PIN, username or password.

### How accurate is the personal information we hold about you?

We take all reasonable measures to make sure the personal information we hold is accurate, complete and up to date. However, the accuracy of your information is largely dependent on what you provide us. To make sure we’ve got your most current and accurate details, please let us know when your information changes (e.g. if you change your name or move house). 

### Can you access and correct the personal information we hold about you?

Yes, but there may be instances where we cannot grant you access to the personal information we hold. For example, we may not grant access to information if it could interfere with the privacy of others or if it would result in a breach of confidentiality. If that happens, we will give you written reasons for any refusal.
