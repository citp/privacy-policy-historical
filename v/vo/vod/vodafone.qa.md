**5\. Online Security Information**

5.1 To ensure secure online payment and all other transactions of personal data, our website uses a technology called SSL (Secure Socket Layer). SSL encrypts all communications between your computer and our server so that the information can only be read and understood by us.

5.2 A closed lock in the bottom corner of your browser window shows a secure connection. For further information, please consult your browser's security specifications. If your browser is equipped with SSL your transaction will automatically be secured.

5.3 The common standard in the Internet to signal a secure site is a closed lock at the bottom of the browser. As long as the lock is displayed closed your information is secure and encrypted to avoid abuse.

5.4 We will make limited use of cookies for certain online services where your account details are accessible. These cookies do not contain any user-specific details (such as user names or passwords). Depending on the type of browser you are using, you may be able to configure your browser so that: (i) you are prompted to accept or reject cookies on an individual basis or (ii) to prevent your browser from accepting any cookies at all. You should refer to the supplier or manufacturer of the web browser for specific details about cookie security.

5.5 This website uses a web analytics service. This may record mouse clicks, mouse movements, scrolling activity as well as any text you type in this website, except text in password fields and credit card information. The service does not collect personally identifiable information that you do not voluntarily enter in this website. It does not track your browsing habits across other web sites or text inputted in password fields. We are using the information to improve our website, make it more user-friendly and monitor that it is performing correctly.
