Vodafone New Zealand Limited (“our, we or us”) is committed to protecting your personal information. We have created this Privacy Policy to help you understand how we collect, use and protect your information when you visit our web and WAP sites and use our products and services.

If you want to talk to us about this policy or any concerns or queries you have about the use of your personal information, please email us at [customer.privacy@vodafone.com](mailto:customer.privacy@vodafone.com "customer.privacy@vodafone.com")

This policy is provided for your information and doesn’t limit or exclude your rights under the Privacy Act 1993 or the Telecommunications Information Privacy Code 2003.

**1\. What information does Vodafone collect?**

We collect information relating to you that you have provided to us (for example, on an application or registration form, when you enter a competition or promotion sponsored by us or through the way you use our products and services) or that we may have obtained from another source (such as our suppliers or from marketing organisations and credit agencies). Where possible, we will collect the information directly from you. However the method of collecting this information may vary depending on which one of our services you are using (for example our mobile services or our internet services).

This information may include, your name, address, telephone numbers, information on how you use our products and services (such as the type, date, time, location and duration of calls or messages, the numbers you call, how much you spend, and information on you and the browsing and viewing activity that happens while you use internet services (including the internet sites and pages visited, your Internet Protocol (IP) address and the dates and times you or anyone using your internet services logs on and off, and the channels accessed through your TV services with us)), the location of your mobile phone, lifestyle information and any other information collected in relation to your use of our products and services. This information may be held by us while you are using our services and for a period of time afterwards, but only for so long as we are legally entitled to use the information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

We may also monitor and record your calls to us and our calls to you.

**2\. How does Vodafone use your information?**

2.12 generally customising your experience on our sites;

2.13 for general administrative and business purposes.

**3\. Sharing your information**

There may be times when we need to disclose your personal information to third parties (some of which may be based outside of New Zealand). If we do this, we will only disclose your information to:

3.1 our group companies who may use and disclose your information for the same purposes as us;

3.2 those who provide to us or our group companies products or services that support the services that we provide, such as our dealers and suppliers;

3.3 other network operators to enable you to make and receive calls through other networks, so we can transfer numbers from one network to another and to monitor or investigate fraud or other offences.

3.4 credit reference agencies (unless we have agreed otherwise), who may share your information with other organisations and who may keep a record of the searches we make against your name;

3.5 debt collection agencies or companies, in order to collect any money owing by you in respect of an unpaid Vodafone bill;

3.6 if someone else pays your bill, such as your employer, that person;

3.7 those providing telephone and similar directories or directory enquiry services and other such publicly available databases and publications, except where you have specifically directed us not to;

3.8 anyone we transfer our business to in respect of which you are a customer or a potential customer;

3.9 anyone who assists us in protecting the operation of the Vodafone networks and systems, including the use of monitoring and detection in order to identify potential threats, such as hacking and virus dissemination and other security vulnerabilities;

3.10 anyone who hosts or maintains data centres, service platforms and other infrastructure and systems on behalf of us and our group companies, where your information is processed;

3.11 persons to whom we may be required to pass your information by reason of legal, governmental or regulatory authority including law enforcement agencies and emergency services;

3.12 other service providers in relation to a service used through our network to allow that service to be charged to you;

If you have not opted out of receiving marketing material from us, we may also provide your personal information to carefully selected third parties who we reasonably believe provide products or services that may be of interest to you and who have contracted with Vodafone to keep the information confidential, or who are subject to obligations to protect your personal information.

If you would like to opt-out of receiving Vodafone marketing materials, please contact 777 from your Vodafone mobile or go to My Vodafone at www.vodafone.co.nz. Even if you opt out, Vodafone will still need to send you essential information about your account or changes to your plans or service.

Some of our message services and selected user initiated service queries, are available to you free of charge.  If you use one of these free services to request or send a message, you or the recipient of that message may receive third party advertising with the requested message, even if you or the recipient have opted out of receiving marketing messages from us.

**4\. Using Products and services outside New Zealand**

If you wish to use our products or services outside New Zealand, your information may be transferred outside New Zealand to that country. Our websites and systems and those of our group companies may also be based on servers located outside of New Zealand. Please note that the data protection and other laws of countries outside New Zealand may not be as comprehensive as the laws of this country.

**5\. Protecting your personal information**

We will take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we collect, use or disclose is accurate, complete, up-to-date and stored in a secure environment protected from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.

If you choose callerID restriction we will prevent your number being shown on any receiver. Your number may still be displayed to emergency or other services, when you send a TXT message and to us.  Where you do not choose to use callerID restriction, your number may be displayed to the person you have called or sent a message to.

**6\. Accessing and updating your personal information**

You have the right to access personal information about you if we hold that personal information in a way that it can be readily retrieved, subject to some exceptions provided at law.

You may request access to the personal information we hold about you by sending an email to  [customer.privacy@vodafone.com](mailto:customer.privacy@vodafone.com "customer.privacy@vodafone.com") Please quote your name and address. We would be grateful if you could also provide brief details of what information you want a copy (this helps us to more readily locate your data).

In some cases, there may be a charge associated with providing copies of your personal information to you. If so, we will advise you of this prior to sending your information to you.

We will not be able to provide you personal information if we do not know or don’t have reasonable grounds to believe it is personal information about you or if disclosing the information would involve the unwarranted disclosure of the affairs of another individual.

You can request correction or amendment of the information held by us at any time and as often as necessary by sending us an e-mail to  [Contacting us](mailto:customer.privacy@vodafone.com "Contacting us") and specifying the information that you require changed. If it is reasonable in the circumstances for us to do so, we will make the requested change or correction, otherwise we’ll take reasonable steps to mark that information as having been subject to a change or correction request.

For further information about New Zealand's Privacy Act 1993 and how it protects the personal information of individuals in New Zealand, see www.privacy.org.nz.

Some of our services are password-protected so that only you have access to your personal information. You should not reveal your password to other people and you should change it regularly. Vodafone will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited e-mail. Also, if you are using the internet, remember to sign out of your Vodafone account and close your browser window when you have finished. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place.

**7\. Internet use**

We make every effort to maintain the security of our internet connections; however for reasons outside of our control, security risks may still arise. Any personal information transmitted to us or from our online products or services will therefore be at your own risk, however we will use our best efforts to ensure that any such information remains secure. We cannot protect any information that you make available to the general public – for example, on message boards or in chat rooms.

Please note that when you are accessing a non-Vodafone website, you should always read their privacy policy or website terms and conditions – especially if you are considering providing them with your personal information. You are also responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any account information.
