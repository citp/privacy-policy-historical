<h3>1. Information Collection and Use</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>The Straight Talk</dt>
  <dd>

    In order to use participate in the events, you have to sign up. Your user
    name will be visible in the events you attend. We'll use your email to
    contact you in case we need to get a hold of you or notify you of any
    upcoming events that we feel may interest you. Speaking of events which
    interest you, like most sites, we use cookies to see how the site is used
    and where we can improve it. We'll do our best to only contact you with
    events and speakers which we feel may interest you. You can always
    unsubscribe from emails. (I know I wouldn't want anyone's inbox to look
    like mine after I signed up for meetup).
  </dd>
  <dt>The Legal Talk</dt>
  <dd>
    Our primary goals in collecting personally identifiable information are
    to provide you with the product and services made available through the
    Site, including, but not limited, to the Service, to communicate with
    you, and to manage your registered user account, if you have one.

    <dl>
      <dt>Information Collected Upon Registration.</dt>
      <dd>
        If you desire to have access to certain restricted sections of the
        Site, you will be required to become a registered user, and to submit
        certain personally identifiable information to Vokle. This happens in
        a number of instances, such as when you sign up for the Service, or
        if you desire to receive marketing materials and information.
      </dd>

      <dt>Additional Information</dt>
      <dd>
        Your full user name is displayed to people in the Vokle network to
        enable you to connect in a more personal way. If you contact us by
        email, we may keep a record of your contact information and
        correspondence, and may use your email address, and any information
        that you provide to us in your message, to respond to you.
      </dd>
      <dt>Use of Contact Information</dt>
      <dd>
        In addition, we may use your contact information to market to you,
        and provide you with information about, our products and services,
        including but not limited to our Service. If you decide at any time
        that you no longer wish to receive such information or communications
        from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any
        of the communications.

        IP address, browser type or the domain from which you are visiting,
        the web-pages you visit, the search terms you use, and any

    monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on the
    Site, and to improve the Site and our services. A session cookie
    enables certain features of the Site and our service and is deleted
    from your computer when you disconnect from or leave the Site. A
    persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used
    by your browser on subsequent visits to the Site. Persistent cookies
    can be removed by following your web browser help file directions. Most
    Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your

    you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit.
