<h3>Order Forms</h3>
<p>When you purchase our products or services online, we collect your contact and payment information (like name, postal address, email address, and credit card number).  We use this information to create/update your account, verify your identity, authorize payments, and to send you a confirmation of your payment.

<h3>Tell-A-Friend Email</h3>

If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address.  We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site.  Vovici does not store this information.</p>

<h3>Log Files</h3>
<p>As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.  This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp and clickstream data.</p> 

<p>We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.</p> 

<p>We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information.</p>

<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. We use  cookies on this site. We do link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.</p>

<p>We use persistent cookies. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file. More information about cookie technology can be found on the Microsoft® website at: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/info/cookies.mspx" target="_blank">http://www.microsoft.com/info/cookies.mspx</a>.</p>

<p>We set a persistent cookie to store your passwords, so you don't have to enter it more than once.  Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.</p>

<p>If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site, such as contests or surveys, will be limited. As some of our promotions or surveys may be targeted towards responses to a particular marketing program, if the persistent cookie for that program is not present due to visitor deletion, you may not be invited to participate in the corresponding survey or promotion.</p>

<p>Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies on our site.  We have no access to or control over these cookies. This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by Vovici (this site) only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. </p>

<h3>Security Measures</h3>
<p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.  No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

<p>If you have questions about security on our Web site, you can send us an email at <a href="mailto:privacy@vovici.com">privacy@vovici.com</a></p>

<h3>Surveys</h3>
<p>When you publish your survey on our servers, we will provide you with a unique URL to display your survey.  We will not provide this URL to any other person or entity, but we will provide your survey to any web browser requesting your unique URL.  We may review your survey contents for violations of our <a href="http://www.vovici.com/about/use.asp">Use Policy</a>. If we determine your survey is in violation of our Use Policy, we will attempt to contact you and reserve the right to delete your survey and results from our systems.</p>

<h3>Survey Results</h3>
<p><b>It's your data.</b> We will not attempt to read your survey results at any time unless explicitly instructed to do so by you, except that, solely with respect to any use of the EFM for CRM  Module, we do review, process and provide analysis in aggregate form with respect to the results of specific format questions developed by Vovici regarding the likelihood of a survey respondent to refer others to the applicable products and/or services of an organization. We only disclose this information in aggregate form with respect to the survey results to these questions for the applicable organization for the EFM for CRM  Module and not in any way that personally identifies you or your specific response to the questions in the survey. We do not own the contents of the data for your survey. Except for the limited analysis performed by us on the specific responses to the EFM for CRM  Module, we only have access to your surveys for purposes of backup and troubleshooting. When your survey results are received by us, we will store them in a secure location. We will only allow your survey results to be downloaded directly into our desktop software or accessed through our online web interface. We have security measures in place to protect your results while stored on our servers and we will prosecute any attempt to access this information without authorization to the fullest extent of the law.</p>

<h3>E-Mail Notification System</h3>
<p>Our e-mail notification system stores your e-mail addresses on our server in a secured location.  These e-mail addresses are kept on the server for tracking and click notification purposes.  Much like survey data, these addresses are yours, not the property of Vovici Corporation. Vovici technical support and development may examine these lists for support and troubleshooting purposes.  We will not use or sell these e-mail addresses to anyone; any attempt to access your e-mail addresses without your authorization will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.</p>

<h3>Safe Harbor and EU Data Protection Requirements</h3>
<p>Safe Harbor provisions are terms and conditions as set forth by the International Trade Federation of the United States Commerce Department that promotes data security and protection and procedures to insure that the terms and conditions are adhered to and supported by those companies who have agreed to the terms and conditions of Safe Harbor and have formally certified to that effect. Vovici Corporation has met the Safe Harbor requirements on 3/28/05 and has been placed on the Safe Harbor list of companies accordingly. This list and details on the Safe Harbor provisions may be found at: <a href="http://web.ita.doc.gov/safeharbor/SHList.nsf/WebPages/virginia" target="_blank">http://web.ita.doc.gov/safeharbor/SHList.nsf/WebPages/virginia</a>. This certification is provided solely by the International Trade Federation of the United States Commerce Department and is not a certification by the TRUSTe program.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site.</p>

<p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.  We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently.  If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here or by means of a notice.</p>

<p class="warn" align="center">If you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of this site, or your dealings with this Website, please feel free to contact us through the contact information listed at the top of this page.</p>
