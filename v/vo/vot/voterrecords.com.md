Google's advertising requirements can be summed up by Google's Advertising Principles. They are put in place to provide a positive experience for Users and can be found here: <https://support.google.com/adwordspolicy/answer/1316548?hl=en>

We use Google AdSense Advertising on Our website. Google, as a third-party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on Our Site.

The Site utilizes Remarketing with Google AdSense, Google display network impression reporting, demographics and interests reporting, and DoubleClick platform integration.

  * #### 11\. Your California Privacy Rights

California Civil Code § 1798.83 permits Users of the Site that are California residents to request certain information about Our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make this request, please send an email on the [Contact Us](https://web.archive.org/contact) page.

Further, if You are a California resident and would like to opt out from the disclosure of Your personal information to any third-party for marketing purposes, please send an email on the [Contact Us](https://web.archive.org/contact) page. Please be advised that if You opt out from permitting Your personal information to be shared, You may still receive selected offers directly from the Website in accordance with California law.

CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. You can review further here: <https://consumercal.org/about-cfc/cfc-education-foundation/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa-3/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf>

According to CalOPPA, We agree to the following:

  *     * ##### i.

Users can visit Our Site anonymously.

    * ##### ii.

Once this Privacy Policy is created, We will add a link to it on Our home page or as a minimum on the first significant page after entering Our Website.

    * ##### iii.

Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy' and can be easily be found on the page specified above.

    * ##### iv.

Users will be notified of any Privacy Policy changes on Our Privacy Policy Page.

    * ##### v.

Users are able to change their personal information by logging in to their account.

  * #### 12\. International Users

If You are visiting Our Website from outside the United States, please be aware that Your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States where Our servers are located and Our central database is operated. The data protection and other laws of the United States and other countries might not be as comprehensive as those in Your country. By using Our services, You understand that Your information may be transferred to Our facilities and those third parties with whom We share it as described in this policy.

  * #### 13\. Our Commitment to Data Security

We take measures to protect the transmission of all sensitive User information. We make every effort to ensure the integrity and security of Our network and systems. Nevertheless, We cannot guarantee that Our security measures will prevent third-party ‘hackers’ from illegally obtaining this information. We take all reasonable measures to prevent such breaches of security, but given the resourcefulness of cyber-criminals, We are unable to guarantee that Our security is one hundred percent (100%) breach-proof. You assume the risk of such breaches to the extent that they occur despite Our reasonable security measures.

  * #### 14\. Public Records

The Site displays public records that are available from various resources, including but not limited to voter registration records from government agencies.
