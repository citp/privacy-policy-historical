<p>At Democrats Abroad, we are committed to protecting your privacy online.  Democrats Abroad will hold any information you provide us here with the utmost care and will only use it in ways to which you have consented: for preparation of the voter registration materials, for voting reminders and information and for membership in Democrats Abroad, as the case may be.  Democrats Abroad does not maintain any sensitive personally identifiable information such as birth date, social security number, driver’s license number, or passport number. 
<br><br>
All personal information and other unique identifiers required by law for voter registration that are submitted in the process of registering to vote are used to produce the voter registration form to send to your local or state election officials.  If you opt in to be reminded about voting information in the future, we will retain your name, email address and voting state information.  If you opt in to join Democrats Abroad, you will have given us permission to transfer your name, contact information, and voting state information to the Democrats Abroad membership database.  For information about the privacy policy for personal data about members of Democrats Abroad see <a href="http://www.democratsabroad.org/join/privacy.php" target="_blank">http://www.democratsabroad.org/join/privacy.php</a>.
<br><br>
Democrats Abroad only maintains aggregate data for statistical purposes and name, email, and voting residence information for those individuals who request that they receive additional information about voting in their last state of residence as it becomes available.  Democrats Abroad will not use any information provided to us here for any other purpose unless we first obtain your consent.
<br><br>
Like any other voter at home, once you mail in your voter registration application form to your local or state election officials, it becomes a matter of public record and is available for inspection and use by legitimate candidates for public office and their campaign organizations as well as by others who satisfy the requirements of the State law governing its use.
<br><br>
Any information that you provide will be collected and maintained directly on servers located in the United States.  If you are located outside the United States, any information you provide will be transferred to the United States.  Democrats Abroad is committed to providing your information with the highest level of privacy protection.  You should know, however, that the general level of protection for personal information in the United States may not be the same as that provided in other countries, including those that belong to the European Economic Area.
<br><br>
If you have any questions about our privacy policy, the information we have collected from you online, the practices of this site or your interaction with this website, send email to: <a href="mailto:privacy@democratsabroad.org">privacy@democratsabroad.org</a> or contact us by mail.
<br><br>
If you request to be reminded of voting information and at any time thereafter you no longer wish us to remind you and wish us to delete your data from our database, please inform us by email at <a href="mailto:privacy@democratsabroad.org">privacy@democratsabroad.org</a>, or by mail.
