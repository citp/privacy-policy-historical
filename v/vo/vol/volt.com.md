Data Processing Outside Your Country
We may transfer your information and process it outside your country of residence to wherever Company
or our clients or our third party data processors operate.
Privacy Shield
With respect to Personal Information associated with individuals located in European Economic
Area (EEA) countries (“EEA Data Subjects”), the Company complies with the Data Protection
Directive 95/46/ec as amended.
To the extent that Personal Information of EEA Data Subjects is transferred to the United States
of America, the Company complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by
the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of Personal
Information transferred from the EEA to the United States. The Company remains responsible
for personal information that is shared under the Onward Transfer Principle with third parties for
external processing on Company’s behalf.
The Company has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield
Principles. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield
Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program,
and to view our certification, please visit www.privacyshield.gov.
Notice of material changes to the use or transfer of your Personal Information incompatible with the
purpose for which it was originally collected will be provided through our website or by other
means so that you may review the changes before you continue your relationship with the
Company. If you object to the changes, you must notify of us of your wish to sever your
relationship with the Company; otherwise, your continuance of the relationship after the notice
means that you are consenting to the changes.
The Company is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade
Commission to ensure compliance with the EU-US Privacy Shield principles outlined in this Privacy
Policy.
In compliance with the EU-US Privacy Shield Principles, the Company commits to resolve complaints
about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information. JAMS will be the US-based
independent organization responsible for reviewing and resolving complaints about our Privacy Shield
compliance. We ask that you first submit any such complaints directly to us via Ciso@volt.com. If you
are not satisfied with our response, please contact JAMS at https://jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield. In
the event your concern still is not addressed by JAMS, you may be entitled to a binding arbitration under
Privacy Shield and its principles.

supplier, vendor, employee and/or candidate Personal Information to third parties for purposes of
direct mail, telemarketing, and/or related promotions, solicitations or marketing contacts.

Management of Personal Information
The Company uses a combination of reasonable security technologies, policies and procedures, and
non-disclosure, confidentiality and/or other forms of agreement(s) to help protect your Personal
Information from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification or disclosure. In the event
that local law in the country of disclosure or use of Personal Information is more stringent than the
requirements set out in this policy, local law will prevail over this policy to the extent necessary to
meet the requirements of that legislation.

supplement, replace or eliminate this Policy, which shall be effective upon publication on the
Company’s website.
