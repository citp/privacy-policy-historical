VOLVO PRIVACY STATEMENT \- VOLVO DIVERSITY POLICY

**Volvo Cars of North America, Inc. & Volvo Finance North America, Inc. Privacy Policy and Securing Data**

This privacy policy and guideline is specific to Volvo Cars of North America, Inc. and Volvo Finance North America, Inc. located in the United States.

At Volvo Cars of North America, Inc. ("VCNA"), and Volvo Finance North America, Inc. ("VFNA"), we believe strongly in personal privacy for individuals and their families. Honesty and respect for personal security are highly valued at VCNA/VFNA and are issues we take as seriously as our continuing efforts in automotive safety. With the advent of the Internet, we can now collect customer information online, as well as through traditional channels, such as the telephone or customer surveys. Most Internet users welcome the fact that customized, relevant and timely information can be provided via the Internet.

VCNA and VFNA recognize that the growth of online services has created additional privacy concerns. It is for that reason that Volvo maintains a strict privacy policy to safeguard customer identifiable information and communications from unauthorized intrusions.

Privacy concerns focus on the protection of "customer identifiable" information which an individual reasonably expects to be kept private. As the term suggests, "customer identifiable" information is information which can be associated with a specific individual or entity, including, for example, a customer's name, address, or telephone number, e-mail address, and information about activities (online or otherwise) that are directly linked to them.

It is common practice and often a necessity for companies, governments, or other organizations to collect customer identifiable information in order to conduct business and offer services. For example, an internet referral service that refers car shoppers to local authorized retailers may collect customer identifiable information, such as name, address, telephone number, and a variety of other information, in the course of providing this service to a customer.

**I. Notice:**

The information which you supply VCNA/VFNA with or which VCNA/VFNA collects about you ("Information") may be used freely by VCNA/VFNA and other businesses owned by or affiliated with VCNA/VFNA's parent company, Ford Motor Company. We may also share Information with other persons to conduct our business, such as credit agencies, marketing and ad agencies, recordkeepers, service providers, and government entities. We may use Information in a variety of ways relating to our business, including developing services and marketing programs, analyzing customer preferences, and investigating and approving your credit.

**VCNA/VFNA Online Privacy Policy**  
How we collect and process the data you provide.

VCNA/VFNA has put in place the following Online Privacy Policy to protect customer identifiable information. This policy covers VCNA/VFNA and its subsidiaries, and applies to all customer identifiable information that VCNA/VFNA obtains when a customer registers for or uses a VCNA/VFNA online service, including visiting a VCNA/VFNA owned and controlled website ("Volvo Web Site"). VCNA/VFNA will continue to protect customer information derived from its sales of automobiles and related products and services in a manner consistent with federal regulations.

**VCNA/VFNA collect and use your information for specific purposes**  
VCNA/VFNA will collect and use customer identifiable information to create and inform you of products and services that better meet your needs, for billing purposes, or to anticipate and/or resolve problems with your service. This means that VCNA/VFNA may use your customer identifiable information to market new services to you that we think will be of interest to you, but we will not disclose your customer identifiable information to third parties that want to market products to you. When VCNA/VFNA uses other agents, contractors or companies to perform services on its behalf, VCNA/VFNA will use reasonable commercial efforts to ensure that the company protects your customer identifiable information in a manner consistent with this Policy.

To receive credit or other services from us, you may be required to provide personal information to VCNA or VFNA and/or an authorized Volvo Retailer which you select. When you utilize online credit application, you are submitting the information from your application to VFNA and an authroized Volvo Retailer which you specify. We may not be able to provide you with services through the Internet if you refuse to provide information to VFNA or your authorized Volvo Retailer. If you choose to provide us with information (whether actively or passively) by using our website, you acknowledge and agree you are doing so on a voluntary basis. You may see any authorized Volvo Retailer in person if you have any reservations about conducting business over the Internet.

**II Choice:**

**Opting out of Volvo marketing information**  
An individual may choose not to receive direct marketing communications from either VCNA or VFNA in connection with online services. Upon such choice, VCNA or VFNA (a) will not contact that individual directly with marketing messages about Volvo online services, and (b) will not use customer identifiable information obtained from that individual's registration for or use of an online service to contact that customer with marketing messages about any VCNA or VFNA products or services. An individual may communicate his or her choice not to receive such messages by e-mail and mail.

To inform VCNA that you do or do not wish to receive communications of certain kinds from VCNA, please do one of the following:

drop us a line - address the letter to:

Volvo Customer Service  
Attn: Privacy  
7 Volvo Drive  
Rockleigh, NJ 07647; or

send us an email at [customerservice@volvocars.com](mailto:customerservice@volvocars.com), with "Privacy" as the subject.

Customer-identifiable information which a visitor volunteers at any VCNA/VFNA Web Sites to inquire about or order Volvo products or services will be protected just as if the information had been provided under more traditional ways of ordering that product or service.

**Additional Privacy Protections for Children Using the Internet**  
Volvo joins the industry in recognizing that children, including young teens, may not be able to make informed choices about personal information requested online. Accordingly, Volvo does not knowingly target children or teenagers (younger than eighteen years of age) for collection of information online. Volvo does not solicit or collect customer identifiable information targeted at children and teenagers under eighteen and does not allow anyone else to do so on any Volvo Web Site.

Volvo encourages parents to take an active role in protecting the privacy and security of their children and to prevent the inappropriate use of information about their children. Volvo also supports the development of technologies that help parents to control the collection and use of personal information from children who use online services in their households.
