Privacy Policy

Last Updated: May 24, 2018.

This page explains our terms of service, which contains important information about your legal rights. When you use Volusion, you're agreeing to these terms. Everyday language summaries are provided for your convenience only and are not legally binding.

All terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the definitions set forth in the [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/terms-of-service).

This privacy policy (this "Privacy Policy") is effective as of the date set forth above. Volusion, LLC is committed to honoring the privacy of Our customers and visitors ("You" or "Your"). This Privacy Policy, which is part of Our overall Terms of Service ("Terms of Service"), covers personal information shared through Our website and Our Services, including Personally Identifiable Information and Anonymous Information (the "Personal Information"). "Personally Identifiable Information" or "PII" means information that can be used to identify You as an individual, such as, for example:

  * Your name, company, email address, phone number, billing address, and shipping address;
  * Your Volusion user ID and password (if applicable);
  * credit card information (if applicable);
  * any account-preference information You provide us; and
  * Your computer's IP address.



"Anonymous Information" means information and data that is not linked to Your Personally Identifiable Information and does not, by itself, permit the identification of an individual.

This Privacy Policy describes how We collect and use the Personal Information You provide on Our website (“Our Site”) and as part of Our Services. It also describes the choices available to You regarding Our use of Your Personal Information and how you can access and update this information. Unless otherwise specifically required by applicable law, by submitting Personal Information through Our Site or as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, or, even if You are not a customer, by visiting Our Site, You expressly consent to the collection, use and disclosure of Your Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

We collect basic client information, including Personal Information, in connection with the performance of the Services. We respect Your privacy, and We assure you that We will maintain and use this information responsibly.

We do not intentionally gather Personal Information from visitors who are under the age of 13.

Please note that this Privacy Policy only addresses activities on Our Site and Our servers, and does not govern the collection and use of information by Our merchants, Our partners, or other companies that We do not control, nor by individuals not employed or managed by Us. If You visit a website that We host, mention or link to, another entity may collect Your Personal Information and You should review its privacy policy before providing the site with information.

Data We Collect from You

Account Registration

The registration of an Account requires You to provide certain Personal Information, including a full legal name, current address, phone number, a valid email address and certain other information indicated as required. If You choose Services that require the payment of a fee, You will also be required to submit a credit card/debit card number, expiration date and billing zip code, which information will be kept on file in Our secure servers in order to process Your recurring invoices. In connection with Your account registration, We may also ask for additional information, including the number of employees in Your company (if an entity), Your annual revenues, Your industry and other similar information. We use all such information to provide the Services to You, including to contact You, confirm Your identity and, if applicable, to invoice You.

Your Customers

We collect Personal Information from Your customers that You share with Us or that such customers provide while registering for Your website using the Services ("Your Site"), browsing Your Site or during checkout on Your Site. We use this information to provide You the Services and so that You can serve Your customers, including supporting and processing orders, authentication and processing payments.

We may also use this information to provide You advertising or marketing.

Social Media

Our websites may use social media features, such as the Facebook 'like' button ("Social Media Features"). These features may collect Your IP address and which page You are visiting on Our website, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. You may be given the option by such Social Media Features to post information about Your activities on Our website to a profile page of Yours that is provided by a third party social media network in order to share with others within your network. Social Media Features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on Our website. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing the relevant Social Media Features.

As described above, We will use Personal Information to perform the Services, including to facilitate the creation of and secure Your account on our network and identify You as a user in Our system. We will also use Personal Information to contact You regarding Your interest in, or experience with, the Services, to provide You with support and to improve the quality of Our Site and Services. We may also use Personal Information for marketing purposes. For example, We may use information that You provide to contact You or send to You information regarding Us or our partners. We use Personal Information that You provide to Us or that is collected from partners to conduct automated decision making, including to assist us in screening merchant accounts for risk or fraud concerns.

We will not use or disclose any such PII, except:

  * as necessary to provide the Services to You;
  * in the aggregate with other information in such a way so that Your identity cannot reasonably be determined (for example, statistical compilations);

  * to a successor organization in the event of a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, or other sale or disposition of all or a portion of Our assets;

We do not sell, rent or trade Your Personal Information to third parties. We will not use any PII we collect from You or Your customers to contact or market to Your customers or directly compete with You.

Third Parties

If You purchase, use or specifically express interest in a product or service of one of Our partners, We may share Personal Information about You with such partner.

We use third party payment processors to assist Us in processing and share with them Your PII payment information securely. Such third party processors’ use of Your Personal Information is governed by their respective privacy policies which may or may not contain privacy protections as protective as this privacy policy.

We may use other third parties to help Us provide services and marketing to You, such as shipping or fulfilling orders, processing payments, monitoring site activity, identifying and preventing fraud, conducting quality assurance and testing, providing support, conducting surveys, and administering e-mails, and share with them Your Personal Information solely for those purposes.

If We share any Personal Information with any of these third parties, We will require that such information be used only to provide the services requested by Us and be maintained by them in strictest confidence.

We do not control the use by third parties of Your Personal Information that We collect, and its use by them will be in accordance with their own privacy policies. However, We will ensure that they are bound by agreements with us that include non-disclosure and certain data protection provisions. If you do not wish for Your Personal Information to be shared in this manner, You may opt not to purchase or use these third party services or to specifically express interest in Our partners products or services.

We will always ask for Your consent before sharing Your Personal Information with Third Parties for purposes other than those described herein.
