**How We Use Information**  
We use the Information we collect about you to facilitate the volunteering process and to provide information to you about VolunteerMatch and related industry topics. We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Please be aware that, to the extent required to provide our services, we share your Information with volunteers, nonprofit organizations, or our Partners, as applicable: 

**For Newsletter Subscribers:**  
We may use our email lists for sending out our newsletter and other VolunteerMatch outbound communications. We do not, however, sell, rent or trade our volunteer, administrator, nonprofit, or general newsletter email addresses to outside parties. 

**For Volunteers:**  
If you indicate to us that you are interested in a particular volunteer opportunity and provide us with your Information, we will forward your Information to the nonprofit organization that is hosting that opportunity so that the organization can contact you regarding your potential involvement, and, if the particular nonprofit organization (including a nonprofit organization that is a Partner) has a regional or national office or is closely affiliated with or a member of a related nonprofit organization (each, an "Affiliate"), then we may also share your Information with the applicable Affiliate. Unless you opt out, your name may also appear to others accessing VolunteerMatch as a volunteer interested in the opportunity you expressed interest in, and your email address will be added to the VolunteerMatch newsletter email list. 

To the extent that you have provided any Information to us through our Web site or the Web site of one of our Partners regarding volunteer opportunities associated with one of our Partner, we may share your Information with the applicable Partner. Each of our Partners has its own policies regarding the collection and use of personal information, and VolunteerMatch is not responsible for their use of your Information. 

**For Volunteers (with an account):**  
If you indicate to us that you are interested in creating a personalized account, the information we gather from you will be used to permit you to: access the account, customize outbound email services, review your referral history and/or post a résumé that can be sent as an attachment to inquiries you make using the VolunteerMatch service. 

**For Nonprofit Organizations:**  
If you submit Information to us as nonprofit organization, then, subject to the terms and conditions as a nonprofit member of VolunteerMatch, your Information (excluding your EIN number) will be accessible by anyone who accesses VolunteerMatch. 

Nonprofits who receive email addresses from potential volunteer signups are strongly encouraged to adopt privacy standards similar to those of VolunteerMatch. Each such organization, however, has its own policies regarding collection and use of personal information and we are not responsible for their use of your Information. Inappropriate use of personal information received from VolunteerMatch may jeopardize nonprofit membership with VolunteerMatch. VolunteerMatch reserves the right to determine, in its discretion, what constitutes inappropriate use of this information. For more about a nonprofit organization's policy, please contact them directly using the contact information posted for that organization on our site.

Cookies are tiny data files that Web sites commonly write to your hard drive when you visit them so that they can remember you when you visit.

In every email we send, we provide instructions regarding how to opt-out of receiving future mailings.
