# Privacy Policy — VolunteerSpot

###  Introduction

VolunteerSpot, Inc. (“VolunteerSpot”) has created this Privacy Policy in order to disclose its use of consumer data collected about you. This Privacy Policy is effective as of May 1, 2008. Any questions regarding this policy should be directed by email to [privacy@VolunteerSpot.com](mailto:privacy@VolunteerSpot.com). The following discloses VolunteerSpot's information gathering and dissemination practices for its marketing website.

###  Information Collected and Received

VolunteerSpot may collect or receive information about each person who registers with the VolunteerSpot website including, but not limited to, user name, password, first and last name, email address, street address, gender, occupation, and interests. VolunteerSpot also collects information on the pages you access and other information you may volunteer, such as survey information.

###  Uses of Information

**WE WILL NEVER SELL YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS, OR ANY OTHER PERSONAL INFORMATION, TO ANY THIRD PARTY. EVER.**

Except as described in this section, we will not disclose your personal information to any third party without notifying you of our intent to share the information and giving you an opportunity to prevent your information from being shared.

From time to time, we may partner with companies based on the interests of our users. These partner companies will never see your email address or any other information that could identify you or be used to contact you directly.

Any exceptions to this policy of sharing your name, address or email address with a partner company will be done only with your permission.

VolunteerSpot reserves the right to disclose information when required by law.

We occasionally use other companies to perform services necessary to our operations. In the course of providing these services, those companies may have access to your personal information. By contractual agreement, those companies must treat your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.  However, we will not be liable for any damages that may result from the misuse of your personal information by these companies.

VolunteerSpot may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with VolunteerSpot's server and to administer VolunteerSpot's web site. Your IP address may also be used to help identify you and your online profile and to gather broad demographic information.

VolunteerSpot's site's registration form requires users to give VolunteerSpot contact information (such as your name and email address) and demographic information (such as your zip code, age, or income level). VolunteerSpot uses customer contact information from the registration form to send the user information about VolunteerSpot and promotional material from some of VolunteerSpot's partners. The customer's contact information is also used to contact the user when necessary. VolunteerSpot may use demographic and/or profile data to tailor the visitor's experience on VolunteerSpot's site, show the visitor content that VolunteerSpot thinks you may be interested in, and display content according to your preferences. The demographic and profile data will be shared with advertisers ONLY on an aggregate basis.

We may also disclose, on an anonymous basis, statements made by our customers.

###  Security

VolunteerSpot uses industry-standard technologies when transferring and receiving consumer data exchanged between VolunteerSpot and other companies to help ensure its security. This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under VolunteerSpot's control. VolunteerSpot's servers are backed up regularly and protected by security systems.
