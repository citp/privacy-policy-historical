# Privacy Policy — SignUp.com

**Introduction  **  
This web site (“Site”) is owned and operated by VolunteerSpot, Inc., dba, SignUp.com (referred to as “SignUp.com” herein). Signup.com has created this Privacy Policy in order to disclose its use of consumer data collected about you. This Privacy Policy is effective as of May 1, 2008. Any questions regarding this policy should be directed by email to privacy@SignUp.com. The following discloses SignUp.com's information gathering and dissemination practices for its marketing website.  
 **  
Information Collected and Received  **  
SignUp.com may collect or receive information about each person who registers with the SignUp.com website including, but not limited to, user name, password, first and last name, email address, street address, gender, occupation, and interests. SignUp.com also collects information on the pages you access and other information you may volunteer, such as survey information.

 **Uses of Information  **  
WE WILL NEVER SELL YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS, OR ANY OTHER PERSONAL INFORMATION, TO ANY THIRD PARTY. EVER.

Except as described in this section, we will not disclose your personal information to any third party without notifying you of our intent to share the information and giving you an opportunity to prevent your information from being shared.  
From time to time, we may partner with companies based on the interests of our users. These partner companies will never see your email address or any other information that could identify you or be used to contact you directly.  
Any exceptions to this policy of sharing your name, address or email address with a partner company will be done only with your permission.

 **SignUp.com reserves the right to disclose information when required by law.  
** We occasionally use other companies to perform services necessary to our operations. In the course of providing these services, those companies may have access to your personal information. By contractual agreement, those companies must treat your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. However, we will not be liable for any damages that may result from the misuse of your personal information by these companies.

SignUp.com may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with SignUp.com's server and to administer SignUp.com's web site. Your IP address may also be used to help identify you and your online profile and to gather broad demographic information.

SignUp.com's site's registration form requires users to give SignUp.com contact information (such as your name and email address) and demographic information (such as your zip code or gender). SignUp.com uses customer contact information from the registration form to send the user information about SignUp.com and promotional material from some of SignUp.com's partners. The customer's contact information is also used to contact the user when necessary. SignUp.com may use demographic and/or profile data to tailor the visitor's experience on SignUp.com's site, show the visitor content that SignUp.com thinks you may be interested in, and display content according to your preferences. The demographic and profile data will be shared with advertisers ONLY on an aggregate basis.  
We may also disclose, on an anonymous basis, statements made by our customers.

 **Security  **  
SignUp.com uses industry-standard technologies when transferring and receiving consumer data exchanged between SignUp.com and other companies to help ensure its security. This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under SignUp.com's control. SignUp.com's servers are backed up regularly and protected by security systems.

 **Cookies  **  
“Cookies” are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. SignUp.com's site and email uses cookies to keep track of your session, shopping cart, and advertising delivery. SignUp.com may also use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests and to save your password. SignUp.com may use an outside ad company to display ads on SignUp.com's site and in email. These ads may also contain cookies. While SignUp.com uses cookies in other parts of SignUp.com's web site, cookies received with banner ads are collected by SignUp.com's ad company and SignUp.com does not have access to this information. Additionally, SignUp.com or a data provider we have engaged may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser or email to enable you to receive customized ads or content on unaffiliated websites, apps, or online services for advertising, analytics, attribution, and reporting purposes. These cookies may include IP address, browser or operating system type and version, or inferred-interest information. The cookies may reflect demographic or other data linked to data you voluntarily have submitted to SignUp.com, e.g., your email address, that we may share with a data provider solely in hashed, non-human readable form that can NOT be decoded to personally identify you. To opt-out of these cookies, please go to <http://www.aboutads.info/choices>
