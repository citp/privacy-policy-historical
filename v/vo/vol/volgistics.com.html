				<p class="he">What information we collect and how we use it</p> 
				<p> In order to use Volgistics we ask you to provide your name,
				  title, phone number, and email address, and the name and address of your
				  organization. We collect this information when you initially sign-up for a free
				  Volgistics trial account. If you choose to turn your trial account into a paid
				  Volgistics account we also ask for the email address of the person responsible
				  for your account’s payment arrangements, and your payment information and
				  billing address.</p> 
				<p>We use this information as the basis for identifying you as the
				  owner of the data you track in the system. We use your payment information to
				  process your payment of service fees, and we use your billing contact’s
				  email address if we need assistance processing a payment. We may use your email
				  address, or the email address of others you setup as ‘Volgistics
				  administrators’ to communicate with you about the status of your
				  Volgistics account.</p> 
				<p>We do not sell, rent, or otherwise provide information about you
				  or your organization to others for any reason. This includes personal
				  information such as your name, address, or email address, and the name and
				  address of your organization. </p> 
				<p>From time to time we may release collective statistics about the
				  Volgistics system, such as the average number of volunteers organizations
				  track, or the percentage of Volgistics customers who fall into general
				  organization classifications. These aggregate statistics never reveal
				  information identifiable as that of an individual customer.</p> 
				<p class="he">Who can access your information</p> 
				<p>Only people you setup as ‘system operators’ in your
				  Volgistics account, and who you give access to the Setup page can view or
				  change your organization information. You view or change your organization
				  information under ‘Account Management’ on the Setup page.</p> 
				<p>Once you initially enter payment information for your account,
				  no one can see your complete credit card or bank account number in Volgistics.
				  Volgistics displays only the last four digits of these numbers, and only where
				  it is necessary for you to identify the card or account used to pay for your
				  service.</p> 
				<p class="he">What happens to your information if you close your
				  account</p> 
				<p>We will continue to protect your information under the terms of
				  this privacy policy even if you close your Volgistics account. If you close
				  your Volgistics account we delete your account information from our system
				  within 30 days. </p> 
				<p class="he">About the information you store in your Volgistics
				  database</p> 
				<p>Your database includes all of the volunteer, coordinator, and
				  assignment information you enter in your account, as well as all records
				  related to those, including service records, history records, and contact
				  records. </p> 
				<p>The information you store in your database belongs solely to
				  you, and Volgistics carefully safeguards the privacy and security of this data.
				  Volgistics never discloses the content of your database to anyone. Volgistics
				  uses procedural and technical safeguards to protect your database against loss
				  or theft as well as unauthorized access, including encryption, "firewalls" and
				  Secure Socket Layers. All data is stored in a secure data center wholly owned
				  and operated by Volgistics. Volgistics uses many different security techniques
				  to protect your data from unauthorized access by users internal and external,
				  however it must be recognized that "perfect security" does not exist on the
				  Internet.</p> 
				<p class="he">Who can access the information you store in your
				  Volgistics database</p> 
				<p>Access to the information you store in your database is
				  carefully controlled through a three part credentialing system. This includes
				  an account number, login name, and password. People you allow to access the
				  system by giving them credentials are known as ‘system operators.’
				  Only people you authorize as system operators have online access to your
				  database.</p> 
				<p>The person who initially signs-up for your trial account chooses
				  a login name and password at the time they sign-up, becoming your
				  organization’s first system operator. Thereafter, that individual may
				  create additional system operators for your account, and authorize others to
				  use the system by providing them with system operator credentials. You can see
				  who the current system operators are for your account at any time under
				  ‘System Operators’ in the Setup area.</p> 
				<p>Only system operators in your organization you designate as
				  ‘Volgistics Administrators’ can create system operator credentials
				  for your account. Volgistics employees cannot access your account passwords,
				  nor change or create new passwords for your account.</p> 
				<p>You are responsible for all actions taken with your Volgistics
				  system operator credentials. Give system operator credentials only to those you
				  wish to have access to your database. If you know or suspect that a system
				  operator’s credentials have been compromised you should disable that
				  system operator’s access to the system immediately under ‘System
				  Operators’ in the Setup area.</p> 
				<p class="he">What can the Volgistics Team access?</p> 
				<p>The content of your database is not generally available to
				  Volgistics employees. In the course of managing database and file system
				  components, authorized Volgistics employees may occasionally work with raw data
				  file content. In these cases, information is generally seen only in an
				  aggregate form. </p> 
				<p>Volgistics employees may access the ‘event log’ for
				  your account for the purpose of answering your support inquiries or assisting
				  you with system operation issues. This log contains a record of system setting
				  changes, system errors, and related system events, but does not provide access
				  to your Volgistics database. You can view the event log for your account under
				  ‘Account management’ in the Setup area.</p> 
				<p>All Volgistics staff work under strict confidentiality
				  agreements and this Privacy Policy. </p> 
				<p class="he">Changes to this policy</p> 
				<p>We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time by posting
				  the amended terms on the Volgistics web site, and posting a notice of the
				  change on the Welcome screen you view when you access your account. All amended
				  terms shall automatically be effective once posted. </p> <br> 
				<p>Revised 03-20-2009</p></td>
