We use the Information we collect about you to facilitate the volunteering process and to provide information to you about VolunteerMatch and related industry topics. We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive.  Please be aware that, to the extent required to provide our services, we share your Information with volunteers, nonprofit organizations, or our Partners, as applicable:

</p><p><b>For Newsletter Subscribers:</b><br>
We may use our email lists for sending out our newsletter and other VolunteerMatch outbound communications. We do not, however, sell, rent or trade our volunteer, administrator, nonprofit, or general newsletter email addresses to outside parties.

</p><p><b>For Volunteers:</b><br>
If you indicate to us that you are interested in a particular volunteer opportunity and provide us with your Information, we will forward your Information to the nonprofit organization that is hosting that opportunity so that the organization can contact you regarding your potential involvement, and, if the particular nonprofit organization (including a nonprofit organization that is a Partner) has a regional or national office or is closely affiliated with or a member of a related nonprofit organization (each, an "Affiliate"), then we may also share your Information with the applicable Affiliate.  Unless you opt out, your name may also appear to others accessing VolunteerMatch as a volunteer interested in the opportunity you expressed interest in, and your email address will be added to the VolunteerMatch newsletter email list.

</p><p>To the extent that you have provided any Information to us through our Web site or the Web site of one of our Partners regarding volunteer opportunities associated with one of our Partner, we may share your Information with the applicable Partner.  Each of our Partners has its own policies regarding the collection and use of personal information, and VolunteerMatch is not responsible for their use of your Information.

</p><p><b>For Volunteers (with an account):</b><br>
If you indicate to us that you are interested in creating a personalized account, the information we gather from you will be used to permit you to: access the account, customize outbound email services, review your referral history and/or post a résumé that can be sent as an attachment to inquiries you make using the VolunteerMatch service.

</p><p><b>For Nonprofit Organizations:</b><br>
If you submit Information to us as nonprofit organization, then, subject to the terms and conditions as a nonprofit member of VolunteerMatch, your Information (excluding your EIN number) will be accessible by anyone who accesses VolunteerMatch.

</p><p>Nonprofits who receive email addresses from potential volunteer signups are strongly encouraged to adopt privacy standards similar to those of VolunteerMatch. Each such organization, however, has its own policies regarding collection and use of personal information and we are not responsible for their use of your Information. Inappropriate use of personal information received from VolunteerMatch may jeopardize nonprofit membership with VolunteerMatch. VolunteerMatch reserves the right to determine, in its discretion, what constitutes inappropriate use of this information. For more about a nonprofit organization's policy, please contact them directly using the contact information posted for that organization on our site.

</p><p><b>Cookies</b><br>
Cookies are tiny data files that Web sites commonly write to your hard drive when you visit them so that they can remember you when you visit. A cookie file contains information that can identify you anonymously and maintain your account's privacy.  Our site uses cookies to maintain a user's identity between sessions so that the site can be personalized based on user preferences or a user's history.

</p><p><b>Third-party Access and Use</b><br>
Occasionally, we hire third-party service providers to help us provide or improve the services we offer you.  Sometimes it is necessary for these providers to have access to the Information we collect about you.  In those cases, we take reasonable steps to ensure that these providers do not use or otherwise disclose any Information we collect about you except for the purpose of fulfilling their service obligations to us.

</p><p>In addition, we share aggregate information about our users with certain third parties. This information shows user activity as a whole rather than on an individual basis and cannot be used to individually identify you. We use aggregated information we collect about users to continue to improve our service for you. 

</p><p>This site contains links to other sites. VolunteerMatch is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. 

</p><p>In the unlikely event that Impact Online, Incorporated, the organization that operates VolunteerMatch, undergoes a sale or transfer of all or substantially all of its assets, the acquiring entity will be subject to this Privacy Policy in its use of your personally identifiable Information. In addition, in the further unlikely event that Impact Online, Incorporated is adjudicated bankrupt or insolvent (a) there will be no further use or disclosure of your personally identifiable Information by Impact Online, Incorporated and (b) your personally identifiable Information will be destroyed. In addition, there will be no use or disclosure of your personally identifiable Information by any entity that acquires assets of Impact Online, Incorporated pursuant to such bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings.

</p><p><b>How You Can Access Or Correct Your Information</b><br>
If you are a nonprofit member, or volunteer with an account, you may access all your personally identifiable Information that we collect and maintain online by simply inputting your username and password where indicated on the website.  If you are a nonprofit administrator, you may make any changes or correct factual errors in your administrator, organization and opportunity information 24 hours a day. We use this procedure to better safeguard your Information. You do not need to contact us to access your record or to make any changes. If you have problems changing your organization's Information, please contact Community Services at <a href="mailto:respond@volunteermatch.org">respond@volunteermatch.org</a>.

</p><p>If you are a volunteer and would like to have your Information deleted from the site, you may do so by contacting Community Services at <a href="mailto:respond@volunteermatch.org">respond@volunteermatch.org</a>.

</p><p><b>Opting-out of communications</b><br>
Individuals who serve as administrators for their organization by registering and maintaining their organizations' information and membership, are the only group required to receive VolunteerMatch communications. All other communications are optional and allow the nonprofit organization, volunteer, subscriber or other user to unsubscribe from the newsletter. In every email we send, we provide instructions regarding how to opt-out of receiving future mailings. Users may remove their Information from our database so as not to receive our service or future communications by sending an email to Community Services at <a href="mailto:respond@volunteermatch.org">respond@volunteermatch.org</a>.

</p><p><b>Our Commitment To Data Security</b><br>
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of Information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the Information we collect online.

</p><p><b>Changes to Policy</b><br>

If you object to any such changes, your sole recourse shall be to cease using the VolunteerMatch Web site.
