<b>How We Use Information</b><br>
We use the Information we collect about you to facilitate the volunteering process and to provide information to you about VolunteerMatch and related industry topics. We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive.
We do not, however, sell, rent or trade our volunteer, administrator, nonprofit, or general newsletter email addresses to outside parties.
</p>

<p>
Please be aware that, to the extent required to provide our services, we share your Information with volunteers, nonprofit organizations, or our Partners, as applicable: 
</p>

<ul class="tighter">
    <li>
        For Newsletter Subscribers:
        <br><br>We may use our email lists for sending out our newsletter and other VolunteerMatch outbound communications, such as product enhancements, tool upgrades, or membership news.
        <br><br>
    </li>
    <li>
        For volunteers without a personal account who have accessed VolunteerMatch through www.volunteermatch.org or a Partner's Web site: 
        <br><br>If you indicate to us that you are interested in a particular volunteer opportunity and provide us with your Information, either through www.volunteermatch.org or a Partner's Web site, we will forward your Information to the nonprofit organization that is hosting that opportunity so that the organization can contact you regarding your potential involvement, and, if the particular nonprofit organization (including a nonprofit organization that is a Partner) has a regional or national office or is closely affiliated with or a member of a related nonprofit organization (each, an "Affiliate"), then we may also share your Information with the applicable Affiliate.
        <br><br>To the extent that you have provided any Information to us through our Web site regarding volunteer opportunities associated with one of our Partners, we may share your Information with the applicable Partner. Each of our Partners has its own policies regarding the collection and use of personal information, and VolunteerMatch is not responsible for their use of your Information. Furthermore, our Partners may collect additional information from you, independent of VolunteerMatch.org, in connection with the volunteer services.
        <br><br>
    </li>
    <li>Additionally, for volunteers with a personal account who have accessed VolunteerMatch through www.volunteermatch.org or a Partner's Web site: 
        <br><br>If you indicate to us that you are interested in creating a personalized account, the information we gather from you will be used to permit you to: access the account, customize outbound email services, review your referral history and/or post a resume that can be sent as an attachment to inquiries you make using the VolunteerMatch service.
        <br><br>For volunteers who have accessed VolunteerMatch through a Partner's Web site where Hours Tracking and/or Special Event Manager are enabled: If you indicate to us that you are interested in a particular volunteer opportunity and provide us with your Information via your employer's intranet, we will forward your Information to the nonprofit organization or Affiliate that is hosting that opportunity so that the organization can contact you regarding your potential involvement.
        <br><br>We share your Information with your employer so that your employer may log  the number of hours you have volunteered during a specified period of time ("Hours").  In some instances, your employer may share your Information with third-party service providers to help your employer process data regarding your Hours. Your employer has its own policies regarding the use of your Information, and VolunteerMatch is not responsible for your employer's use of your Information. Furthermore, your employer may collect additional information from you, independent of VolunteerMatch.org, in connection with the volunteer services.
        <br><br>
    </li>
    <li>For Nonprofit Organizations:
        <br><br>If you submit Information to us as a nonprofit organization, then, subject to the terms and conditions as a nonprofit member of VolunteerMatch, your Information (excluding your EIN number) will be accessible by anyone who accesses VolunteerMatch. In addition, we may share your Information, including your EIN number, with selected Partners in order to verify your organization's identity and tax status.
        <br><br>Nonprofits who receive email addresses from potential volunteer signups are strongly encouraged to adopt privacy standards similar to those of VolunteerMatch.  Each such organization, however, has its own policies regarding collection and use of personal information and we are not responsible for their use of your Information. Inappropriate use of personal information received from VolunteerMatch may jeopardize nonprofit membership with VolunteerMatch. VolunteerMatch reserves the right to determine, in its discretion, what constitutes inappropriate use of this information. For more about a nonprofit organization's policy, please contact them directly using the contact information posted for that organization on our site.
    </li>
</ul>

<br>
<p>
<b>Children's Privacy</b><br>
We welcome Volunteers of all ages, including children under the age of thirteen. Due to our status as a non-profit organization, we are not required to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). However, we strongly encourage our Volunteers aged thirteen and under to use our services only with parental consent. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Cookies</b><br>
Cookies are tiny data files that Web sites commonly write to your hard drive when you visit them so that they can remember you when you visit. A cookie file contains information that can identify you anonymously and maintain your account's privacy. Our site uses cookies to maintain a user's identity between sessions so that the site can be personalized based on user preferences or a user's history.
You can set your Web browser to prompt you before you accept a cookie, accept cookies automatically or reject all cookies.  However, if you choose not to accept cookies from this Web site, then you may not be able to access and use all or part of this Web site or benefit from the information and services which it offers.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Third-party Access and Use</b><br>
Occasionally, we or our Partners hire third-party service providers to help provide or improve the services we offer you. Sometimes it is necessary for these providers to have access to the Information we collect about you. In those cases, we take reasonable steps to ensure that these providers do not use or otherwise disclose any Information we collect about you except for the purpose of fulfilling their service obligations to us and our Partners. We may share your Information with third-party service providers in connection with the following: 
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Some of our corporate partners will match your volunteer hours contribution with a donation. In such cases, we will hire third-party service providers to help calculate the corporate partner's donation amount.</li>
    <li>Our corporate partners may also hire third-party service providers to help coordinate volunteer events. We may share information with these third-party service providers in order to facilitate coordination of these events.</li>
    <li>Information collected from nonprofit members may be shared with other websites, such as Yahoo!, in order to advertise volunteer events. We share aggregate information about our users with certain third parties. This information shows user activity as a whole rather than on an individual basis; such aggregate information cannot be used to individually identify you. We use aggregated information we collect about users to continue to improve our service for you.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In the unlikely event that VolunteerMatch undergoes a sale or transfer of all or substantially all of its assets, the acquiring entity will be subject to this Privacy Policy in its use of your personally identifiable Information. In addition, in the further unlikely event that VolunteerMatch is adjudicated bankrupt or insolvent (a) there will be no further use or disclosure of your personally identifiable Information by VolunteerMatch and (b) your personally identifiable Information will be destroyed. In addition, there will be no use or disclosure of your personally identifiable Information by any entity that acquires assets of VolunteerMatch pursuant to such bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings. 
</p>

<p>
Your privacy is very important to us. Due to factors beyond our control, however, we cannot fully ensure that your Information will not be disclosed to third parties. For example, we may be legally obligated to disclose Information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, or third parties may circumvent our security measures to unlawfully intercept or access your Personal Information.
