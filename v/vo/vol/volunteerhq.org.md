International Volunteer HQ (IVHQ) collects personal information on its registration form and through email to enhance the quality of its programs. This information is collected solely for internal use within IVHQ and its partner organizations. Your email and other details will be passed onto other volunteers in the same intake as you, so you can make contact before you arrive in the host country.

We do not sell your emails or other personal information onto other online companies. This means that information about your education, career, exam results, hobbies, phone numbers, email addresses, postal addresses, and interests will be kept totally confidential.

Online payments are processed through a secure third party site, and IVHQ does not receive vulnerable information such as credit card details.
