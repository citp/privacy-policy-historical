**Vital interest**

### **How do we share this information?**

_We do not sell your information to third parties, but we do work closely with our authorised repairer network and with third party suppliers who fulfil business activities for us (like roadside assistance, marketing, events and market research etc.)_

Read more __

We do not sell your information to third parties. However, we may from time to time disclose your information to the following categories of companies or organisations to which we pass the responsibility to handle services on our behalf: roadside assistance service providers, customer contact centres, mobility and car hire providers, direct marketing communications agencies and consultants, market research and market analytics service providers, our legal and other professional advisors.

We will also share your information with our authorised repairer network in situations where we need to pass your information to them in order to manage any request or complaint you have made to us. For example, where you have requested a test drive, we will need to share your personal information with your selected authorised repairer so that they can contact you to arrange for the test drive to take place.

We take steps to ensure that any third-party partners who handle your information comply with data protection legislation and protect your information just as we do. We only disclose personal information that is necessary for them to provide the service that they are undertaking on our behalf. We will aim to anonymise your information or use aggregated none specific data sets where ever possible.

Due to the international nature of our business, there may be some instances where your information is processed or stored outside of the EU.  In those instances, we will ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place for that transfer and storage as required by applicable law. 

There are circumstances where we share your information with our parent (or other companies within our Group) in order to fulfil orders, transactions, handle complaints or provide you with a service or information that you have requested. For example; we will share information with Volkswagen Financial Services UK Limited where you enquire about their services through us or where you make a complaint to us and later make the same or similar complaint to them. Volkswagen Financial Services UK Limited may use your information to provide you with information and carry out their obligations arising from contracts you enter into with them.  For more information, please see their [privacy statement](https://www.vwfs.co.uk/en/home/legal_notice.html).

### **How long do we keep your information for?**

_We will not hold your personal information in an identifiable format for any longer than is necessary. If you are a customer or otherwise have a relationship with us we will hold personal information about you for a longer period than if we have obtained your details in connection with a prospective relationship._

Read more __

We do not retain personal information in an identifiable format for longer than is necessary.

If we have a relationship with you (e.g. you are a customer or the registered driver of a leased or other vehicle purchased from us or an authorised repairer), we hold your personal information for 6 years from the date our relationship ends. We hold your personal information for this period to establish, bring or defend legal claims.  Our relationship may end for a number of reasons including where the vehicle warranty or lease expires, or we have been made aware that you no longer own or drive that vehicle.

Where we have obtained your personal information following a request for information, test drive, brochure, quotation or any other information on any of our products or services, we hold your personal information for 1 year and 6 months from the date we collect that information, unless during that period we form a relationship with you e.g. you purchase or lease a vehicle.  We hold your personal information for this period to give us an opportunity to form a relationship with you.

The only exceptions to the periods mentioned above are where:

  * The law requires us to hold your personal information for a longer period, or delete it sooner;
  * Where you have raised a legal claim, complaint or concern regarding a product or service offered by us, in which case we will retain your information for a period of 6 years following the date of that complaint or query; or
  * You exercise your right to have the information erased (where it applies) and we do not need to hold it in connection with any of the reasons permitted or required under the law (see further How can I manage the information we hold about you);



### **How can I manage the information we hold about you?  **

_You have the right as an individual to access your personal information we hold about you and make corrections if necessary. You also have the right to withdraw any consent you have previously given us and ask us to erase information we hold about you. You can also object to us using your personal information (where we rely on our business interests to process and use your personal information)._

Read more __

You have a number of rights in relation to your personal information under data protection law. In relation to most rights, we will ask you for information to confirm your identity and, where applicable, to help us search for your personal information. Except in rare cases, we will respond to you within 30 days after we have received any request (including any identification documents requested).

You have the right to:

  1. Ask for a copy of the information that we hold about you;
  2. Correct and update your information;
  3. Withdraw your consent (where we rely on it). Please see further [How do we use this information](https://web.archive.org/privacy);
  4. Object to our use of your information (where we rely on our legitimate interests to use your personal information) provided we do not have any continuing lawful reason to continue to use and process the information.  When we do rely on our legitimate interests to use your personal information for direct marketing, we will always comply with your right to object;
  5. Erase your information (or restrict the use of it), provided we do not have any continuing lawful reason to continue to use and process that information;
  6. Transfer your information in a structured data file (in a commonly used and machine readable format), where we rely on your consent to use and process your personal information or need to process it in connection with your contract.

Our social media channels are the best place to find out about all the latest Volkswagen news and products and to share your thoughts, pictures and videos.

We strive to create an open and transparent space for our community to engage; we will, however, remove posts that aren’t related to Volkswagen and/or violate the Terms and Conditions of Facebook. We have provided more detail on these guidelines and our moderation policy, below.

**KEY COMMUNITY GUIDELINES**

  * Make sure you don't post any personal information, including specific information on your car, telephone numbers or address information
  * Please don't post anything that's offensive, abusive, deceptive, defamatory, obscene, menacing, illegal, fraudulent, misleading, threatening, racist, sexist, or in any way discriminatory
  * Please don't post any adverts, spam or links to irrelevant websites
  * Please don’t post any commercial solicitations
  * Keep it relevant - if you post something that is off-topic, then it may be removed



**MODERATION POLICY**

**If contributors persistently ignore our community guidelines, we will seriously consider having posting privileges on our social media channels withdrawn.**

We want to maintain an open and transparent conversation across our channels, but if the nature of your content infringes on the over-arching experience for our fans and followers we reserve the right to take action to mitigate against this happening. One of our customer service team may be in touch if an issue comes up in relation to our community guidelines.

**We will, when necessary, remove comments from our social media content.**

If a response to a Volkswagen UK social media post or a comment published on the community section of our Facebook page is perceived as breaching the community guidelines set out above, then it will be removed by the community moderation team, which will be carried out in the interests of maintaining the community standards appropriate for the vast majority of the people who visit.
