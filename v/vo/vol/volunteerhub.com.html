			<h1>Privacy Statement</h1>
			<div class="Section1">

<p class="MsoNormal">CEI is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy
statement applies to the data collected by CEI through the CEI VolunteerHub Web
sites, CEI VolunteerHub services, and associated software (the
"Services"). This privacy statement does not apply to data collected
through other online or offline CEI sites, products or services.</p>

<h2>Collecting Your Business Information</h2>

<p class="MsoNormal">Information that is provided by organization administrators
such as event information, attendee lists, or contact information, and any
content uploaded to our servers by administrators ("Business
Information") are considered confidential to the subscribing organization.
We will not view Business Information except as necessary to appropriately
support the service. We will use Business Information for the purpose of
service capacity planning; anticipating, diagnosing, supporting or resolving
any problems that might limit or disrupt the Services; and improving the
quality of the Services. Any Business Information collected during the meeting
is also used to facilitate debugging during development, or to debug customer
escalations that are being reproduced in real time. </p>

<h2>Collecting Your Personal Information</h2>

<p class="MsoNormal">We will ask you when we need information that personally
identifies you or allows us to contact you. The personal information we collect
may include your name, postal address, email address, telephone number,
facsimile number, company name, job title, and information about your company
as well as information about the nature of your usage of our service, including
the number of event registrants, duration and frequency of events, and total
number of events. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">We may collect certain information about your visit, such as
the name of the Internet service provider and the Internet Protocol (IP)
address through which you access the Internet; the date and time you access the
Web site; the pages that you access while at the Web site and the Internet
address of the Web site from which you linked directly to our site. This
information is used to help improve the Services, analyze trends, and
administer the Services. </p>

<h2>Use of Personal Information</h2>

<p class="MsoNormal">The personal information collected on this Site will be used
to operate the Site and to provide the service(s) or carry out the
transaction(s) you have requested or authorized. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In support of these uses, CEI may use personal information
to provide you with more effective customer service, to improve the Site and
any related CEI products or services, and to make the Site easier to use by
eliminating the need for you to repeatedly enter the same information or by
customizing the Site to your particular preference or interests. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">We may use your personal information to provide you with
important information about the product or service that you are using,
including critical updates and notifications. Additionally, with your
permission, we may send you information about other CEI products and services,
and/or share information with CEI partners so they may send you information
about their products and services. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">CEI occasionally hires other companies to provide limited
services on our behalf, such as Web site hosting, packaging, mailing and
delivering prizes, answering customer questions about products and services,
and sending information about our products, special offers, and other new
services. We will only provide those companies the personal information they
need to deliver the service. They are required to maintain the confidentiality
of the information and are prohibited from using that information for any other
purpose. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">CEI may disclose personal information if required to do so
by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to : (a) conform
to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on CEI or the
site; (b) protect and defend the rights of property of CEI and its family of
Web sites, or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of
CEI employees, users of CEI products or services, or members of the public.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Personal information collected by VolunteerHub may be stored
and processed in the United States or any other country in which CEI or its
affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities, and by using this site,
you consent to any such transfer or information outside of your country.</p>

<h2>Control of Your Personal Information</h2>

<p class="MsoNormal">Except as otherwise described in this statement, personal
information you provide related to the Services will not be shared outside of
CEI and its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates without your permission.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">With regard to personal information that is collected at
registration from our users (e.g. name, user ID, email address), we present the
option not to receive communications regarding the Services. Customers who no
longer wish to receive communications may opt-out or unsubscribe from receiving
these communications. Each communication will have a way to unsubscribe from
that list. If you encounter any difficulty please email us at support@volunteerhub.com.
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Please be aware that this privacy statement and the choices
you make related to the Services will not apply to personal information you may
have provided to CEI in the context of other, separately operated, CEI products
or services.</p>

<h2>Access to Personal Information</h2>

<p class="MsoNormal">If your personally identifiable information changes, we will
provide a way to correct or update your personal data. Customers can log in and
click on the Your Account link to modify personal information. VolunteerHub customers
also may contact support@volunteerhub.com.</p>

<h2>Security of Your Personal Information</h2>

<p class="MsoNormal">CEI is committed to protecting the security of your personal
information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help
protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.
For example, we store the personal information you provide on computer servers
with limited access that are located in controlled facilities. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">We do not disclose your private, online communications.
However, what you publish to your VolunteerHub service is available to those
whom you authorize to see the information. In the event that you elect not to
use any of the service�s security access controls, the content that you publish
is available to those in the general public who are aware of the URL address
for your event.</p>

<h2>Use of Cookies</h2>

<p class="MsoNormal">We use cookies on this site to ensure the integrity of the
registration process and to personalize the Site. A cookie is a small text file
that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used
to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely
assigned to you, and can only be read by a Web server in the domain that issued
the cookie to you. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a
convenience feature to save you time. For example, if you personalize a web
page, or navigate within a site, a cookie helps the site to recall your
specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of delivering
relevant content, eases site navigation, and so on. When you return to the web
site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can
easily use the site's features that you customized. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web
browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser
setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you
may not be able to use interactive features of this or other web sites that depend
on cookies. </p>

<h2>Links to Other Web Sites</h2>

<p class="MsoNormal">This Web site may contain links to other Web sites. Please
be aware that this privacy statement applies solely to the information
collected by Volunteerhub Services. We are not responsible for the privacy
practices or the content of other Web sites. In some cases, the VolunteerHub Service
may be hosted by a customer, on the customer�s site. In such cases when our Service
is being run on the customer�s network, users should visit the VolunteerHub site
in order to review the privacy policy. We encourage you to be aware when you
are leaving this Web site and read the privacy statements of each and every Web
site that you visit before providing any personal information.</p>

<h2>Enforcement of this Privacy Statement</h2>

<p class="MsoNormal">If you have questions regarding this statement, you should
contact CEI by e-mail at support@volunteerhub.com.</p>

<h2>Changes to the Privacy Statement</h2>

<p class="MsoNormal">We may occasionally update this privacy statement. When we
do, we will revise the "last updated" date at the top of the privacy statement.
For material changes to this privacy statement, we will notify you either by
placing a prominent notice on the home page of our web site or by directly
sending you a notification. We encourage you to periodically review this
privacy statement to stay informed about how we are helping to protect the
personal information we collect. Your continued use of the Services constitutes
your agreement to this privacy statement and any updates.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">CEI VolunteerHub welcomes your comments regarding this
privacy statement. If you have questions about this statement or believe that
we have not adhered to it, please contact us by e-mail or postal mail at the

promptly determine and remedy the problem.</p>
