<b>Information Collection and Use</b></p><p>

VolunteerHub.com is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement.  VolunteerHub.com collects information from our users at several different points on our website.</p><p>

<b>Registration</b></p><p>
In order to use this website, a user must first complete the registration form. During registration a user is required to give their contact information (such as name, address, email, phone, etc).  This information is used to contact the user about the services on our site for which they have expressed interest.  Except for email address and full name, all other user information is optional.</p><p>

<b>Cookies</b></p><p>
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site.  Once the user closes their browser, the cookie simply terminates.  For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the user would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site.  If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site.  The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in some areas of our site.</p><p>

<b>Log Files</b></p><p>
We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.  IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.</p><p>

<b>Links</b></p><p>
This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that VolunteerHub.com is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.  We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information.  This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.</p><p> 

<b>Security</b></p><p>
This website takes every precaution to protect our users’ information.  When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line.</p><p>  

If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can <a href="contact.stm">contact us</a> any time.</p><p>

<b>Correction/Updating Personal Information</b></p><p>
If a user’s personally identifiable information changes (such as your zip code), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user’s personal data provided to us.  This can usually be done at the member information page or by <a href="contact.stm">contacting us</a>.  </p><p>

<b>Notification of Changes</b></p><p>
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under which circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email.  Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. </p><p>
