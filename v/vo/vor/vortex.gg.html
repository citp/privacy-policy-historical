                        <li>Once we change the Privacy Policy, it will become legally binding on you 30 days after we post it online. During that period, you're welcome to contact us if you have specific questions about the changes.</li>
                        <li>If you don't agree to those changes (regardless of whether you email us), then unfortunately we must ask you to cease using Vortex services. We're sorry we have to say that, but we hope you'll appreciate that for Vortex services to work properly we need to have everyone using it under the same rules instead of different people having different rules. That's why we encourage you to get in contact if you have queries.</li>
