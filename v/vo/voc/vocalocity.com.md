### Vonage Privacy Policy

* * *

**About Our Privacy Policy**  
Vonage Holdings Corp. and its affiliated companies (collectively, “Vonage,” “we,” “us,” “our” and other similar pronouns) knows your privacy is important to you, and we want you to know that it is important to us too. We have prepared this Privacy Policy to explain to you how we collect, use and disclose information from and about users and prospective users of our Web sites, products and services (“Customers” or “you”), including users of our communications and other cloud-based services, our mobile applications (our “Mobile Apps”), and other products or services we may offer (collectively, our “Services”). Customers who use the Services for residential or personal use (as opposed to business use) are referred to in this Privacy Policy as “Consumers”.

This Privacy Policy is supplemental to the information use, sharing and disclosure provisions set forth in our Terms of Service ([Personal](https://web.archive.org/tos), [Small Business](https://www.vonage.com/business/legal-policy-center/essentials/tos), [Mid-Market and Enterprise](https://www.vonage.com/business/legal-policy-center/premier/tos)), subject to applicable law. For business customers, this Privacy Policy is also supplemental to any separate written agreements we may have with you. In the event of a conflict between your business agreement and this Privacy Policy where your business agreement expressly references this Privacy Policy when contradicting it, the conflicting terms of your business agreement control over those of this Privacy Policy.

#### What information may we collect and access?

**Personally Identifiable Information**  
We may collect personally identifiable information, including name, physical address, email address, telephone number, credit card information, and other personal information (collectively, "PII") from Customers. We may also obtain Customers’ credit report.  If you create an account or access our Services through your account with a third party service, such as Facebook, Google or Twitter, or use a social media feature through our Service, certain PII from those third party social media services may be shared with us. We will treat this information shared with us in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Any information that third party social media services collect is subject to those respective entities’ own privacy policies.

**Your Contact Lists and Address Book**  
If you use our Mobile Apps, we may request your permission to access and store the contact list or address book maintained on your mobile phone, tablet, or other broadband-connected device (“Mobile Device”). Your contact list is considered your PII. We may use your contact list information to facilitate certain Services such as to enable you to make calls easily and to facilitate free calls, texts, and other Services. We may also facilitate the delivery of messages to individuals in your contact list that you wish to invite to download our Mobile Apps so that you can utilize our Services with these selected individuals. We will not use your contact list information for other purposes without first notifying you of the proposed use. If you do not allow us to access your contact list information, certain features of our Mobile Apps may not be available to you. You may at any time opt out from further allowing us to have access to your Mobile Device’s contact list via the Mobile App’s privacy settings on your Mobile Device.

**Access to Mobile Device Camera, Microphone and Photos**  
If you use our Mobile Apps, we may request your permission to access the camera, microphone and photos on your Mobile Device. If you approve and/or enable it in your Mobile Device settings, our Mobile Apps may access and use the camera, microphone and photos on your Mobile Device to make and receive voice and video calls and messages and to send photos to others. You may at any time opt out from further allowing us to have this access via the Mobile App’s privacy settings on your Mobile Device.

**Your Precise Location Information**  
Our Mobile Apps may collect precise information about the geographic location of your Mobile Device. If your Mobile Device is equipped with GPS or can connect with wireless access points or hot spots, or if your Mobile Device is also a phone that communicates with cell towers or satellites, then your Mobile Device is able to use these features to determine its precise geographic location. If you have consented, the geographic location of your Mobile Device will be transmitted to our servers in real time any time that the Mobile App is running (even if you are not actively using the Mobile App, it is minimized, or it is closed on your Mobile Device). Once you set your Mobile Device to transmit its location information to us, your Mobile Device will continue to transmit its location information to us until you set your Mobile Device to no longer do so. Your precise geographic location is considered your PII unless it is aggregate data and does not identify you. To the extent our Mobile Apps collect precise geographic location, you may at any time opt out from further allowing us to have access to your Mobile Device’s precise location information via the Mobile App’s location settings on your Mobile Device.

You also may use the Mobile App to do a one-time share of your precise geographic location in chat session.

**Your Usage Information**  
We and our service providers may also collect other information from Customers regarding usage of our Services (“Usage Information”), in each case depending on which Service is used. Such information may include Web site pages, content or ads viewed or clicked on; the date and times, and time spent, using certain Services; user navigation through our Services; call log data; your search terms; demographic data; information from cookies and other tracking technologies (described below); information about your computer, customer premises equipment or Mobile Device (including MAC IDs, a unique device identifier, or “UDID” that we assign to your Mobile Device, and performance and signal strength); your usage of the Services on your Mobile Device or at-home equipment; performance indicators such as signal strength and call quality (such as audio and jitter characteristics); other information from your Mobile Device such as telemetry, information from the device operating system, and network being used; your Web browser and operating system and their settings; the language your computer or Mobile Device is set to; the referring page that linked you to our Web site; your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address; your wireless carrier; nearby WiFi hot spots and cell towers; home network setup, performance and bandwidth speed; and other information which may not directly identify any one individual. The identity of your Internet service provider and your general (not precise) geographical location can be derived from your IP address.

Among other things, this Usage Information, along with tracking technologies, enables third party analytics companies, such as Google analytics, to generate analytics reports on the usage of our Services. To opt out of your Usage Information being included in our Google analytics reports, you may follow [these](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout) instructions.

**Customer Proprietary Network Information**   
We collect and derive Customer Proprietary Network Information (“CPNI”) in the course of your use of our Voice-Over IP (“VOIP”) Services. CPNI means, with certain exceptions, information about the quantity, technical configuration, type, destination, location and amount of use of our VOIP Services, as well as information contained on our invoices for VOIP Services. Your CPNI is considered your PII unless it is aggregate data and does not identify you.

We use your CPNI, for example:

  * to provide you the Services you have subscribed to and related features, including customer care, quality control and troubleshooting, performance monitoring and response, and analytics;
  * to select and extend to you, as allowed by law, offers for additional Services within the same category, or related or adjunct to, the Services you already receive;
  * for billing and collections purposes;
  * to protect our rights and property; to investigate fraud and prevent violation of our Terms of Service or related use policies and unlawful use of our network and Services; to protect our company, our other customers and other persons from fraud, abuse and unlawful use of or subscription to our Service; and
  * for additional purposes of which you approve.



We may disclose your CPNI in response to a subpoena, court order, or lawful law enforcement request.

We may also disclose your CPNI to other telecommunications providers and related entities as required by applicable laws and regulations.

**Your Social Security Number**   
In certain limited circumstances, we may collect your Social Security number from you for a limited purpose, such as for tax reporting relating to a payment for a customer referral or to facilitate an international money transfer. Your Social Security number is considered your PII.

We have a policy to treat your Social Security number as confidential information and to not disclose it to third parties except as allowed or required by applicable laws. We also have policies and procedures in place designed to keep this information secure, and “need-to-know” access policies so that only those of our personnel, agents, and lenders who need it for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy are permitted to have access to it and so that such information is not used for any other purpose. We may disclose your Social Security number to our vendors for the limited purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, as well as other entities that have legal rights to receive it pursuant to applicable laws. Our personnel who violate our policies to protect Social Security numbers are subject to discipline, up to and including possible termination.

**Other Information**  
With your permission, we may collect and access other categories of information not discussed above.

#### How do we collect information?

**We collect information from you directly**  
In many cases, we collect information directly from you when you provide it to us during registration or other interactions with us. In other cases, we collect information in the course of making the Services available to you.

**We collect information from third parties**  
We may obtain credit information about you from outside credit reporting agencies. We may also obtain information from outside companies such as those that collect consumer information including demographic and interest data. Examples of this information include gender, age range, sports enthusiast, frequent diner or pet owner. We use this data and combine it with other information we have about you to help us predict your preferences and to direct marketing offers that might be more relevant to you.

When you use social media credentials to login to or otherwise interact with a Vonage site or offer, we may collect information about your social media profile, such as your interests, “likes” and friends list. We may use this information, for example, to personalize your Vonage experiences and marketing communications, to enhance our services and to better serve you. You can control this data sharing via options in your social media accounts.

We also obtain contact information and other marketing lead information from third parties, website “refer-a-friend” options or social media platforms and may combine it with information we have to contact you or direct Vonage marketing offers to you.

**Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies**   
We may use various tracking technologies on the Services to collect additional information about your online activities and to enable us to customize and enhance your experience on the Services.

“Cookies” are pieces of information that may be placed on your computer or Mobile Device by a Web site or Mobile App in order to facilitate and enhance your interaction with that Service. We or our service providers may use cookies to customize your use of our Services, make your use more convenient, or otherwise enhance our Service. For example, cookies may enable us to recognize you when you return to our Service and to maintain your Web session while you browse through our sites.  Some of the cookies we use are essential for the operation of our Service.

In addition to cookies, we and our service providers may use other technologies such as clear gifs, web beacons, pixel tags, Java script, device fingerprinting and third party cookies. We and our service providers may use these technologies for analytics to improve the performance of our Services and learn how to improve it, to better understand usage of our Services, for tailored advertising, to measure advertising effectiveness, and to anonymously track usage of third party sites.

You may also stop or restrict the placement of cookies on your computer, Mobile Device or other relevant media, including third party cookies, or flush them from your browser, by adjusting your Web browser preferences, although doing so may limit the functionality of our Service.

The Services do not process “do not track” headers transmitted by web browsers, and we do not require our service providers to respond to “do not track” headers. Instead, to opt out of behavioral advertising, follow the opt-out instructions in the Interest Based Advertising Section below.

By using our Services, you consent to our, and our service providers’, use of cookies and other tracking technologies as described in this Privacy Policy.

**Call Recording**  
When you speak with our customer service or sales representative on the phone, your calls may be recorded and/or monitored for quality assurance and training purposes. By speaking with our representatives, you consent to this.

#### How do we use information?

**Use of PII**  
We use the information we collect to provide the Services to you, to enhance your experience with the Services, and to improve the Services and our business. In addition to other purposes described in this Privacy Policy, we use PII, for example:

  * to provide, localize and bill for Services requested by Customers;
  * to respond to questions from Customers;
  * to market products and Services that we believe may be of interest to Customers, including by telephone, email, postal mail and SMS/text message;
  * to enable our vendors, contractors and partners to provide and assist us in the provision and marketing of Services to Customers and to participate in joint marketing efforts;
  * to engage in research and development and to evolve and create new product and service offerings;
  * to monitor quality control, integrity, and security of the Services, to investigate potential misuse of the Services or violations of our Terms of Service, and to protect our rights and property; and
  * for other purposes disclosed when information is submitted to us or described in agreements we may have with you.



To perform the above functions and others described in this Privacy Policy, we may match information collected from you through different means or at different times, including PII and Usage Information, and use such information along with information obtained from other sources (including third parties) such as contact information, demographic information, personal interest information, and information provided to us by governmental agencies and regulators. We or our service providers may also use your information to assess the level of interest in, and use of, our Services, our emails and our other messaging campaigns both on an individual basis and in the aggregate.

Vonage will not read, listen to or disclose to any third parties the content of your private email, conversations, or other communications that are transmitted using our Services without your prior consent except, on an as needed basis, for quality control, customer support, and voicemail transcription services, or as otherwise authorized or required by law.

**Your Consent to Communications**  
By providing your contact information to us, you consent to receive email messages, text messages, phone calls, faxes and postal mail, including that of a promotional nature, from Vonage and our affiliates at the contact information you provide. You consent to receive phone calls from Vonage and its affiliates even if your phone number is listed on the federal or state “do not call” registries. **An auto-dialer and/or artificial or prerecorded message may be used to make calls to you.** You agree to enter into, sign and receive this consent to receive communications electronically. You represent that you are legally competent and have legal authority to form a contract and provide this consent with respect to the contact information you provide. You must be 18 years of age or older. You may not consent on behalf of someone else or provide someone else’s contact information. You are not required to agree to promotional communications in order to purchase goods or services from us.

Text messages may be informational, or about our promotional offerings. Informational text messages may include, for example, registration verifications, texts containing a Mobile App download link after you have requested our Mobile App, texts to set up certain Service features you have selected, account balance information or notifications of price or Service changes, and texts informing you of voice messages received in your account. Your wireless carrier may charge fees for text messages, emails and calls to your Mobile Device. Msg&Data Rates May Apply. Text “Stop” to opt out of text our messages. Text “Help” for Help.

**Your Choices**  
If you do not want your PII or CPNI used by Vonage for any direct marketing purposes, or shared with third parties for their own marketing use, then you may opt out of such use or sharing by contacting us as described in the Questions and Contact Information Section below, even if you have previously consented to such use.  You may also control whether our Mobile Apps can access certain content on your Mobile Device via the settings on your Mobile Device. We may offer additional choices at the time Customers sign up for Services or within marketing communications, such as email opt-outs.

However, we are not responsible for removing your PII from the records of any third party who has previously been provided your information in accordance with this or a prior Privacy Policy. In addition, because we must use a Customer’s PII in order to provide our services, Customers cannot opt out of all uses of their PII unless they cancel their Service.

**Aggregate De-Identified Information**  
We aggregate our customer information together in a way that does not reveal our customers’ names, contact information or personal identities. Once we do this, we may use and disclose such aggregate and de-identified information in any way and for any purpose allowed under applicable law without your consent.

#### Why and with whom do we share information?

We may share PII with affiliates, vendors and other third parties for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy, we will not disclose or make available any Consumer PII to any third parties seeking to market third party products without your consent. We only work with carefully selected vendors, and we require any vendors with whom we share PII to protect the confidentiality of such information and use it solely for the purposes for which it was shared.

If you purchase certain products and Services offered by Vonage or a partner through a special marketing arrangement (for example, through a co-branded advertisement or offer, or an arrangement where we and a partner market or offer the other’s products or services), PII may be received and shared by both Vonage and our partner. Each company’s own privacy policy applies.

We will not share your credit card or other financial account information with any third parties, even joint marketing partners, unless they are involved in processing payments for Services that you have purchased from Vonage.

We may disclose your precise geographic location information, subject to applicable law, for example, to emergency service providers, law enforcement, family members in the event of an emergency, and otherwise with your express prior authorization.

The name on your account, or a portion thereof, and/or your phone number may be displayed to people that you make calls to and to other users of the Services so that they may contact you.

If you are a business customer, and have requested this, your business name and phone number may be included in public directories.

We may also use and disclose PII, subject to applicable law, to investigate and help prevent potentially unlawful activity or activities that threaten the integrity of our Service, network, or business; to investigate fraud or violations of our [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/tos); as required by courts or administrative agencies; in response to a subpoena, court order, or lawful law enforcement request, or in connection with a sale, merger, liquidation, or reorganization of our business or assets.

We may disclose your PII to credit bureaus, such as to report late payments and other defaults on your account. With regard to CPNI, this is subject to the CPNI Section above.

Your calls and messages made through our Service may be transmitted through your own Internet access provider. Naturally, if so, your Internet access provider handles your communications as they flow through their lines. We have no responsibility for what your Internet access provider does or does not do with your information.

#### Other Important Information About Your Privacy

**Interest Based Advertising**  
We work with third party ad networks that serve advertisements displayed to you on our Services and elsewhere. These companies may use information about your online activities over time and across our Services and other online properties, the region of the country or world where your IP address indicates you are located, as well as other information about you, in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. These companies may employ cookies, web beacons, and other technologies to collect information about your online activities to personalize advertising content to you and to measure the effectiveness of advertisements. The information practices of these ads networks are governed by their own privacy policies and are not covered by this Privacy Policy. For more information about third-party advertisers and how to prevent them from using your information, visit Aboutads.info at <http://www.aboutads.info/choices>. You have to opt out using each of your Web browsing applications, computers and Mobile Devices separately.

**Information Security**  
Vonage has implemented administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to help protect the PII that we transmit and maintain. However, no system or service can give a 100% guarantee of security, especially a service that relies upon the public Internet. Therefore, you acknowledge the risk that third parties may gain unauthorized access to your information.

Keep your account password secret. You are responsible for any activity under your account using your account password or other credentials.

If we believe that the security of your PII in our care may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you of that development. If a notification is appropriate, we will endeavor to notify you as promptly as possible under the circumstances, subject to any legal obligations to notify law enforcement and regulators first. If we have your email address, we may notify you by email, subject to applicable law. You consent to our use of email as a means of such notification.

**Public Forums**  
You should be aware that any PII which you voluntarily include and transmit through publicly accessible forums (such as chat rooms, blogs, social networking sites, or listservs) may be viewed and used by anyone with access to such forums. Vonage is unable to control such uses of your PII, and by using such Services, you assume the risk that the PII provided by you may be viewed and used by third parties.

**Account Information and Access**  
Consistent with applicable laws and data security requirements, Vonage will reasonably honor written requests from Consumers to access or amend their account information, such as name, address, and billing information. Customers are responsible for ensuring that the information on file with Vonage is current and accurate. Customers may access and update their information by [logging in to their account](http://www.vonage.com/?login) or contacting us as described in the Questions and Contact Information Section below. Where permitted by law, Vonage may charge a reasonable fee to process requests for access to data and may limit the number of requests per year. Your right to amend your information is subject to our records retention policies.

**Children's Privacy Policy**  
Vonage does not sell products or services for purchase by children. Vonage does not knowingly solicit or collect PII from children or teenagers under the age of eighteen. If you believe that a minor has disclosed PII to Vonage, please report this to us.

**Third Party Web Sites and Services**  
Our Services may contain links to other Web sites and services not maintained by Vonage or its affiliates. In addition, other Web sites and services may also reference or link to our Service. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our Service or browse the Internet, and to read the privacy statements of the third party Web sites and services that you visit. We do not endorse, screen, or approve, and are not responsible for the privacy practices, or the content of, such other Web sites and services.

Vonage does not assume, and expressly disclaims, any liability for third parties that have been provided with information as permitted by this Privacy Policy or who have collected information as permitted by this Privacy Policy (such as advertisers using third party cookies).

**Changes to this Policy**  
We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions from this Privacy Policy at any time by posting such changes here. You should review this Privacy Policy regularly for changes, and can easily see if changes have been made by checking the Effective Date below. However, if at any time in the future we plan to use PII collected under this Privacy Policy in a way that differs materially and adversely from this Privacy Policy, we will post such changes here and we may request your consent or approval before implementing the change with respect to PII that you provided to us before the change in policy.

**Transfer of Your Information to the United States of America and Other Countries**  
Our Services are primarily maintained in the United States of America, where PII is stored and processed to provide our Services and for our operations. Vonage also has limited-purpose offices in the United Kingdom. We and/or our service providers also process data in some other countries for customer care, account management and service provisioning. When you sign up for Service with Vonage or inquire about our Services, we transfer your information to the United States and other countries as necessary to perform our agreement with you or to respond to an inquiry you make. Accordingly, by using our Services, you authorize the transfer of your PII to the United States, where we are based, and to other locations where we and/or our service providers operate, and to its (and their) storage and use as specified in this Privacy Policy and any applicable Terms of Service or other agreement between you and Vonage. In some cases, Vonage may seek specific consent for the use or transfer of your information overseas at the time of collection. If you do not consent, we may be unable to provide you with the Services you requested. The United States and other countries where we operate may not have protections for PII equivalent to those in your home country.

**Your California Privacy Rights**  
California's "Shine the Light" law, Civil Code section 1798.83, requires certain businesses to respond to requests from California Consumers asking about the businesses' practices related to disclosing personal information to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. Alternately, such businesses may have in place a policy, as we do, only to disclose personal information of Consumers to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes if the Consumer has opted into such information-sharing.

**Questions and Contact Information**  
To contact us regarding:

  * Consumer Service: Call **1-VONAGE-HELP (1-866-243-4357)** (United States); or
