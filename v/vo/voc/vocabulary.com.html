<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>This privacy policy explains how Vocabulary.com 
     	("Vocabulary.com", "We", or "Us") collects and uses personal information that you ("you" or "your") 
     	  provide on the Vocabulary.com website and on the Vocabulary.com App (collectively "Vocabulary.com"). 
     	  This privacy policy was last updated on January 24th, 2016.</p>


        <h2>Guiding Principles</h2>
        <p>Our privacy policy is guided by the following principles:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>We’re committed to creating a safe and secure online environment for you.</li>
            <li>We do not sell your personal information to third parties.</li>
            <li>We collect very little personally identifiable information about you, and what we do collect we store securely. </li>
            <li>We believe that ultimately, you own your data, and that, whenever possible, you get to decide whether to take it with you, even if your account was provided by someone else, such as your school. </li>
            <li>We believe that improving your vocabulary is a worthwhile lifelong pursuit. Therefore, unless you tell us otherwise, we will keep your learning history so that we can continue to personalize your experience over time. </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>How we collect data</h2>
        <p>Vocabulary.com collects the following information about you and your use of Vocabulary.com:</p>

        <h3>Personal Information</h3>
        <p>When you register for Vocabulary.com, you provide to us personal information  (such as your full name, email address, grade level and school affiliation) that could be used to identify you.

If you do not want to be identified, do not use any part of your real name as your nickname.</p>
        <p>If you provide your school affiliation to Vocabulary.com, or if you elect to join a Class created by an Educator, we may share some of your personal information (including your learning history), with the creator of the Class, other members of that Class, or with Administrators at your school or school district.  If you do not wish to share this information, do not join a class or do not provide your school affiliation.</p>

        <h3>Advertising is not shown to Users Properly Associated with School or District Accounts</h3>
        <p>If you join a class owned by a teacher who is part of a paid school or district account, or you use a registered authentication provider that is linked to a paid school or district account, we will not serve ads to you on Vocabulary.com.</p>
        
        
        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <p>Data security is important to us.</p>
        
        <h3>We try to ensure that Vocabulary.com and the information sent to us are safe, but no security measures are perfect.</h3>
        <p>Vocabulary.com uses certain physical, managerial, and technical safeguards designed to preserve the integrity and security of your Personal Information and other information we maintain in connection with Vocabulary.com. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any or all of the information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, we makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. We encrypt the transmission of all data using secure socket layer technology (SSL) or similar technologies. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.</p>
        
        
        <h2>We will notify you electronically or via the website if Vocabulary.com experiences a data security incident that could affect you.</h2>
        <p>If we learn of a data security incident that compromises or appears to compromise your Personal Information, then we will attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. If you are a paid School or District customer, we will notify you electronically of any data security incident that affects your students. We may also post a notice on Vocabulary.com if a data security incident occurs.</p>
        
        
        <h2>Data Retention</h2>
        <p>Unless we receive a deletion request from you or your parent or are contractually required to delete your account due to our business relationship with your school or district, we will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as is reasonably useful for operational or educational purposes.</p>
        <p>
            If you are a School or District that has a paid account with Vocabulary.com, and you’d like to request that we delete student information that you have provided us, 
            please contact <a href="/help/contactus">our support team</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you have an account provided by a School or District, and would like to transfer the information to a personal account, please contact <a href="/help/contactus">our support team</a>.

        <h2>Technical Information</h2>
        <p>To provide a personalized learning and high-quality experience, we may use various technologies that automatically record certain technical information from your browser or device, including standard log files, web beacons, or pixel tags. This technical information may include your Internet Protocol (IP) address, device or browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring or exit pages, clickstream data, operating system, and the dates and times that you visit Vocabulary.com. We do this to better understand how you are using Vocabulary.com so we can improve functionality and the services we offer you.</p>
        <p>Like most websites, whether or not you are a registered member, we may send one or more cookies – small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters – to your computer. Cookies remember information about your activities on a website and enable us to provide you with a more personalized learning experience. Vocabulary.com may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie disappears automatically after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to Vocabulary.com. You can, however, remove a persistent cookie at any time. Please review your web browser “Help” file to learn the proper way to modify your cookie settings. However, without cookies you will not have access to certain services and features on Vocabulary.com.</p>
        <p>Vocabulary.com uses a variety of third-party service providers, such as Google Analytics to understand usage. We may allow third-party service providers to place and read their own cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies to collect information through Vocabulary.com. This information is collected directly and automatically by these third parties, and Vocabulary.com does not participate in these data transmissions. Vocabulary.com will, wherever feasible, contractually obligate our third-party service providers to abide by the terms of this Privacy Notice.</p>
        <p>Vocabulary.com also uses Local Storage Objects (LSOs) such as HTML5 to store content information and preferences. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on Vocabulary.com may use LSOs such as HTML5 to collect and store information. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LSOs. Please consult your browser’s “Help” function to learn more.</p>
        
        
        <h2>Children</h2>
        
        <h3>Vocabulary.com is committed to children’s privacy.</h3>
        <p>
            For this reason, we provide a limited feature set to Children under 13 (“Child Users”). We do not knowingly let children under 13 register directly to Vocabulary.com. If you are a parent who discovers that your child has registered to Vocabulary.com without your consent, please contact us at 
            <a href="mailto:support@vocabulary.com" target="_blank">support@vocabulary.com</a>, and request that we delete the child’s personal information from our systems.
        </p>
        
        <h3>How Child Users May Register and Use Vocabulary.com</h3>
        <p>All Child Users who sign up must provide a parent's email address. The parent is then notified that the child has signed up to use Vocabulary.com. We ask that children chose a username that is not their real name. </p>
        <p>Alternatively, a child can be registered to use Vocabulary.com through his or her school, or through an Authentication Provider that is supported by the child’s school, or by teachers, tutors and other similar adults who assist in the educational process who have taken steps to obtain parental consent. Parents always have the option to delete their Child User’s account.</p>
        <p>If a school or district has provided this information, both parties agree to uphold their responsibilities under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (“FERPA”), the Protection of Pupil Rights Amendment (“PPRA”), and the Children’s Online Privacy and Protection Act (“COPPA”). We provide the Services as an outsourced institutional function under FERPA 34 CFR Part 99.31(a)(1). The Children’s Online Privacy and Protection Act (“COPPA”) requires that online service providers obtain clear and verifiable parental consent before collecting personal information from children under 13. You represent and warrant that you have received consent from parents, or have the authority to provide consent on behalf of parents, for us to receive Personal Information related to children under 13. We recommend that all schools provide appropriate disclosures to students and parents regarding their use of service providers such as Vocabulary.com and that they provide a link to our Privacy Policy to parents and guardians.</p>
        
        <h3>Restrictions on Child Users</h3>
        <p>Children are restricted from certain parts of Vocabulary.com. For example, children cannot comment on articles. In addition, we do not collect children's email addresses (unless they are provided by an Authentication Provider or by the child’s school), so all email communication from Vocabulary.com will be sent to the parent's email address.</p>
        <p>Some other features of Vocabulary.com, however, may permit a Child User to enter free-form text through which the Child User could enter Personal information that would be visible to other Users. This may occur, for example, when a child names his or her word list, or enters his or her notes or sentence examples on a word list. If you are a parent, please advise your child about the risks of posting Personal Information on Vocabulary.com (or any other online service).</p>
        <p>If you are a parent, and you agree to let your child use Vocabulary.com, you agree and acknowledge that you permit your child to use Vocabulary.com and all features made available on Vocabulary.com as fully contemplated by us. As a parent, you understand that any personally identifiable information that your child provides in connection with registration or otherwise may be used by us as provided in this Privacy Policy. Except where the context indicates otherwise, the remainder of this Privacy Policy (including any discussion of the personally identifiable information that we may collect, use or disclose) shall apply equally to a Child User account and an account for someone over 13.</p>
        <p>If you are an educator and you add a student who is under 13 to your class, you acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, including, but not limited to, obtaining parental consent concerning collection of students' personal information used in connection with the provisioning and use of Vocabulary.com.</p>
        
        <h3>California Children’s Privacy Rights</h3>
        <p>
            If you are under the age of 18, or the parent of a User under the age of 18, residing in California, you are entitled to request removal of content or information you have posted on Vocabulary.com. If you would like to request removal of your or your child’s content or information, please email us at <a href="mailto:support@vocabulary.com" target="_blank">support@vocabulary.com</a>
            for assistance. Please note that removal of your content or information does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal, as there may be deidentified or recoverable elements of your content or information on our servers in some form. Additionally, we will not remove content or information that we may be required to retain under applicable federal and state laws.
        </p>
        
        
        <h2>Communication from Vocabulary.com</h2>
        
        <h3>Customer Service</h3>
        <p>Based upon Personal Information you provide us, we will send you a welcoming email to verify your email address and password.  We will also communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, and to manage your account. We will communicate with you by email only.</p>
        
        <h3>Service-related Announcements</h3>
        <p>We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so.  For instance, if Vocabulary.com is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email.</p>
        <p>Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature.</p>
        
        <h3>Weekly Update Emails</h3>
        <p>If you have registered for Vocabulary.com, we may send you a periodic email that includes a personalized vocabulary question, and information about new content on Vocabulary.com. If you have registered for Vocabulary.com and identified yourself as an educator, we may send you a personalized email that describes your students’ use of Vocabulary.com. You may opt out of these emails. (Please see "Choice and Opt-out")</p>
        
        <h3>Other Emails</h3>
        <p>You may opt in to receive other emails, such as comment notifications or emails when new material comes out on the blog. You may opt out of these emails. (Please see "Choice and Opt-out")</p>
        
        <h3>Special Offers and Updates</h3>
        <p>We will occasionally send you information on products, services, special deals, and promotions. You may opt out of these emails.  (Please see "Choice and Opt-out")</p>
       
       
        <h2>Choice and Opt Out</h2>
        <p>
            We provide you the opportunity to ‘opt-out’ of having your Personal Information used for certain purposes, when we ask for this information.  For example, if you no longer wish to receive certain communications from us, 
            you may opt-out of receiving them by either changing <a href="/account/emailprefs">the email preferences</a>
            section of the <a href="/account/">My Account</a>
            section, or through clicking on the provided link on any communication that we send.
        </p>

        <h2>Changes to this Privacy Statement</h2>
        <p>If we decide to change our privacy practices, we will modify this Privacy Policy so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.</p>
        <p>We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time, so please review it frequently.</p>
