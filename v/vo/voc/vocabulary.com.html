<font size="5" color="#880088"><b>Vocabulary University - Information &amp; Privacy Policy </b></font>
<p>

Vocabulary University is committed to preserving the privacy and security of its participants. Information about visitors will not be sold or provided to third parties. Participants information is collected only to enhance the experience of the participant and subsequent participants.
</p><p>

</p><li><b>Information:</b><br>
Vocabulary University is strongly committed to preserving the privacy and security of its participants in our interactive products and services. In general, our service automatically gathers certain usage information like the numbers and frequency of visitors to WWW.VOCABULARY.COM and its areas, very much like television ratings that tell the networks how many people tuned in to a program. We only use such data in the aggregate. This collective data helps us determine how much our customers use parts of the site, so we can improve our site to assure that it is appealing as we can make it for as many of you as possible.
<p>

</p></li><li><b>Disclosure:</b><br>
Our policy is to respect and protect the privacy of our participants. Vocabulary University will never willfully disclose individually identifiable information, that you give to us, about our participants to any third party without first receiving that participant's permission.<br>
We may ask you for information about your interests so that both you and we can take advantage of the interactivity of the online medium, but you may always choose to respond or not.<br>
In addition, we may provide you with the opportunity to list your school or other affiliation information in one of the directories on our service. These listings are optional and you can make changes to or eliminate this information when you want to.<br>
To receive your diploma from one of the University's programs we will need your name, address and email so we can keep track and inform you of your progress toward your degree, and notify you with University updates.<br>
<p>

</p></li><li><b>Special Attention to Kids:</b><br>
Vocabulary University encourages parents and guardians to spend time online in cyberspace with their children and to participate in the activities offered on the VOCAB U. site. Vocabulary University takes special care to protect the safety and privacy of young people using our services. We are an active supporter of COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act).
<ul><li>If you are 12 years old or younger, <b>BEFORE</b> you give out personal information, we at VOCAB U. need your parent's permission first. Please have your parents send us an <a href="mailto: jancook@vocabulary.com">email</a> saying it's OK for you to be part of the <b>"VU student-player team"</b>.</li></ul>
We do not specifically collect information about children and believe that children should get their parent's consent before giving out any personal information. Parents should review the World Wide Web's readily available safety tips before their child explores the Internet.<br>
<p>

</p></li><li><b>Vocabulary University's Privacy Policy Changes:</b><br>
If we decide to change our privacy policy for WWW.VOCABULARY.COM, we will post those changes here so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information and whether we will disclose it to anyone.<br>
<p>

Questions regarding the above statement should be directed to <a href="mailto:jancook@vocabulary.com?subject=Privacy Policy questions">Jan and Carey Cook</a> at Vocabulary University for clarification.
