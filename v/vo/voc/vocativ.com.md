The Policy describes the ways we collect and use your personal information on Vocativ and the rights and options available to you with respect to your information.

This policy is incorporated by reference to Vocativ’s [Terms of Use](http://www.vocativ.com/terms-use/) (the “ **Terms** “), and constitutes an integral part of them.

Registration is not mandatory for using Vocativ. However, certain features on Vocativ are only available to registered users.

When you register to Vocativ, we will ask you to provide certain personal details, such as your e-mail address, nickname of your choice and an optional profile image. Bear in mind that false, incorrect, or outdated information may impair our ability to provide you with Vocativ and contact you when necessary. We will explicitly indicate the fields for mandatory completion. If you do not enter the requisite information in these fields, you may not be able to register to Vocativ.
