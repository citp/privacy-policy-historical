About SG Vogue and the Information We Collect   
SG Vogue is an online social networking community that connects people through networks of friends for dating or making new friends. To accomplish this, our users create their own profiles which are shown to the people in their personal network. A personal network consists of a user?s friends as well as the extended group of people that a user is connected to via chains of mutual friends. To fulfill the purpose of this site, some personal information we ask for is displayed to people within these personal networks.

Use of Information Obtained by SG Vogue 

Information users submit to SG Vogue 

Profile information as well as first name and photos are displayed to people in a user's personal network, to support the function of the site as social networking community where users can meet new people through their friends. Email address and full name are used when a user invites a friend via email to join the service, when a user requests to add another user to their friend list, and when we send notifications to a user related to their use of the service. Except when inviting or adding friends, a user's email address is not shared or displayed with people within a user's personal network. Users within a personal network communicate on SG Vogue with each other through the SG Vogue service, without disclosing email addresses. We may also use a user's email address to send weekly updates or news regarding our site, but the user may choose not to receive email of this type by accessing their Account Info.

Invite a Friend 

If a user elects to use our Invite feature to invite a friend to our site, we ask them for the friend's email address. SG Vogue will automatically send the friend an email inviting them to join the site. SG Vogue stores this email address for the purpose of automatically adding the respondant to the friends list of the user sending the invitation, and also to send reminders of the invitation. SG Vogue does not sell these email addresses or use them to send any other communication besides invitations and invitation reminders. The friend may contact SG Vogue to request the removal of this information from our database.
