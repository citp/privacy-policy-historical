  and clients with the highest possible standards of product and service. As
  part of that commitment we have produced the following privacy policy statement
  to help you better understand the privacy issues that arise as a result of
  the use of our website products and services.</p>
<p>This policy statement will address the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The types of information we collect 
  </li><li>How we use or disclose the information we collect 
  </li><li>The quality and security of the information we hold 
  </li><li>Your access to the information we hold

<p><b class="subheads">The types of information we collect </b><br>
  In general, when you visit our websites you do not have to tell us who you are,
  or reveal any personally identifiable information to us. Unless you specifically
  agree to tell us, we will never know who you are, and you are able to interact
  with our websites in a completely anonymous way.</p>
<p>Personally identifiable information is defined as any specific data that could
  disclose you as an individual, such as your name, address, telephone number,
billing and shipping information, credit card information or e-mail address.</p>
<p>When you visit our websites our servers automatically record basic information
  about your usage, such as the type of internet browser and operating system
  you are using, the date, time and duration of your visit and the pages you
  viewed. This information is anonymous and does not identify you as an individual,
  nor will we combine it with information that does identify you as an individual.
  This information is collected and analysed to provide us with a greater understanding
  of how you use our websites. </p>
<p>Where necessary we collect personally identifiable information on certain
  areas of our websites, for example, if you register on a forum, enter a competition
  or subscribe to an e-mail newsletter. The personally identifiable information
  collected may consist of a username or unique user ID and contact information,
  such as your name, email address, mailing address, telephone and fax numbers.
  You may have the opportunity to make purchases on our websites, in which case
  we would need to collect your order information, credit card details and delivery
  instructions in order to facilitate payment and shipment.</p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0px">From time to time a pop-up window may invite you to answer
  survey questions and provide certain demographic information, such as your
  age, sex, income bracket, country of access, and location of connection, (e.g.
  home or work).</p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0px">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0px">Your response to these types of surveys is entirely voluntary
    and you should feel no obligation to participate.</p>
<p>At times we may use a feature of your browser (called a "cookie") to automatically
  assign you a unique user ID. A cookie, by itself, cannot be used to find out
  your identity, it merely identifies your computer to our servers when you visit
  our websites. We will not combine your user ID with information that does identify
  you as an individual. You may, at anytime, set your browser to allow, notify
  you or refuse altogether the use of cookies.</p>
