For certain services, we may also request a credit card number, government identification number, or other financial information.

We receive and store any information you enter on our website or give us in any other way, including through email, telephone, or other communications with our customer service department. If you contact us for support, we will keep an internal record of what support was given.

We use your information to contact you regarding changes to our products, our website, new services, and special offers we think you'll find valuable. If you would rather not receive this information, please see the "Updating Your Information" section below on how to change your preferences.

We use information gathered about you from our website statistics (for example, your IP address) to help diagnose problems with our webserver, and to administer our website. We also gather broad demographic information from this data to help us improve our website and make your experience more enjoyable. This is not linked to any personally identifiable information, except as necessary to prevent fraud or abuse on our system.
