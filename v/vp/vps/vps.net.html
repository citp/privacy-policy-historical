<p>This Privacy Policy explains how Hosting  Services, Inc. (HSI) DBA vps.net collects, uses, maintains and discloses  information collected from our customers, visitors to our websites, individuals  who contact us and visitors to our customers’ websites (all: “User” or  “Users”). Please review our Privacy Policy in conjunction with our Acceptable  Use Policy (AUP) and, if applicable, your contract with us. The purpose of this  Privacy Policy is to provide Users with an understanding of what types of  information we collect, how we treat it, and choices they may have related to  this information. We reserve the right to change our Privacy Policy at any  time. Any changes to this Privacy Policy, other than necessary to remedy  typographical errors, will be announced on our home page, as well as in email  to the primary address Users have on file with us.</p>
<h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Orders</strong>
    <br>
    <br>
    If Users purchase a  product or service from us, we request personal information from them on our  order form. Users must provide contact information (such as name, email and  mailing address) and financial information (such as credit card number, CVV and  expiration date). During the purchase process, Users may provide optional  information to us. If that information is provided, it is covered by this  Privacy Policy; however, providing it is voluntary. Credit card information is  made secure by a High-grade Encryption (AES-256, 256 bit keys) Comodo SSL  Certificate.<br>
    <br>
We use this information  for billing purposes and to fill a User’s orders. If we have trouble processing  an order, we will use this information to contact the User.
  </li><br>
  <li><strong>Customer Testimonials <br>
    <br>
  </strong>We post User’s  testimonials/comments/reviews on our website which may contain personal  information. We do obtain the User’s consent via email prior to posting the  testimonial to post their name along with their testimonial. Users may contact us  in writing at <a href="mailto:sales@vps.net">sales@vps.net</a> to have their testimonial removed. We will remove  it in 30 days.</li><br>
  <li><strong>Tell-A-Friend <br>
    <br>
  </strong>If Users choose to use  our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask the User for  their friend's name and email address. We will automatically send the User’s  friend the User’s personal message via email. HSI stores this information for  the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our  referral program. Users or the User’s friend may request deletion of this  information by contacting us in writing at <a href="mailto:sales@vps.net">sales@vps.net</a>. This information will  be removed in 30 days.</li><br>
  <li><strong>Customer Service <br>
    <br>
  </strong>We will communicate  with Users in response to their inquiries, to provide the services they  request, and to manage the Users’ account. We will communicate with Users by  email or telephone, in accordance with their wishes.</li><br>
  <li>    <strong>Surveys or Contests<br>
    <br>
    </strong>From time-to-time we  may provide Users the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys. If  Users choose to participate, we may request certain personal information from  them. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and  Users therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The  requested information may include contact information, demographic information,  and personal preferences. We may use a third party service provider to conduct  these surveys or contests; that provider is prohibited from using our Users' personal  information for any other purpose. Users may request deletion of this  information by contacting us in writing at <a href="mailto:sales@vps.net">sales@vps.net</a>.</li><br>
  <li><strong>Registration and Support <br>
    <br>
  </strong>The forms found on our  website are used to gather contact information (such as name, email address,  billing information, and phone number) of Users to process orders, respond to  questions and requests. If Users need to change their personal account  information, they may update it by making the change in their account.<br><br>
  We do not intentionally  collect information from children under the age of 13.<br><br>
  HSI keeps records of  User interaction and support provided (via chat, phone, and email) to track  account history and better assist our Users. When Users contact HSI for support  for their services, Users will be asked to match certain information that is in  their Registration Information. This Registration Information will be used to  identify Users personally. In the course of providing support to Users, HSI may  annotate the Registration Information with information disclosed while  providing support (Support Information).<br><br>
  Support Information may  identify Users individually. In addition to providing support to Users, HSI may  disclose Support Information to third-party vendors in order to provide the  support requested by Users. These third parties may disclose and use Support  Information to improve their business processes and for marketing. Unless  necessary to provide support to Users, HSI will not disclose Support  Information containing information that identifies Users individually to these  third parties. During a support request, Users may request that HSI not  disclose Support Information to third parties. This request will prevent HSI  from providing support to Users.<br><br>
We  rely on the following legal basis, under data protection law, to process your personal  information:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Because  the processing is necessary to perform a contract with you, or take steps prior  to entering into a contract with you (e.g. where you have made a purchase with  us, we use your personal information to process the payment and fulfil your  order).</li>
  <li>Because  we have obtained your consent (e.g. where you contact us with a query, where  you add optional information to your account profile, or if you consent to  receive marketing from us).</li>
  <li>Because  it is in our legitimate interests as an information technology provider to  maintain and promote our services. We are always seeking to understand more  about our customers in order to offer the best products and customer  experience, so we use information about you to tailor your view of our website,  to make it more interesting and relevant in respect of the products and offers  on view. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Marketing &amp; Email  Correspondence</h4>
<p>HSI will use Users’ names and email addresses  to send newsletters to them. These newsletters include information on  promotions, services, and company information. We  will contact you for marketing purposes where we have your consent or on the  basis that it is necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interests. Out of respect for User  privacy, we provide Users a way to unsubscribe in each promotional email.<br><br>
  We will send Users service-related  announcements on occasion when it is necessary to do so; for example, if there  is network maintenance, Users will receive an email. Users may opt out of these  communications by clicking the unsubscribe link provided.<br><br>
  If Users do not want to receive our newsletter  and promotional communications, they may opt out of receiving them by following  the instructions included in each newsletter or communication or by emailing us  at: <a href="mailto:sales@vps.net">sales@vps.net</a>.</p>
<h4>Third-Party Sharing</h4>
<p>We will share Users’ personal information with  third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy. These  third parties include credit card processors, technology vendors chosen by  Users to be included in the services, and bandwidth providers. We do not sell  User personal information to third parties except as described in this Privacy  Policy. We may also disclose User personal information: </p>
<ul>
  <li>as  required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process; </li>
  <li>to  parent, associated and subsidiary companies of HSI, as necessary to provide the  services and assist with our business operations;</li>
  <li>when  we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights,  protect User safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a  government request; or </li>
  <li>to  any other third party with the User’s prior consent to do so.</li>
</ul>
<p>HSI may aggregate  information covered by this Privacy Policy and disclose it outside our  business. This information will not identify Users individually.</p>
<p>  Where we have  responsibility for processing Users’ personal information and we transfer such personal  information to a third party agent who is acting on our behalf, we will, under  the Privacy Shield Principles, remain liable if our third party agent fails to  process such personal information in a manner consistent with the Privacy  Shield Principles unless we prove that we are not responsible for the event  giving rise to the damage.</p>
<h4>Linked/Advertiser Sites</h4>
<p>From time-to-time, we may include links or  banners for third-party sites, including sites that advertise. This privacy  policy does not govern the information these sites collect when you visit them.  These sites may know that you have visited them from our site.</p>
<h4>Security</h4>
<p>The security of Users’ personal information is  important to us. We use commercially reasonable standards to protect the  personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we  receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of  electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. When Users enter sensitive  information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission  of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). Electronic  communication (for example: email, online chat, or instant messaging) that  Users may send HSI may not be secure unless HSI advises Users in advance that  security measures will be in place prior to transmitting the information. Users  should not send confidential information such as financial information, social  security numbers or passwords to HSI through unsecured electronic  communication.</p>
<h4>Overseas  Transfers of Personal Information</h4>
<p>  HSI needs to store your personal information  and payment information on databases in the US. HSI complies with the EU-U.S.  Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce (<a href="https://www.commerce.gov/page/eu-us-privacy-shield" target="_blank">https://www.commerce.gov/page/eu-us-privacy-shield</a>) regarding the  collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the  European Union to the United States. HSI has certified to the Department of  Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles. If there is any  conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield  Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the  Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit&nbsp;<a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/" target="_blank">https://www.privacyshield.gov/</a>.</p>
<h4>Data Retention</h4>
<p>We will retain User’s information for as long  as their account is active or as needed to provide Users services. If Users  wish to cancel their account or request that we no longer use their information  to provide them services, contact us at <a href="mailto:billing@vps.net">billing@vps.net</a>. We will retain and use  User information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve  disputes, and enforce our agreements. Following termination of the Users’  agreement with us, Users will have no access to this information, and we may  delete it for any reason, at any time.</p>
<h4>Your Rights</h4>
<p>If  you are a user based in the European Economic Area (EEA), you may have certain  rights in respect of your personal information, including the right to access,  correct, and request the erasure of your personal information. </p>
<p>  Upon written request, we provide Users with  access to personal information they have provided to us. In most cases, we will  need verify your identity by further means. Users can access this information  by e-mailing us at <a href="mailto:billing@vps.net">billing@vps.net</a>. If Users are having trouble accessing the  contact address above, our customer support team can assist them, and they can  be contacted at 1-888-395-0752. Users may also contact us at the address below  to correct, amend or delete information we maintain about them. </p>
<p>  We  will comply with any requests to exercise your rights in accordance with applicable  law. Please be aware, however, that there are a number of limitations to these  rights, and there may be circumstances where we are not able to comply with  your request. To make any requests regarding your personal information, or if  you have any questions or concerns regarding your personal information, you  should contact us using the details below. You are also entitled to raise your  concerns with your local supervisory authority for data protection. Furthermore,  Hosting Services, Inc.

<h4>Business Transitions</h4>
<p>In the event HSI goes through a business  transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or  a portion of its assets, Users’ personal information will likely be among the  assets transferred. Users will be notified via e-mail of any such change in  ownership or control of their personal information.</p>
