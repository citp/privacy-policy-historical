Information We Collect</strong></p>        <p>Our primary purpose in collecting personal information is to provide you with   a smooth, efficient, safer and customised trading experience. This allows us to   provide services and features that most likely meet your needs, and to customise   our services to make your experience safer and easier. We only collect personal   information about you that we consider necessary for this purpose and to achieve   this goal. </p>        <p>To fully use our services, you will need to register using our online   registration form, where you will be required to provide us with your contact   information and other personal information. You are also required to provide us   with a User ID and Password. We use your financial information, including credit   card information to verify your name, address, and other contact information, as   well as to bill you for your use of our services. </p>        <p>We automatically track certain information about you based upon your usage of   our Site. We use this information to do internal research on our users'   demographics, interests, and behaviour to better understand and serve you and   our community. This information is compiled and analysed on an aggregated basis.   The information shall not contain anything that is personably identifiable about   you. This information may include the URL that you just came from (whether this   URL is on our Site or not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on our   Site or not), what browser you are using, and your IP address. </p>        <p>You may encounter "cookies" or other similar devices on certain pages of our   Site that are placed by third parties. We do not control the use of cookies by   third parties. </p>        <p>If you send us correspondence, such as emails or letters, or if other users   or third parties send us correspondence about your activities or postings on the   Site, we may collect such information into a file specific to you. </p>        <p>If you register for vPOST on another web site or use a web site providing a   service for vPOST or a web site that helps facilitate your activity on vPOST,   that web site may provide personal information about you and your transactions   back to vPOST. </p>        <p><strong><a id="info_use" name="info_use"></a>3. Our Use of Your Information </strong></p>        <p>We use personal information about you (including but not limited to the   information in the file we maintain about you, and other information we obtain   from your current and past activities on the Site) to resolve disputes,   troubleshoot problems, help ensure safe trading on our Site, and enforce our   User Agreement. At times, we may look across multiple users to identify problems   or resolve disputes, and in particular we may examine your information to   identify users using multiple User IDs or aliases. </p>        <p>You agree that we may use personal information about you to improve our   marketing and promotional efforts, to analyse Site usage, to improve our content   and product offerings and customise our Site's content, layout, and services.   These uses improve our Site and better tailor it to meet your needs, so as to   provide you with a smooth, efficient, safer and customised experience while   using our services. </p>        <p>You agree that we may use your information to contact you and deliver   information to you that, in some cases, is targeted to your interests, such as   targeted banners, administrative notices, product offerings, and communications   relevant to your use of the Site. By accepting the User Agreement and Privacy   Policy you expressly agree to receive this information. </p>        <p><strong><a id="disclosure" name="disclosure"></a>4. Our Disclosure of Your   Information</strong></p>        <p>Although vPOST uses industry standard practices to protect your personal   information, due to technical limitations, we cannot ensure that all of your   private communications and other personal information will never be disclosed in   ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. By way of example (without   limiting the foregoing), we may be forced to disclose information to the   government or third parties under certain circumstances (further details of   which are set out below in the "Legal Requests" section), or third parties may   unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications.   Therefore, although we use industry standard practices to protect your privacy,   we cannot and do not guarantee, and you should not expect, that your personal   information or private communications will always remain private. </p>        <p>As a matter of policy, we do not sell or rent any personal information about   you to any third party. However, the following describes some of the ways that   your personal information may be disclosed, and by agreeing to the User   Agreement and Privacy Policy you expressly agree that your personal information   may be disclosed by vPOST in the following ways: </p>        <p><a id="advertisers" name="advertisers"></a><strong>Advertisers.</strong> We   aggregate (gather up data across all user accounts) personal information and   disclose such information in a non-personally identifiable manner to advertisers   and other third parties for marketing and promotional purposes. However, in   these situations, we do not disclose to these entities any information that   could be used to identify you personally. Certain information, such as your   name, email address and password are never disclosed to advertisers. </p>        <p><a id="community" name="community"></a><strong>vPOST Community.</strong> Throughout the Site, you are identified by your User ID. If you select your   email address as your User ID you will disclose your email address to other   users and third parties. As a result, other users and third parties might send   you unsolicited email and be able to personally identify all of your activities   on the Site. We describe how to change your User ID. Even if your User ID is not   your email address, your User ID can be used to identify you and your activities   throughout the Site. <a id="external_sps" name="external_sps"></a></p>        <p><a id="other_corps" name="other_corps"></a><strong>Other Corporate   Entities</strong> . We share much of our data, including personal information   about you, with our subsidiaries and joint ventures that are committed to   serving your online trading needs and related services, throughout the world, as   allowed by applicable law. To the extent that these entities have access to your   information, they will treat it at least as protectively as they treat   information they obtain from their members and users. Our subsidiaries and joint   ventures follow privacy practices no less protective of all users than our   practices described in this Privacy Policy, to the extent allowed by applicable   law. It is possible that vPOST, its subsidiaries, its joint ventures, or any   combination of such, could merge with or be acquired by another business entity.   Should such a combination occur, you should expect that vPOST would share some   or all of your information in order to continue to provide the service. You will   receive notice of such event (to the extent it occurs) and we will require that   the new combined entity follow the practices disclosed in this Privacy   Policy.<br>        </p>        <p id="legal_requests" name="legal_requests"><a id="legal_requests" name="legal_requests"></a><strong>Legal Requests</strong> . vPOST may lawfully   disclose your personal information for law enforcement or regulatory purposes.   vPOST cooperates with law enforcement inquires and other third parties to   enforce laws, intellectual property and other rights. We can (and you authorise   us to) disclose any information about you to law enforcement or other   governmental officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary,   appropriate or as otherwise permitted under applicable laws, in connection with   an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, piracy or other   activity that is illegal or may expose us to legal liability. Further, we can   (and by becoming an vPOST member you authorise us to) disclose your UserID,   name, street address, city, state, post code, country, phone number, email and   company as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate, in   connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringement,   piracy or other activity that may expose us to legal liability or as otherwise   permitted under applicable laws.</p>        <p><strong><a id="user_info" name="user_info"></a>5. Your Use of Other Users'   Information</strong></p>        <p>By entering into our User Agreement, you agree to respect to other users'   personal information that you obtain through the Site or through a vPOST-related   communication or vPOST-facilitated transaction. </p>        <p>In addition, under no circumstances will you disclose personal information   about another user to any third party without our consent and the consent of   such other user after adequate disclosure. Note that law enforcement personnel   and other rights holders are given different rights with respect to information   they access. </p>        <p>We and our users do not tolerate spam. </p>        <p><a id="password" name="password"></a><strong>6. Control of Your Password </strong></p>        <p>You are responsible for all actions taken with your User ID and password,   including fees. Therefore we do not recommend that you disclose your vPOST   password to any third parties. If you choose to share your User ID and password   or your information with third parties to provide you additional services, you   agree that you are responsible for all actions taken with your User ID and   password and therefore you should review that third party's privacy policy. If   you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your   personal information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your   behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you   should immediately change your password and notify vPOST .</p>        <p><a id="change_info" name="change_info"></a><strong>7. Accessing, Reviewing and   Changing Your Personal Information. </strong></p>        <p>Following registration, you can review and change the information you   submitted during registration including: </p>        Your User ID and email address If you change your User ID we may keep   track of your old User ID(s) and your new User ID.        <p>Your registration information such as: name, company, address, city, state,   post code, country, primary phone number, secondary phone number, fax number and   gender. </p>        <p>Your password(if you have supplied such information). </p>        <p>Your credit card number and expiration date, and other financial information. </p>        <p>Upon your request, we will deactivate your account, contact information, and   financial information from our active databases. To make this request, please   email to vPOST. Such information will be deactivated as soon as reasonably   possible in accordance with our deactivation policy and applicable law. </p>        <p>We will retain in our files information you have requested to remove in some   circumstances, such as to prevent fraud, resolve disputes, troubleshoot   problems, assist with any investigations, and enforce our User Agreement, and to   comply with legal requirements. Therefore, you should not expect that all of   your personal information will be completely removed from our databases in   response to your requests. However, such information will be deactivated from   public viewing and usage by other members of vPOST and will only be available to   select vPOST personnel. </p>        <p><a id="other_collectors" name="other_collectors"></a><strong>8. Other Information   Collectors </strong></p>        <p>Except as otherwise expressly discussed in this Privacy Policy, this document   only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. To the   extent that you disclose your information to other parties, whether they are   buyers on our Site or other sites throughout the Internet, different rules may   apply to their use or disclosure of the personal information you disclose to   them. To the extent that we use third party advertisers, they adhere to their   own privacy customs and policies. Since vPOST does not control the privacy   policies of third parties, you are subject to the privacy policies of that third   party. We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personal   information to others. </p>        <p><a id="security" name="security"></a><strong>9. Security - Secure Socket Layer   (SSL) Encryption </strong></p>        <p>We use industry standard efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your   personal information, such as firewalls and Secure Socket Layers (SSL).</p>        <p>vPOST is committed to protecting the confidentiality and integrity of   personal information you submit. Our secure server encrypts all personal   information (including name, address and contact details) so that it cannot be   read as the information travels over the Internet. </p>        <p>SSL protocol is used to safeguard your sensitive personal information during   online transactions. Using this widely accepted form of encryption, your   transaction is secured from your personal computer to the computer processing   your request. </p>        <p>As users enter the payment information, it is captured on a page that uses   the SSL protocol by default. All personal and financial information is encrypted   as it travels over the Internet. All financial information is stored in   encrypted form on our servers. The server is also not accessible through the   Internet. Security of your financial details will continue to be an issue of top   priority for our company. </p>        <p><a id="notice" name="notice"></a><strong>10. Notice </strong></p>  We may change   this Privacy Policy from time to time based on your comments and our need to   accurately reflect our data collection and disclosure practices. The revised   policy will be posted on this Site and shall take effect from the date of such   posting.      </div>        <div class="clear"></div>
