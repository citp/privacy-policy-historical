**1\. An Important Note About Children.**

Children (persons under the age of 15 years) are not eligible to become a vPOST member and use our services. We ask that children do not submit any personal information to us.

**2\. Information We Collect**

Our primary purpose in collecting personal information is to provide you with a smooth, efficient, safer and customised trading experience. This allows us to provide services and features that most likely meet your needs, and to customise our services to make your experience safer and easier. We only collect personal information about you that we consider necessary for this purpose and to achieve this goal. 

To fully use our services, you will need to register using our online registration form, where you will be required to provide us with your contact information and other personal information. You are also required to provide us with a User ID and Password. We use your financial information, including credit card information to verify your name, address, and other contact information, as well as to bill you for your use of our services. 

We automatically track certain information about you based upon your usage of our Site. We use this information to do internal research on our users' demographics, interests, and behaviour to better understand and serve you and our community. This information is compiled and analysed on an aggregated basis. The information shall not contain anything that is personably identifiable about you. This information may include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on our Site or not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on our Site or not), what browser you are using, and your IP address. 

You may encounter "cookies" or other similar devices on certain pages of our Site that are placed by third parties. We do not control the use of cookies by third parties. 

If you send us correspondence, such as emails or letters, or if other users or third parties send us correspondence about your activities or postings on the Site, we may collect such information into a file specific to you. 

If you register for vPOST on another web site or use a web site providing a service for vPOST or a web site that helps facilitate your activity on vPOST, that web site may provide personal information about you and your transactions back to vPOST. 

**3\. Our Use of Your Information**

We use personal information about you (including but not limited to the information in the file we maintain about you, and other information we obtain from your current and past activities on the Site) to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, help ensure safe trading on our Site, and enforce our User Agreement. At times, we may look across multiple users to identify problems or resolve disputes, and in particular we may examine your information to identify users using multiple User IDs or aliases. 

You agree that we may use personal information about you to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to analyse Site usage, to improve our content and product offerings and customise our Site's content, layout, and services. These uses improve our Site and better tailor it to meet your needs, so as to provide you with a smooth, efficient, safer and customised experience while using our services. 

You agree that we may use your information to contact you and deliver information to you that, in some cases, is targeted to your interests, such as targeted banners, administrative notices, product offerings, and communications relevant to your use of the Site. By accepting the User Agreement and Privacy Policy you expressly agree to receive this information. 

**4\. Our Disclosure of Your Information**

Although vPOST uses industry standard practices to protect your personal information, due to technical limitations, we cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personal information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. By way of example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be forced to disclose information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances (further details of which are set out below in the "Legal Requests" section), or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. Therefore, although we use industry standard practices to protect your privacy, we cannot and do not guarantee, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private. 

As a matter of policy, we do not sell or rent any personal information about you to any third party. However, the following describes some of the ways that your personal information may be disclosed, and by agreeing to the User Agreement and Privacy Policy you expressly agree that your personal information may be disclosed by vPOST in the following ways: 

**Advertisers.** We aggregate (gather up data across all user accounts) personal information and disclose such information in a non-personally identifiable manner to advertisers and other third parties for marketing and promotional purposes. However, in these situations, we do not disclose to these entities any information that could be used to identify you personally. Certain information, such as your name, email address and password are never disclosed to advertisers. 

**vPOST Community.** Throughout the Site, you are identified by your User ID. If you select your email address as your User ID you will disclose your email address to other users and third parties. As a result, other users and third parties might send you unsolicited email and be able to personally identify all of your activities on the Site. We describe how to change your User ID. Even if your User ID is not your email address, your User ID can be used to identify you and your activities throughout the Site. 

**Other Corporate Entities** . We share much of our data, including personal information about you, with our subsidiaries and joint ventures that are committed to serving your online trading needs and related services, throughout the world, as allowed by applicable law. To the extent that these entities have access to your information, they will treat it at least as protectively as they treat information they obtain from their members and users. Our subsidiaries and joint ventures follow privacy practices no less protective of all users than our practices described in this Privacy Policy, to the extent allowed by applicable law. It is possible that vPOST, its subsidiaries, its joint ventures, or any combination of such, could merge with or be acquired by another business entity. Should such a combination occur, you should expect that vPOST would share some or all of your information in order to continue to provide the service. You will receive notice of such event (to the extent it occurs) and we will require that the new combined entity follow the practices disclosed in this Privacy Policy.  


**Legal Requests** . vPOST may lawfully disclose your personal information for law enforcement or regulatory purposes. vPOST cooperates with law enforcement inquires and other third parties to enforce laws, intellectual property and other rights. We can (and you authorise us to) disclose any information about you to law enforcement or other governmental officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary, appropriate or as otherwise permitted under applicable laws, in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, piracy or other activity that is illegal or may expose us to legal liability. Further, we can (and by becoming an vPOST member you authorise us to) disclose your UserID, name, street address, city, state, post code, country, phone number, email and company as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate, in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringement, piracy or other activity that may expose us to legal liability or as otherwise permitted under applicable laws.

**5\. Your Use of Other Users' Information**

By entering into our User Agreement, you agree to respect to other users' personal information that you obtain through the Site or through a vPOST-related communication or vPOST-facilitated transaction. 

In addition, under no circumstances will you disclose personal information about another user to any third party without our consent and the consent of such other user after adequate disclosure. Note that law enforcement personnel and other rights holders are given different rights with respect to information they access. 

We and our users do not tolerate spam. 

**6\. Control of Your Password**

You are responsible for all actions taken with your User ID and password, including fees. Therefore we do not recommend that you disclose your vPOST password to any third parties. If you choose to share your User ID and password or your information with third parties to provide you additional services, you agree that you are responsible for all actions taken with your User ID and password and therefore you should review that third party's privacy policy. If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your personal information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately change your password and notify vPOST .

**7\. Accessing, Reviewing and Changing Your Personal Information.**

Following registration, you can review and change the information you submitted during registration including: 

Your User ID and email address If you change your User ID we may keep track of your old User ID(s) and your new User ID. 

Your registration information such as: name, company, address, city, state, post code, country, primary phone number, secondary phone number, fax number and gender. 

Your password(if you have supplied such information). 

Your credit card number and expiration date, and other financial information. 

Upon your request, we will deactivate your account, contact information, and financial information from our active databases. To make this request, please email to vPOST. Such information will be deactivated as soon as reasonably possible in accordance with our deactivation policy and applicable law. 

We will retain in our files information you have requested to remove in some circumstances, such as to prevent fraud, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, and enforce our User Agreement, and to comply with legal requirements. Therefore, you should not expect that all of your personal information will be completely removed from our databases in response to your requests. However, such information will be deactivated from public viewing and usage by other members of vPOST and will only be available to select vPOST personnel. 

**8\. Other Information Collectors**

Except as otherwise expressly discussed in this Privacy Policy, this document only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. To the extent that you disclose your information to other parties, whether they are buyers on our Site or other sites throughout the Internet, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the personal information you disclose to them. To the extent that we use third party advertisers, they adhere to their own privacy customs and policies. Since vPOST does not control the privacy policies of third parties, you are subject to the privacy policies of that third party. We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others. 

**9\. Security - Secure Socket Layer (SSL) Encryption**

We use industry standard efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal information, such as firewalls and Secure Socket Layers (SSL).

vPOST is committed to protecting the confidentiality and integrity of personal information you submit. Our secure server encrypts all personal information (including name, address and contact details) so that it cannot be read as the information travels over the Internet. 

SSL protocol is used to safeguard your sensitive personal information during online transactions. Using this widely accepted form of encryption, your transaction is secured from your personal computer to the computer processing your request. 

As users enter the payment information, it is captured on a page that uses the SSL protocol by default. All personal and financial information is encrypted as it travels over the Internet. All financial information is stored in encrypted form on our servers. The server is also not accessible through the Internet. Security of your financial details will continue to be an issue of top priority for our company. 

**10\. Notice**

We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time based on your comments and our need to accurately reflect our data collection and disclosure practices. The revised policy will be posted on this Site and shall take effect from the date of such posting.
