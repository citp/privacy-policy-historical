## 2\. WHAT PERSONAL DATA WE COLLECT AND HOW WE COLLECT IT

**IMPORTANT:** YOUR FAILURE TO PROVIDE CERTAIN PERSONAL DATA MAY MAKE OUR SERVICES OPERATE NOT AS INTENDED OR NOT OPERATE AT ALL FOR YOU. YOUR FAILURE TO PROVIDE CERTAIN PERSONAL DATA MAY ALSO MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO PROVIDE SOME OF OUR SERVICES TO YOU, BECAUSE OUR SERVICES REQUIRE CERTAIN MINIMUM PERSONAL DATA IN ORDER TO OPERATE AS WE INTEND. 

In Section 2(A-C) of this Privacy Policy, we provide categories of personal data that KeepSolid collects and how KeepSolid collects such personal data when you use the **Services**.   
In Section 2(D) of this Privacy Policy, we provide a description of KeepSolid’s “no logging” policy that applies when you use the **VPN Services**.   
In Section 2(E) of this Privacy Policy, we provide additional categories of personal data that KeepSolid collects and how KeepSolid collects such personal data when you use **KeepSolid Sign**. 

  1. PERSONAL DATA THAT YOU PROVIDE 

Upon your registration for and use of the Services, we collect certain personal data directly from you, in each case only if applicable, including the following:

We may also collect personal data, such as names and contact information, from third parties, such as marketing, research, sales lead generator companies, social networks, as well as from any publicly-accessible sources. We also collect your payment history regarding our Services (but not your payment information) from third-party payment processors, such as Google, Apple, PayPal, Amazon, Stripe, and Paymentwall.

  4. KEEPSOLID’S VPN SERVICES – NO LOGGING POLICY 

**As explained in this Section 2(D), KeepSolid does NOT monitor, store, or log your internet activities (including the internet sites that you visit) while using any of our VPN Services** , except the total amount of internet traffic for each session and session dates (this data is collected only if you use personal servers or personal IP address). KeepSolid also stores the number of connected devices for each account – this data is monitored to enforce the maximum device limits. This data can be assessed in the [User Office](https://web.archive.org/login), where you may remove devices from your account. 

Certain personal data collected by us automatically (i.e. IP address, connection type, browser type and operating system) is stored only for the duration of your session in the VPN Services. This means that KeepSolid never stores or logs these categories of personal data after the end of your session in our VPN Services – we delete such personal data after your session ends. This also means that your personal data, including your email address, first and last name, username, and IP address, **is never connected to any of your internet activities during your VPN Services sessions.**

We store some of your personal data that we collect from you and from other sources as long as you remain a user of the Services. We retain personal data necessary for compliance with our legal obligations and contractual performance for the longer of: (i) the required time period under applicable law; (ii) or seven years.

The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) is a United States federal law enacted to give parents increased control over what information is collected from their children online and how such information is used.

The Services are not directed to children under the age of 13, nor do we knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, please do not provide personal information of any kind whatsoever to KeepSolid. If a child provides us with personal information, a parent or legal guardian of that child may contact us to obtain that information and/or delete it from our records by sending an email to [[email protected]](https://web.archive.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#ea9a98839c8b8993aa818f8f9a998586838ec4898587).
