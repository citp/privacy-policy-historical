## 3\. Cookies

This section describes the information we collect about visitors to our Applications. As noted above, **we do _not_ track user activities outside of our Applications, nor do we track the web activities of users when they are logged into our VPN Services.**

We may use or engage others to use cookies, clear gifs, and similar technologies to understand how users access and use our Applications. In general, you can browse our Applications without telling us who you are or submitting any personal information.

_Browser Cookies._ Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your web browser for record-keeping purposes. There are two types of cookies: session-based and persistent-based cookies. Session cookies exist only during an online session; we use session cookies to allow our systems to uniquely identify you while you are logged in to your account at the Applications. Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you have closed your browser or turned off your computer. We use persistent cookies on the website only, to track aggregate and statistical information about user activity.

_Disabling Cookies._ Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in future. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Applications visitors who disable their web browsers' ability to accept cookies will be able to browse the Applications but certain Applications features will not function.

_Third Parties._ We may engage third parties, such as Google Analytics or Firebase, to track and analyze non-personally identifiable Applications data. We do not provide these third parties with any personal information that we have collected about you.
