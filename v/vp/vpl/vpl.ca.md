###  **1 Purposes for Which Personal Information May be Collected**

###  **2 Collection and Use**

Personal information will only be collected in accordance with FIPPA. Accordingly, except in the limited circumstances provided for in FIPPA, personal information about an individual will be collected directly from that individual. Individuals are informed of the reasons for collecting personal information at the time (or before) it is collected. In addition, at the time of collection (or before), individuals are informed of VPL’s legal authority for collecting the information and the name, title, and contact information for VPL’s Privacy Officer, responsible for ensuring compliance with FIPPA, to whom questions about the collection can be directed.

Unless an individual consents to some other use, personal information will only be used for the stated purpose for which it is collected. Personal information may be collected for uses such as: access to library materials, services, and programs; room rentals; communications; collection of fines, fees, and debts; fundraising; protection of VPL property; security of users and staff; non-identifying statistical purposes; and in the limited circumstances provided for in FIPPA.

###  **6 Retention**

VPL will not retain any personal information longer than necessary for the provision and planning of library services and programs, unless a longer period is required by law.

VPL may, however, retain personal information related to library services and programs when users opt in to allow the library to do so; for example, to enhance or personalize library services and programs.

VPL’s [Protection of Privacy Policy](https://web.archive.org/policy/protection-privacy-policy#ui-accordion-accordion-header-1) details the purposes for which your personal information may be collected by the library, how it is collected and used, how it is protected, how to access your personal information that has been collected as well as to whom it may be disclosed in accordance with the B.C. Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FIPPA).

To be transparent and accountable, the library must publish a Personal Information Bank (PIB) directory of ways we collect, use and share your personal information.

Each listing explains why we collect that information, how we use it, and who we share it with.
