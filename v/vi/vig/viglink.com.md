### Information That You Give Us That is Covered by the Privacy Policy:

**Personal Data.** We collect personally identifiable data, such as your name, address, telephone number and email address when you voluntarily choose to register for use of the Software or Service and when you contact us with comments or inquiries. If you are publisher of a website and are registering to use the Software and Service, we may also collect your bank account and/or credit card information that you may provide to us upon request. 

**Passively Collected Information.** When you interact with us through the Site, we receive and store certain additional personally non-identifiable information. Such information, which is collected passively using various technologies, cannot presently be used to specifically identify you. Examples include IP addresses, browser types, domain names, and other anonymous statistical data involving your use of the Site, the Software and/or the Services. 

### Cookies:

In operating the Site, we may use a technology called "cookies." A cookie is a piece of information that the computer that hosts the Site gives to your computer when you access the Site. Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the Site and help us analyze Site usage more accurately. 

In addition, we may install the Software on third party websites. In doing so, the Software will place a cookie on the computers of users of those third party websites and will collect personally non-identifiable information about your browser and your activity at such websites. 

On most web browsers, you will find a "help" section on the toolbar. Please refer to this section for information on how to receive notification when you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off. Acceptance of cookies is not a requirement to browse the Site; however certain areas and features of the Site, require your acceptance of cookies to work properly. If you choose to use cookies, we may collect personally identifiable information without your prior permission. 

### Use of Personally Identifiable Information:

We use your personally identifiable information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If you provide personally identifiable data for a certain reason, we may use such information in connection with the reason for which it was provided. For instance, we will use the personally identifiable information provided by users of the Software in order to make payment of eligible commissions. We also use personally identifiable information and personally non-identifiable information collected through the Site and use of the Software and Services to help us improve the Site, Software and Services, and to better understand our users. If we intend on using any personally identifiable information in any manner that is not consistent with this Privacy Policy, you will be informed of such anticipated use prior to or at the time at which the personally identifiable information is collected. 

### Use of Personally Non-Identifiable Data:

We may use personally non-identifiable information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to the Site and users of the Software and Service, the number of visitors to each page of the Site, and the domain names of our visitors' Internet service providers. No personally identifiable information is available or used in this process. 

### Sharing Information:

We are not in the business of selling personally identifiable information. We consider this information to be a vital part of our relationship with you. There are, however, certain circumstances in which we may share personally identifiable information with certain third parties without notice to you including those set forth below: 

**Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties.** We, like many businesses, sometimes hire other companies to perform certain business-related functions. Examples include mailing information, maintaining databases, hosting services, and processing payments. When we employ another company to perform a function of this nature, we provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific function. We require such third parties to maintain the confidentiality of such information and use such information only as necessary to provide us with designated services. 

**Legal Requirements.** We may disclose personally identifiable information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) comply with a legal obligation, (b) protect and defend our rights or property (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Site or the public, or (d) protect against legal liability. 

**Business Transfers.** As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, personally identifiable information may be part of the transferred assets. 

**Informal Notices and Bulletins.** Periodically, we may choose to send news, bulletins, educational materials, marketing materials, or other information to you, and will use personally identifiable information to send such communications. 

### Your Choices:

You can always choose not to provide personally identifiable information to us. However, doing so may prevent you from obtaining certain information or using certain areas of the Site, the Software and the Services. 

### Children:

We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under the age of 13. If you are under 13, please do not give us any personally identifiable information. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and to help enforce this Privacy Policy by instructing their children to never provide personally identifiable information on the Internet without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided personally identifiable information to us, please contact us, and we will endeavor to delete that information from our databases. 

### Links to Other Web Sites:

This Privacy Policy applies only to information collected through the Site, the Software and the Service. It does not apply to information collected by third party sites or products or services that may be accessible through the Site, the Software of the Services. We suggest that you contact those third parties directly for information on their privacy, security, data collection and distribution policies. 

### Security:

We take commercially reasonable steps designed to protect personally identifiable information and to protect such information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no Internet or e-mail transmission is ever fully secure or error free. Please keep this in mind when disclosing any personally identifiable information to us or to any other party via the Internet. 

### Other Terms and Conditions:

We reserve the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time and from time to time. When we post changes to this Privacy Policy, we will revise the "last updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy.
