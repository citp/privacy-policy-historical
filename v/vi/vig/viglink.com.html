  <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
  <h3>Last updated: January 7, 2010</h3>

  <p>
    <strong>We understand your concern about how information about you is used and
    shared. We have prepared this Privacy Policy to let you know about our policy
    regarding information that is collected on our website located at
    www.viglink.com (the "Site") and through your use of our software (the
    "Software") and services (the "Services").</strong>
  </p>

  <h3>Information That You Give Us That is Covered by the Privacy Policy:</h3>

  <p>
    <strong>Personal Data.</strong> We collect personally identifiable data, such
    as your name, address, telephone number and email address when you voluntarily
    choose to register for use of the Software or Service and when you contact us
    with comments or inquiries. If you are publisher of a website and are
    registering to use the Software and Service, we may also collect your bank
    account and/or credit card information that you may provide to us upon
    request.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Passively Collected Information.</strong> When you interact with us
    through the Site, we receive and store certain additional personally
    non-identifiable information. Such information, which is collected passively
    using various technologies, cannot presently be used to specifically identify
    you. Examples include IP addresses, browser types, domain names, and other
    anonymous statistical data involving your use of the Site, the Software and/or
    the Services.
  </p>

  <h3>Cookies:</h3>
  <p>
    In operating the Site, we may use a technology called "cookies." A cookie is a
    piece of information that the computer that hosts the Site gives to your
    computer when you access the Site. Our cookies help provide additional
    functionality to the Site and help us analyze Site usage more accurately.
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition, we may install the Software on third party websites. In doing so,
    the Software will place a cookie on the computers of users of those third
    party websites and will collect personally non-identifiable information about
    your browser and your activity at such websites.
  </p>
  <p>
    On most web browsers, you will find a "help" section on the toolbar. Please
    refer to this section for information on how to receive notification when you
    are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off. Acceptance of cookies
    is not a requirement to browse the Site; however certain areas and features of
    the Site, require your acceptance of cookies to work properly. If you choose
    to use cookies, we may collect personally identifiable information without
    your prior permission.
  </p>

  <h3>Use of Personally Identifiable Information:</h3>
  <p>
    We use your personally identifiable information in a manner that is consistent
    with this Privacy Policy. If you provide personally identifiable data for a
    certain reason, we may use such information in connection with the reason for
    which it was provided. For instance, we will use the personally identifiable
    information provided by users of the Software in order to make payment of
    eligible commissions. We also use personally identifiable information and
    personally non-identifiable information collected through the Site and use of
    the Software and Services to help us improve the Site, Software and Services,
    and to better understand our users. If we intend on using any personally
    identifiable information in any manner that is not consistent with this
    Privacy Policy, you will be informed of such anticipated use prior to or at
    the time at which the personally identifiable information is collected.
  </p>

  <h3>Use of Personally Non-Identifiable Data:</h3>
  <p>
    We may use personally non-identifiable information and pool it with other
    information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to the Site
    and users of the Software and Service, the number of visitors to each page of
    the Site, and the domain names of our visitors' Internet service providers. No
    personally identifiable information is available or used in this process.
  </p>

  <h3>Sharing Information:</h3>
  <p>
    We are not in the business of selling personally identifiable information. We
    consider this information to be a vital part of our relationship with you.
    There are, however, certain circumstances in which we may share personally
    identifiable information with certain third parties without notice to you
    including those set forth below:
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties.</strong> We, like many
    businesses, sometimes hire other companies to perform certain business-related
    functions. Examples include mailing information, maintaining databases,
    hosting services, and processing payments. When we employ another company to
    perform a function of this nature, we provide them with the information that
    they need to perform their specific function. We require such third parties to
    maintain the confidentiality of such information and use such information only
    as necessary to provide us with designated services.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Legal Requirements.</strong> We may disclose personally identifiable
    information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such
    action is necessary to (a) comply with a legal obligation, (b) protect and
    defend our rights or property (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the
    personal safety of users of the Site or the public, or (d) protect against
    legal liability.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Business Transfers.</strong> As we develop our business, we might sell
    or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger,
    reorganization, dissolution or similar event, personally identifiable
    information may be part of the transferred assets.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Informal Notices and Bulletins.</strong> Periodically, we may choose
    to send news, bulletins, educational materials, marketing materials, or other
    information to you, and will use personally identifiable information to send
    such communications.
  </p>

  <h3>Your Choices:</h3>
  <p>
    You can always choose not to provide personally identifiable information to
    us. However, doing so may prevent you from obtaining certain information or
    using certain areas of the Site, the Software and the Services.
  </p>

  <h3>Children:</h3>
  <p>
    We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under the age of 13.
    If you are under 13, please do not give us any personally identifiable
    information. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their
    children's Internet usage and to help enforce this Privacy Policy by
    instructing their children to never provide personally identifiable
    information on the Internet without their permission. If you have reason to
    believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided personally identifiable
    information to us, please contact us, and we will endeavor to delete that
    information from our databases.
  </p>

  <h3>Links to Other Web Sites:</h3>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy applies only to information collected through the Site,
    the Software and the Service. It does not apply to information collected by
    third party sites or products or services that may be accessible through the
    Site, the Software of the Services. We suggest that you contact those third
    parties directly for information on their privacy, security, data collection
    and distribution policies.
  </p>

  <h3>Security:</h3>
  <p>
    We take commercially reasonable steps designed to protect personally
    identifiable information and to protect such information from loss, misuse,
    and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no
    Internet or e-mail transmission is ever fully secure or error free. Please
    keep this in mind when disclosing any personally identifiable information to
    us or to any other party via the Internet.
  </p>

  <h3>Other Terms and Conditions:</h3>
  <p>
    We reserve the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time and
    from time to time. When we post changes to this Privacy Policy, we will revise
    the "last updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy. If there are
    material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you of any such
    modifications by posting a message on the Site. We encourage you to
    periodically review this Agreement to be informed of our privacy policies.
    Your continued use of the Site, the Software or the Services after any changes
    or revisions to this Privacy Policy shall indicate your agreement with the
    terms of such revised Privacy Policy.
  </p>

  <h3>Access to Information:</h3>
  <p>
    To keep your personally identifiable information accurate, current, and
    complete, please contact us as specified below. We will exercise commercially
    reasonable efforts to update or correct personally identifiable information in
    our possession that you have previously submitted to us.
