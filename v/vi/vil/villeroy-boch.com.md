Universal Analytics allows the activities on our website to be analyzed across devices (e.g., accessing it on a laptop and later on a tablet). This happens by assigning a pseudonym user ID to a user. However, no person-related data is shared with Google. Even when Universal Analytics adds additional Google Analytics functions, this does not mean that protection of privacy is reduced.

In view of the discussion on the use of analytical tools with complete IP addresses, we would like to point out that this website uses Google Analytics with the extension "_anonymizeIp()" so that IP addresses are only processed further in abbreviated form to prevent them being linked directly.

We also use the technical extension "Google Signals", which enables cross-device tracking. This makes it possible to assign an individual website visitor to different end devices. However, this only happens if the visitor has logged in to a Google service when visiting a website and has activated the option "personalized advertising" in his Google account settings at the same time. Even then, however, no personal data or user profiles are accessible to us; they remain anonymous to us.

If you do not want "Google Signals" to be used, you can disable the "Personalized advertising" option in your Google Account preferences.
