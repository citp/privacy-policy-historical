# Victorian Plumbing Privacy Policy | Victorian Plumbing UK

At Victorian Plumbing, we aim to take an honest, secure and careful approach to your data. We understand the importance of your personal details and we know and care that your data is used in a secure, sensitive and fair manner.

This policy, alongside our Terms & Conditions is designed to give you a clear, transparent view on why Victorian Plumbing collect and process your personal details, how we use them, and what rights you have in relation to how Victorian Plumbing interact with your data.

The data controller is Victorian Plumbing, Diamond House, 41 Stephenson Way, Formby Business Park, Formby, L37 8EG, United Kingdom.

By visiting VictorianPlumbing.co.uk, you are accepting and consenting to the practices described in this Privacy Notice.

Why does Victorian Plumbing require my personal data?

We capture data for a number of reasons:

Mainly, we require your personal details to fulfil an order, request or customer service issue that you've requested. This data is essential to us fulfilling your requirement and is collected as part of our on-going business activities. For example, we collect your address from you during checkout, to ensure we're able to deliver goods to your requested location.

We store some personal details in order to communicate with you relating to our business activities. This may be informing you of our current product range, deals, discounts and offers on our product range. We only do this when you have actively consented for us to add you to our database.

We also store some personal details when you're using our site, to allow us to identify any website technical issues, and for us to develop our systems to provide a fast, easy experience. We don't automatically store many personal details, normally just secure server logs and this is in line with industry best-practices and well-established processes taken by the majority of sites you visit across the internet.

We store your details for as long as is reasonably needed to complete the actions described above. For example, if you have purchased a product from us with a 20 year guarantee, we'll store your personal details for this period of time, so we can assist you during the guarantee period with any guarantee claims.
