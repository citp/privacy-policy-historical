<h3>Passing Information to Third Parties</h3>
<p>We shall not sell, share, hire or otherwise deal in any of your personal information or Registration Information with third parties unless you give Us specific permission to do so when you register on the Site or through a subsequent affirmative confirmation on the Site. However We work with partner organisations. Provided that you are over 13, We may wish to send you information in relation to these partners' products or services. We will seek your consent, or if you are under 13 the consent of your parent or legal guardian before We do so. We will also periodically give you the opportunity to "opt out" of receiving such email communication referred to in paragraphÂ 3.1 above.                     As We operate globally, it may be necessary to transfer your information internationally, and in particular your information may be stored on the servers of 19 Entertainment Ltd or its parent company CKx Inc. or Our website host, which is currently Haecceitas Limited. Use of personal data by such third parties is safeguarded by both international procedures and legal agreements to comply with the requirements of the Act.</p>
<p>We will make your personally identifiable information available to other companies or people when:                     We hire third party vendors to provide specialised services such as customer support; email message deployment; suppression, merge and de-duplication services; data processing; and special products or services that you have requested. These companies are only allowed to use the information in order to help Us fulfil Our services to you. We do not provide your information to these companies for their own, permanent use;                     you unsubscribe for a mailing that We send to you on behalf of a third party. We may share your removal instruction with the third party so that it may be added to that person's list of people to whom they may not send emails;                     you are the winner or finalist of a competition that is co-sponsored with a third party and that third party needs your information in order to manage the prize fulfilment or competition participation process;                     when required by law, such as when We respond to injunctions, court orders, or legal process; or                     We believe that your actions violate applicable laws, Our Terms of Use, or any usage guidelines for specific products or services, or threaten the rights, property, or safety of Our company, Our users, or others.                     We may share aggregated demographic information (country, city, gender (where provided)) about Our user base with Our Site development team and web hosting provider or other relevant third parties. This information does not identify you as an individual user. We do not link such aggregate user data with personally identifiable information.</p>
<h3>Links to Third Parties</h3>
<p>This Site may link to other websites. These third partyÂ websites are outside of Our control and are not covered by this Privacy Policy. If you access other websites using the links provided (for instance by clicking on a banner advertisement), the operators of these websites may collect your personal information. Please ensure that you are satisfied with the Privacy Policies of these Third Party websites before you submit any personal information. We cannot be held responsible legally or otherwise for the activities, privacy policies or levels of privacy compliance of these Third Parties. We encourage you to read that website's privacy policy before providing any personal information.</p>
<h3>Newsletters</h3>
<p>We may offer free newsletters to share information with you about the Site, about Us and Our affiliates and subsidiaries, or about Our business partners and advertisers and sponsors. You may receive a newsletter either by registering for a particular newsletter or in conjunction with a special feature or membership for which you have registered on the Site. You may cancel your free email subscription by following the instructions provided on the Site or, in some instances, in the designated area of certain newsletters or emails.</p>
<h3>Competitions and Surveys</h3>
<p>From time to time We may provide you the opportunity to take part in competitions or surveys on Our Site. If you participate, We will request certain Personal Information from you. Participation in these surveys or competitions is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and address). Your personally identifiable information may be used to contact you for winner notification, prize delivery confirmation or other related purposes. We may ask your permission to allow Us to post publicly some of your information on the Site, such as on a winner's page, in the event you win a competition or sweepstakes. Except as required by applicable law, We will not post your information without your permission.                     We may decide to use a third party service provider to conduct these competitions or surveys. Any such company will be prohibited from using Our users' Personal Information for any other purpose unless you give your consent. The name of any such company will be visible on any page where you are invited to part with your information or views. We will never share the personally identifiable information you provide through a competition or survey with other third parties unless We give you prior notice and choice. In those cases where We are not the operator or host of the competition or sweepstake, We have no control over the information collected and accordingly urge you to review the advertiser's or sponsor's privacy policy applicable to the competition or sweepstakes before participating.</p>
<h3>Security of Personal Information</h3>
<p>We take precautions to ensure the security of personal information submitted by users. Unfortunately, no electronic communication over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. While We strive to take care to protect your personal information, We cannot warrant the security of any information that you submit to Us, and you do so at your own risk. We do offer secured-server transactions that encrypt your information in transit to thwart someone from intercepting it and misusing it when collecting credit card information for online purchases. We also store any personal information, including credit card numbers in a secure area to which the general public does not have access.</p>
