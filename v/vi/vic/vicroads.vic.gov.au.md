 **VicRoads General Privacy Statement**

  
VicRoads is committed to protecting your privacy. We are required by law to protect personal, health and other confidential information such as information relating to your driver licence and vehicle registration. 

This statement summarises VicRoads policies for the management of personal, health and other confidential information.

  * We cannot collect, use or disclose information of a personal nature, health information or information that is commercially sensitive, except to the extent set out in the Road Safety Act 1986, the Information Privacy Act 2000, and the Health Records Act 2001. Our staff are trained in their obligations under these Acts. 
  * We will only collect information about you, that is necessary for us to perform our functions. We will always try to do so in a fair, lawful and non-intrusive way. Wherever possible, we will collect information directly from you rather than from third parties. We will do our best to tell you if we collect information about you from a third party.
  * When we collect information from you we will tell you why we are collecting it, any law that requires it to be collected, the organisations or type of organisations to whom we would usually disclose it, the consequences for you if the information is not provided to us and will inform you of your rights to have access to the information. 
  * We are prohibited from using or disclosing personal or commercially sensitive information obtained under the Road Safety Act, such as driver licence or vehicle registration information, except for purposes permitted by the Act. We are also prohibited from using or disclosing health information except in limited circumstances set out in the Health Records Act.

  
For example, we are allowed to use information about you:

– for the purposes of driver licensing and vehicle registration

– for law enforcement purposes, including legal proceedings, prosecutions, investigations and enforcement of judgements and court orders (the information may also be disclosed to appropriate organisations or personnel for the same reasons)

– for public safety purposes.

Other examples of permitted use include disclosure of the information to:

– other State government or Territory road or traffic authorities for the purposes of exchanging vehicle and driver information

– the manufacturer or supplier of vehicles in connection with vehicle safety recalls

– the Transport Accident Commission

  * Aside from where the law specifically allows us to use or disclose personal or health information, we will not do so, without your consent, for purposes which are unrelated to the purposes for which we collected the information.
  * We do everything we can to make sure that the information we hold about you is accurate, complete and up to date. We are required under the Public Records Act to hold some records for extended periods. We will not keep information longer than we need to. From time to time we check our databases to ensure that the information we hold is accurate and up to date.
  * Access to our computer systems is controlled and monitored. Our staff and authorised external users only have access to systems that their duties require. We have comprehensive auditing procedures to prevent and detect fraud. 
  * Our computer systems uniquely identify individual users to ensure that access is appropriately authorised. Transactions involving information of a personal nature that can be audited are traceable to an individual VicRoads officer. 
  * Our Internet privacy policy is contained on our website privacy statement located at www.vicroads.vic.gov.au
  * An individual or organisation (such as an enforcement agency), seeking access to personal, health and other confidential information held by VicRoads has to sign a confidentiality agreement. When entering into an agreement, the recipient agrees that the information will only be used and disclosed in accordance with the terms and conditions outlined in the agreement. However, if you authorise us in writing to release the personal information to another individual or organisation, then a confidentiality agreement is not required. 
  * If you ask us, we will generally give you access to information we hold about you. However, there are some exceptions to this. For example, we do not have to give you access to personal information we hold about you where doing so would pose a serious and imminent threat to life or health, would unreasonably impact on the privacy of others or where the information would otherwise be exempt from disclosure by law. We do not have to give you access to health information that is supplied to us in confidence in some circumstances.
  * We may from time to time transfer personal, health or other confidential information about you to organisations in other States and Territories. We are permitted to exchange registration and licensing information with other State and Territory road authorities, and for some other purposes that are set out in the Road Safety Act. In other cases, we will only do this where you consent, where we believe that the recipient organisation is subject to binding privacy obligations that are substantially similar to the ones under which we operate, or where it is in your interests for us to do so.
  * We thoroughly investigate any suspected infringements of privacy. Our anti-fraud unit develops fraud prevention strategies to identify procedural and systems weaknesses and develops and delivers anti-fraud and corruption awareness programs. Disciplinary action is taken in cases where investigations of suspected infringements of privacy are proven. 

  
If you:

  * want to have access to personal or health information we hold about you
  * want to know more about what sort of information we hold, for what purposes and how we deal with that information
  * have concerns that we may have infringed your privacy rights, you should contact:
