# Privacy statement | State Library Victoria

State Library Victoria is committed to protecting user privacy. The Library collects personal information from users in order to achieve its statutory functions and strategic objectives, and manages that information in accordance with privacy legislation.

The following information pertains specifically to your privacy and the Library's websites.

### Clickstream data

When users visit Library websites, web servers automatically capture and log data, which includes:

  * IP address
  * top-level domain name (for example, .com, .au, .gov)
  * date and time of site visit
  * pages accessed

### Cookies

Library websites use cookies. A cookie is a small piece of code placed on your computer which allows us to record information about your visit.

We use cookies to record usage statistics for this site, such as the number of visits, documents viewed, browser type, and the way the site is navigated.  In using these cookies, we do not retrieve or record any personal information such as names or email addresses. The anonymous statistical data we collect may be aggregated and used in broader statistical analysis or to assist in making your experience easier and more efficient.

### Analytics

The Library uses analytics tools, such as Google Analytics, for the capture and provision of website statistics. These services use cookies. In addition some tools such as Google Analytics use a ‘web beacon’ or transparent image. Web beacons are a convenient way of gathering the statistics and managing cookies. Users can ‘opt out’ of Google Analytics if they use the opt-out service provided by Google.

### Security of your personal information

There are risks associated with transmitting information over the internet. The Library implements various mechanisms to protect the security and integrity of personal information. While the Library strives to protect the security of information, unfortunately no data transmission can be guaranteed as completely secure. If you are concerned about transmitting sensitive information to the Library over the internet, you may prefer to contact us by mail or via telephone.

### Links to other sites

Our websites may contain links to other websites not operated by the Library which may be of interest to you. The Library is not responsible for the privacy practices of such sites and it is recommended that you familiarise yourself with those websites' privacy policies.
