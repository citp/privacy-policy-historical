Unless indicated otherwise, this policy applies only to personal information collected through the Web site, microsites, or mobile sites of our brands and lines of business that expressly adopt, and display or link to, this policy. These brands and lines of business include Victoria's Secret, Victoria's Secret Pink, and Pink Nation. By "personal information" we mean your identifying information (like name, home address, and email address), and descriptive information (like tastes and preferences) if coupled with your identifying information ("personally identifying information"). We may refer to all our brands and lines of business (i.e., Victoria's Secret, Victoria's Secret Pink (or "Pink"), and Pink Nation (by Pink)) as "we," "us," or "our" throughout this privacy policy. </p> <h3> This privacy policy answers these questions:</h3> <ul class="vs questions"> <li><a href="#collection" target="_self">What personal information is collected at our Web site, and how is it used?</a></li> <li><a href="#usage" target="_self">How does this Web site interact with third-party Web sites and content?</a></li> <li><a href="#share" target="_self">What information do we share with third parties and our sister brands (or what information may they access because of the services they provide to us)?</a></li> <li><a href="#choices" target="_self">What choices do you have over how your information is used?</a></li> <li><a href="#update-info" target="_self">How do you update your personal information?</a></li> <li><a href="#security" target="_self">How do we secure your information on our site?</a></li> <li><a href="#store-info" target="_self">Where is personal information stored and processed?</a></li> <li><a href="#questions" target="_self">Whom should you contact with questions or concerns?</a></li> <li><a href="#last-updated" target="_self">When was this policy last updated?</a></li> </ul> <h3 id="collection"> What personal information is collected at our Web site and how is it used?</h3> <ol class="vs" id="personal-information"> <li> <h4> 1. &nbsp;Information You Directly Provide through this Site</h4> <p> We collect personal information directly from you to do all the things typically associated with Web sites. Examples of the information we collect include name, address, phone number, email address, personal preferences, credit card number, purchase and ordering information, demographical information, responses to survey questions and sizing information. </p> <p> This information is collected at various places: for instance, when you check out with your online order; subscribe to catalogs, email offers, and Pink mobile messaging offers; participate in surveys;join Victoria's Secret Pink Nation; enter contests or sweepstakes; or interact with special-event or program offers. </p> <p> We may also collect information that you provide about people you know. For example, we collect your gift recipient's contact information to process your gift orders. We use personally identifying information to do things like: </p> <ul class="vs"> <li> process your online orders;</li> <li> open an online account at your request;</li> <li> personalize your online experience with content and offers that are tailored to your interests;</li> <li> provide customer service, whether it's responding to a request or following up on an order;</li> <li> include you in surveys and contests;</li> <li> enable you to post your content, such as comments or images;</li> <li> facilitate networks of online social activity centered around our products and services;</li> <li> improve our website, improve the manner in which offers are made on our website, improve purchase decisions of our visitors and the interactions visitors have with our website;</li> <li> enable you to interact with third-party content service providers, whether by linking to their sites, viewing their content within our Web environment, or by viewing our content within their Web environment; and</li> <li> market products and services for each of our brands--for instance, by adding you to the Victoria's Secret and Victoria's Secret Pink email list or Victoria's Secret print-catalog list when you make an online purchase; or by adding you to the Pink Nation email list if you sign up for Pink Nation.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <h4 id="technology"> 2. &nbsp;Information We Observe or Collect through Technology</h4> <ol class="vs"> <li> <h5> a. &nbsp;Navigational Information</h5> <p> When you visit this Web site, we collect navigational information, such as browser type and version, service-provider identification, <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> address, the site from which you came, and the site to which you navigate. Navigational information is largely anonymous in the sense that it doesn't contain your name, address, phone number, email address or other information that directly identifies you. However, we may associate this navigational information with your personal information if you provide it. </p> </li> <li> <h5> b. &nbsp;Cookies and Clear gifs</h5> <p> To better understand what you do while on our site, we use a browser feature known as a cookie. A cookie is a small data file that's stored by your Web browser on your computer. It's used to do things like see how you navigate our Web site, what you click on, and remember you and your online purchases when you return. This helps us improve our site, provide better customer service, personalize your online experience, and personalize offers to you based on your unique tastes and both your online and offline (e.g., in-store) interactions and purchase history. </p> <p> We also use clear-gifs (also known as a Web beacon or Web bug) on our Web site and in our emails. A clear gif is a nearly invisible pixel-sized graphic image on a Web page, Web-based document or e-mail message. It helps us do things like view the URL of the page on which the clear gif appears and the time our Web site or email in question is viewed. Clear gifs in e-mails help us confirm the receipt of, and response to, our emails, including those that you forward to friends and family; and they help deliver a more personalized online experience. These technologies may be used to help us see which of our interactive experiences online users like mostfor example, by keeping track of the number of times a video, widget or other media is accessed or embedded on social networking sites; and on which social networking sites it is embedded, based on inquiries that are sent to our Web site. Cookies and clear gifs also allow us to associate your online navigational information, or purchases and interactions (both online and offline), with any personal information you provide (such as name, address, phone number, survey responses, and email address). We'll associate this information to deliver products and services to you; to improve our business; to transact business; and to market our products and services on this and other Web sites and through a variety of media like email, mobile advertising, and direct mail. As an example, we may use cookies to keep track of what you put into your shopping bag. That can help us contact you if your online session is disrupted in mid-purchase, resulting in an abandoned cart. We can also use this technology to determine whether you'd be interested in participating in special events, given your preferences. The end result is a more personalized experience that's tailored to your needs and tastes. </p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <h4> 3. &nbsp;Information Others Observe or Collect through Technology</h4> <p> Third-party service providers help us provide certain features on our site and analyze our visitor's site and purchase preferences. They may also help us deliver ads to you about our products through banner ads when you visit other web sites (often referred to as "online network advertising"). The following provides more information about these service providers and the choices you have with respect to their services. </p> <ol class="vs"> <li> <h5> a. &nbsp;Features</h5> <p> We use third-party services to provide certain features on our Web site. These third parties use some or all of the technologies described in <a href="#technology" target="_self">Information We Observe or Collect Through Technology</a> to provide these features. </p> </li> <li> <h5> b. &nbsp;Analysis</h5> <p> We contract with analytics companies to better understand your use of our Web sites, and Web capabilities like embeddable widgets. These third parties may serve surveys to determine satisfaction with the Web site and then tie the responses to actual behavior on the Web site, which will allow us to improve our Web sites and Web capabilities. They accomplish this by using some or all of the technologies described in <a href="#technology" target="_self">Information We Observe or Collect Through Technology</a>. </p> </li> <li> <h5> c. &nbsp;Advertising</h5> <p> We contract with third-party advertising companies which, in turn (1) place, use, and rely on cookies and web beacons when you interact with us through our Web sites and our email; (2) help us determine which of our products you may like, based on both your online and offline (e.g., in-store) shopping histories with us; (3) use your basic personal information (such as name, address and email address) to help us associate your online and stores purchases and interactions through and with us; and (4) deliver personalized online display and banner advertising to you on other Web sites, based on those purchases and interactions. If you'd like more information about how online network advertising works and what your choices are for the information that's collected via these third-party cookies, please see <a href="#choices" target="_self">What Choices do you have Over how Your Information is Used</a>? </p> </li> </ol> </li> </ol> <p> <a class="ui-callout" href="#wrapper" target="_self">Back To Top</a> </p> <h3 id="usage"> How does this Web site interact with third-party Web sites and content?</h3> <p> We may enable you to navigate to third-party sites and services, or otherwise display third-party content. We do this for your convenience. We don't endorse or generally have any affiliation with these third parties. And we don't control and aren't responsible for their Web practices. Whether the third-party content appears within our Web environment (like a map frame), or you leave our Web site for another site to view it, those service provider's terms, conditions, and privacy policies govern your online experience (unless there's a conspicuously posted statement by us that says otherwise). Please view their terms of service and privacy policies if you have any question about their practices. </p> <p> Here's a partial list of the sites or content of these third parties: </p> <ol class="vs"> <li> <h5> 1. &nbsp;Interactive Maps</h5> <p> We may facilitate easy access to the online maps of content providers like Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo!

In these cases, the third-party's privacy policy may apply to any personal information you provide in connection with the event. So please take note of who's running the event in question; and the terms, conditions, and policies that apply. </p> </li> <li> <h5> 3. &nbsp;Social Networking or Other User-Generated-Content Sites, and Other Websites</h5> <p> We may at times facilitate easy access to third-party sites, like social networking sites and other sites that host user-generated content.

If you become a member of one of these programs or purchase something from us at this Web site through such a program, we may provide the company administering the membership program enough information about you or your purchase (like contact information, transaction date, transaction amount, and order number), to enable it to honor your membership. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of the companies sponsoring these membership programs. Their terms, conditions, and policies apply to any information that's provided to them to further their programs. </p> </li> </ol> <p> <a class="ui-callout" href="#wrapper" target="_self">Back To Top</a> </p> <h3 id="share"> What information do we share with third parties and our sister brands (or what information may they access because of the services they provide to us)?</h3> <ol class="vs"> <li> <h5> 1. &nbsp;Our Sister Brands</h5> <p> We may also share the information described in this policy, like postal and email address, customer preferences, and purchase history within our corporate family so that our affiliates may market to you.

Bigelow, Henri Bendel, the La Senza family of brands, Mast Global, and Slatkin &amp; Co.. </p> </li> <li> <h5> 2. &nbsp;Contractors</h5> <p> We use third-party "back-office" contractors to help handle parts of our business because of their expertise, resources, or scale.
