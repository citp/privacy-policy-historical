		Privacy Statement</h2>
	<p>
		This privacy policy explains what personal information is collected through this Web site, how that information is used, to whom it's disclosed, and how it's safeguarded. This policy applies only to personal information collected through the Web site, microsites, or mobile sites of our brands and lines of business that expressly adopt, and display or link to, this policy. These brands and lines of business include Victoria's Secret, Victoria's Secret Pink, and Pink Nation By "personal information" we mean your identifying information (like name, home address, and email address), and descriptive information (like tastes and preferences) if coupled with your identifying information ("personally identifying information"). We may refer to all our brands and lines of business (i.e., Victoria's Secret, Victoria's Secret Pink, and Pink Nation) as "we," "us," or "our" throughout this privacy policy.</p>

	<ol id="personal-information">
		<li>
			<h4>
				1. &nbsp;Information Collected Directly from You and Others through this Site</h4>
			<p>
				We collect personal information directly from you to do all the things typically associated with Web sites. Examples of the information we collect include name, address, telephone number, mobile phone number, email address, personal preferences, credit card number, purchase and ordering information, demographical information, responses to survey questions and sizing information.</p>
			<p>
				This information is collected at various places: for instance, when you check out with your online order; subscribe to catalogs, email offers, and mobile messaging offers; participate in surveys; join Victoria's Secret Pink Nation; enter contests or sweepstakes; or interact with special-event or program offers.</p>
			<p>
				We collect information about you. And, when you provide it, we collect information about those you know. For example, we collect your gift recipient's contact information to process your gift orders. We use this information to do things like:</p>
			<ul class="ui-list">
				<li>
					process your online orders;</li>
				<li>
					open an online account at your request;</li>
				<li>
					personalize your online experience with content and offers that are tailored to your interests;</li>
				<li>
					provide customer service, whether it's responding to a request or following up on an order;</li>
				<li>
					include you in surveys and contests;</li>
				<li>
					enable you to post your content, such as comments or images;</li>
				<li>
					facilitate networks of online social activity centered around our products and services;</li>
				<li>
					improve our website, improve the manner in which offers are made on our website, improve purchase decisions of our visitors and the interactions visitors have with our website;</li>
				<li>
					enable you to interact with third-party content service providers, whether by linking to their sites, viewing their content within our Web environment, or by viewing our content within their Web environment; and</li>
				<li>
					market products and services for each of our brands--for instance, by adding you to the Victoria's Secret and Victoria's Secret Pink email list or Victoria's Secret print-catalog list when you make an online purchase; or by adding you to the Pink Nation email list if you sign up for Pink Nation.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h4 id="technology">
				2. &nbsp;Information We Observe or Collect through Technology</h4>
			<ol class="type-a">
				<li>
					<h5>
						a. &nbsp;Navigational Information</h5>
					<p>
						When you visit this Web site, we collect navigational information, such as browser type and version, service-provider identification, <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> address, the site from which you came, and the site to which you navigate. Navigational information is largely anonymous in the sense that it doesn't contain your name, address, phone number, email address or other information that directly identifies you. However, we may associate this navigational information with your personal information if you provide it.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h5>
						b. &nbsp;Cookies and Clear gifs</h5>
					<p>
						To better understand what you do while on our site, we use a browser feature known as a cookie. A cookie is a small data file that's stored by your Web browser on your computer. It's used to do things like see how you navigate our Web site, what you click on, and remember you and your online purchases when you return. This helps us improve our site, provide better customer service, personalize your online experience, and personalize offers to you based on your unique tastes and purchase history.</p>
					<p>
						We also use clear-gifs (also known as a Web beacon or Web bug) on our Web site and in our emails. A clear gif is a nearly invisible pixel-sized graphic image on a Web page, Web-based document or e-mail message. It helps us do things like view the URL of the page on which the clear gif appears and the time our Web site or email in question is viewed. Clear gifs in e-mails help us confirm the receipt of, and response to, our emails, including those that you forward to friends and family; and they help deliver a more personalized online experience. Overall, these technologies may be used to help us see which of our interactive experiences online users like most–for example, by keeping track of the number of times a video, widget or other media is accessed or embedded on social networking sites; and on which social networking sites it is embedded, based on inquiries that are sent to our Web site. Cookies and clear gifs also allow us to associate your online navigational or transactional information with any personal information you provide (such as name, address, phone number, survey responses and email address). We'll associate this information only for our purposes: to deliver products and services to you; to improve our business; to transact business; and to market our products and services through a variety of media like email, mobile advertising, and direct mail. As an example, we may use cookies to keep track of what you put into your shopping bag. That can help us contact you if your online session is disrupted in mid-purchase, resulting in an abandoned cart. We can also use this technology to determine whether you'd be interested in participating in special events, given your preferences. The end result is a more personalized experience that's tailored to your needs and tastes.</p>
				</li>

		</li>
		<li>
			<h4>
				3. &nbsp;Information Others Observe or Collect through Technology</h4>
			<p>
				Third-party service providers help us provide certain features on our site and analyze our visitor's site and purchase preferences. They may also help us deliver ads to you about our products through banner ads when you visit other web sites (often referred to as "online network advertising"). The following provides more information about these service providers and the choices you have with respect to their services.</p>
			<ol class="type-a">
				<li>
					<h5>
						a. &nbsp;Features</h5>
					<p>
						We use third-party services to provide certain features on our Web site. These third parties use some or all of the technologies described in Information We Observe or Collect Through Technology to provide these features.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h5>
						b. &nbsp;Analysis</h5>
					<p>
						We contract with analytics companies to better understand your use of our Web sites, and Web capabilities like embeddable widgets. These third parties may serve surveys to determine satisfaction with the Web site and then tie the responses to actual behavior on the Web site, which will allow us to improve our Web sites and Web capabilities. They accomplish this by using some or all of the technologies described in <a href="#technology">Information We Observe or Collect Through Technology</a>.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h5>
						c. &nbsp;Advertising</h5>
					<p>
						We contract with third-party advertising companies that, in turn, collect non-personally identifying information by placing cookies on your browser when you visit us here. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, credit card information, e-mail address, or telephone number) about your visit to deliver our ads on this and other Web sites through their online advertising networks. These companies also provide this information to us which we, in turn, use to gauge how effective our ads are. If you'd like more information about how online network advertising works and what your choices are for the information that's collected via these third-party cookies, please see <a href="#choices">What Choices do you have Over how Your Information is Used</a>?</p>

We don't endorse or generally have any affiliation with these third parties. And we don't control and aren't responsible for their Web practices. Whether the third-party content appears within our Web environment (like a map frame), or you leave our Web site for another site to view it, those service provider's terms, conditions, and privacy policies govern your online experience (unless there's a conspicuously posted statement by us that says otherwise). Please view their terms of service and privacy policies if you have any question about their practices.</p>

In these cases, the third-party's privacy policy may apply to any personal information you provide in connection with the event. So please take note of who's running the event in question; and the terms, conditions, and policies that apply.</p>

			<h5>
				e. &nbsp;Third-Party Rewards or Membership Programs</h5>
			<p>
				We may interact with certain unrelated companies that offer their customers memberships to participate in programs, which may include rewards for purchases from us.

We are not responsible for the privacy practices of the companies sponsoring these membership programs.

Clearing cookies after each visit here will prevent observations from multiple sessions being aggregated over time. Please consider the consequences of blocking or clearing cookies. Many Web sites rely on their cookies to provide you with services or features that you have requested or expect. With respect to cookies used as part of a survey, if you do not want the use of cookies to associate survey responses with your behavior on the site, you can elect to not take the survey.

			<p>Nosotros recopilamos la informaci&oacute;n personal directamente de usted para hacer todas las cosas t&iacute;picamente asociadas con los sitios de Web.

			<li>procesar sus pedidos en l&iacute;nea;</li>

					<p>Cuando usted visita este sitio Web, recopilamos informaci&oacute;n relacionada con la navegaci&oacute;n, como por ejemplo el tipo de navegador y su versi&oacute;n, la identificaci&oacute;n del proveedor de servicio, la direcci&oacute;n IP, el sitio que ha visitado anteriormente y el siguiente sitio por el cual navegar&aacute;. En su mayor&iacute;a, la informaci&oacute;n de navegaci&oacute;n es an&oacute;nima en el sentido de que no contiene su nombre, direcci&oacute;n, n&uacute;mero de tel&eacute;fono, direcci&oacute;n de email ni ning&uacute;n otro tipo de informaci&oacute;n que lo identifique en forma directa. Sin embargo, podemos relacionar esta informaci&oacute;n de navegaci&oacute;n con su informaci&oacute;n personal si usted nos proporciona &eacute;sta.</p>
				<li>
					<h5><span>b.</span> &nbsp;Cookies y "clear gifs"</h5>
				<p>Para comprender mejor lo que usted hace mientras navega por nuestro sitio, usamos una funci&oacute;n del navegador que se conoce como "cookie". Una cookie es un peque&ntilde;o archivo de datos que su navegador Web almacena en su computadora. Se usa con objetivos tales como ver de qu&eacute; manera navega nuestro sitio Web, en d&oacute;nde pulsa usted un clic, y para recordarla a usted y las compras que ha realizado en l&iacute;nea cuando vuelva a ingresar al sitio. Esto nos ayuda a perfeccionar nuestro sitio, brindar mejor servicio al cliente, personalizar su experiencia en l&iacute;nea y personalizar las ofertas que le enviamos basado en sus gustos exclusivos y su historial de compra.</p>
				<p>Adem&aacute;s, usamos "clear-gifs", tambi&eacute;n conocidos como Web beacon o Web bug (interceptores de red), en nuestro sitio Web y en nuestros emails. Un clear gif es una imagen gr&aacute;fica del tama&ntilde;o de un p&iacute;xel, pr&aacute;cticamente invisible, dentro de una p&aacute;gina Web, en un documento disponible a trav&eacute;s de la Web o en un mensaje de email. Nos ayuda en asuntos tales como ver la direcci&oacute;n URL de la p&aacute;gina en la que el clear gif aparece y ver la hora en la que se accede a nuestro sitio Web o al email en cuesti&oacute;n. Los clear gifs ubicados en los emails nos ayudan a confirmar el recibo de, y la respuesta a, nuestros emails, incluyendo aquellos que usted reenv&iacute;a a sus amigos y familiares; adem&aacute;s, nos ayudan a ofrecerle una experiencia en l&iacute;nea m&aacute;s personalizada.</p>
				<p>En t&eacute;rminos generales, podemos usar estas tecnolog&iacute;as como ayuda para saber cu&aacute;les de nuestras experiencias en l&iacute;nea nuestros usuarios disfrutan m&aacute;s; por ejemplo, llevar cuenta de la cantidad de veces un video, una aplicaci&oacute;n u otro tipo de medio se accede o se incorpora a sitios para establecer conexiones sociales; y a qu&eacute; sitios para establecer conexiones sociales se incorpora, a base de consultas enviadas a nuestro sitio Web. Las cookies y los clear gifs tambi&eacute;n nos permiten relacionar su informaci&oacute;n de navegaci&oacute;n en l&iacute;nea o la informaci&oacute;n correspondiente a sus transacciones con cualquier tipo de informaci&oacute;n personal que usted nos proporcione (por ejemplo: nombre, direcci&oacute;n, n&uacute;mero de tel&eacute;fono y direcci&oacute;n de email). Relacionaremos esta informaci&oacute;n s&oacute;lo para fines propios: enviarle productos y servicios; mejorar nuestra compa&ntilde;&iacute;a; hacer negocios y comercializar nuestros productos y servicios mediante diversos medios tales como emails, publicidad m&oacute;vil y correo directo. Por ejemplo, podemos usar las cookies para llevar un registro de lo que usted a&ntilde;ade a su bolsa de compra. Esto puede ayudarnos a contactarla en caso de que su sesi&oacute;n en l&iacute;nea se interrumpa a mitad de una compra, lo que resultar&iacute;a en un carrito abandonado. Tambi&eacute;n podemos usar esta tecnolog&iacute;a para determinar si a usted le interesar&iacute;a participar en eventos especiales, de acuerdo con sus preferencias. El resultado final es una experiencia m&aacute;s personalizada, adaptada a sus necesidades y gustos.</p>
