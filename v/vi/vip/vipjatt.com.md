If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend or friends about our app, we ask them for the friend's name and email address. We will automatically send the friend a one-time email invitation to visit the app. We store this information for the sole purpose of sending these emails.

THIRD PARTY AND GOOGLE ADSENSE ADVERTISING

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our app. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.

CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY

We frequently revise this Privacy Policy to keep it up to date with mPlay.fm products, services and Web pages. "Updated" may be used to alert users to recent changes and to the date of the last update. We also post FAQ's from time to time on specific products.

NO ERROR FREE PERFORMANCE

We customarily release alpha and beta versions of our products, which are further refined before the release of the final "Gold" version. Because these products are still in a test phase, we may not always catch an unintended privacy issue, despite our efforts to do so. As such, we welcome feedback on any privacy concerns you may have, and on how to improve our products generally, in all stages of release. mPlay.fm does not guarantee error-free performance under this privacy policy. We will use reasonable efforts to comply with this privacy policy and will take prompt corrective action when we learn of any failure to comply with our privacy policy. mPlay.fm shall not be liable for any incidental, consequential or punitive damages relating to this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy shall be governed by the laws of the United States.
