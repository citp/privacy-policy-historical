          <h1>Live Nation Entertainment Privacy Policy - Your Privacy Rights</h1>

<p>
    <strong>Effective July 20, 2012 (last updated June 27, 2017)</strong></p>
    <p>
    <strong>
        This Privacy Policy applies to the sites and apps where it appears.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    This Policy describes how we treat personal information we collect both
    online and offline. This includes on our websites and in our apps. It also
    includes at our box offices or in phone or email interactions you have with
    us. If you live in Canada, please read our
    <a href="http://www.ticketmaster.ca/h/privacy.html">Canadian Privacy Policy</a>.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>We collect information from and about you.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Contact information.</strong>
    For example, we might collect your name and street address. We might also
    collect your phone number or email.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Payment and billing information.</strong>
    For example, we collect your credit card number and zip code when you buy a
    ticket.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Information you post.</strong>
    For example, we collect information you post in a public space on our
    website. We also collect information you post on a third-party social media
    site.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Demographic information.</strong>
    We may collect information like your age range, race, or gender. We may
    collect information about events you like or products you buy. We might
    collect this as part of a survey or from third parties, for example.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Other information.</strong>
    If you use our website, we may collect information about the browser you're
    using. We might look at what site you came from, or what site you visit
    when you leave us. We may collect information about your location,
    including your precise location. We may collect this using technology such
    as GPS and Wi-Fi. If you use our mobile app, we may also access your
    device's location in the background. We may collect your device's unique
    identifier. We might also collect the type of mobile device you are using,
    or the version of the operating system your computer or device is running.
    We might look at how often you use the app and where you downloaded it.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>We collect information in different ways.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>We collect information directly from you.</strong>
    For example, if you register for a promotion or buy tickets. We also
    collect information if you post a comment on our websites or ask us a
    question.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>We collect information from you passively.</strong>
    We use tracking tools like browser cookies and web beacons. To learn more
    about these tools and to control them, please click
    <a href="/ad-choices">here</a>. We also collect information from our mobile apps.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>We get information about you from third parties.</strong>
    For example, if you use an integrated social media feature on our websites
    or mobile applications. The third-party social media site will give us
    certain information about you. This could include your name and email
    address. Your activities on our sites and apps may be posted to the social
    media platforms.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>We use information as disclosed and described here.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        We use information to respond to your requests or questions.
    </strong>
    For example, we might use your information to confirm your registration for
    an event or contest. You may give us your friend's information, for
    example, via our referral service to tell a friend about our website or to
    purchase a gift card. We will only use your friend's information to provide
services you requested. Your friend may contact us at    <a href="mailto:privacy@livenation.com">privacy@livenation.com</a> to ask
    us to delete their information.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>We use information to improve our products and services.</strong>
    We might use your information to customize your experience with us. This
    could include displaying content based upon your preferences.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        We use information to look at site trends and customer interests.
    </strong>
    We may use your information to make our website and products better. We may
    combine information we get from you with information about you we get from
    third parties.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>We use information for security purposes.</strong>
    We may use information to protect our company, our customers, or our
    websites.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>We use information for marketing purposes.</strong>
    For example, we might send you information about special promotions or
    offers. We might also tell you about new features or products. These might
    be our own offers or products, or third-party offers or products we think
    you might find interesting. Or, for example, if you buy tickets from us
    we'll enroll you in our newsletter. To learn about your choices for these
    communications, read the
    <a href="#certain-choices">
        choices section
    </a>
    below.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>We may also use push notifications on our mobile apps. </strong>
    We may use push notifications and your location information on our mobile
    apps to send you alerts regarding local events.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        We use information to send you transactional communications.
    </strong>
    For example, we might send you emails about your account or a ticket
    purchase. We might also contact you about this policy or our website terms.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        We use information as otherwise permitted by law or as we may notify
        you.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    We keep personal information as long as it is necessary or relevant for our
    business. We also keep information to resolve disputes, enforce our
    agreements and as otherwise required by law.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>We may share information with third parties.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        We will share information within the Live Nation family of companies.
    </strong>
    This may include Ticketmaster and Live Nation-owned or operated venues, for
    example.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        We will share information with third parties who perform services on
        our behalf.
    </strong>
    For example, we share information with vendors who help us manage our
    online registration process or who fulfill your purchases. Some vendors may
    be located outside of the United States.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>We will share information with our business partners.</strong>
    This includes a third party who provides or sponsors an event, or who
    operates a venue where we hold events. Our partners use the information we
    give them as described in their privacy policies, which may include sending
    you marketing communications. You should read those polices to learn how
    they treat your information.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        We may share information if we think we have to in order to comply with
        the law or to protect ourselves.
    </strong>
    For example, we will share information to respond to a court order or
    subpoena. We may also share it if a government agency or investigatory body
    requests. Or, we might also share information when we are investigating
    potential fraud. This might include fraud we think has happened during a
    sweepstakes or promotion.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        We may share information with any successor to all or part of our
        business.
    </strong>
    For example, if part of our business is sold we may give our customer list
    as part of that transaction.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        We may share your information for reasons not described in this policy.
    </strong>
    We will tell you before we do this.
</p>
<p>
    <a name="certain-choices"></a><strong>
        You have certain choices about how we use your information.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>You can opt out of receiving our marketing emails.</strong>
To stop receiving our promotional emails, click    <a href="/account">here</a> or follow
    the instructions in any promotional message you get from us. Your device
    settings should provide you with instructions on how to turn off push
    notifications. It may take about ten days to process your request. Don't
    worry! Even if you opt out of getting marketing messages, we will still be
    sure to send you transactional messages. For example, we may still contact
    you about your orders.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>You can modify information you have given us.</strong>
    To correct or delete information or update account settings, log into your
    account and follow the instructions. We make changes as soon as we can.
    This information may stay in our backup files. If we cannot make the
    changes you want, we will let you know and explain why. If you contact us
    requesting access to your information, we will respond within 30 days.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>You can control cookies and tracking tools.</strong>
    To learn how to manage how we - and our vendors - use cookies and other
    tracking tools, please click
    <a href="/ad-choices">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>You can control tools on your mobile devices.</strong>
    For example, you can turn off the GPS locator or push notifications on your
    phone. Each push notification has an "unsubscribe" link.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Your California Privacy Rights.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    If you live in California and have an established business relationship
    with us, you can request a list of the personal information we have shared
    with third parties for their marketing purposes. We will also give you a
    list of the third parties that have received your information. You can make
    a request one time each year.
</p>
<p>
To exercise your rights, you can    <a href="mailto:privacy@livenation.com">email us</a> or write to us at the
    address below. Mention in your letter that you are making a "California
    Shine the Light" inquiry. We will respond within 30 days.
