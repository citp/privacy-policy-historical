# Sunbelt Software Privacy Statement

The following principles apply to the personally identifying information we ask for and that you provide. "Personally identifying information" is information that individually identifies you, such as your name, physical address or email address.

**Data Collection**  
Sunbelt Software collects limited non-personally identifying information your browser makes available whenever you visit one of our websites. This log information includes your Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your download and in some cases, one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser. We use this information to operate, develop and improve our services.

Some of our services require you to register. Sunbelt Software asks you for some personal information in order to create an account (typically your name, email address, physical address, and phone number) and we will use that information to provide the service. For certain services, such as our OnLineShop, we may request credit card or other payment information which we do not keep or store on our servers.

When we require personally identifying information, we will inform you about the types of information we collect and how we use it. We hope this will help you make an informed decision about sharing your personal information with us.

**Cookies**  
To enhance your experience with our site, some of our web pages use "cookies." Cookies are small text files we place in your computer's browser to store your preferences. Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your e-mail address or other personally identifiable information unless you choose to provide this information to us by, for example, by registering at our site. However, once you choose to furnish the site with personally identifiable information, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie.

We use cookies to understand site usage and to improve the content and offerings on our site. For example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience at our web pages (e.g. to recognize you by name when you return to our site). We also may use cookies to offer you products, programs, or services.

**Information Sharing**  
We do not rent or sell your personally identifying information to other companies or individuals, unless we have your consent. We may share such information in any of the following limited circumstances: 

  * We have your consent. 
  * We provide such information to trusted businesses or persons for the sole purpose of processing personally identifying information on our behalf. When this is done, it is subject to agreements that oblige those parties to process such information only on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and appropriate confidentiality and security measures. 
  * We conclude that we are required by law or have a good faith belief that access, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of Sunbelt Software, its users or the public. 

In the event of a transfer of ownership of Sunbelt Software (including any publications), such as acquisition by or merger with another company, we will provide notice before any personally identifying information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

We may share aggregated information with others. Examples of this include the number of users who downloaded a specific product or how many users clicked on a particular advertisement.

**Information Security**  
We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data.

We restrict access to your personally identifying information to employees who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services.

We provide mechanisms for updating and correcting your personally identifying information for many of our services.

You may send an e-mail or letter to the following e-mail or street address requesting access to or correction of your personally identifiable information:

**Secure Shopping & Registration Guarantee**  
The purchase and registration areas of our site (OnLineShop) are secure. This means that any information you send us is protected by encryption to prevent unauthorized access to your information. The secure site is indicated in the URL with the use of "https://", and often reflected at the bottom of your browser with a lock or key graphic.

**Links**  
This website and any newsletter issued by any site affiliated with this site may contain links to other websites with whom we have a business relationship. Sunbelt Software does not review or screen these sites, and we are not responsible or liable for their privacy or data security practices, or the content of these sites.

Additionally, if you register with any of these sites, any information that you provide in the process of registration, such as your email address, credit card number or other personally identifiable information, will be transferred to these sites. For these reasons, you should be careful to review any privacy and data security policies posted on any of these sites before providing information to them.
