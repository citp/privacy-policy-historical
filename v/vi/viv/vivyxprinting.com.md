Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested. 

When creating an account or placing an order with us, you may provide certain information as requested in the applicable forms. We then use that information as necessary to process your order or complete other requests you may make via our website. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order. 

We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website. This information does not identify you or any customer, rather it is general information about percentage of visitors that use particular features on our website. 

### Our Commitment To Children's Privacy:

Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13. 

### How You Can Access Or Correct Your Information:

You can access all your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain by logging into [your assigned account](http://www.vivyxprinting.com/account.asp) using the password provided. We use this procedure to better safeguard your information. 

You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable information by sending us a request that credibly shows error. 

To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.
