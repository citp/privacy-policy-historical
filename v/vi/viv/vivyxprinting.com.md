## Orders, Returns & Guarantee

### Fast Turnaround

Vivyx Printing ships orders as quickly as possible. Standard Processing orders ship no later than 5 business days from the day after your order was placed.

This service may take up to 10 days to deliver. 

**Standard Processing time is up to 5 business days following the day when the order is placed. For faster processing, select Expedited Processing during checkout.** Expedited Processing ensures your order will ship by the end of the next business day. 

### Pre-Ship Visual Inspection

Your print is visually inspected by our quality control department before it is shipped, to ensure you receive a high-quality print. This is a manual process, not performed by machines. We believe in delivering quality! 

### Special Quality Notice

During the photo upload and configuration process, you may be alerted that your uploaded photo is not big enough to produce a very high quality print in the size you have selected. You will be given an option to select a smaller size, or proceed anyway. If you choose to proceed anyway, accepting that your print may be of reduced quality, VivyxPrinting.com does not guarantee the quality of the resulting print and will not refund or reprint the order! 

### How to Request a Reprint or Refund

If your print quality is not satisfactory, or is defective, you may request a reprint or refund by [contacting us](https://web.archive.org/web/20121230191657id_/http%3A//www.vivyxprinting.com/%3C%=RootURL%%3E/contact.asp) or calling Customer Service between 10am-6pm MST (Monday-Friday.)
