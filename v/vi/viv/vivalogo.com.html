<br>
Vivalogo is committed to protecting your online privacy while providing you with the most useful and enjoyable Web experience possible. While you can use many features of Vivalogo anonymously, you are required to provide personal information to gain access to some of our premium content and services.
<br>

<br>
<b>How we collect and use personal information</b>
<br>

<br>
When you complete our order form we collect information about you and your business to aid in the design of your logo or other graphic design services.  The information we collect from you is never shared with any other company and is treated as confidential.
<br>

<br>
We also work tirelessly to make sure that we use any information you provide us only in ways you have approved. 
<br>

<br>
<b>How we use "cookies"</b>
<br>

<br>
We only use "cookies" in our Client Area to provide secure logging in.
As you probably know, "cookies" are small pieces of information that some Web sites store on your computer's hard drive when you visit them. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies but allow you to modify security settings so you can approve or reject cookies on a case-by-case basis. Even if you do not use cookies, you can still access all of the features on our site (except ofcourse the Client Area).
<br>

<br>
<b>What we provide to third parties</b>
     <p>It is important to note that VivaLogo does not process orders directly. 
          We use reputable ecommerce company - Share-It, Inc. to do this on our 
          behalf using the very latest in secure transmission technologies. It 
          is very important for Share-It to keep accurate purchase records. Share-It 
          will pass on the following details when you purchase one of our packages 
          to us - name, company name, e-mail address, and other relevant contact 
          details. This data is used only to identify you in order to give you 
          the full benefits of your purchase. Please note that we do not receive 
          a copy of your actual payment details (such as Credit card numbers or 
          Wire transfer details). We do not make any of this information available 
          to any third parties. To learn more about our ecommerce vendor`s privacy
