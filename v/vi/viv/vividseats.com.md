## International Users

If you provide personal information through our website, you agree that the personal information will be transferred to and processed in the United States of America and any other country or jurisdiction at our sole discretion. The laws that apply to the use and protection of personal information in the United States or other countries or jurisdictions in which we transfer or process personal information may be different than the laws and protections in your country. By using our website or app, you agree to the transfer and processing of your information in accordance with US law. In the event you wish to withdraw consent, please email [ support@vividseats.com](mailto:support@vividseats.com.) to delete your account and then cease using our services.

While we take certain steps to safeguard your personal information, please note that the United States has **NOT** been deemed by the European Commission to ensure an adequate level of protection for personal data. Accordingly, the level of safeguards and legal protections provided in the United States or other non-European countries from which you may access our website or mobile application may not be as stringent as that under European Union privacy standards or the privacy laws of some other countries, possibly including your home jurisdiction.

## Privacy Shield

We will treat all data received from the EU in accordance with privacy shield principles. Vivid Seats participates in the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks and complies with the associated requirements regarding collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the EU and Switzerland to the United States. For the avoidance of doubt, Vivid Seats' adherence to the Privacy Shield framework does not apply to any human resources data. To learn more about Privacy Shield, and to see our certification, please visit <https://www.privacyshield.gov/>. Vivid Seats is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission and may be held liable in cases of onward transfers of data received from the EU to third parties.

## European Residents

If you are a resident of the European Union, you may have certain rights under European data protection law with respect to your personal data, including the right to request access to, correct, amend, delete, limit the use of, or withdraw your consent for the processing of your personal data. You may also have the right to receive a copy of your personal data in a commonly used and machine-readable format and to transmit such data to another controller. To request deletion of, access to, or to make changes to data, or to otherwise exercise any of your rights in this paragraph, email us at [legal@vividseats.com](mailto:legal@vividseats.com.). Please remember that if you delete or limit the use of your personal data, you may not be able to use the services provided through our website or mobile application.
