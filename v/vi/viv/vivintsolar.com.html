<h2 id="privacy">Privacy</h2>
<p>Your privacy is important to Vivint Solar, Inc. (together with its affiliates, “Vivint Solar”). The following Privacy Policy (this “Policy”) discloses the information practices followed by Vivint Solar with respect to your personal information we gather through our website (this “Site”), the way we use the information internally, and our policy regarding sharing information with others. We have implemented these practices for this Site and related pages.</p>
<h2 id="what-information-do-we-collect">What information do we collect</h2>
<p>We collect information from you when you register on this Site, respond to a survey, or fill out a form. Personal information gathered on this Site means any information that is related to an identified person, or that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to: first and last name; email address; a home, postal or other physical address or other contact information; title, birth date, gender, occupation, industry, or personal interests; and other information necessary or useful to provide a product or service that you have requested. You may, however, visit our site anonymously.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-we-protect-your-information-">How do we protect your information?</h2>
<p>We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you enter, submit, or access your personal information.
We offer the use of a secure server. All supplied sensitive or private information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology, and we keep the information secure.</p>
<h2 id="what-do-we-use-your-information-for-">What do we use your information for?</h2>
<p>Any of the information we collect from you may be used in one of the following ways:
i.    To personalize your experience. Your information helps us to better respond to your individual needs.
ii.    To improve our Site. We continually strive to improve our Site offerings based on the information and feedback we receive from you.
iii.    To improve customer service. Your information helps us to more effectively respond to your customer service requests and support needs.
iv.    To process transactions. Your information will not be sold, exchanged, transferred, or given to any company other than an affiliate of Vivint Solar, Inc., such as Vivint, Inc., for any reason whatsoever, without your consent, other than for the express purpose of delivering the purchased product or service requested.
v.    To administer a contest, promotion, survey or other Site feature.
vi.    To send periodic emails. The email address you provide for order processing will only be used to send you information and updates pertaining to your order. Note: If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, we include detailed unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of each email.</p>
<h2 id="e-mail-communications">E-mail communications</h2>
<p>E-mail is not necessarily secure against all forms of interception. If your communication includes sensitive information about you and you would prefer not to transmit this information in this fashion, please contact us by mail or telephone rather than e-mail.
We collect only those e-mail addresses that are volunteered by the visitor, through e-mail messages addressed to our company or its employees, or through visitor responses via the “contact us” portion of the Site, e-mail marketing destination web pages and public events. We use the lists of e-mail addresses for marketing purposes and to inform those interested in our products about events, products, services or other items of interest. We may also use the lists of e-mail addresses volunteered by our visitors to register the visitor for an extranet account or to process orders for brochures and other written materials.
You may opt-out of receiving the promotional or marketing e-mails at any time by notifying us as a reply to any unwanted e-mail, or by writing to Vivint Solar at 1800 W. Ashton Boulevard, Lehi, Utah 84043.
This opt-out procedure will not be available for e-mails that are necessary to provide confirmation of a completed transaction (such as a purchase, service request or change in the visitor’s user profile) or for e-mails that confirm a visitor's status as a registered user of the Vivint Solar customer extranet.</p>
<h2 id="other-personal-information">Other personal information</h2>
<p>We may use a mailing address or phone number that a visitor provides for a variety of Vivint Solar related reasons. We may send periodic mailings to visitors or make telephone calls to inform those visitors who have provided a mailing address or telephone number of new products, services or events.  We may also share such information with our affiliates, such as Vivint, Inc.
If you do not wish to receive such calls or mailings, you may request to be removed from the contact list by contacting Vivint Solar at support@vivintsolar.com or by telephone 877.404.4129. Additionally, you may make your request by writing to Vivint Solar at 1800 W. Ashton Boulevard, Lehi, Utah 84043.</p>
