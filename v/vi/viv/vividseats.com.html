          <p><strong>Cookies&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for  record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. We do not link the  information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you  submit while on our site.<br>
            <br>
            We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies.&nbsp; We use session cookies to make it easier for  you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your  browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period  of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in  your Internet browser’s “help” file. <br>
            <br>
            We set a persistent cookie to store your email address, so you don’t have to enter  it more than once.&nbsp; Persistent cookies  also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the  experience on our site.&nbsp; <br>

            We collect information contained in cookies, such as your purchases and log in  data, to personalize your shopping experience.&nbsp;  Your browser must accept cookies if you wish you add items to a shopping  cart.<br>

            <strong>Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)</strong><br>
            <br>
            Our third party advertising partner employs a software technology called clear  gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our  site by informing us what content is effective.&nbsp;  Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in  function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web  users.&nbsp; In contrast to cookies, which are  stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web  pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do  not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally  identifiable information.<br>
