      You may not use this Site to send online greeting cards to   mailing lists to which you do not have full rights or to send unsolicited bulk   or commercial messages. In addition, the use of automated scripting-type   programs that automate the process of sending or viewing any of the Materials is   strictly prohibited. VivaPersia.com reserves the right to limit, in its sole discretion and   without prior notice to you, the number of cards or messages that you may send   using the Site and/or the number of recipients to which you send such cards or   messages. <br>

      <p class="margin_left_20"><strong>Overview</strong><br>
      At VivaPersia.com, protecting our users' privacy and security   is a top priority. For this reason, we have adopted the following policy to   advise you of your choices regarding the use of your personal information   online. This policy describes what types of information we gather about you, how   we use it, under what circumstances we disclose it to third-parties, and your   rights to update or correct it.</p>
      <p class="margin_left_20"><strong>Aggregate Data</strong><br>
  We gather certain generic information with   respect to customers' use of our web site, such as the number of unique   visitors, the frequency with which they visit, and the areas on the web site   that they favor. These statistics are very much like television ratings that   tell the networks how many people tuned in to a program. We only use this type   of data in aggregate-that is, we look at the data on a collective basis, in   summary form, rather than on an individual basis. This data helps us determine   the extent to which our customers use certain parts of our web site, which, in   turn, enables us to make it as appealing as possible. We may also provide   statistical "ratings" about how our customers collectively use our web site to   advertisers, sponsors, and other companies with which we do business ("Business   Partners"). We do this so they, too, can understand how often people use their   areas of the site in order for them to provide you with the best possible   experience. These statistical ratings do not contain any personally identifiable   information about you or any of our users.</p>
      <p class="margin_left_20"><strong>IP Addresses</strong><br>
      We collect and analyze traffic on our web site   by keeping track of the IP addresses of our visitors. IP addresses are unique   numeric identifiers that are assigned to each computer browser accessing the   Internet. An IP address, by itself, cannot identify you personally. However,   when combined with other information provided by your Internet Service Provider   (ISP), your IP address can be used to identify the computer originating a   message.</p>
      <p class="margin_left_20"><strong>When You Send A Greeting</strong><br>
      If you use our web site to send a greeting or any other content, we collect your e-mail address and your   recipient's e-mail/mailing address. This information is necessary to send the content   and provide confirmation that it has been received. We will not use your   recipient's e-mail/mailing address for any purpose other than to send the greeting. We   may also use your e-mail address to contact you if you have chosen to receive   communications from VivaPersia.com or its Partners.</p>
      <p class="margin_left_20"><br>
        <strong>Privacy of Greeting Card Information</strong><br>
      We treat all of our greetings   products as private correspondence between the sender and the recipient and will   not disclose the contents of any greeting other than to the intended recipient,   except under the specific situations outlined in Disclosure Exceptions, below.   This policy applies to all aspects of our greetings, including your personalized   messages. Under normal circumstances, we will not monitor or edit the contents   of the online greetings you send. On occasion, however, we may need to view your   message in connection with the technical processing of your greeting or the   maintenance of our network. Also, if you ask one of our customer service   representatives to help you send a greeting or to verify that a greeting was   sent, that representative will be able to access all information about the card,   including the recipient's e-mail address and the message. <br>
      <em><br>
      </em><strong>Disclosure Exceptions</strong><br>
      Notwithstanding the above   policies, we reserve the right to disclose your personal information to   appropriate third-parties if we are required to do so by law or we believe that   such action is necessary: </p>
      <ul>
        <li class="margin_left_20">To comply with legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena or court   order; </li>
        <li class="margin_left_20">To protect the company's rights and property; </li>
        <li class="margin_left_20">To investigate reports of users sending material using a false e-mail   address or users sending harassing, threatening, or abusive messages; </li>
        <li class="margin_left_20">To protect against misuse or unauthorized use of our web site and/or the   VivaPersia.com service; or </li>
        <li class="margin_left_20">During emergencies, such as when we believe someone's physical safety is at   risk. </li>
