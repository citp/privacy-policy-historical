To provide you the best possible products and services, we will request specific
                    personal information when you register on vivre.com, when you make a product or gift
                    card purchase, and when you request a catalogue. Any personal information collected
                    on vivre is knowingly and voluntarily provided by customers and visitors to our site.

                    At registration, we collect your name, shipping and billing addresses, telephone numbers,
                    and e-mail address in order to deliver your orders promptly and to the proper
                    location. We use your e-mail address to send you two emails following a purchase.
                    The first confirms that your order was shipped, and provides an itemized order summary
                    with your order number. The second e-mail provides you with a FedEx tracking
                    number so that you can determine the status of your order. Please note that should
                    any of your items be on-reserve, out-of-stock or discontinued, you will receive an additional
                    email after your order confirmation specifying the specific status of each item
                    in question. If necessary, a Customer Care Associate may contact you by telephone to
                    resolve any issues concerning your order.

                    misuse and alteration of the information under our control. We will automatically store
                    your credit card number and expiration date on our secure server with your account so
                    that you will not have to fill out this information again during future visits and purchases
                    at vivre.com. This information is used solely for billing purposes when you order from

    <p>
Shopping and buying online with your credit card is actually statistically more secure than using it in a department store. And, at Vivre, our customers' privacy and security are a top priority. We take every precaution to protect your online order information. 
<br><br>
Our checkout and confirmation areas are secured using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. SSL technology ensures that your credit card number and personal data are never sent over the Internet unencrypted. Once we receive your credit card information, it is immediately and securely stored in its encrypted form in our data center. Once it is encrypted, only the credit card authorization company can decrypt it. Your credit card number is never displayed on our site—only the first and last four digits will ever be shown. Even our Customer Care associates only have access to your card's first digit, last four digits, and expiration date.
<br><br>
You can have full confidence in the security of your transactions while shopping with Vivre. However, should you prefer to order by telephone, we are happy to take your order at 800.411.6515.
