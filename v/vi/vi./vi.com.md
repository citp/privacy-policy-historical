# Privacy Policy | Vi

Information is collected on this website by ViSalus, Inc. doing business as ViSalus Sciences ("ViSalus"). ViSalus is committed to protecting your privacy and will use your personal information responsibly. Please read below for detailed information about our privacy policy.

## Information Collection and Use

ViSalus is the owner of all information collected at this site. We will not share or rent this personal information with or to anyone else in any way that is different from what is disclosed to you in this policy. We may collect information from several different points on our website or the websites of ViSalus Promotors, when you make a purchase from one of our Promotors or have other interactions where personal data is provided.

At certain points in interactive communication with us, you might provide us with personal information such as your name, address, telephone number, and email address. Demographic personal information such as income level, gender, and other personal information of yours may be provided by you on an optional basis.

We may also gather on line information regarding your purchases and shopping activities on websites we host (such as those of ViSalus Promotors) to improve the content, ease of use and shopping experience on those websites and to improve our marketing and promotions for our company overall and the websites in particular.

In addition, our web server may automatically collect the following non-personally identifiable information:

  * your internet service provider's address,
  * the referring URL and
  * the information on the pages you access on our site or on the sites of the ViSalus Promotors since we host those websites.



Personal information that you provide to ViSalus will be used by us for the purposes of enabling a ViSalus Promotor to contact you at your request for the purposes of your becoming a ViSalus Promotor. ViSalus may also use your personal information to contact you to keep you informed of developments or opportunities in relation to ViSalus, or any of its products or services.

We may also use information collected when you make a purchase on line through a Promotor Website or at a ViSalus show in order to process your order or purchase, process credit card payments, provide warranty service or advise you of promotions and ViSalus product news. We may also send you emails with offers from marketing partners which have products or service we believe might be of interest to you.

We do use third party companies to gather information and provide services to us, for example in maintaining and organizing customer information and conducting promotions, upgrading our internet services, sending communications and contacting our customers. Some of those third parties will and do have access to the information which customers provide, including email addresses and credit card information and they may also use cookies on behalf of ViSalus.

We may also use third party providers to provide ads for ViSalus products or services throughout the internet. They may provide anonymous information regarding your visits to a ViSalus website (or that of a ViSalus Promotor) and your interaction with the goods and services which ViSalus provides. They may also use information about your visits to ViSalus and other web sites to target advertisements for goods or services. Your anonymous information is collected through a pixel tab, a standard technology used at most major consumer websites. This technology does not require the use or collection of any personally identifiable information such as your name or email address.

If you have any concerns regarding the use of your information or wish to be removed from our e-mail list, please contact us at the address shown at the end of this Privacy Policy.

## Children

We do not intend to collect any personal information from children under the age of eighteen. If a parent or guardian of a child who has provided us with such personal information would like the information deleted from our records, he or she should contact us at the email address or telephone number listed at the bottom of this policy statement. We will then delete the child's personal information from our files.

If we become aware that personally identifiable information regarding a child under the age of 13 has been collected at the Site, we will use such information for the sole purpose of contacting a parent or guardian of the child to obtain verifiable parental consent. If we cannot obtain consent after a reasonable period of time, or if when contacted a parent or guardian requests that we do not use or maintain such information, we will make reasonable efforts to delete it from our records. Upon request by a parent or guardian, ViSalustm will provide a description of the specific types of personal information collected from a child who is under the age of 13.
