**DATA SECURITY**

  * We use the latest security measures to protect your details when you shop with us. We use 128-bit TLS (the successor to SSL) to encrypt all data sent from you to us and us to you. This protects your personal, card and other data from being read by others in transit. Our servers also refuse to accept connections using older versions of SSL which are no longer considered secure if a client tries to use them, so you know your connection is secure.
  * Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our website, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.
  * Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure.

Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.
  * We will engage selected system support partners from time to time as required in order to support and maintain our website’s security and integrity of data. Data may be transferred as required to fulfil the purpose of the engagement. For example, we currently use Sentry to improve data integrity and Cloudflare for additional data security.

**RETENTION OF DATA**

One of the core principles of GDPR is storage/retention of data and the regulation states to keep data only for as long as reasonably required. The regulation also states if there is a legal or statutory obligation to retain data, this supersedes GDPR for the period of legal/statutory obligation.

VioVet has reviewed all of its legal obligations and determines the following pieces of statute are applicable to data retention:

  * Veterinary Medicines Regulations
  * Companies Act 2006
  * HMRC Record Keeping Requirements



Based on this review, prescriptions/medical records will be kept for five complete financial years and adequate financial records will need to be kept for six complete financial years. To maintain adequate financial records, details of customer orders and supporting information will need to be kept.

After these periods, all Personally Identifiable Information will be removed.

**WHERE WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION**

  * The primary location for data stored by VioVet and used for the processing of orders is in the UK where only authorised personnel have access to the data.
  * The information that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers.
