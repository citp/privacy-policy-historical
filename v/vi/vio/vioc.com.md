# Valvoline Instant Oil Change

We have organized our websites so that you will not be required to identify yourself or reveal any personal information in order to view our websites. At times, we may ask you to provide information about yourself or your company in order to better serve you. If you choose to provide this personally identifiable information, we will use it in accordance with this Privacy Notice. We provide this Privacy Notice to answer some of the questions you may have about the types of information we may collect from our website and what we may do with that information. By entering this website, you are consenting to the terms of this Privacy Notice. This Privacy Notice only applies to data collected on vioc.com. Individual Ashland Inc. ("Ashland") websites may have privacy notices tailored specifically for activity on those websites, and the terms of those privacy notices may differ to some extent from this Privacy Notice. 

**Changes to this Privacy Notice**  
We reserve the right to update this Privacy Notice at any time without notice to you. The most current version of the Privacy Notice can be reviewed by clicking on the "Privacy Notice" hypertext link located at the bottom of the web pages on this website. Your use of this website may also be subject to additional terms outlined elsewhere on this website. 

**What information do we collect?**  
We understand that you expect to learn about Valvoline Instant Oil Change when you visit this website. Similarly, we hope to learn about your needs as a current or potential customer or shareholder through your visits to this website. On some of our web pages, you may be able to ask questions, register to receive information, enter sweepstakes or enter information about your vehicle. In addition, we enter information you give us at a service center on this site. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing future visits for you, improving our website and communicating with you. You may decide against participating in data collection by not sending us information which you consider private. 

"My Car History" offers a user the opportunity to personalize their online experience by using cookies. We use "cookies" on this website to help you use our services more easily, and to help us keep track of certain statistical information such as IP address, the type of browser and operating system used to access this site, the date and time you access this site, the pages you visit and, if you linked from another website, the address of that website so that we can continuously improve our website and our service to you. A "cookie" is a small data file that a website can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your hard drive to help our website "remember" information about you when you return to our website, such as your preferences for our website and user passwords. Our cookies cannot read data off of your hard drive, cannot read cookie files created by other websites or track any personal information about you. You may be able to set your browser to erase a cookie, reject a cookie or notify you when you receive a cookie. If you erase or reject a cookie, you may still use this website. 

Personalization in the "My Car History" area creates an individual experience for users by displaying the user's name, MVP records from VIOC, service history the user inputs, and manufacturer's recommendations. 

**What security measures are in place for "My Car History"?**  
VIOC's proprietary and non-sequential card-numbering process ensures a statistical improbability that any one person - either accidentally or purposely - could enter your vehicle's MVP number. 

**What do we do with this information?**  
We will use the information that you provide us to better understand your needs and to provide you with better products and services. At the most basic level, we will use information you provide to communicate with you, to update you on our products and services, and to personalize our websites for you. Periodically, we may survey you about your use of products for other market research, or to provide you with marketing information we think will be useful to you. Of course, you need not participate in these surveys or accept this marketing information. 

**Will information be sold to third parties?**  
Except as set forth in this Privacy Notice, we will not, without your permission, give, sell or provide to others for a fee the information which you provide to us. We will always ask for and obtain your permission before sharing your personal information with third parties not involved in providing the products or services you have requested or with anyone other than Ashland affiliates, business associates or corporate transaction partners, unless we believe in good faith the law supports disclosure without your consent. 

**What do we do with the e-mail addresses we collect?**  
Valvoline Instant Oil Change is collecting e-mail addresses in an effort to communicate with consumers via e-mail. To use the "MVP System" online, it is required that a user provide their e-mail address. You will be given the opportunity to choose whether or not you would like to receive e-mail communications from VIOC. If you do not select a checkbox, VIOC will assume that you do not wish to receive e-mail communication from VIOC. These options include service reminder notifications and offers, newsletters, product information, etc. If at any time you wish to change your selection about e-mail communication from VIOC, you can do so under "Customer Profile" in the "My Car History" section of the VIOC.com site. 

If you choose to opt in to all our offers, you can expect to receive various auto-related service and product e-mail from time to time. We understand that our customers may wish to be selective in opting out of specific offerings of products and services while retaining other services of interest. 

**Hyperlinks**  
We may provide you with hyperlinks to other websites. Please be aware that we cannot guarantee or vouch for the data collection practices of such other websites. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements for those linked websites. 

**Privacy of Children**  
This website is not designed for, or directed to, children under the age of 13 and will not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from individuals in this age group. We encourage parents to take an active role in their children's online activities and to talk with their children about disclosing personally identifiable information to websites. 

**How to contact Ashland**
