Privacy Matters

* * *

10/23/98 

Depending on what you do when you visit any Web site, you are providing information about your visit to the site’s owners. This includes visa-asia.com. We value privacy and think you do too, so we want you to have the information you need to make your own decisions about your personal privacy. When you visit or supply information to any Web site, we think it’s a good idea for you to first understand what that site’s privacy policies are. If the site doesn’t tell you, don’t hesitate to ask. 

The bottom line at visa-asia.com is that we use the information that we get from your visit for internal tracking purposes, to make the visa-asia.com as useful and interesting to you as we can, and to respond to your requests for information or other services. Except as specifically noted below or in the visa-asia.com [Site Rules](https://web.archive.org/web/20010220030953id_/http%3A//www.visa.com.hk/ut/legal/main.html), we do not use your personal information for any other purpose, we _never_ sell it to any third party, and we never even share it with any third party. 

Here is more detail on how we handle information we learn from you when you visit visa-asia.com. 

**Browsing:**

**When you** visit visa-asia.com and move from page to page, read pages or download content onto your computer, 

**We learn** which pages are visited, what is downloaded, the domains our visitors come from (e.g. ‘aol.com,’ or ‘umich.edu’) and the addresses of sites visited immediately before coming to visa-asia.com. However, none of this is associated with you as an individual. It is measured only in aggregate. 

Visa-asia.com uses cookie technology as part of our Web site’s statistical reporting. The information in the cookies lets us trace the paths followed by visitors to our site as they move from one page to another. We also use standard Web server log files, to help us count visitors and evaluate our site’s technical capacity. Cookies do not capture your individual email address or any private information about you. 

**We use** this information to find out how many people visit visa-asia.com, help us arrange the pages in the most user-friendly way, keep the site browser-friendly, and to make our pages more useful to our visitors. We record information on site traffic but not information on individual visitors to our site, so no information about you in particular will be kept or used. 

**Responding to Games or Surveys:**

**When you** respond to a trivia game by submitting your answers or respond to a survey question with your opinion, 

**We learn** your answer or opinion. 

**We use** your response to come up with the game or survey results and, sometimes, to publish those results in aggregate on the site. We will never permanently record or report any response you give on its own or connect it to your name or address. We hold these responses only as anonymous statistics. 

**Email:**

**When you** send us an email to comment on something or ask us a question, 

**We learn** your exact email address and the thoughts you share. 

**We use** your email address to thank you for your comment and/or reply to your question, and we will store your communication and our reply in case we correspond further. We will never use your email address to send you any unsolicited message or information, nor will we share it with or sell it to anyone else for such use. 

**Mailing Lists, Other Services:**

**When you** give us your email address and/or other information and ask us to use it to provide you with specific communications or other services offered on the Visa site.

**We learn** your exact email address, any other information you provide, and your request. 

**We use** your email address and any other information you give us to provide you with the information or other services you requested until you ask us to stop (using the ‘unsubscribe’ instructions provided with each email and/or on the site where you signed up and/or as we otherwise provide), or until the information or services is no longer available. We will not use your address or other information to provide you with any unsolicited message or information (unless that is part of the service you are requesting), nor will we share it with or sell it to any third party for such use. 

**Linking To Other Sites:**

Please remember that when you use a link to go from visa-asia.com to another Web site, the visa-asia.com Site Rules and this Privacy Policy are no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other Web site, including sites which have a link on visa-asia.com, is subject to the rules and policies of that site. Please read over those rules and policies before proceeding. 

Please note the whenever you submit any information to us in connection with any service provided in connection with visa-asia.com, you consent to Visa’s processing this information in the United States as necessary to provide the services in which you are participating. 

Please also read over the visa-asia.com [Site Rules](https://web.archive.org/web/20010220030953id_/http%3A//www.visa.com.hk/ut/legal/main.html). Visa takes privacy matters very seriously, and intends to stay at the forefront of privacy policy and protection matters. If you have any questions, comments, criticisms, or complaints about visa-asia.com’s privacy policy and/or the way it affects you, please feel free to [email us](mailto:askvisa@visa.com).
