### How we treat personal information that is also sensitive information

Sensitive information is a sub-set of personal information that is given a higher level of protection under the Australian Privacy Principles. **Sensitive information** means information relating to your racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion, trade union or other professional associations or memberships, philosophical beliefs, sexual orientation, sexual practices or sex life, criminal records, health information or biometric information. Provided you consent, your sensitive information may only be used and disclosed for purposes relating to the primary purpose for which the sensitive information was collected. Sensitive information may also be used or disclosed if required or authorised by law.

### Our responsibilities as a 'controller' under the GDPR

Controllers are defined by the GDPR as natural or legal persons, a public authority, agency or other body to which personal information or personal data has been disclosed, whether via a third party or not, and who determines the purposes and means of processing personal information. We are a controller under the GDPR as we collect, use and store your personal information to enable us to provide you with our goods and/or services. As a controller, we have certain obligations under the GDPR when collecting, storing and using the personal information of EU citizens. If you are an EU citizen, your personal data will:

  * be processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner by us;
  * only be collected for the specific purposes we have identified in the ‘collection and use of personal information’ clause above and personal information will not be further processed in a manner that is incompatible with the purposes we have identified;
  * be collected in a way that is adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purpose for which the personal information is processed;
  * be kept up to date, where it is possible and within our control to do so (please let us know if you would like us to correct any of your personal information);
  * be kept in a form which permits us to identify you, but only for so long as necessary for the purposes for which the personal data was collected;
  * be processed securely and in a way that protects against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage.



We also apply these principles to the way we collect, store and use the personal information of our Australian customers or clients. Specifically, we have the following measures in place, in accordance with the GDPR:

  *  **Data protection policies:** We have internal policies in place which set out where and how we collect personal information, how it is stored and where it goes after we get it, in order to protect your personal information.
  *  **Right to ask us to erase your personal information:** You may ask us to erase personal information we hold about you.
  *  **Right to ask us to restrict data processing:** You may ask us to limit the processing of your personal information where you believe that the personal information we hold about you is wrong (to give us enough time to verify if the information needs to be changed), or where processing data is unlawful and you request us to restrict the processing of personal information rather than it being erased.
  *  **Notification of data breaches:** We will comply with the GDPR in respect of any data breach.



### Our responsibilities as a 'processor' under the GDPR

Where we are a processor, we have contracts containing certain prescribed terms in our contracts with controllers. Depending on circumstances, we can be a controller or processor or controller and processor. In addition to:

  * our contractual obligations with controllers (where we are solely a processor); and
  * our legal obligations under the GDPR as a controller (where we are both a controller and processor) as a processor we also have the following responsibilities under the GDPR:
    * not to use a sub-processor without the prior written authorisation of the data controller;
    * to co-operate with supervisory authorities;
    * to ensure the security of its processing;
    * to keep records of processing activities;
    * to notify any personal data breaches to the data controller; and
    * to employ a data protection officer and appoint (in writing) a representative within the European Union if required by the GDPR. (These are not required for the company at the present time).
