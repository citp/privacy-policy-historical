  <h2>Legal Basis for Processing Personal Data Under General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</h2>
  <p>
    If you are from the European Economic Area (EEA), VisualSVN Software Ltd's
    legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described in
    this Privacy Policy depends on the Personal Data we collect and the
    specific context in which we collect it.
  </p>
  <p>

  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>We need to perform a contract with you</li>
    <li>You have given us permission to do so</li>

      by your rights</li>
    <li>For payment processing purposes</li>
    <li>To comply with the law</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Retention of Data</h2>
  <p>
    VisualSVN Software Ltd will retain your Personal Data only for as long as
    is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. We will
    retain and use your Personal Data to the extent necessary to comply with
    our legal obligations (for example, if we are required to retain your data
    to comply with applicable laws), resolve disputes, and enforce our legal
    agreements and policies.
  </p>
  <p>
    VisualSVN Software Ltd will also retain Usage Data for internal analysis
    purposes. Usage Data is generally retained for a shorter period of time,
    except when this data is used to strengthen the security or to improve the
    functionality of our Service, or we are legally obligated to retain this
    data for longer time periods.
  </p>

  <h2>Transfer Of Data</h2>
  <p>
    Your information, including Personal Data, may be transferred to —
    and maintained on — computers located outside of your state,
    province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the data
    protection laws may differ than those from your jurisdiction.
  </p>

  <h3>Disclosure for Law Enforcement</h3>
  <p>
    Under certain circumstances, VisualSVN Software Ltd may be required to

    agency).
  </p>

    your Personal Data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
