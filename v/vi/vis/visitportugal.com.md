# Visit Portugal

This is a non-profit website, and there is no commercial or other interest in the selection of the contents shown. The contents of this website are formulated on the basis of editorial and marketing criteria with the sole purpose of facilitating the choice of Portugal as a tourist destination.

This website fully respects its users’ right to privacy, which is why, on principle, it neither collects nor uses navigation information related to the identification of its visitors.

It is important, however, to make it clear that the website does collect and use the following information: 

\- The user’s country of origin, profile and interests, in order to improve the match between the user’s aims and interests and the information that is displayed. In this way every new search on the website will bring up information pages that are most relevant to the user’s interests.

\- Information searches that can later be organised by the user to create a plan for their holiday. These are saved between visits to the website (for users with ‘cookies’ or with a ‘login’), so that we can provide a support service for planning a trip to Portugal by the visitor and/or a group.

\- Visitor identification, irrespective of the computer used, through the creation of a ‘login’ consisting of an e-mail address and password. (The e-mail address provided by the user will then be used to send newsletters containing tourist information about Portugal).

This website also produces a database of purely statistical information, (without any personal identification), that contains its visitors’ profiles, interests and countries of origin. This information is used to improve the website’s response to its visitors’ interests and requests, and is made available to the official bodies in the tourism sector in Portugal for the same purpose. 

Individual information, even when unidentified, about users is only shared with third parties who act on behalf, and in the name, of the Turismo de Portugal, ip (Portugal National Tourism Organisation), subject to confidentiality agreements.

 **Cookies  
** This website uses ‘cookies’, which are small text files saved on the user’s computer. These enable the Turismo de Portugal, ip, to identify the computers that access the website, and what contents are of interest to their users. 

The Turismo de Portugal, ip uses the information to avoid repeating unwanted content in subsequent user searches, and to show other content to the user that the Turismo de Portugal, ip  considers to be more interesting on the basis of the user’s profile. 

The ‘cookie’ does not save any information that identifies the user. 

Although the Turismo de Portugal, ip does not pass on any information, albeit unidentified, to third parties, this website does save statistical information collected about the preferences of its visitors, which it may pass on to official bodies in the tourism sector. With regard to this, see ‘PRIVACY'.

‘Cookies’ enable this website to recognise the user of a computer on a subsequent visit, with the new visit operating as a continuation of the previous one.

If the user registers and uses the ‘login’ for self-identification, the website will recover the information that it already has about the user, even if it has been collected on another computer.

Users may view the information collected about them on the ‘visitor profile’ page, and may correct the estimated profile and/or delete the interests collected. If the user chooses to delete their interests, the website will automatically restart a new compilation of interests. This functionality is relevant if the user has already made a visit to Portugal and now wishes to plan another.

Users not identified by a ‘login’ will have their profiles and interests automatically deleted if they do not return to the website within three months from the date of the last visit.

The use of ‘cookies’ may be disabled on your computer. On some operating systems and/or browsers they may be disabled for only certain sites. Consult your computer manual to change your settings to allow ‘cookies’ from this website.

If you disable the use of ‘cookies’, this website will treat you as a new user whenever you access it, and will not save any information regarding your visits. At the same time there will be functionalities that will not be operational, such as ‘planning your visit to Portugal’ or ‘creating an album’.
