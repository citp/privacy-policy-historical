# Microsoft Visual Studio Product Family Privacy Statement

Last updated: April 2015

At Microsoft, we're working hard to protect your privacy, while delivering software and services that bring you the performance, power and convenience you desire. This privacy statement explains the data collection and use practices of Microsoft Visual Studio software products and services (together, "Visual Studio"). It doesn’t apply to other online or offline Microsoft sites, products, or services that have their own privacy statements.

Visual Studio may enable you to purchase, subscribe or use other products and services from Microsoft or third parties with different privacy practices. Your use of other products and services is governed by their privacy statements and policies.

## Collection and Use of Personal Data

Microsoft collects data to operate effectively and provide you with the best products, services and experiences we can. Some of this information you provide directly to us, such as when you register for a service like Visual Studio Online. Some of it we get by recording how you interact with our products and services. We collect this data in a variety of ways, including from web forms and software running on your device. We also obtain data from other sources and combine with data we collect directly. The data we collect includes the following:

**Name and contact data**. This includes your first and last name and email address.

**Credentials**. When you create a Microsoft account or a Visual Studio Online account, for example, you will need to provide a password, password hints, or similar security information used for authentication and account access.

**Usage data**. We collect information about how you interact with our products and services. This includes information about how you use the products and services, such as the features you use, the web pages you visit, and the search terms you enter. It includes information about the device you use with the services, including IP address, device identifiers, regional and language settings, and information about the network, operating system, browser or other software you use to connect to the services. And it also includes information about the performance of the product or service and any errors or problems you experience with them. In order to create a richer picture of your product usage, we will correlate usage data across other Microsoft services, like Visual Studio Online.

**Automatically collected data**. We automatically collect limited information about the set-up and installation of Visual Studio, including information about the version and license status of Visual Studio, the operating system of the device, the CPU architecture of the operating system, data identifying causes of product crashes and data regarding the success or failure of the installation of the software.

## How We Use Personal Data

Microsoft uses the data we collect to operate, improve and personalize the products and services we offer. We will not use this data for advertising.

**Providing and improving our products and services**. We use data to provide the services we offer. This includes operating the services, maintaining and improving the reliability and security of the services, developing new features, and providing customer support. We also use data to provide you with personalized features that enhance your productivity and tailor your experience based on your activities, like your IDE synchronized settings.

## Reasons We Share Personal Data

We will share your personal data with your consent, including as necessary to complete any transaction or provide any service you have requested or authorized.

We may share or disclose personal data with Microsoft-controlled subsidiaries and affiliates. We also share data with vendors or agents working on our behalf. For example, companies we've hired to provide customer service support or assist in protecting and securing our systems and services may need access to personal data in order to provide those functions. In such cases, these companies must abide by our data privacy requirements and are not allowed to use this personal data for any other purpose. We may also disclose personal data as part of a corporate transaction such as a merger or sale of assets.

Finally, we will access, disclose and preserve personal data, including your private content when we have a good faith belief that doing so is necessary to:

  1. comply with applicable law or respond to valid legal process from competent authorities, including from law enforcement or other government agencies;
  2. protect our customers, for example to prevent spam or attempts to defraud users of the services, or to help prevent the loss of life or serious injury of anyone; 
  3. operate and maintain the security of our services, including to prevent or stop an attack on our computer systems or networks; or
  4. protect the rights or property of Microsoft, including enforcing the terms governing the use of the services – however, if we receive information indicating that someone is using our services to traffic in stolen intellectual or physical property of Microsoft, we will not inspect a customer’s private content ourselves, but we may refer the matter to law enforcement.



Please note that some of our sites and services include links to sites or services of third parties that have privacy practices different from those of Microsoft. If you submit personal information to any of those sites or services, your information is governed by their privacy statements.

## How to Access and Control Your Data

Some Microsoft services give you the ability to view or edit your personal data online. How you can access or control your personal data will depend on which services you have used.

**Visual Studio account:** The connected Integrated Development Environment (IDE) uses your Microsoft Account or other supported identity to connect to your Visual Studio Online profile, including your Visual Studio Online account. The first time you start Visual Studio, you supply your credentials. Based on that authentication, Visual Studio finds and applies your license and synchronizes your settings (such as fonts, language preference, and keyboard settings) across all of your devices. For more information, see [Synchronized Settings in Visual Studio](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn135229\(v=vs.120\).aspx). Learn more about [Microsoft Account](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=267635).

Once you log into Visual Studio Online, you will be automatically connected to Visual Studio Online in the future via an authentication token when you open Visual Studio.

Through the Notification Center, you will be provided with notifications about licensing, updates and subscription status. For additional information about Visual Studio Online, see the [Visual Studio Online Privacy Statement](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=512132).

**Usage Data** : In most versions of Visual Studio, users may opt out of usage data. To update settings please navigate to **Help|Customer Feedback Options|Settings**.

For pre-release and free versions of the software, users cannot opt out of usage data collection.

If you extract and repackage or redistribute tools, like the compiler and build tools, in any manner outside of the Visual Studio installation process we will collect usage data on those tools. After Visual Studio install completes navigate to **Help|Customer Feedback Options|Settings** in order to turn off data collection for versions of Visual Studio that allow you to opt out. You must re-extract, repackage and redistribute the tools to ensure the collection does not happen on these extracted versions as well.

## Connections to the Internet

Visual Studio has several features that utilize connections to the Internet to help you be more productive. For example, Visual Studio connects to RSS feeds, checks for updates, connects you to help online and allows you to view and download extensions, development tools and code samples via connections to the Internet.

During the process of connecting to the Internet for these features, basic information such as your IP address, your version of Visual Studio and any search and filter parameters supplied by you may be transmitted to Microsoft or any third party servers you choose to interact with.

## Security of Your Personal Data

Microsoft is committed to protecting the security of your personal data. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal data from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, we store the data you provide on computer servers with limited access that are located in controlled facilities. Additionally, when we transmit sensitive personal information (such as a password) over the Internet, we protect it through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.

## Where Data is Stored and Processed

Personal data that is collected by or sent to Microsoft may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Microsoft or its affiliates, subsidiaries or service providers maintain facilities. We take steps to ensure that the data we collect under this privacy statement remains subject to the provisions of this statement and the requirements of applicable law wherever it is located.

Microsoft abides by the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of data from the European Economic Area and Switzerland. To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view our certification, please visit <http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/>.

## Our Retention of Personal Data

Microsoft retains personal data for as long as necessary to provide services, fulfill transactions, and operate our business, including to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

## Changes to this Privacy Statement

We will occasionally update this privacy statement to reflect customer feedback and changes in our services. When we post changes to this statement, we will revise the "last updated" date at the top of the statement. If there are material changes to the statement or in how Microsoft will use your personal information, we will notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes before they take effect or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to periodically review this privacy statement to learn how Microsoft is protecting your information.
