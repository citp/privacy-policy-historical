Vision Direct is committed to safeguarding your privacy online. The customer information we collect, such as your prescription information, email address, billing address, shipping address, credit card, and Eye Care Provider is used only to process your order and contact you in relation to your account. If information you provide changes or becomes inaccurate, or you wish us to delete personal information we hold about you, please contact [Service@VisionDirect.com](mailto:Service@VisionDirect.com)

Vision Direct will never sell or rent your email address or other contact information to a third party, unless appropriate in connection with the sale or transfer of all or part of the business. However, we may use your contact information from the registration form to send you promotional material and information. When you register, you are given an opportunity to opt-in to receive this material. If you do not wish to receive such material, please indicate so on the registration form or within your account profile and we will respect your request.

In processing your order, Vision Direct may disclose your personal information to credit card processing companies to bill you for the products and services you select and your Eye Care Provider to attempt to confirm the validity of your prescription. We also contract with a third-party service partner to provide us with data collection and reporting services. As a result of your accessing our site, a small text file known as a "cookie" may be placed on your computer's hard drive to enable your web browser to be identified. Through cookies we may receive information about your browsing and buying activity on our web site. This information is used solely to help us tailor your experience on our site and improve our products and services. The third-party company is contractually prohibited from sharing your information with anyone else.

Your personal information is stored on secure servers located in the United States. Depending on where you reside, your personal information may be processed and stored in a jurisdiction that does not have laws and rules to protect personal data equivalent to those in your jurisdiction. Vision Direct takes reasonable steps to protect your personal information from loss, misuse, or other unauthorized use, and to remove your personal information when no longer required. However, Vision Direct cannot guarantee that loss, misuse, or unauthorized use will never occur (i.e., that someone will not overcome our technical and organizational security measures), and makes no representations or warranties to this effect.

VisionDirect.com may contain links to other sites operated and maintained by separate companies. We are not responsible for the privacy practices, content, or conduct of or on such web sites. Privacy policies on these sites may differ from our policy. You should always read the privacy policy of a linked site before disclosing any personal information.

This privacy policy may be modified in the future. We will inform you of any changes by posting a notice directly to this web page. Material changes in the privacy policy will be brought to your attention when you next sign in. Changes will go into effect on the date posted.
