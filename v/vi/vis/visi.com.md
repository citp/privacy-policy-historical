# VISI Privacy Policy | Customer privacy policy| VISI

**Summary of Our Commitment to Protecting Customer Privacy  ** 

TDS HMS is dedicated to providing superior customer satisfaction and to safeguarding personal information about our clients and employees.   

When we collect Confidential Personal Information about you, we will inform you in clear and conspicuous language of the purpose for which we are collecting and/or using the information, any third-parties to whom we will disclose the information, the choices you have regarding limiting the use and disclosure of your information, and how you may contact TDS HMS to review, correct, or dispute this information.   

We will use your Confidential Personal Information only in ways that are compatible with the purposes for which we collected it from you or which you subsequently authorized, and we will provide you with notice before we use or disclose your information for a purpose other than that for which it was originally collected.  We will take reasonable steps to ensure that all Confidential Personal Information we collect, retain, or use is relevant to its intended use, accurate, complete, and current.   

When we host data for customers, we start with two simple principles: 

  * We use, disclose, and otherwise process personal data only to provide the services requested by our customer.  
  * We maintain robust security to protect it against unauthorized acquisition or use. 



TDS HMS’s obligations with respect to personal data for which TDS HMS is a data processor, such as data that TDS HMS hosts for its customers, are further defined in TDS HMS’s agreements with its customers.  Personal information obtained from our clients is processed in compliance with the terms and conditions set forth in our client contracts and correspondence and our professional standards.  

TDS HMS recognizes that its commercial customers may also be subject to detailed privacy and information security regulations as a financial institution under the Gramm Leach Bliley Act or as a covered entity or business associate under HIPAA.  We can readily accommodate legal requirements to ensure appropriate privacy controls, and we enter into additional agreements, such as Business Associate Agreements, when required by applicable law.  

**Safe Harbor Compliance**  

Business with personal data originating in the European Union should rest assured that TDS HMS complies with the data protection requirements applicable to it.  

TDS HMS complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from the Member States of the European Union and Switzerland. TDS HMS has self-certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement with respect to all personal data transferred from the EU or Switzerland to the US within the scope of its Safe Harbor certification.  To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view TDS HMS’s certification, please visit:  [https://safeharbor.export.gov/list.aspx](https://safeharbor.export.gov/list.aspx)

**Accessing your Confidential Personal Information  ** 

TDS HMS takes reasonable measures to assure that the Confidential Personal Information we use about you is reliable, accurate, complete, and up-to-date. Customers who wish to review and/or edit their Confidential Personal Information may do so by contacting us using the information listed at the end of this statement We will make reasonable good faith efforts to provide you with access to your Confidential Personal Information upon request either to correct or amend this data if it is inaccurate or incomplete or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. 

We may decline to process requests for information that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort. 

TDS HMS provides customers with the ability to authorize individuals ("Authorized User") to make inquiries, limited changes, or both, in order to maintain their account. Customers may specify the type of information and changes that the Authorized User is approved to request. Customers may add or remove an Authorized User from their account at any time. 

We ask customers and their Authorized Users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests. If you or your Authorized User contacts us via phone, you will be asked to provide your name, the account Personal Identification Number ("PIN") (if the account is PIN protected; otherwise you will be asked to provide other information for the purposes of identity verification), and the billing address ZIP code before we are able to assist you. You or your Authorized user will be asked to present a valid photo ID when requesting account information while at a business office. 

**Communication Preferences  ** 

If you do not want TDS HMS to use your Confidential Personal Information to contact you for marketing or solicitation purposes (excluding notices about your existing account), TDS HMS customers may make this request to [privacy@tdshms.com](mailto:privacy@tdshms.com).  When writing to us, please specify which contact methods (phone calls, mail, bill inserts, or email messages) you would prefer that we do not use to communicate to you for the purposes outlined above. Keep in mind that restricting contact methods may make it more difficult for us to keep you informed about new products and services that can be of benefit to you. You can revoke these options at any time by contacting us using one of the methods provided in this Privacy Statement. 

These choices do not apply to the display of online advertising or the receipt of transactional and service communications that are considered part of certain TDS HMS services, which you may receive periodically unless you cancel the service. 

If you request to not be contacted by phone for marketing or sales purposes, please note that the TDS Do Not Call List restricts these types of phone contacts from TDS only, so you may continue to receive calls from other companies. If you would like to add your number to the National Do Not Call List, you may do so by calling 1-888-382-1222 or visiting [www.donotcall.gov](http://www.donotcall.gov/). 

**Controlling Unsolicited Email ("Spam")  ** 

TDS HMS is concerned about controlling unsolicited email or "spam." While TDS HMS and its vendors continue to actively review and implement new technology to help prevent this activity, there is no currently available technology that will totally prevent the sending and receiving of unsolicited email. Using junk email tools and being cautious about the sharing of your email address while online will help reduce the amount of unsolicited email you receive.

TDS HMS takes these and other reasonable technical and organizational security safeguards to protect against such risks as loss or unauthorized access, destruction, use, alteration, modification, or disclosure of Confidential Personal Information.   You should understand that the open nature of the Internet is such that data may flow over networks without security measures and may be accessed and used by people other than those for whom the data is intended. 

We restrict access to Confidential Personal Information to TDS HMS employees, employees of our Affiliates, and authorized Third Parties who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination, if they fail to meet these obligations. 

We will not store Confidential Personal Information beyond what is necessary for business purposes, including for internal service evaluation and quality assurance purposes, except as otherwise required by law.

TDS HMS conducts compliance audits of our relevant privacy practices to verify adherence to this Privacy Statement. Any employee that TDS HMS determines is in violation of this Statement may be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.   

Our employees, agents, and Affiliates are trained regarding their responsibilities to safeguard your privacy. They are required to adhere to a Code of Business Conduct, this Privacy Statement, and TDS HMS's policies which support our commitment to protecting customer privacy. If employees or Third Parties become aware of practices that raise privacy concerns, they are required to report them to their supervisors or to contact TDS HMS's Incident Response Team.
