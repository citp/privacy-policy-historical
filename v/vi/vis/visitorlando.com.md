# Visit Orlando Privacy Policy | VisitOrlando.com

Effective Date: September 6, 2017  
Last modified: September 6, 2017

 **Note on September 6, 2017 modification** : We have updated Our Privacy Policy, in part, to keep up with new technology offered by third parties to provide more relevant marketing to You. For example, certain third-party social media services are able to provide interest-based advertisements which may provide You with more relevant advertisements on such third-party platforms. This update discloses and explains Our use of such technology while also removing an auto-purge provision that was inadvertently included for international reasons in Our prior policy. As described below, you may always request changes to how we treat your information by contacting us at [privacy@VisitOrlando.com](mailto:privacy@VisitOrlando.com).

### Choices About How We Use and Disclose Your Information

We strive to provide You with choices regarding the personal information You provide to Us. By providing Visit Orlando with Your email address and electing to receive Our newsletter and other marketing You provided Visit Orlando with your consent to receive email communications about new Visit Orlando products and services, third party offers we may send you, or other promotional Visit Orlando communications.

We have created mechanisms to provide You with control over Your information. Additionally, third parties serving You with advertisements may also provide You with control over such ads. For example, by providing Us with Your email address, in accordance with this Privacy Policy, We may provide Your address to certain social media networks for the purpose of matching Your email address with Your social media account. Your email address is not provided to the third party for the third party’s use, rather, it is simply provided for matching and is then discarded. The result is that you may receive a more relevant ad on that third party social media platform. However, if you do not prefer this type of “interest-based” ad, the ad itself may have a mechanism to disable such technology. Additionally:

  * **Tracking Technologies and Advertising.** You can set Your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert You when cookies are being sent. If You disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of this site may then be inaccessible or not function properly.
  * **Promotional Offers from Us.** If You do not wish to have Your information used by Us to promote Our own or third parties’ products or services, You may use the opt-out link found in our promotional emails. 
  * **Targeted Advertising.** If You do not want Us to use information that We collect or that You provide to Us to deliver advertisements according to Our or Our advertisers’ target-audience preferences, You can opt-out by either utilizing the tools provided on the ad itself or via the third-party network’s preferences where you see the ad, such as Instagram and Facebook.
  * We do not control third parties’ collection or use of Your information to serve interest-based advertising. However these third parties may provide You with ways to choose not to have Your information collected or used in this way. You can opt out of receiving targeted ads from members of the Network Advertising Initiative here: <http://optout.networkadvertising.org/>. You may opt out of receiving targeted ads from members of the Digital Advertising Alliance here: <http://optout.aboutads.info/>.



We only want to use Your information in a way that You approve, so in addition to using the tools described above, You may opt-out of certain marketing by sending an email request to [privacy@VisitOrlando.com](mailto:privacy@VisitOrlando.com). In your email, please indicate which mode(s) of communication you would like to opt-out of (i.e. postal mail, email, targeted advertising, or telephone contact). If you are visiting other websites and see an advertisement from Visit Orlando, there may be an opportunity to opt-out of future Visit Orlando ads on that site as managed by the third party provider through its opt-out function.

Please note that Visit Orlando Members who opt-out of promotional Visit Orlando communications will continue to receive non-promotional Visit Orlando communications via email that are otherwise provided as conditions of membership.
