<p>This Privacy Policy sets out the data processing practices, including how and for what purposes we use the information collected about you or that you provide to us or our Clients&nbsp;&nbsp; through the use of/or in connection with the provision of our Sites, Quizzes and Services, or your use of the Internet and any other electronic communications networks.&nbsp; Where our Quizzes appear on third party websites or we are providing our Services on behalf of our Clients (unless otherwise expressly indicated) any personal information collected may be provided to the owner of the website and its use governed by the website's Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy.&nbsp; Please review all third party websites’ Privacy Policies carefully as we are not responsible for the practices of such parties.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have any queries or comments about our use of your information, please get in touch with us by emailing us at <a href="mailto:contact@imagini.net">contact@imagini.net</a> or writing to Customer Support, Imagini Holdings Limited, 7 Moor Street, London W1D 5NB.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information collected</strong></p>
<p>We collect personal information from visitors to the Sites or our Clients’ websites, participants in our Quizzes and users who interact with online adverts or who otherwise visit websites within our network, including:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>&nbsp;Information provided by you:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Name, address and email address.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;Demographic information such as age, gender and country of residence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;Data on your image preferences and information about products and/or pages viewed when you participate in our Quizzes.&nbsp; Although we cannot identify you individually from your image preferences, your responses help us to build up a picture of you, your characteristics, lifestyle or preferences in order to serve you personalised adverts and content.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you contact us, we may also keep a record of that correspondence and/or collect information from such correspondence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;Information collected automatically from your computer:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Information from cookies.&nbsp; A cookie is a small piece of information sent by a web server to a web browser, which enables the server to collect information from the browser. You can find out more about the use of cookies on <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: none;">www.allaboutcookies.org</span></span></a> .&nbsp; Most browsers allow you to turn off cookies or to receive a warning before a cookie is stored on your hard drive. Please refer to your browser instructions or help screen to learn more about how to do this. &nbsp;However, should you decide to disable any cookies we place on your computer you may not be able to use certain services or facilities on the Sites or our Clients’ sites and content and adverts may be less relevant to you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your IP address, which is the unique address of your computer which is automatically provided to other computers when your web browser or email application requests a web page or email from those computers on the Internet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Information about the type of browser you are using (for example Firefox, Internet Explorer or Safari).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Clickstream” data collected from “Web beacons” (also known as “clear gifs”, “action tags” or “Web bugs”), including information about your journey across the Internet and your browsing behaviour around various websites, including interactions with adverts, within our network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On behalf of our Clients</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul><p><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Use of personal information</strong></p>
<p>We process personal information for the purposes of providing our Services for the benefit of and on behalf of our Clients.&nbsp; Our Services involve analysing the above information to create a picture of your lifestyle, interests and browsing and shopping intent as well as tastes and preferences.&nbsp; Although most of the information we collect cannot identify you (unless you choose to provide information such as your name, address or email address) it enables us to create groups of users with similar browsing, interest or behaviour patterns, depending on our Clients’ specifications.&nbsp; We call these groups Audience Groups.&nbsp; The Audience Groups can then be used to provide you with content and adverts that are more relevant to your lifestyle and interests.&nbsp; We also use cookie and Clickstream data collected from various websites that are part of our network to provide targeted advertising services and to profile users across our network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The information may also be used for analytical and strategic development purposes, to measure the effectiveness of content and adverts and to provide you with a more personalised service on both our Site and our Clients’ websites.</p>
<p>Where our Clients are using your information for the above purposes, we encourage them to make you aware of this in their privacy policies and to explain how you can opt-out of such practices.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>For our own purposes</p>
</li>
</ul><p>&nbsp;Our Sites are generally intended for use by our Clients and other businesses looking to use our Services.&nbsp; We will therefore use your personal information to provide and improve our Services, respond to your enquiries and requests, administer orders and accounts and to provide you with information about our Services.&nbsp; You may opt-out of receiving mailings by emailing <a href="mailto:contact@imagini.net">contact@imagini.net</a>.</p>
<p>We may also use the information collected automatically, such as your IP address and information stored via cookies, to gather statistics about the number of people who visit the Sites and to customise the Sites content, layout and services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sharing information</strong></p>
<p>We will only share your name, contact details and other information which can directly identify you, with our Clients if you have provided your express consent.&nbsp; We may share other information, such as your responses to Quizzes as part of our Services to enable our Clients to design or improve their services and products and for other marketing purposes.</p>
<p>We may also transfer information, such as your IP address and data about your journey around the Internet, your interactions with adverts within our network and other information collected via cookies, Web beacons and other technologies to our Clients, advertising partners and other third parties within our network. This information may be used to provide advertising, promotions and other products and services that may be of particular interest to you. It may also be used to provide you with a tailored choice of content and media products.&nbsp; Our advertising and promotions partners have no access to your name or personal contact information stored by us unless you choose to share it with them. We do not provide your name or personal contact information to an advertising partner when you interact with or view a targeted advertisement.</p>
<p>We may also use third parties to provide services on our behalf, which may involve them processing your information, e.g. to complete partial addresses or to augment the information we hold about you. &nbsp;Such companies may only act on our instructions and will not be able to use your information for their own purposes without your consent.</p>
<p>We may transfer, sell or assign any of the information described in this Policy to third parties as a result of a sale, merger, consolidation, change of control, transfer of assets or re-organisation of Imagini Holdings Limited or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates.&nbsp; However, except as described above or unless we are required to do so by law or to enforce our terms and conditions of use, or to protect the rights, property or safety of our customers or others we will not disclose, sell or distribute your information to any third party without your permission.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I view, change or remove my information?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely, we believe that you should be in control of your data and should be able to see, amend or delete it at any time. To do this simply visit <a href="http://my.visualdna.com">http://my.visualdna.com</a> where you'll be able to see any quiz data, edit your interests, intent and demographic information or delete (opt out) your entire profile.</p>
<p>You also may at any time request access to all personal information we hold on you, by writing to Customer Support, Imagini Holdings Limited at 7 Moor Street, London W1D 5NB. We will provide this information within 40 days of a written request for a small administrative charge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Safeguards, security and storage</strong></p>
<p>Although we do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of the data transmitted to the Site; any transmission is at your own risk. Given that the Internet is a global environment, using the Internet to collect and process personal data necessarily involves the transmission of data on an international basis. Therefore, by browsing the Sites, participating in Quizzes and communicating electronically with us, you acknowledge our processing of personal data in this way. However, we will endeavour to protect all personal information collected through this website in accordance with strict data protection standards.</p>
<p>All of the information we collect or record is restricted to our offices or designated sites. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information. We will explicitly ask you when we need information to identify you. We may require you to co-operate with our security checks before we disclose information to you.</p>
<p>We will retain your information for a reasonable period or for as long as is required by law.</p>
<p>Where applicable, we comply with the Internet Advertising Bureau's (IAB) <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com/good-practice-principles" target="_blank">Good Practice Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other websites</strong></p>
<p>This Policy applies only to the Sites and not to other websites to which we provide links or other websites which use our Services. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and practises of any other website, even if you access them using links from our Sites or if you can access our Sites, Quizzes or Services from them. You are therefore advised to read the privacy policy of such other websites.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Changes to Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>We may change this Policy at our discretion by publishing the changes on the Sites and other pages where this Policy applies. We will indicate at the top of the page the date the Policy was last revised. &nbsp;It is your responsibility to regularly check the Sites to see if there have been any changes to this Policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
