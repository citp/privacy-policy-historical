Thank you for visiting Maryland State Government. We take data security and the privacy of your personal and non-personal information very seriously. Maryland law mandates that state agencies shall not create personal records unless the need for the information is clearly established and that personal records shall be relevant to the purposes, for which they are collected, be accurate and current, and not be obtained by fraudulent means.   State officials who request personal data from citizens must notify the citizens regarding the purposes for which the information is collected; consequences to the citizen for refusing to provide the personal information; the citizen's right to inspect and correct personal records; whether the information is generally available for public inspection; and whether the information is made available to other entities. Please refer to the eMaryland technology web site for additional information on information technology policies in Maryland.   The State of Maryland is committed to providing you with Web sites over which you may securely and confidently transact business with the state. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact us . The Office of Tourism Development is committed to maintaining your confidence and trust, and accordingly maintains the following privacy policy to protect personal information provided online.  

**Basic Confidentiality Policy**  
It is OTD policy that personal information, such as your name, postal and e-mail address or telephone number, is private and confidential. Accordingly, the personal information you provide is stored in a secure location, is accessible only by designated staff, and is used only for the purposes for which you provide the information.

Our computer is not set up to track, collect or distribute personal information about its visitors. It does recognize the home server of visitors, but not e-mail addresses. This information is used only for internal purposes by OTD technical support staff. No personal information is collected. In addition, our web sites track information about the visits to our Web sites.   For example, we compile statistics that show the daily number of visitors to our sites, the daily requests we receive for particular files on our web sites, and what countries those requests come from. These aggregated statistics are used internally to better provide services to the public and may also be provided to others, but again, the statistics contain no personal information and cannot be used to gather such information.
