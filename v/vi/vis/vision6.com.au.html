offline or online, including through this website and mobile application (<strong>Site</strong>).In this Privacy Policy <strong>we</strong>, <strong>us</strong> or <strong>our</strong> means Vision 6 Pty Ltd ABN 23 099 766 499. When we collect, store and use your personal information,
we do so in accordance with the rules set down in the Australian <em>Privacy Act 1988</em> (Privacy Act) and by the European Union General Data Protection
Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (the <strong>GDPR</strong>).<h3>Personal information</h3> <strong>Personal information</strong>: The types of personal information or personal data we may collect about you include:<ul class="completely-normal"><li>your name</li><li>your contact details, including email address, mailing address, street address and/or telephone number;</li><li>your age and/or date of birth;</li><li>your credit card details;</li><li>your demographic information, such as postcode;</li><li>your preferences and/or opinions;</li><li>information you provide to us through customer surveys;</li><li>details of products and services we have provided to you and/or that you have enquired about, and our response to you;</li><li>your browser session and geo-location data, device and network information, statistics on page views and sessions, acquisition sources, search

of browser you are using, the type of operating system you are using and the domain name of your Internet service provider;</li><li>additional personal information that you provide to us, directly or indirectly, through your use of our Site, associated applications, associated
social media platforms and/or accounts from which you permit us to collect information; and</li><li>any other personal information requested by us and/or provided by you or a third party.</li></ul> We may collect these types of personal information directly from you or from third parties.<h3>Collection and use of personal information</h3> We may collect, hold, use and disclose personal information for the following purposes:<ul class="completely-normal"><li>to enable you to access and use our Site, associated applications and associated social media platforms;</li><li>to contact and communicate with you;</li><li>for internal record keeping and administrative purposes;</li><li>for analytics, market research and business development, including to operate and improve our Site, associated applications and associated social
media platforms;</li><li>to run competitions and/or offer additional benefits to you;</li><li>for advertising and marketing, including to send you promotional information about our products and services and information about third parties that
we consider may be of interest to you;</li><li>to comply with our legal obligations and resolve any disputes that we may have; and</li><li>to consider your employment application.</li></ul><h3>Disclosure of personal information to third parties</h3> We may disclose personal information to:<ul class="completely-normal"><li>third party service providers for the purpose of enabling them to provide their services, including (without limitation) IT service providers, data
storage, web-hosting and server providers, debt collectors, maintenance or problem-solving providers, marketing or advertising providers, professional
advisors and payment systems operators;</li><li>our employees, contractors and/or related entities;</li><li>our existing or potential agents or business partners;</li><li>payment systems operators;</li><li>sponsors or promoters of any competition we run;</li><li>anyone to whom our business or assets (or any part of them) are, or may (in good faith) be, transferred;</li><li>credit reporting agencies, courts, tribunals and regulatory authorities, in the event you fail to pay for goods or services we have provided to you;</li><li>courts, tribunals, regulatory authorities and law enforcement officers, as required by law, in connection with any actual or prospective legal proceedings,
or in order to establish, exercise or defend our legal rights;</li><li>third parties, including agents or sub-contractors, who assist us in providing information, products, services or direct marketing to you. This may include
parties located, or that store data, outside of Australia; and</li><li>third parties to collect and process data, such as Google Analytics or other relevant businesses. This may include parties that store data outside of Australia.</li></ul> Where we disclose your personal information to third parties, including data processors, we will request that the third party handle your personal information in accordance
with this Privacy Policy. The third party will only process your personal information in accordance with written instructions from us and we require that the third party either
complies with the privacy shield principles set out in the GDPR or another mechanism set out by applicable EU &amp; Swiss data protection laws for the transfer and processing of
personal information. When we refer to ‘processing’ in this clause and this Privacy Policy in general, we mean any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal
information, whether or not by automated means, such as collecting, recording, organising, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure
by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available personal information.  Please note that we use the following third parties to process your personal information:<ul class="completely-normal"><li>Google Analytics;</li><li>Amazon;</li><li>Sinch;</li><li>Eventbrite;</li><li>Facebook;</li><li>Microsoft;</li><li>Mixpanel;</li><li>OptinMonster;</li><li>Slack;</li><li>Stripe;</li><li>Userback;</li><li>Xero; and</li><li>Zendesk.</li></ul> By providing us with personal information, you consent to the disclosure of your personal information to third parties who reside outside Australia and, if you are
a European Union (<strong>EU</strong>) citizen, to third parties that reside outside the EU. Where the disclosure of your personal information is solely subject
to Australian privacy laws (and not subject to the GDPR), you acknowledge that we are not required to ensure that those third parties comply with Australian privacy laws.<h3>How we treat personal information that is also sensitive information</h3> Sensitive information is a sub-set of personal information that is given a higher level of protection under the Australian Privacy Principles. <strong>Sensitive information</strong> means information relating to your racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion, trade union or other professional associations or memberships, philosophical beliefs,
sexual orientation, sexual practices or sex life, criminal records, health information or biometric information.  Provided you consent, your sensitive information may only be used and disclosed for purposes relating to the primary purpose for which the sensitive information was collected.  Sensitive information may also be used or disclosed if required or authorised by law.<h3>Our responsibilities as a 'controller' under the GDPR</h3> Controllers are defined by the GDPR as natural or legal persons, a public authority, agency or other body to which personal information or personal data has been disclosed,
whether via a third party or not, and who determines the purposes and means of processing personal information. We are a controller under the GDPR as we collect, use and store
your personal information to enable us to provide you with our goods and/or services.  As a controller, we have certain obligations under the GDPR when collecting, storing and using the personal information of EU citizens. If you are an EU citizen, your personal data will:<ul class="completely-normal"><li>be processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner by us;</li><li>only be collected for the specific purposes we have identified in the ‘collection and use of personal information’ clause above and personal information will not be further
processed in a manner that is incompatible with the purposes we have identified;</li><li>be collected in a way that is adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purpose for which the personal information is processed;</li><li>be kept up to date, where it is possible and within our control to do so (please let us know if you would like us to correct any of your personal information);</li><li>be kept in a form which permits us to identify you, but only for so long as necessary for the purposes for which the personal data was collected;</li><li>be processed securely and in a way that protects against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage.</li></ul> We also apply these principles to the way we collect, store and use the personal information of our Australian customers or clients.  Specifically, we have the following measures in place, in accordance with the GDPR:<ul class="completely-normal"><li><strong>Data protection policies:</strong> We have internal policies in place which set out where and how we collect personal information, how it is stored and where it
goes after we get it, in order to protect your personal information.</li><li><strong>Right to ask us to erase your personal information:</strong> You may ask us to erase personal information we hold about you.</li><li><strong>Right to ask us to restrict data processing:</strong> You may ask us to limit the processing of your personal information where you believe that the personal
information we hold about you is wrong (to give us enough time to verify if the information needs to be changed), or where processing data is unlawful and you request
us to restrict the processing of personal information rather than it being erased.</li><li><strong>Notification of data breaches:</strong> We will comply with the GDPR in respect of any data breach.</li></ul><h3>Our responsibilities as a 'processor' under the GDPR</h3> Where we are a processor, we have contracts containing certain prescribed terms in our contracts with controllers. Depending on circumstances, we can be a controller or processor
or controller and processor. In addition to:<ul class="completely-normal"><li>our contractual obligations with controllers (where we are solely a processor); and</li><li>our legal obligations under the GDPR as a controller (where we are both a controller and processor) as a processor we also have the following responsibilities under the GDPR:<ul class="completely-normal"><li>not to use a sub-processor without the prior written authorisation of the data controller;</li><li>to co-operate with supervisory authorities;</li><li>to ensure the security of its processing;</li><li>to keep records of processing activities;</li><li>to notify any personal data breaches to the data controller; and</li><li>to employ a data protection officer and appoint (in writing) a representative within the European Union if required by the GDPR. (These are not required for the company
at the present time).</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Your rights and controlling your personal information</h3> <strong>Choice and consent</strong>: Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By providing personal information to us, you consent to us collecting, holding, using and disclosing your

managerial procedures such as the pseudonymisation and encryption of personal information, to safeguard and secure personal information and protect it from misuse, interference, loss and
unauthorised access, modification and disclosure.  We cannot guarantee the security of any information that is transmitted to or by us over the Internet. The transmission and exchange of information is carried out at your own risk. Although
we take measures to safeguard against unauthorised disclosures of information, we cannot assure you that the personal information we collect will not be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent
with this Privacy Policy.<h3>Cookies and web beacons</h3> We may use cookies on our Site from time to time. Cookies are text files placed in your computer's browser to store your preferences. Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your email address
or other personally identifiable information. However, they do allow third parties, such as Google and Facebook, to cause our advertisements to appear on your social media and online media feeds
as part of our retargeting campaigns. If and when you choose to provide our Site with personal information, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie.  We may use web beacons on our Site from time to time. Web beacons (also known as Clear GIFs) are small pieces of code placed on a web page to monitor the visitor’s behaviour and collect data
about the visitor’s viewing of a web page. For example, web beacons can be used to count the users who visit a web page or to deliver a cookie to the browser of a visitor viewing that page.  We may use Google Analytics to collect and process data. To find out how Google uses data when you use third party websites or applications, please see <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/</a> or any other URL Google may use from time to time.<h3>Links to other websites</h3> Our Site may contain links to other websites. We do not have any control over those websites and we are not responsible for the protection and privacy of any personal information which you provide
whilst visiting those websites.
