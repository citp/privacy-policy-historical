The following policies apply to <a href="www.visiblebody.com">www.visiblebody.com</a> and all other Websites owned and operated by Company.</p>
						<p>1. Collection of Personal Information from Site Visitors<br>For all visitors, Company may automatically collect and/or track the following information: (1) home server domain name; (2) information provided by visitors in online forms (including email) and surveys; and (3) aggregate/user-specific information on how many times certain pages are accessed and what Web pages and application functions visitors use. A cookie may be placed on your machine to enable Company to collect the aggregate/user-specific information listed above. In addition, Company may collect certain statistical information about users' visits, such as how many people visit our site, the users' IP addressees, which pages users visit on our site, from which domains users reach our site, and which browsers they use. We use these statistics about user visits for aggregation purposes only, to help us improve the usefulness of the site.</p>
						<p>2. Use of Personal Data Collected<br>Personal data collected by Company will be used by Company for editorial and feedback purposes, for marketing and promotional purposes, for a statistical analysis of users' behavior, for product development, for content improvement, to inform advertisers as to how many visitors have seen or clicked on their advertisements, and to customize content and layout of Company's site. Data on visitors' home servers is aggregated for internal review and then discarded. Names, postal and e-mail addresses, and phone numbers collected may be added to Company's databases and used for future communications regarding site updates, new products and services, and upcoming events.</p>
						<p>3. Disclosure of Personal Data to Third Parties<br>Company may, at its option, share, rent, sell or otherwise disclose personal data (other than credit card numbers) to third parties whom Company has pre-screened, and who market products and/or services that Company determines, in its sole discretion, might be of interest to visitors of Company's Website.</p>
						<p>We may also share personal information collected as described above with other individuals and organizations who need to have access to such information in connection with our marketing and promotional efforts and who have agreed to maintain the confidentiality of such information. For example, when you sign up for our email newsletter, your email address and other information you provide will be transmitted to our third-party marketing vendor, who will retain that information for sending you our email newsletter.</p>
						<p>Certain purchases by you of Company products may be conducted by an online authorized reseller using its own Website, accessed through Company's Website. In such cases, the personal information you provide to the authorized reseller in connection with the purchase will be subject to the authorized reseller's own privacy policy. The reseller may in turn share with Company personal data about you in connection with these transactions. Company will use this information in compliance with its own Privacy Policy.</p>
						<p>We also reserve the right to release information as required by any governmental or law enforcement agency or under a court order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
						<p>4. Collection of Personal Data from Children<br>Company does not attempt to collect personal information from children under age 13.
