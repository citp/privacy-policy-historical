		<h4><a name="collected"></a>Collected Information</h4>
		<p>The information we collect is gathered from several sources. These include our conferences, product subscription forms/registrations, reader service cards, website message postings, survey information and purchases via telephone, direct mail, email, and other electronic sources. From these sources we may collect postal addresses, e-mail addresses, telephone numbers, and/or demographic information for those individuals that volunteer such information. For each visitor to our websites, our web server automatically recognizes the visitor’s domain name and IP address only, but no other identifiable information unless volunteered. In addition, we collect aggregate information on what web pages visitors access or visit.</p>
		<h4><a name="howweuse"></a>How We Use Collected Information</h4>
		<p>The information we collect is used to improve the content of our web pages, to customize the content and layout of our pages for each individual visitor, and/or to notify visitors about updates to our website. As part of a subscription and/or registration agreement, subscribers and registrants will be contacted by us through mail, e-mail, and/or phone to communicate with them about their subscription and/or registration. They will be contacted for renewal, re-qualification, surveys, updates concerning their account profile and special offers related to their subscription and/or registration. We also use the information to contact them for marketing purposes and share this information with other reputable organizations to allow them to contact our subscribers and registrants. We share both individual contact and demographic information and aggregate statistics about our members with advertisers and reputable third party vendors for marketing and promotional purposes, unless otherwise specified when the information is collected. Certain information — such as your password and credit card number — is never disclosed in any form whatsoever to any outside party.</p>
		<h4><a name="email"></a>E-mail Communications</h4>
		<p>If you have registered for one of our magazines, websites, events, products, or services and you have supplied an e-mail address, you may receive both transactional emails pertaining to your registration/purchase and promotional emails with valuable offers. </p>
		<p>Transactional emails are sent in order to maintain your account with 1105 Media Inc. You can opt-out of receiving these types of e-mails by using the opt-out mechanism located within a received e-mail message or by cancelling you subscription, registration, or purchase. </p>
		<p>Promotional emails are sent to bring you valuable, screened offers. You can opt-out of receiving these types of e-mails by using the opt-out mechanism located within a received e-mail message, by <a href="https://1105.sub-forms.com/ONE6909_1105pref&amp;pk=PP" target="_blank">clicking here</a> to update your email preferences, calling us at the number above, or by writing to us at the address above.</p>
		<p>It will take up to 10 business days to process your e-mail opt-out request. Please note that you may receive additional communications from us or an outside company after submitting your request if your e-mail address was selected from our database just prior to receiving and processing your request.</p>
	<h4><a name="postal"></a>Postal Communications</h4>
		<p>If you volunteer a postal address you may receive periodic mailings to relate information about new products, services, and/or upcoming events. We may also provide this information to other carefully selected outside companies for promotional purposes.

		<h4><a name="cookies"></a>Cookies</h4>
		<p>We use   cookies to store visitors' preferences, record session information (such as   items that visitors add to their shopping carts), record user-specific   information such as what pages users access or visit, ensure that visitors are   not repeatedly sent the same banner ads, customize web page content based on a   visitor's browser type or other information that the visitor sends, and store   users names and passwords.</p>
		<p>We   also use third-party advertising companies to serve ads to visitors on our   websites. These companies may use information (not including visitors' names,   addresses, email addresses, or telephone numbers) about visits to this and other   websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest   to visitors. For more information about this practice and choices about not   having this information used by these companies, <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html">click here</a>.</p>
		<h4><a name="ad"></a>Ad Servers</h4>
		<p>To try and bring you offers that may be of interest to you, we have relationships with other carefully selected companies that we allow to place ads on our web pages. As a result of your visit to our site, ad server companies may collect information such as your domain type, your IP address, and clickstream information. The use of such information is governed by the privacy policy of these other companies.</p>
		<h4><a name="security"></a>Security</h4>
		<p>1105 Media Inc. takes every precaution to protect your information from unauthorized use. When you submit sensitive information via our websites, the information is protected both online and offline.

		<p>From time to time, we may use provided information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our privacy policy. If our information practices change we will immediately post any adjustments to our policy on this website. This will serve as your notification of these changes.
