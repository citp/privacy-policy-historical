Your can turn off our cookies on your computer and this will not affect your use of the Site.We do not use details relating to a particular computer's Internet Protocol address in order to administer the Site or to otherwise track the movement of users through the Site. 

We do, however, record certain information regarding use of the Site on our own internal systems. This information is, however, used solely to enable us to administer the Site, to rectify errors and to hold details of a user who has added to or amended information in a particular archive.

The personally identifiable information that is required to use the Site is owned solely by us. We do not share, sell or rent your information to any other person, company or organisation in any way other than as disclosed in this document or as stated at the point where the information is collected. You should, however, note that if you request a brochure through the Site or VisitWales, in some instances your details may be forwarded to a regional tourism marketing organisation so that they can despatch the brochure to you. [Your details will only be used by that organisation for the purposes of sending the brochure to you.]

  * To contact you if we experience problems in processing a payment. 



From time to time, we may also forward a newsletter to your email address. This would contain information on new features and services in relation to the Site.   
The information may also be made available to companies of tourism related specialist supplies, products and services who are interested in advertising on the Site and who may, from time to time, email you details of specialist services which may be of interest to you. 

We are not in favour of our users being inundated with inappropriate and unsolicited email. We will therefore carefully select the organisations to whom we would provide such data. Further, we will not, in any event, provide such companies with any of your financial information. 

You also have the right to 'opt-out' of your information being used for purposes not directly related to the Site. For further details of this right, please see 'Your Rights in Relation to this Information' below. 

  


## WHAT SECURITY MEASURES DO WE HAVE IN PLACE TO PROTECT THIS INFORMATION? 

To protect your privacy, your financial information is sent to us through a secure server which encrypts it before it is sent to us. We also use our best efforts to protect your information off-line: it is only given to those of our employees who genuinely need to have access to it in order to perform their job.   
Furthermore, our security procedures for storing and disclosing customer details conform with the Data Protection Act 1998 so as to prevent unauthorised access to it. 

The Site may, from time to time, contain links to other web sites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of the owners and operators of these sites. We therefore encourage you to read the privacy statements and policies on each site to which you are asked to submit personal information. 

  


## YOUR RIGHTS IN RELATION TO THIS INFORMATION 

If you wish to change any of your personal information, please use the facilities available on the Site to correct and update it.   
You also have the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having your information used for purposes not directly related to the Site at the point where we ask you for that information. For example, if you wish to register to create or use an archive (e.g. a discussion thread) but do not want to receive future newsletters, promotional emails or marketing material, simply put a cross in the relevant box that appears in our registration form.   
If, after a certain period of time, you decide that you no longer wish to receive newsletters, promotional and marketing emails, you can change your personal profile accordingly. Alternatively, you may decide that you would like to begin to receive newsletters, promotional and marketing emails.   
In order to change your personal profile, please follow the process set out under 'my details' in the top navigation bar. Please note, however, that we cannot backdate any changes that you make. This means that you could continue to receive information from a particular third party where we have already provided your details to that third party. You will therefore have to contact each such third party if you no longer wish to receive newsletters, promotional and marketing emails directly from them. 

  


## POLICY CHANGE 

Please note that we reserve the right to change this policy at any time in the future, with or without notice. Should we decide to change the policy, we will post notification of the changes on 'about this Site' section on the left navigation bar.
