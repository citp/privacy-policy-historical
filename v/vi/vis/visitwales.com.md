ii. when you register on the Site that you are happy for us to send information to you in the future.   
iii. when you enter a competition or prize draw.   


## What data is collected? 

The data we collect may be personal data and may include your name, email address, postal address and postcode.   
We may also ask for your telephone number to enable us to contact you if you have won a prize draw or competition. 

We are required by HM Customs and Excise to store and collect information about the country you live in. 

## Who collects the information? 

The information is collected by us, Welsh Government, Cardiff Bay, Cardiff, CF99 1NA. 

We hold valid notifications under the Data Protection Act 1998. 

The personally identifiable information that is required to use the Site is owned solely by us. We do not share, sell or rent your information to any other person, company or organisation in any way other than as disclosed in this document or as stated at the point where the information is collected. You should, however, note that if you request a brochure through the Site or VisitWales, in some instances your details may be forwarded to a regional tourism marketing organisation so that they can despatch the brochure to you. [Your details will only be used by that organisation for the purposes of sending the brochure to you.] 

## Consent

By disclosing personal information to us you consent to the collection, storage and processing of information in the manner described in this Policy. 

  


## How is the information used and by whom? 

The above information will be used by us for the following purposes only: - 

  * To send you promotional email. 



From time to time, we may send a newsletter to your email address. This would contain information on new features and services in relation to the Site.   
The information may also be made available to companies of tourism related specialist supplies, products and services who are interested in advertising on the Site and who may, from time to time, email you details of specialist services which may be of interest to you. 

We are not in favour of our users being inundated with inappropriate and unsolicited email. We will therefore carefully select the organisations to whom we would provide such data. Further, we will not, in any event, provide such companies with any of your financial information. 

You also have the right to 'opt-out' of your information being used for purposes not directly related to the Site. For further details of this right, please see 'Your Rights in Relation to this Information' below. 

  


## What security measures do we have in place to protect this information? 

To protect your privacy, your financial information is sent to us through a secure server which encrypts it before it is sent to us. We also use our best efforts to protect your information offline: it is only given to those of our employees who genuinely need to have access to it in order to perform their job.   
Furthermore, our security procedures for storing and disclosing customer details conform with the Data Protection Act 1998 so as to prevent unauthorised access to it. 

The Site may, from time to time, contain links to other web sites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of the owners and operators of these sites. We therefore encourage you to read the privacy statements and policies on each site to which you are asked to submit personal information. 

  


## Your rights in relations to this information

If you wish to change any of your personal information, please contact us on the below email address.   
You also have the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having your information used for purposes not directly related to the Site at the point where we ask you for that information. For example, if you wish to enter a competition but do not want to receive future newsletters, promotional emails or marketing material, simply leave the relevant box that appears in our registration form unticked.   
If, after a certain period of time, you decide that you no longer wish to receive newsletters, promotional and marketing emails, you can unsubscribe directly through the email communication or contact us and request removal from the database.   
Please note, however, that we cannot backdate any changes that you make. This means that you could continue to receive information from any third party you have consented to contact you, where we have provided your details to that third party. You will therefore have to contact each such third party if you no longer wish to receive newsletters, promotional and marketing emails directly from them. 

  


## Policy Change

If this privacy policy changes in any way, we will place an updated version on this page. Regularly reviewing this page ensures you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances, if any, we will share it with other parties.
