When you complete a registration form to create a User Account, we require you to provide us with relevant PII.

    * _Cookies._

Like many websites, we employ the use of 'cookies' in certain areas of our Site to allow us to provide information that is targeted to your interests and make your online experience more convenient (for instance, by reducing the number of times you have to re-enter your password). Cookies are small bits of electronic information that a website sends to a visitor's browser and are stored on your hard drive. We may use cookies or similar tools to learn about your preferences and Internet session information, to record information including your likely state of residence, the web pages that you access and for how long, whether you return to the Site, and whether a particular email is opened. We do not receive or record any personal information in the cookies we use and are never tied to anything that could be used to identify you. We may encode our cookies so that only we can interpret the information stored in them. Although most web browsers automatically accept cookies, you may choose to change your browser to block cookies that or to notify you when you are sent a cookie. Most cookies are 'session cookies,' meaning that they are automatically deleted at the end of a session and you are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits.
