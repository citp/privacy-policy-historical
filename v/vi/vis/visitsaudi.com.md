What rights do I have?

You have the right to **ask us for a copy** of your personal data; to **correct** , **delete**  or **restrict**  (stop any active) processing of your personal data; and to **obtain the personal data you provide to us for a contract or with your consent in a structured, machine readable format**. In some cases where you have requested that your personal data is deleted, we may still have to keep this data on our Platform as the removal of such data will impact other data. In such cases, you can request that such data is anonymized.

In addition, you can **object to the processing**  of your personal data in some circumstances in particular, where we don’t have to process the data to meet a contractual or other legal requirement, or where we are using the data for direct marketing. 

These **rights may be limited** , for example if fulfilling your request would reveal personal data about another person, or if you ask us to delete information which we are required by law to keep or where we have compelling legitimate interests in keeping. 

To exercise any of these rights, you can get in touch with us using the details set out below. 

The provision of certain information is mandatory for the provision of certain services: if the relevant data is not provided, then we might not be able to provide you with certain services. All other provision of your information is optional. However, note that failure to provide the optional data means that we will not be able to send you communications about the goods and services that may be of interest to you, nor personalise the way that our content is presented to you. 

**How do I get in touch with you?**

We hope that we can satisfy queries you may have about the way we process your data. If you have any concerns about how we process your data, or would like to opt-out of direct marketing, you can get in touch by emailing us at info@VisitSaudi.com 

**How long will you retain my data?**

In the event that you wish to deactivate your account, a red flag goes on our database and, whilst people cannot use the personal information, it stays on the system for a period of one year for administration purposes before being deleted. We will only keep your content for as long as is reasonably required for the purpose(s) for which it was submitted.

Where we process personal data for marketing purposes or with your consent, we process the data until you ask us to stop and for a reasonable period after this (to allow us to implement your requests). We also keep a record of the fact that you have asked us not to send you direct marketing or to process your data indefinitely so that we can respect your request in future.

In respect of children's data, parents and guardians give us their consent to collect and use the data of minors by providing their details.
