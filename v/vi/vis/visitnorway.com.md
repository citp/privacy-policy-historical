# Privacy and security policy - Official Travel Guide to Norway - visitnorway.com

Visitnorway’s privacy policy sets out the rules we will abide by when dealing with personal information we collect from individuals in the course of our business. We will never allow a third party to use your personal data for marketing and communication purposes.

We have based our privacy policy upon applicable Norwegian consumer and data protection legislation.

Collection, storage and processing of your personal information include the following data and collection methods:

  
(PII) Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is information that identifies you as an individual.

 **Customer reviews**  
Trip Advisor comments and reviews  
Visitnorway may collect and display reviews and comments from what users have published on relevant products on Trip Advisor.  

Your disclaim any proprietary rights you may have in such Customer Reviews, and your review(s) may be freely used, copied, distributed and made available in any medium and in any form by Visitnorway or its affiliates without your permission.  
Visitnorway does not edit Customer Reviews submitted on Tripadvisor and imported to Visitnorway, and to the fullest extent permitted by law will not be in any way responsible or liable for such Reviews or their subsequent posting, use or distribution. 

In addition, Visitnorway does not verify, endorse or approve the views or comments expressed in any Reviews which are the personal views of the individuals submitting them. Any decisions made on the basis of reviews or comments appearing on the service are taken at your own risk.

(or “Non-PII”)Non-Personally Identifiable Information is aggregated information and any other information that does not reveal your specific identity.

 **Statistics gathering and aggregation**  
Visitnorway uses commonly employed Internet technologies to collect additional information about users. For example, Visitnorway and our affiliates use “cookies” to determine how users reach the Visitnorway Web pages and to track general usage patterns once a user is on our Web pages. “Cookies” are small pieces of information that are transferred by a website and stored by your web browser on your computer’s hard drive. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies; however, you can always choose not to accept a cookie by changing your computer preferences to refuse cookies or to prompt you to accept each cookie, but doing so may limit the range of features available on Visitnorway pages. No identifying information is collected by our web analytics software. 

The software records the IP address of the visitor only. Information is collected, aggregated and analyzed in order to improve the function, content, overall appearance, and capability of the Visitnorway reservation service. Visitnorway also collects certain technical information from your computer each time you request a page during your visit to Visitnorway Web pages. This information is collected from your computer’s web browser to enhance your experience on our Web pages and may include your IP address, operating system, web browser software (e.g. Internet Explorer), screen resolution, and referrer website.

 **Protection of children**  
Visitnorway does not knowingly collect any personal information from children.

 **Enforcement of this Privacy Policy**  
We will treat all information we collect from you as strictly confidential. Visitnorway does not rent or lease its customer lists to third parties. We will not reveal, disclose, sell, distribute, rent, license, share or pass onto any third party (other than those who are contracted or supply services to Visitnorway) any personal information that you may have provided to us unless we have your express consent to do so, other than in the circumstances set out in the next paragraph.

Visitnorway may disclose the information that we collect about you when we have reason to believe that it is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against persons or entities who may be causing injury to you, to us, or to others.

We may also disclose your information when we believe the law requires it. We require that all our customers agree to abide by our Privacy policy as part of our terms of trade. Please note that we cannot and do not assume any responsibility for the privacy or security practices of any other web sites which you may be able to access through our site, or for our customers’ level of compliance with our code.

 **Changes to this statement**  
Visitnorway may, in its sole discretion, revise this privacy policy at any time and all such revisions shall be effective when posted. 

Privacy policy changes will apply to the information collected from the date we post the revised Privacy Policy, as well as to existing information held by us. You can determine when this Policy was last revised by referring to the “Last updated” legend at the bottom of this page.
