<p>

</p>
<p>IMPORTANT: BY USING THIS&nbsp;WEB SITE YOU GIVE YOUR CONSENT THAT

	site.&nbsp; The term "personal data" refers to personally identifiable 
	information about you, such as your name, birth date, e-mail address or mailing 
	address.</p>
<p><strong>Notification of Changes to This Policy</strong></p>
<p>Sequentum is continually improving and adding new functionality and 
	features to this web site and improving and adding to its existing products,

<p><strong>Information Gathering and Dissemination Practices</strong></p>
<p>
	Our site's registration forms require customers and prospective customers

	periodically about the products and services for which the customer has signed 
	up, as well as general information about Sequentum. &nbsp;In these mailings, we 
	may include offers from our partners, information about product upgrades and 
	enhancements, as well as marketing promotions from Sequentum.</p>
<p>Anonymous Data Collected Through This Web Site</p>
<p>In addition to the information you provide when you use our web

	of this web site and our e-mail updates, to better understand our customers and 
	markets, and to improve Sequentum products and services.</p>

	address) and the date and time you accessed this web site.&nbsp; Cookies by 
	themselves cannot be used to discover the identity of the user.&nbsp; A cookie

	business of Sequentum, for further processing in accordance with the purposes 
	for which the data was originally collected or for purposes to which you have 
	subsequently consented.&nbsp; In addition, there may be some other, limited 
	circumstances in which Sequentum may share or transfer the information in its 
	databases, for example, to comply with a legal requirement, for the 
	administration of justice, to protect your vital interests, to protect the
