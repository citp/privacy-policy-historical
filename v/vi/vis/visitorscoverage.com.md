# VisitorsCoverage Inc. - Privacy statement and privacy policy

### **INFORMATION WE MAY COLLECT**

Personal data means any information about an individual person from which that person can be identified. It does not include data where the identity has been removed, i.e. anonymous data.

We may collect, use, store and transfer different kinds of personal data about you which we have grouped together as follows:

**Identity Data** includes (for each traveler) first name, maiden name, last name, username or similar identifier, marital status, title, date of birth and gender, age(s) or date(s) of birth, passport number, nationality, and country and/or state of residency.

**Contact Data** includes billing address, delivery address, email address and telephone numbers.

**Financial Data** includes bank account and payment card details.

**Transaction Data** includes details relating to or necessary for the provision of products and services you desire to or have purchased from us, such as coverage limits, dates of travel, trip deposit date (if applicable), destination, trip type (e.g., pleasure, adventure, business), and booking and/or tour operators.

**Technical Data** includes internet protocol (IP) address, browser type and version, time zone setting and location, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system and platform and other technology on the devices you use to access our Site.

**Profile Data** includes purchases or orders made by you, your interests, preferences, feedback and survey responses.

**Usage Data** includes information about how you use our Site and Services.

**Marketing and Communications Data** includes your preferences in receiving marketing from us and our third parties and your communication preferences. This also includes us making a note of conversations we have had with you in person and/or communications you sent to us. This helps us to manage our relationship with you and ensures you only receive communications from us that are relevant and timely.

We also collect, use and share **Aggregated Data** such as statistical or demographic data for any purpose. Aggregated Data may be derived from your personal data but is not considered personal data in law as this data does not directly or indirectly reveal your identity. For example, we may aggregate your Usage Data to calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific website feature. However, if we combine or connect Aggregated Data with your personal data so that it can directly or indirectly identify you, we treat the combined data as personal data which will be used in accordance with this privacy policy.

Where we need to collect personal data by law, or under the terms of a contract we have with you and you fail to provide that information when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have or are trying to enter into with you (for example, to provide you with an insurance quote or policy). In this case, we may have to cancel a product or service you have with us but we will notify you if this is the case at the time.

### HOW WE COLLECT YOUR DATA

We collect different information about you in a number of ways:

**Information you give us**

When you obtain a policy quote or buy a policy, sign up for our marketing communications, contact us to ask a question or give us feedback, we will store the personal data you give to us such as your name, email address, postal address, telephone number, and other details. We will also keep a record of our communications with you (including information like your survey responses).

**Automated technologies or interactions**

As you interact with our Site, we may automatically collect Technical Data about your equipment, browsing actions and patterns. We collect this personal data by using cookies and other similar technologies.

**Information from third parties**

We may receive information about you from third parties as set out below:

  * Analytics providers such as Google
  * Advertising networks such as Facebook or Quora
  * Search information advertising providers such as Google AdWords



### HOW WE MAY USE YOUR INFORMATION

We will only use your personal data when the law allows us to. Most commonly, we will use your personal data in the following circumstances:

  * Where we need to perform the contract we are about to enter into or have entered into with you (i.e., when we help you purchase an insurance policy).
  * Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests.
  * Where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.
  * Where we have your explicit consent before using your personal data in that specific situation. However, generally we do not rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your personal data and you have the right to withdraw consent to marketing at any time by contacting us (or by using any other mechanism we provide, such as an unsubscribe link in an email). You will find the relevant contact details at the end of this policy.



**Purposes for which we will use your personal information**

We have set out below, in a table format, a description of all the ways we plan to use your personal information, and which of the legal bases we rely on to do so. We have also identified what our legitimate interests are where appropriate.

Please note that we may process your personal information for more than one lawful ground depending on the specific purpose for which we are using your information. Please contact us if you need details about the specific legal ground we are relying on to process your personal data where more than one ground has been set out in the table below.

Finally, while the table below describes our practices, we do not use any personal data (in any of the categories we have identified) relating to individuals in the European Economic Area for any marketing communications or advertising unless such individuals have opted in to receive marketing communications or advertising from us.
