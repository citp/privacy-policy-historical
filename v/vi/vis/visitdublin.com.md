This policy (together with our Terms & Conditions and any other documents referred to in such terms and conditions) sets out the basis on which any personal data we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be processed by us, and applies to all of your personal data irrespective of the medium or method by which we obtained/received your personal data.

In this policy, the term “personal data” means data relating to a living individual who is or can be identified either from the data, or from the data in conjunction with other information, that is in, or is likely to come into, our possession, and includes personal data as described in data protection legislation (as defined below).

Please read the following carefully. Entering into this website and providing your consent to our use of your personal data in accordance with the terms of this policy indicates that the user (either "user" or "you") has reviewed this policy and has agreed to be bound by it as well as our Terms of Use. You will be required to expressly accept and consent to this policy before we process your personal data. If you do not agree to these terms you must leave the website immediately. We will keep a record of your consent in this regard. If you no longer consent to our processing of your personal data, you may request that we cease such processing by contacting us via the ‘How to contact us’ facility referred to below.

##  2\. What information do we collect?

We fully respect your right to privacy in relation to your interactions with the website, and we endeavour to guarantee to be transparent in our dealings with you as to what information we will collect and how we will use your information. Also, we only collect and use individual user details where we are legally entitled to do so. Information in relation to personal data collected by Irish entities is available on [www.dataprotection.ie](http://www.dataprotection.ie/), the website of the Irish Data Protection Commissioner (“DPC”).

  We will handle your personal data in accordance with data protection legislation. “Data protection legislation” means the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003 and Directive 95/46/EC, and any other applicable law or regulation relating to the processing of personal data and to privacy (including the E-Privacy Directive), as such legislation shall be amended, revised or replaced from time to time, including by operation of the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (“GDPR”) (and laws implementing or supplementing the GDPR).

  We only collect and use individual user details where we are legally entitled and/or required to do so under the Tourist Traffic Acts 1939 to 2016 and data protection legislation. Where you have provided your consent to our collection and use of your personal data, you are entitled to withdraw such consent by notice to us.

  * **Clicking on a link in any of these emails**  may cause you to be personally identified on our site and may cause some part of your past browsing history on our site to be available to our personnel so we may more effectively engage with you and improve our site. If you do not wish for this tracking to occur, you can unsubscribe from our mailings or use private browsing mode to avoid tracking.

  * **If you fill out a web form on any of Fáilte Ireland websites**  for either leisure tourism or business tourism (MICE) reasons, your information will be stored in our CRM system and some amount of your past browsing on our site may be available to us to determine your interests.

  * To public bodies with a related remit in relation to the promotion of the island of Ireland as a tourist destination (such as Tourism Ireland and Tourism Northern Ireland) and subsidiaries for the purposes described in this privacy policy.

##    
7.  Security - How we protect your personal information

The Fáilte Ireland services are designed to provide reasonable and appropriate organizational, technical, and administrative measures to protect personal information within our organization against unauthorized or unlawful access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. Users of Fáilte Ireland services must also do their part in protecting the data, systems, networks, and service they are utilizing. Unfortunately, no data transmission or storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that your password to any Fáilte Ireland account has been compromised), please immediately notify us by contacting us in accordance with the “Contact Us” section below.

For your protection, we will only implement requests with respect to personal information about you (not anyone else), and we may need to verify your identity before implementing your request. We will comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable and in accordance with applicable law. We may need to retain certain information for recordkeeping purposes, as required under applicable legal obligations, and/or to complete any transactions that you began prior to requesting such change or deletion (e.g. when you make a purchase or enter a promotion, you may not be able to change or delete the personal information provided until after the completion of such purchase or promotion). Some of your information may remain within our systems and other records, in compliance with applicable law.

##  8\. How long do we keep your data for?

To meet our legal and regulatory obligations, any information that you provide to us will be kept and stored for such period of time as we deem necessary taking into account the purpose for which it was collected in the first instance, and our obligations under data protection legislation.

In general, your personal data will be retained by us for two years and six months from the last date of contact or transaction.

##    
9\. What rights do you have?

As a data subject, you have the following rights under data protection legislation:

  * the right of access to personal data relating to you.

  * the right to correct any mistakes in your personal data.

  * the right to ask us to stop contacting you with direct marketing.

  * rights in relation to automated decision taking.

  * the right to restrict or prevent your personal data being processed.

  * the right to have your personal data ported to another data controller.

  * the right to erasure.

  * the right to complain to the Data Protection Commissioner if you believe we have not handled your personal data in accordance with the data protection legislation. 




These rights are explained in more detail below, but if you have any comments, concerns or complaints about our use of your personal data, please contact us (see ‘How to contact us’ below).

We will respond to any rights that you exercise within a month of receiving your request, unless the request is particularly complex or cumbersome, in which case we will respond within three months (we will inform you within the first month if it will take longer than one month for us to respond).

Where a response is required from us within a particular time period pursuant to data protection legislation, we will respond within that time period.

###  **Right to access to personal data relating to you**

You may ask to see what personal data we hold about you and be provided with:

  * a summary of such personal data and the categories of personal data held.

  * details of the purpose for which it is being or is to be processed.

  * details of the recipients or classes of recipients to whom it is or may be disclosed, including if they are overseas and what protections are used for those oversea transfers.

  * details of the period for which it is held (or the criteria we use to determine how long it is held).

  * details of your rights, including the rights to rectification, erasure, restriction or objection to the processing.

  * any information available about the source of that data.

  * whether we carry out automated decision-making, or profiling, and where we do, information about the logic involved and the envisaged outcome or consequences of that decision making or profiling.

  * where your personal data are transferred out of the EEA, what safeguards are in place.




Requests for your personal data must be made to us (see 'How to contact us' below) specifying what personal data you need access to, and a copy will be retained on your personal file. To help us find the information easily, please give us as much information as possible about the type of information you would like to see.

If, to comply with your request, we would have to disclose information relating to or identifying another person, we may need to obtain the consent of that person, if possible. If we cannot obtain consent, we may need to withhold that information or edit the data to remove the identity of that person, if possible.

There are certain types of data which we are not obliged to disclose to you, which include personal data which records our intentions in relation to any negotiations with you where disclosure would be likely to prejudice those negotiations.

We are entitled to refuse a data access request from you where (i) such request is manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because of its repetitive character (in this case, if we decide to provide you with the personal data requested, we may charge you a reasonable fee to account for administrative costs of doing so), or (ii) we are entitled to do so pursuant to data protection legislation.

###  **Right to update your personal data or correct any mistakes in your personal data**

You can require us to correct any mistakes in your personal data, which we hold free of charge. If you would like to do this, please:

  * email, call or write to us (see ‘How can you contact us’ below).

  * let us have enough information to identify you (e.g. name, registration details).

  * let us know the information that is incorrect and what it should be replaced with.




If we are required to update your personal data, we will inform recipients to whom that personal data have been disclosed (if any), unless this proves impossible or has a disproportionate effort.

It is your responsibility that all of the personal data provided to us is accurate and complete. If any information you have given us changes, please let us know as soon as possible (see ‘How to contact us’ below).

###  **Right to ask us to stop contacting you with direct marketing**

You can ask us to stop contacting you for direct marketing purposes. If you would like to do this, please:

  * email, call or write to us (see ‘How can you contact us’ below). You can also click on the ‘unsubscribe’ button at the bottom of the email newsletter. It may take up to five days for this to take place.

  * let us know what method of contact you are not happy with if you are unhappy with certain ways of contacting you only (for example, you may be happy for us to contact you by email but not by telephone).




We will provide you with information on action taken on a request to stop direct marketing – this may be in the form of a response email confirming that you have ‘unsubscribed’.

###  **Rights in relation to automated decision taking (if applicable)**

You may ask us to ensure that, if we are evaluating you, we don’t base any decisions solely on an automated process and have any decision reviewed by a member of staff.

Profiling may occur in relation to your personal data for the purposes of targeted advertising and de-targeting you from specified advertising. This allows us to tailor our advertising to the appropriate customers and helps to minimise the risk of you receiving unwanted advertising.

These rights will not apply in all circumstances, for example, where the decision is (i) authorised or required by law, (ii) necessary for the performance of a contract between you and us, or (iii) is based on your explicit consent. In all cases, we will endeavour that steps have been taken to safeguard your interests.

###  **Right to restrict or prevent processing of personal data**

In accordance with data processing legislation, you may request that we stop processing your personal data temporarily if:

  * you do not think that your data is accurate (but we will start processing again once we have checked and confirmed that it is accurate).

  * the processing is unlawful but you do not want us to erase your data.

  * we no longer need the personal data for our processing, but you need the data to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.

  * you have objected to processing because you believe that your interests should override the basis upon which we process your personal data. 




If you exercise your right to restrict us from processing your personal data, we will continue to process the data if:

  * you consent to such processing.

  * the processing is necessary for the exercise or defence of legal claims.

  * the processing is necessary for the protection of the rights of other individuals or legal persons.

  * the processing is necessary for public interest reasons.




###  **Right to data portability           **

In accordance with data protection legislation, you may ask for an electronic copy of your personal data that you have provided to us and which we hold electronically, or for us to provide this directly to another party. This right only applies to personal data that you have provided to us – it does not extend to data generated by us.

The right to data portability also only applies where:

  * the processing is based on your consent or for the performance of a contract

  * the processing is carried out by automated means

**Right to erasure**

In accordance with data protection legislation, you can ask us to erase your personal data where:



  * you do not believe that we need your personal data in order to process it for the purposes set out in this policy.

  * if you had given us consent to process your personal data, you withdraw that consent and we cannot otherwise legally process your personal data.

  * you object to our processing and we do not have any legal basis for continuing to process your personal data.

  * your data has been processed unlawfully or have not been erased when it should have been.

  * the personal data have to be erased to comply with law.




We may continue to process your personal data in certain circumstances in accordance with data protection legislation.

Where you have requested the erasure of your personal data, we will inform recipients to whom that personal data have been disclosed, unless this proves impossible or involves disproportionate effort. We will also inform you about those recipients if you request it.

###  **Right to complain to the Data Protection Commissioner (DPC)**

If you do not think that we have processed your personal data in accordance with this policy, please contact us in the first instance. If you are not satisfied, you can complain to the DPC or exercise any of your other rights pursuant to data protection legislation. Information about how to do this is available on the DPC website at [www.dataprotection.ie](http://www.dataprotection.ie/).

###  **Offensive content**

If you post or send content which may reasonably be deemed to be offensive, inappropriate or objectionable anywhere on the website or otherwise engage in any disruptive behaviour on any Fáilte Ireland service, we may remove such content.

Where we reasonably believe that you are or may be in breach of any applicable laws, for example on hate speech, we may disclose your personal information to relevant third parties, including to law enforcement agencies or your internet provider. We would only do so in circumstances where such disclosure is permitted under applicable laws, including data protection legislation.

  


##  10\. Updates to this privacy policy

If any change may materially and negatively affect the privacy of your personal information, we will use reasonable efforts to notify you in advance and give you a reasonable period of time to object to any changes.
