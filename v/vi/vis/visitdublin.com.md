We analyse this data for trend and statistics reasons, such as which parts of our Website users are visiting and how long they spend there.

We collate information on all our Website traffic that is represented in aggregate format through cookies. We use third parties such as Google Analytics to collect user information, including through the use of cookies (flash and non-flash) and web beacons.  They help us to improve our Website and to deliver many of the functions that make your browser experience more user friendly.   You can find a list of cookies we use and the purposes for which we use them in the tables below.

This cookie is typically written to the browser upon the first visit to the Website from that web browser. If the cookie has been deleted by the browser operator, and the browser subsequently visits the Website, a new __utma cookie is written with a different unique ID.

__utmb

This cookie is used to establish and continue a user session with the Website. When a user views a page on the Website, the Google Analytics code attempts to update this cookie. If it does not find the cookie, a new one is written and a new session is established. Each time a user visits a different page on the Website, this cookie is updated to expire in 30 minutes, thus continuing a single session for as long as user activity continues within 30-minute intervals. This cookie expires when a user pauses on a page on your site for longer than 30 minutes. You can modify the default length of a user session with the [_setSessionCookieTimeout()](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/gajs/methods/gaJSApiBasicConfiguration#_gat.GA_Tracker_._setSessionCookieTimeout) method.
