**Crash Media Group - Privacy Policy**

Crash Media is a company that is registered in the UK with Company Number 3729433 and with a registered address at Crash Media Group, 78-80 St John's Street, London, EC1M 4EH. 

**Our Data Promise to you**

Crash Media Group is absolutely committed to respecting and protecting your data whilst it is in our care. We collect your personal information because it helps us to understand your needs and guides the way in which we interact and communicate with you about our products and services now and in the future. We have strict policies and procedures in place to protect your data when you send it to us, when we process it in order to provide you with the services you have requested or, where you have given us your permission to do so, to send you information that we think you'll find interesting, and thereafter when we store your data on our secure servers. 

We are notified with the Information Commissioner's Office, the regulator of the Data Protection Act 1998 and abide by its requirements. 

**What personal data do we collect?**

Crash Media Group collects both Personal Data and Anonymous Data when you send us information or when you visit one of our websites. When we talk about Personal Data we mean any information that can identify you as an individual, such as your name and postal address. Anonymous Data doesn't identify you as a person but it might be used in aggregate, for instance when you participate in a survey. 

**How do we keep it secure?**

Our servers are protected using HTTP and SSL technology (where indicated), so whilst your data is in our care we know it's as secure as it can be. We are taking all reasonable steps to meet our obligations and responsibilities under the Data Protection Act 1998 and other privacy legislation, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). 

When we ask another organisation to provide a service for us, we ensure that they have appropriate security measures in place. If we or our service providers transfer any information out of the European Economic Area (EEA), it will only be transferred with the correct protection in place, as stated in UK law. 

The internet is not a totally secure medium and you acknowledge and agree that Crash Media Group shall not be responsible for unauthorised use, distribution, damage or destruction of personal data, except to the extent that we are required to accept such responsibility under the Data Protection Act 1998. 

**How do we collect and use your Personal Data?**

We collect your details when you register on one of our websites; subscribe to our services; subscribe to receive emails from us and our partners; participate in discussion boards or other social media functions on our website, or enter a competition or promotion. 

With regards to each of your visits to our websites we may automatically collect the following information: 

  * Technical information, including the Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your device to the Internet, your login information, browser type and version, time zone setting, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system, unique identifiers and other device platform information; 

  * Information about your visit, including the full Uniform Resource Locators (URL) clickstream to, through and from our site (including date and time); products or pages you viewed or searched for; page response times, download errors, length of visits to certain pages, page interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs), and methods used to browse away from the page. 

  * Information about your interactions with our email messages, such as the links you click on and whether you open or forward a message, the date and time of these interactions and the device you use to read emails;

  * Information collected through cookies, web beacons and other tracking technologies provided by our partners and affiliates




We will always be transparent about how we plan to use your data so that you have the choice whether or not to give it to us. We respect your preferences and will do our best to make sure that we keep our promises. 

If you give us your consent to send you further marketing messages we may contact you from time-to-time with carefully selected offers and promotions from ourselves or from our network of carefully selected partners, from which you may always opt-out or unsubscribe. It is not our practice to contact you if you have made it clear that you do not wish to hear from us about our products and services. 

We may need to authenticate your identity to provide you with access to subscriber-only services. We might also send you surveys or invite you to enter a competition or receive a newsletter, for instance. If you do not wish to participate you may simply decline our invitations. 

As part of our Google Analytics tracking we have implemented the following features: Remarketing, Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting. Visitors can opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising by visiting here <https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/>

We use this information for reporting purposes and to advertise online. Third-party vendors, including Google, may show your ads on sites across the Internet. We may use the cookies relating to Google Analytics together with third party cookies to inform, optimise and serve ads based on a user's part visits to our websites. 

For a full list of third parties we work with and links to their websites so you can see how they use cookies please go to [Crash Media Group's Cookie policy](http://www.cmg.london/cookie-policy). 

**Do we share that data with any other companies?**

Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy or in the data collection statements that will always be visible when we collect your information and where we give you the opportunity to select your preferences, we may release your data to external companies that we use to process your orders, to supply you with a prize in the event you win a competition, for instance. Every supplier we use has to go through a rigorous up-front process to ensure that their processes are at least as good as our own. 

However, you expressly consent to the sharing of your Personal Data with those suppliers with whom we contract in order to provide services to you, otherwise we may not be able to provide the level of service that we know you'll require. 

If you send in a comment, we may post it on our site or use it as a testimonial without mentioning your full name or publishing any information that would identify you. Furthermore, in some circumstances we may display some of your information such as your username and age. Others may be able to see your personal data if you post any information in comments underneath articles or forums and may be used to send you unsolicited communications over which we have no control. 

We may share some of your information with advertisers, ad servers and ad networks to deliver targeted advertising both on our websites and on selected partner websites but this will not include any information which directly identifies you. However, by interacting with or viewing an advert, you should be aware that the third party may make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the advert. 

These activities may involve the use of cookies and other similar technologies. To learn more or to see how you can opt out of targeted advertising, for more information please read our [Cookie Policy](). 

Please take care when using social networking sites too which we may invite you to join that you do not disclose anything that you might later wish to retract. 

There are certain times when we may be legally required to disclose your data in good faith where it is required by law or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on us, or where we have a requirement to protect or defend the rights of Crash Media Group or any users of our servers. We will always ensure that those requesting the information have the legal right to do so. 

If another company should acquire any of our companies or our assets, including our database, that company will have the right of possession to the Personal Data collected by us and will assume the rights and obligations formerly attributable to us and will use the data in line with the terms under which you submitted it or as described in this Privacy Policy. 

**The information we may collect from you about others**

Sometimes we may offer you the chance to invite a family member or a friend to enjoy a particular service. In such circumstances, we will collect both your personal details and those of your friend or family member. We will ask your consent to mention your name when we contact the person or persons you have recommended and we will only use this information once and not save it in our database, unless they have entered a competition, for example, when the information will be stored purely for that purpose. If they decide to take up any of our invitations then their data will be treated exactly the same as your own, using the terms under which the data was collected and the information as described in this Privacy Policy. 

**Leaving our website and moving on to third party websites**

When you click on advertisements or links on any of our sites, you will leave that site and go to a third-party site, which is outside of our control. When we place an advertisement on one of our sites, it does not signify that we are endorsing that advertiser's product or service. We do not accept responsibility for content, have no control over and our Privacy Policy does not apply to these companies, sites or content and if such third-party sites collect Personal Data, we cannot control how this data is processed, stored or used. We advise that you read their data collection statements, which accompany any registration and their Privacy Policies before you submit your personal information.
