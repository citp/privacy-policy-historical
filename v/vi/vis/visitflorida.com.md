**About Privacy**  
Your privacy is important to VISIT FLORIDA and we will treat any of your information with care.

Our Privacy Statement lets you know how we handle personally identifiable information you share with us through our digital and printed communication vehicles.

**II. Privacy Statement ("Privacy Statement")**  
**Scope**  
This Privacy Statement explains how we collect and handle personally identifiable information you share with VISIT FLORIDA through our web site, electronic newsletter and promotional emails. It also describes our use of cookies and other tracking devices. It provides instruction regarding links to other web sites, security of the information you provide and potential changes to the Privacy Statement. It provides contact information for questions and instructions for un-subscribing.

**Personal Information Collection**  
You may use our web sites, digital newsletters and other forms of internet-based communications to learn about VISIT FLORIDA products and services without disclosing any personal information beyond what you provided when requesting authorized VISIT FLORIDA publications, both digital or printed. We may ask you to provide us with personal information, for example, to access or use certain features or if you request additional information from VISIT FLORIDA Partners. Information that may be requested by VISIT FLORIDA includes: contact information, such as name, address, email address, and telephone number; demographic information, such as household information, age group, etc. and information about your travel interests.

**Personal Information Uses**  
Personal information that you voluntarily offer may be used to reply to your requests, to update and improve content on our web site or electronic newsletter, or to assist with marketing research. Such information includes but is not limited to survey responses, site registrations and information preferences, normally related to potential vacations in Florida. This information is used to tailor communications to you, either by authorized VISIT FLORIDA communications entities, such as COF, or VISIT FLORIDA Partner organizations that are suited to your provided information/preferences. Note: VISIT FLORIDA Partner organizations, as referenced here, would include hospitality businesses or organizations in Florida which are also paid members of the VISIT FLORIDA Partner organization.

With respect to sharing personal information with authorized, membership Partners: We sometimes offer information or services on behalf of Partners within a solicitation. We endeavor to make clear and apparent when corporate partner offers are combined with COF offers. In such cases, the information you provide is shared with our Partners and is subject to use within that company's privacy policy. Note: VISIT FLORIDA Partners, as referenced here, would include companies wishing to offer products or services to Florida visitors, but not necessarily Florida-based companies. Examples could include financial, lodging or transportation firms.

VISIT FLORIDA will not share your personal information with non-Partners for their independent use without your permission.

We may disclose your personal information as required by law, in conjunction with a government inquiry, or in litigation or dispute resolution.

**Cookies and Other Tracking Devices**  
We may use cookies and other tracking devices on our web sites to allow us to measure site activity in aggregate, not on the individual level. This in turn allows us to provide a better user experience. Only information you voluntarily provide is stored in your customer file.

You can choose to refuse cookies - simply refer to your browser Help instructions to learn more about how to manage their use.

**Links to Outside Web Sites**  
This site may contain links to third party sites not controlled by VISIT FLORIDA, which therefore are not covered by this privacy statement, such as those belonging to VISIT FLORIDA Partners and Sponsors. We recommend that you check the privacy statement of other sites you visit before providing any personal information.

**Security of Information**  
VISIT FLORIDA recognizes the importance of safeguarding personal information in our possession from theft, inappropriate use, or improper distribution. It should, however, be recognized that no company can perfectly protect personal information.

**Privacy Inquiries**  
If you have concerns or questions regarding VISIT FLORIDA's consumer privacy practices, please forward them to [privacy@VISITFLORIDA.org](mailto:privacy@VISITFLORIDA.org)

**Changes to Privacy Statement**  
VISIT FLORIDA retains the right to change this Privacy Statement. For your benefit, we will post changes to this page in a timely manner.
