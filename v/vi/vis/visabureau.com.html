<h6>1. Information Gathered</h6>
<p>Visa Bureau collect personal information from Online Visa Assessments, email and SMS alerts and data capture forms on our website. Cookies are used when entering our site to record the location from where each visitor arrived.

The contents of the log file are analysed each month to determine how many visitors Visa Bureau serve, what pages they look at most, and from where they connect.
