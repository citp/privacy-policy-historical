You can limit the sharing of certain types of customer information, known as Customer Proprietary Network Information, or CPNI, within the Verizon family of companies for marketing services to you that are different from your current Visible services.

#### V. YOUR CHOICES

You have choices about certain ways we use and share information about you. 

**Customer Proprietary Network Information.  **Visible customers may choose to limit the use and sharing of Customer Propriety Network Information (or “CPNI”) among Visible’s affiliates, which includes the Verizon family of companies, for the purpose of marketing communications-related services that are different from those you currently have. CPNI is information that relates to the type, quantity, destination, technical configuration, location, amount of use and related billing information of your telecommunications or interconnected Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) services. Federal law governs our use and sharing of CPNI. Notice about Visible’s use and sharing of CPNI and the choices you have may be provided in your monthly statement or in other ways. To opt out, log in to your account and go to “Privacy” in your Account in the Visible app or online at [www.visible.com/account/privacy](https://web.archive.org/account/privacy/ "Follow link"). 

**Marketing.  **You have choices about receiving marketing from Visible. If you would like to be removed from Visible’s email marketing list, you can opt-out by following the unsubscribe instructions, usually found at the bottom of the emails. 

**Cookies.  **You may be able to refuse or disable cookies by adjusting your web browser settings. Because each web browser is different, please consult the instructions provided by your web browser (typically in the “help” section). If you choose to refuse, disable, or delete these technologies, some of the functionality of our apps or sites may no longer be available to you. 

**Do-Not-Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms.  **Some web browsers transmit "do-not-track" signals to websites. Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them. We currently do not take action in response to these signals. 

#### VI.    CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS

We are required to disclose information, upon request, to our California customers and to allow California residents under age 18 who are registered users to request removal of information they have publicly posted. 

A business subject to California Civil Code section 1798.83 is required to disclose to its California customers, upon request, the identity of any third parties to whom the business has disclosed personal information within the previous calendar year, along with the type of personal information disclosed, for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. Please note that under California law, businesses are only required to respond to a customer request once during any calendar year. 

A business subject to California Business and Professions Code Section 22581 must allow California residents under age 18 who are registered users of online sites, services or applications to request and obtain removal of content or information they have publicly posted.
