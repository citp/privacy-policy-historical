Visible Systems Corporation Privacy Policy
In this Website Privacy Statement ("statement"), Visible Systems Corporation,
provides information about how we collect, use and transfer personally
identifiable data from you, an individual person and website visitor, through
Visible's publicly accessible websites (any of our websites such as
http://www.visible.com that can be accessed without a password) and on
which we post a direct link to this statement (collectively the "site").
Scope
This statement covers only data collected through the site and not any other
data collection or processing, including, without limitation, data collection
practices of webpages to which the site links, or data that we or our affiliates
collect offline or through webpages that do not display a direct link to this
statement, for example the Salesforce.com applications on which we host
data for registered customers like Visible.
Types of Data and Collection Methods
Through the site, we receive data that you actively submit as well as data that
we track:
•      Actively Submitted Data: When you request information, subscribe to a
mailing list or for a service, respond to an online survey or otherwise actively
send us data, we usually collect data such as your name, e-mail address(es),
mailing address(es), telephone number(s), and certain information related to
the business you represent such as number of employees and industry type.
You can opt out of providing information by not entering it when asked and, if
such information is required in order to allow us to respond to your inquiry,
you will receive a notice advising you of this. In each such instance, you will
know what data we collect through the site, because you actively submit it.


•       Passively Tracked Data: When you visit the site, we also passively track
information on your computer and Internet connection, such as the IP address
of your computer and/or Internet service provider, the date and time you
access the site, the Internet address of websites from which you link to our
site, the computer technology you are using and your movements and
preferences on our site. We use technology that many other websites employ,
including, without limitation, "cookies" or small data files stored on your
computer's hard drive, to collect such information. In some instances, we also
use cookies to collect information in connection with future visits from that
website, to recognize you as a previous visitor, or to track your activity on our
site. If you follow a link to the site from an affiliate or promotion, we store
information about your arrival from that affiliate or promotion in a session
cookie. You do not need to have cookies turned on to visit our site. You can
refuse cookies by turning them off on your browser. But, if you want to access
webpages that require registration, you need to accept a mandatory session
cookie, which you can delete after you leave the site.
•       Combinations: Unless you also actively submit personal information
such as your name or address, passively tracked data does not typically allow
us to identify you personally (even though it can theoretically be done, we do
not have the means or an interest to find out who you are, unless you identify
yourself voluntarily through an active submission of data). To the extent
permitted by applicable law, we reserve the right to combine passively tracked
data with personal data that you actively submit.
Collection Purposes, Use of Data
We collect passively tracked data primarily for purposes of administering,
protecting and improving our site and our systems, to better understand the
preferences of our site visitors, to identify server problems, to compile
aggregated statistics about site usage, and to help personalize your
experience on our site. We collect actively submitted data primarily for two
purposes: Firstly, for the purpose for which you originally sent us the data
(e.g., to provide information to you or sign you up for a free trial); and
secondly, for purposes of contacting you to further discuss your interest in our
company, the services we provide and ways we can improve them to provide


information on services, promotions and events. You can opt out of receiving
marketing emails as explained below.
Disclosures of Personal Information
We are not in the business of selling or renting your information to
telemarketers and we do not share your personally identifiable information
with others. We may share your information as required by law or in the
interest of protecting or exercising our or others' legal rights, e.g., without
limitation, in connection with requests from law enforcement officials and in
connection with court proceedings. We may share or transfer your information
in connection with a prospective or actual sale, merger, transfer or other
reorganization of all or parts of our business. Also, we reserve the right to fully
use and disclose any information that is not in personally identifiable form
(such as statistics and survey results that do not identify you individually by
name).
Opt-Out
In connection with promotions or other projects, we may ask you specifically
whether you have objections against a certain kind of data use or sharing. If
you opt-out under such circumstances, we will respect your decision. To opt
out of receiving commercial communications from Visible or please click on
the "opt-out" link in the communication or, please contact us at
info@visible.com. Please note that our affiliates and other data recipients
have their own data privacy policies, which may differ from ours and you
would have to contact them separately with respect to opt-out requests.
Access
If personal information you have submitted through the site is no longer
accurate, current, or complete, and you wish to update it, please send an e-
mail to info@visible.com. Upon appropriate request we will usually be glad to
update or amend your information, but we reserve the right to use information
obtained previously to verify your identity or take other actions that we believe
are appropriate.
Security


Transmissions over the Internet are never 100% secure or error-free.
However, we take reasonable steps to protect your personal information from
loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.
Effective Date, Amendments

modify, add or remove portions of this statement from time to time and in our
sole discretion, but will alert you that changes have been made by indicating

accepting the current version of this statement as posted on the site at that
time. We recommend that users revisit this statement on occasion to learn of
any changes.
