You agree that the use of the LVCVA Websites is limited to the State of Nevada, the United States of America, and not any other location.

**Information We Collect**

We may collect information directly from you, automatically through your use of the LVCVA Websites, and from third parties. We may combine all of that information we collect about you from these various sources.

User information is collected to provide a more efficient LVCVA online experience; to provide updates and information to help the LVCVA meet your needs; and to communicate with you in regards to matters you have requested additional information, applied for or inquired about an opportunity, or bid on a project.

Information we collect automatically/cookies and other tracking mechanisms. We may use applications, servers and other technology provided by third-party companies to help us improve our LVCVA Websites’ performance and user experience. We may automatically collect information about you through the use of common information-gathering tools, as well as new tracking technologies that develop as technology evolves. Information is also collected about you with regard to each of your visits to the LVCVA Websites. This information is automatically collected by analytics/tracking technologies, which are referred to as cookies. This information includes technical information, including the internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the internet; browser type and version; current location (if allowed); time zone setting; browser plug-in types and versions; operating systems and platform; information about your visit or visits from your IP address, including the full uniform resource locators (URL) clickstream to through and from the LVCVA Websites (including date and time), pages viewed, browser time, number of visits, search engine referrer, searches performed and search strings, page response times, download errors, length of visits, to certain pages, page interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs), and methods used to browse away from the page.

The tools that we or our service providers may use to track you include the following:

  * **_Cookies_**.  A cookie is a small string of text that a website can send to your browser to help the website remember and customize your visit. For example, we use cookies to help us to tailor our content and services to you, remember your orders, keep you logged into your account, and compile statistics about services usage. With most internet browsers or other software, you can erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block or disable cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. Please refer to your browser instructions to learn more about these functions. If you reject cookies, functionality of our website may be limited, and you may not be able to take advantage of many of our website’s features. We might also collect information on the browser type, including plug-in versions such as Flash or QuickTime. Another example of information we might capture is the URL where a user is entering or exiting the site.  
  * **_Web beacons/clear GIFs_**.  Clear graphics interchange format images (“GIFs”) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, are embedded invisibly on webpages or in emails. We, or our service providers, may use clear GIFs (also known as web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags) in connection with our services to track the activities of visitors to our website, and to help us manage content and compile statistics about usage of our services. We, or our service providers, may also use clear GIFs in emails to our users to help us track email response rates, identify when our emails are viewed, and track whether our emails are forwarded.
  * **_LSOs_**.  We may also use local storage objects (“LSOs”) to store your website preferences and to personalize your visit. LSOs are different from browser cookies because of the amount and type of data stored. Typically, you cannot control, delete or disable the acceptance of LSOs through your web browser. For more information on Flash LSOs, or to learn how to manage your settings for Flash LSOs, please click here. 



We use Quantcast and Google Analytics to collect this type of information. 

     **_Quantcast_**.  Quantcast may use your computer’s IP address, pixel code, referring HTTP location, current HTTP location, search string, time of the access, browser time, any searches made from the LVCVA Websites, and other statistics to analyze log data from different websites, and combine it with other non-personally identifiable information to produce the reports that are made available on the Quantcast.com to enable web publishers and advertisers to deliver audience segments that are appropriate for their products or services. 

_**Google Analytics**_.   We use Google Analytics’ third-party audience data such as age, gender and interests to better understand the behavior of our users, to work with companies that collect information about your online activities, and to provide advertising targeted to suit your interests and preferences. For example, you may see certain ads on this website because we contract with Google and other similar companies to target our ads based on information we or they have collected, including information that was collected through automated means (such as cookies and web beacons). These companies also use automated technologies to collect information when you click on our ads, which helps track and manage the effectiveness of our marketing efforts. 

If you do not want your data collected with Google Analytics, you can install the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on. This add-on instructs the Google Analytics JavaScript (ga.js, analytics.js, and dc.ja) running on websites to prohibit sending information to Google Analytics. 

To opt-out of analytics for the web, visit the Google Analytics opt-out page and install the add-on for your browser. For more details on installing and uninstalling the add-on, please see the relevant help resources for your specific browser.

Updates to your browner or operating system may affect functionality of the opt-out add-on. [Learn about managing add-ons for Chrome here](https://support.google.com/chrome_webstore/answer/2664769?hl=en). If you are not using Chrome, check directly with the manufacturer of your browser to determine whether add-ons will function properly on the browser version that you are using. 

The latest versions of Internet Explorer sometimes load the Google Analytics opt-out add-on after sending data to Google Analytics. Therefore, if you are using Internet Explorer, the add-on will set cookies on your computer. These cookies ensure that any collected data is immediately deleted from the collection server. Please make sure that third-party cookies aren’t disabled for your Internet Explorer browser. If you delete your cookies, the add-on will, within a short timeframe, reset these cookies to ensure that your Google Analytics browser add-on remains fully functional.

The Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on does not prevent data from being sent to the website itself or in other ways to web analytics services. 

[Learn about how Google Analytics collects, uses and processes data here](https://developers.google.com/analytics/resources/concepts/gaConceptsTrackingOverview).

[Learn about the cookies Google Analytics uses here](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/cookie-usage). 

**_Adobe_**.  Adobe uses cookies in several ways, such as:

  * Authenticating and identifying you on our websites so Adobe can provide you the services you requested.
  * Keeping track of information you have provided — for example, keeping items in your shopping cart as you browse adobe.com
  * Providing you the Adobe websites you use
  * Remembering your preferences or where you left off in your use of an Adobe website ([learn more or opt out](https://www.adobe.com/privacy/opt-out.html#2))
  * Measuring your use of Adobe websites so that Adobe can improve them, tailor its websites to your likely interests, and conduct market research
  * Understanding your likely interests so Adobe can provide you more relevant Adobe ads and content on non-Adobe websites and in non-Adobe apps ([learn more or opt out](https://www.adobe.com/privacy/opt-out.html#2))
  * Running the Adobe Experience Cloud solutions that help our business customers personalize and improve the performance of their websites, apps and marketing messages ([learn more or opt out](https://www.adobe.com/privacy/opt-out.html#2)).



**_Facebook_**.  Facebook uses cookies if you have a Facebook account; use the Facebook Products, including its website and apps; or visit other websites and apps that use Facebook Products (including the Like button or other Facebook technologies). Cookies enable Facebook to offer the Facebook Products to you, and to understand the information Facebook receives about you, including information about your use of other websites and apps, whether or not you are registered or logged in. Facebook’s data policy describes the information it processes to support Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and other products, and other features offered by Facebook. [Facebook’s cookie policy explains how Facebook uses cookies](https://www.facebook.com/policy/cookies). 

Users in the United States may opt out of many third-party ad networks. For example, you may go to the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) [Consumer Choice Page](http://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2#!/) for information about opting out of interest-based advertising and your choices regarding having information used by DAA companies. You may also go to the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) [Consumer Opt-Out Page](http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1#!/) for information about opting out of interest-based advertising and your choices regarding having information used by NAI members.

Opting out from one or more companies listed on the DAA [Consumer Choice Page](http://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2#!/) or the [NAI Consumer Opt-Out Page](http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1#!/) will opt you out from those companies’ delivery of interest-based content or advertisements to you, but it does not mean you will no longer receive any advertising through our website or on other websites. Please note that even if you opt out, you may continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that you are viewing (e.g., contextually based ads). Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you opt out on the DAA or NAI websites, your opt out may not be effective. Additional information is available on the DAA’s website http://www.aboutads.info/ or the NAI’s website at www.networkadvertising.org.

The service providers we use for online advertising may change. By visiting our website, you accept and consent to our use of Google, Facebook and other services to serve advertisements to you.

These companies are contractually forbidden from disclosing or using your personal or other information other than to carry out the purposes for which the information was disclosed. These companies are in no way authorized to sell, rent or trade your personal information. While there are such contractual obligations in place, we cannot and do not guarantee that a third party could not breach its obligation and use your nonpublic personal information in a way contrary to our policy.

We may disclose information, including nonpublic personal information, in special cases when we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) conform to legal requirements or comply with the legal process such as, but not limited to, situations when we are required to do so by federal, state, or local laws and regulations, or when we receive a subpoena or are ordered by a court to do so; (b) protect and defend our rights; or (c) act to protect the interests of our users or others. Additionally, we may, without notice to you, provide aggregate statistics about visitors to the LVCVA Websites, such as volume, traffic patterns and related site information, to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will include no personal information.

Other unaffiliated third parties. With your separate written consent, we may share your information directly with third parties, including so they may send you marketing offers directly. The information that we share with such third parties may include, without limitation, your name, address and email address. 

We may also share your information, including personal information, in the following contexts:

  * Protecting rights and interests. We may disclose Personal Information if required to do so by law, or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary, to investigate, protect or defend the rights, safety or property of LVCVA, our customers or the public; to investigate or enforce perceived violations of our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy; as evidence in litigation in which we are involved; and for fraud protection and credit risk-reduction purposes.
  * Sale or acquisition of assets. We may share your information if we become involved in a transaction involving the sale of our assets, such as a merger or acquisition, if we are transferred to another company, in the event of a bankruptcy, or as part of any other business transfer. If the surviving entity in such a transaction is not LVCVA, the surviving entity may use your information pursuant to its own privacy policies, which may be different from this Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.
  * Legal compliance. We may share your information to comply with laws, regulations, legal process (e.g., a warrant or subpoena) or guidance; and to respond to governmental requests (e.g., requests from a regulator).
  * Aggregate or anonymous information. We may share anonymized or aggregated information (“Aggregate Information”) to third parties without restriction. Aggregate Information may include overall usage patterns of users, the total number of users, the percentage of users who are female, or in a certain age range, or who live in a particular region, etc., or the percentage of users who are also consumers of various other products and services. Aggregate Information may be compiled in reports and disclosed, sold, licensed or rented to third parties. However, since Aggregate Information does not include any information that can be used to individually identify you or any other user, it is not possible for the third-party recipient of the Aggregate Information to use it to identify or contact you. For example, we may share Aggregate Information to inform a third party’s decision on whether to place advertisements on the LVCVA Websites. These companies may use such information about your visits to the LVCVA Websites and other websites to provide advertisements on the LVCVA Websites and other websites.

**Security of Personal Information**

We exercise reasonable care to protect your nonpublic personal information. This includes storing the personal information on our servers behind a secured firewall and ensuring all transmissions to other vendors use secure encryption technology. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the internet can be guaranteed to be 100 percent secure. So, while we strive to protect your nonpublic personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us or receive from us. This is especially true for information you transmit to us via email. We have no way of protecting that information until it reaches us. Once we receive your transmission, we maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your personal information.

Internally, we will limit access to nonpublic personal information to those associates who need the information to provide products and services to you, or to maintain or service those products or services. These associates are limited in number and are committed to our privacy and security policies. We will review our security arrangements from time to time, as we deem appropriate.

  **Viewing and Updating Your Information**

You can review and revise your personal information at any time by accessing your LVCVA profile at the LVCVA Websites. To protect your privacy, we make every attempt to verify your identity before granting access to view or revise your personal information.

  **Email Communication from LVCVA**

You will receive email from the LVCVA only if you have registered for one of our mailing lists. Use links on the email you receive from the LVCVA to manage your subscriptions.

   **Transmission of Information**

Any material, information or idea you transmit to or post on the LVCVA Websites by any means will be treated as nonconfidential and non-proprietary, and may be disseminated or used by the LVCVA or its affiliates for any purpose whatsoever, including, but not limited to, developing, manufacturing and marketing products. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all personal data provided to the LVCVA online will be handled in accordance with the LVCVA Online Privacy Practices. You are prohibited from posting or transmitting to or from this website any unlawful, threatening, libelous, defamatory, obscene, scandalous, inflammatory, pornographic or profane material, or any other material that could give rise to any civil or criminal liability under the law.  
 

**Third-party Links and Content**

The LVCVA Websites may contain general links and social content linking to other sites, including those of our business partners. We try to link only to sites that share our high standards and respect for privacy, we are not responsible for the privacy practices employed by other sites, and those other sites have not agreed to our privacy policy. Visit those sites for information regarding their privacy policies prior to providing personal information.

Social content is aggregated and collected by a business partner. Social content, including text, images, video and other content, is displayed on the LVCVA Websites through the terms and conditions of our business partner.  

The links and social content we provide on the LVCVA Websites, or that are accessible through the LVCVA Websites, are there for your reference and convenience only. We do not control any of these websites, nor are we responsible for their content. The LVCVA does not imply any endorsement of the material on such websites or any association with their operators by including these links on the LVCVA Websites. If you decide to access any of the LVCVA Websites, you do so entirely at your own risk and you should be aware that upon using any links and social content available via the LVCVA Websites that you will be leaving the LVCVA Websites and subject to the terms and conditions of those sites/platforms, as applicable.

**Security**

We have taken steps to protect your information. For example, we limit internal access to our servers and have physical, electronic and administrative safeguards in place that are designed to protect your information. However, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure, and we cannot guarantee the security of information transmitted through our services. We cannot ensure or warrant the security of any such information, and you provide such information at your own risk.

You can also take steps to help protect your information. For example, if you have an account with us, you should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your account by, among other things, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, and by keeping your login and password private.
