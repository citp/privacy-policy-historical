<h2>II. Data Collection and Usage</h2>
<p>We collect, store and use your personal information to allow you to use our Site, to communicate with us, and for the other purposes described in more detail below or as we may specify at the time of collection.</p>
<p>We collect and use information about you in several ways. We may receive information directly from you when you send us email, share a photo, complete a form on our Site (such as a survey or a request for a guide or a sweepstakes entry), sign up to receive email from us, or call us with questions. We may receive your social media profile when you share articles on our Site using your social account. We also collect information electronically when you browse our Site. We do not store it longer than necessary.<br>
</p>
<p>There are two types of information we collect – anonymous and personal. Anonymous information is information that cannot be used to identify you individually. We collect anonymous information automatically. Personal information is information that can be used to identify you individually, such as your name, address, email address, or phone number. Except for your IP address, we collect personal information only when you give it to us. You may be asked to provide personal information anytime you are in contact with us. We may share your personal information with our Florida tourism partners, as described in detail below. We and our Florida tourism partners may combine your personal information with other information to provide and improve our products, services, and advertising. You are not required to provide any personal information that we request, but if you choose not to do so, in many cases we will not be able to provide you with our services or respond to any questions you might have.</p>
<p>The type of information we collect from you depends on how you interact with us. You can use our Site without providing us with any information other than anonymous information we collect automatically.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;"><b>A. Information you provide directly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">We obtain information that identifies you personally directly from you. We ask for your contact information (name, street address, email address, and phone numbers) when you request a guide, sign up for electronic newsletters, answer a survey, enter a sweepstakes or other game or contest, participate in other promotional activities, or share your photos with us. We may also ask for information that helps us understand more about your interest in Florida tourism, such as demographic information like household information and age group, and information about your travel interests. By law we must ask prize winners for their social security numbers so that we can report their winnings to the IRS. When you share a photo with us, we may obtain your credit line (an acknowledgement of who shot the photo), caption and date and place the photo was taken.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">We use the information that you voluntarily provide to reply to your requests, to update and improve the content on our Site or in our electronic newsletters, and to assist with marketing research. We use photos you share with us to promote Florida vacations.<br>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;"><b>B. Information we collect electronically automatically.</b></p>
<p style="margin-left: 80.0px;"><b>1. <b style="">Inf</b></b><b style="">ormation about your visit.</b> Our Site servers automatically record your visits to our Site. Like all other website servers, ours compiles a log that records the date, time, browser (i.e., Firefox), device type (i.e., iPhone), operating system (i.e. Android) and originating IP address of each Site page request.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80.0px;">We use cookies that identify your browser or device. They collect and store information when you visit our Site about how you use the Site, and facilitate interest-based advertising. For detailed information about cookies, the types of cookies we use and how we use them please see our <a href="/en-us/cookie-notice.html">Cookie Notice</a>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80.0px;">We have a legitimate interest in collecting this information to monitor usage of our Site, identify issues with our Site, and improving our services.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80.0px;"><b>2. Information About Your Location.</b>&nbsp; &nbsp;From your IP address, we can tell generally where you are when you are accessing our Site, i.e., which city.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;"><b>C. With Whom Do We Share Information We Collect?</b></p>
<p style="margin-left: 80.0px;"><b>1. Personal Information.</b> We may share the information that you voluntary provide with our Florida tourism partners and also with business partners that fulfill your requests for information, such as companies that mail our print brochures.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80.0px;">We share your email address with trusted business partners who provide Florida tourism services and have also agreed to use your information only to promote their own products and services.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80.0px;">We may disclose your personal information as required by law, in conjunction with a government inquiry, or in litigation or dispute resolution.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80.0px;"><b>2. Anonymous Information.</b>&nbsp; &nbsp;We may disclose statistical information to third parties in aggregate form without revealing any personal details about our users (for example, 45% of our Site visitors live in the Northeast).</p>
<h2><b>III. WHERE YOUR INFORMATION WILL BE HELD</b></h2>
<p>Our Site operates in the U.S. If you are located outside of the U.S., please be aware that all information you provide us will be transferred to and stored and processed in the U.S. Please also be aware that by using our Site and giving us your information, you consent to such U.S. transfer, storage and processing. You also understand that the U.S. privacy laws may be different from the laws of your country.</p>

For further details see European Commission: EU-US Privacy Shield https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/eu-us-privacy-shield_en.</p>
<p>Where we use third party vendors based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield or if the transfer is governed by a contract including Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) approved by the European Commission in accordance with Article 46(2)(c) of the General Data Protection Regulation or similar clauses.</p>
<h2>IV. YOUR RIGHTS</h2>

<li><b>You have the right to restrict processing.</b> You are entitled to ask us to suspend the processing of certain of your personal information about you, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it.</li>
<li><b>You have the right to object to processing.</b> Where we are processing your personal information based on a legitimate interests (or those of a third party) you may challenge this. However we may be entitled to continue processing your information based on our legitimate interests or where this is relevant to legal claims. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes.</li>
