<h5>02. Types of information collected on the Visa AP website</h5>
<p>There are two types of information collected on the Visa AP website: Personal Information and Non-Personal Information.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Personal Information</b><br>Personal Information is information that identifies you as an individual, such as your name, mailing address, email address, age range, etc. Personal information is only obtained when you voluntarily provide the information to us. Visa uses personal information to better understand your needs and interests and to provide you with better service. For example, you may be asked to voluntarily submit your email address to us when communicating with us or your name and email address when entering a sweepstakes or contest.<br>&nbsp;<br>On occasion, Visa may ask you to voluntarily submit information about other people. For example, this may be done to send them a link to a web page or sign them up for a promotion.<br>&nbsp;<br>Once you choose to provide us with personal information, you can be assured it will be used only to support your relationship with Visa. We take seriously the trust you place in us and will not sell, rent or lease your personal information to others.<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Non-Personal Information</b><br>Non-Personal Information is information that does not identify you as an individual, such as your browser type, IP Address, the URL of the previous web site you visited, etc. Visa may automatically collect certain types of non-personal information from you when using the Visa AP website. We may also collect non-personal information that you voluntarily provide, such as information included in response to a questionnaire or survey.<br></p>

Other types of personal information we collect help us to profile who are registered cardholders and what their interests are.<br><p></p>

<h5>04. How we collect information</h5>
<p>Visa collects data when you provide information to us or through the use of web technology.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Information Collected Through You</b><br>If you choose to use certain services or enter a sweepstakes or contest on the Visa AP website, we may require you to provide contact and identity information. Where possible, we indicate which fields are required and which fields are optional. If you choose not to use a particular service or feature or enter a sweepstakes or contest, you do not have to provide the contact or identity information it calls for.<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Non-Personal Information Collected Through TechnologyCookies:</b><br>The Visa AP website may use cookie technology to improve your experience on the Visa AP website and gather data for web site statistical reporting. Cookie technology does not capture your individual email address or any personal information about you.<br>&nbsp;<br>A cookie is a small piece of information sent by a web site that is saved on your hard disk by your computer’s browser. It holds information a site may need to personalize your experience (i.e., rotating images on the Visa AP website home page) and gathers web site statistical data, such as which pages are visited, what is downloaded, the Internet provider’s domain name and country that our visitors come from and the addresses of sites visited immediately before and after coming to the Visa AP website. However, none of this is associated with you as an individual and is measured only in aggregate.<br>&nbsp;<br>To browse without cookies, you can configure your browser to reject all cookies or to notify you when a cookie is set. (Each browser is different, so check the “Help” menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.) Your experience of the Visa site may be different if you set your browser to block cookies.<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Web Beacons:</b><br>The Visa AP website may use web beacons to serve advertising, enhance email advertising and track usage on the Visa AP website. We use third parties to manage web beacons and the data they collect. Web beacons do not capture your individual email address or any other personal information.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Web beacons, also called clear GIFs (a common format for image files), are invisible files on web pages that you visit. If you visit a page on the Visa AP website that contains a web beacon, it communicates with your computer to determine, among other things, whether you have been to that page before or viewed a particular advertisement.<br>&nbsp;<br><b>IP Address:</b><br>The Visa AP website may collect IP addresses for the purposes of systems administration, server problem diagnosis and compiling aggregate information (such as how many visitors logged on to the Visa AP website). When you visit a particular web page on the Visa AP website, our servers log your IP address. An IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer automatically when you use the Internet.<br></p>
