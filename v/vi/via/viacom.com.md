This Privacy Policy, as amended from time-to-time, will remain in full force and effect even if your use of or participation in the Site or any particular service, feature or function offered through the Site terminates, expires, ceases, is suspended or deactivated for any reason.  If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please do not access the Site or any features or services offered through the Site.  


**2.** **         ** **U.S. Governing Law.**

**3.** **          ** **Collection and Use of Personal Information and Other Information.**

When we use the term "Personal Information" we mean information that would allow someone to identify you or contact you, such as your full name, postal address, e-mail address or telephone number.   When we use the term "Other Information", we mean any information other than Personal Information that may be collected about you (Personal Information and Other Information, together, the "Information"). 

**a.** **  ** **Information We Collect that You Provide Us.** **  **

**i.   User Registration.**  To the extent we offer user registration on the Site, to register as a member of the Site, you are required to select a user name and password (together, your "User ID") and may also be required to provide other Information, such as your email address and date of birth. Additional Information may be requested during the registration process (but not required).

 **ii. In Connection with Certain Features and Functions.**  We may also provide you with access to certain features or functions that we may offer on the Site, such as message boards. To sign up for or participate in these features or functions, you may be required to provide us with certain Information about you in order for us to personalize and/or allow you to use such features and functions.

 **b.    Information Collected Through Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies. **

"Cookies" (which may be html files, Flash files or other technology) are text files that help store user preferences and activity. . "Web beacons" (also known as image tags, gif or web bugs) are small pieces of code used to collect advertising data, such as counting page views, promotion views or advertising responses.  The Site and/or third parties may use **  "**cookies", "web beacons" and other similar tracking technologies (collectively, "Tracking Technologies") to collect Other Information automatically as you browse the Site and the web.

By visiting the Site, whether as a registered user or otherwise, you acknowledge, understand and hereby agree that you are giving us your consent to track your use of the Site through these Tracking Technologies.

We use Tracking Technologies to help tailor our content, allow users to move between associated sites without logging into each site, understand Site and internet usage, improve or customize the content, offerings or advertisements on this Site, personalize your experience on this Site (for example, to recognize you by name when you return to the Site), understand your interactions with email messages (such as the links clicked on and whether the messages were opened or forwarded), save your password in password-protected areas, save your online game or video player settings, enable you to use shopping carts on the Site, help us offer you products, programs or services that may be of interest to you, deliver relevant advertising, maintain and administer the Site and for other purposes described in the "Use of Information", [ **Other Information Collected by Us**](https://web.archive.org/about/pages/privacypolicy.aspx#info).  These Tracking Technologies collect "click stream" data and additional Other Information regarding your visits to the Site (such as your visits to the Site's webpages, use of our features and purchasing history or preferences), may collect such Other Information across multiple sessions on this Site and other websites offered by Affiliates and may also collect your IP address or some other identifier unique to the Device you use to access the Site ("Identifier").  An Identifier is automatically assigned to any Device you use to access the Site.  Your Personal Information is not collected as part of this process but we may associate Other Information collected by Tracking Technologies with Personal Information.   

This Site may additionally use a variety of third party advertising networks, data exchanges, traffic measurement service providers, marketing analytics service providers and other third parties (collectively, "Third Party Advertising Service Providers") to, for example, serve advertisements on the Site, facilitate targeting of advertisements and/or measure and analyze advertising effectiveness and/or traffic on the Site ("Targeting Services").  These Third Party Advertising Service Providers may enable us to display advertisements based on your visits to the Site and other websites you have visited.  Targeting Services enable us to, among other things, help deliver advertisements or other content to you for products and services that you might be interested in, to prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times and to conduct research regarding the usefulness of certain advertisements to you.

These Third Party Advertising Service Providers do not have access to Tracking Technologies set by the Site except to the extent necessary to provide services to the Site.  The Third Party Advertising Service Providers and other third parties may themselves set and access their own Tracking Technologies on your Device if you choose to have Tracking Technologies enabled in your browser (or, for Flash cookies, if you have not removed them) and/or they may otherwise collect or have access to Information about you and your online activities over time and across different websites when you use the Site.
