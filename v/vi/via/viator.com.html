<p>We have prepared this Privacy Policy to help you understand how Viator collects, uses and safeguards the personal information you provide to us on our websites, via email, and through our service providers and distribution partners.</p>

<h3 id="whoWeAre">Who We Are</h3>
<p>Viator operates through different websites around the world, which are all part of the Viator family.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Viator.com</strong> is our flagship website, where we offer our complete range of products and services directly to consumers.</li>
<li>At Viator we also work with hundreds of <strong>affiliate partners</strong> (<a href="http://www.viator.com/partnership#distribution" target="_self">click here</a> to view a partial list of Viator affiliates) who distribute our products and services to consumers through their individual websites. We typically host our affiliates' product-information and booking pages, and manage payment and credit card information.</li>
<li>We also work with <strong>distributors</strong> (as discussed below) who manage the hosting, purchase and payment for our products and services.</li>
</ul>
<div class="back_to_top"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></div>
<h3 id="whatInfo">What Information Do We Collect?</h3>
<p>When you visit Viator.com or any of our affiliates' web pages that are hosted by us, our web server automatically recognizes and collects your IP address.</p>
<p>In order to purchase our products or services, it is necessary for you to disclose personal information, including your name, address, email address, phone number, credit card details and other identifying information in order to process orders and provide customer service. If you do not provide personal information when purchasing one of our products or services, we cannot confirm your purchase or fulfill your booking.</p>
<p>When you register with Viator, we ask for basic information including your name, email address and ask you to create a unique password and user id along with a password hint. To help us send more relevant communications to you (if you choose to receive them) we keep track of all website searches and bookings. For example, if you frequently visit Paris and London, we may send you special notices listing deals and popular products for those destinations. If you subscribe to any of our email marketing communications - including newsletters and destination alerts, it is necessary to disclose your name, your home country, and email address.</p>
<p>In some instances we may also ask for personal demographic data such as your country of residence, gender, age, travel habits, etc.</p>
<p>We also use cookies (as discussed below) to collect information about the performance and usability of our websites.</p>
<div class="back_to_top"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></div>
<h3 id="cookies">Cookies, and How We Use Them</h3>
<p>"Cookies" are pieces of information that are stored by your web browser on your computer's hard disk, for record-keeping purposes. Cookies in and of themselves only identify your computer; they do not personally identify you.</p>
<p>At Viator we make limited use of cookies to store your preferences, record session information, collect information on how you visit and access our websites, and to tailor our web pages to your needs.</p>
<p>We do <strong>not</strong> use cookies to identify specific users for marketing purposes. We do not match cookies to your purchase information. And we do not use cookies to track your movements after leaving our websites. Most web browsers allow you to turn off cookies; however, turning off cookies will limit your use of our websites.</p>
<div class="back_to_top"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></div>
<h3 id="personalInfo">How We Use Your Personal Information</h3>
<p>We use your personal information in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>To provide you with the information you request about our products</li>
<li>To send you email marketing messages and information for which you have specifically subscribed</li>
<li>To fulfill your bookings</li>
<li>To confirm your purchases</li>
<li>To ensure you are correctly billed</li>
<li>To measure and track demographic details about our customers</li>
<li>To target content on our website to more closely match your interests</li>
<li>If you have selected to receive email marketing messages, to target the appropriate content for email marketing messages to better match your interests</li>
</ul>
<p>If you make a purchase at one of our websites, we may also send you information about new products, or ask your opinion about our websites, etc., so that we may improve our service to you and other consumers. If you do not want Viator to contact you in the future, please let us know by sending an email to our Privacy Officer at <a href="mailto:privacy@viator.com">privacy@viator.com</a>.</p>
<p>If you subscribe to any of our email marketing messages, we will use your personal information to send you the information you requested. You will always have the option to unsubscribe by sending an email to privacy@viator.com, by logging into your account - if you've created one - and updating your email subscription preferences, or by following the link at the bottom of each email marketing message we send you.</p>
<p>Some of the personal information we collect is shared with our service partners (e.g. tour operators) who are directly involved in fulfilling the purchases you have made from us.</p>
<p>We only provide our service providers with your name and your local contact details, if you provide them (e.g. your hotel name for pick-ups and drop-offs, your local phone number, etc.) We do not provide our service providers with any other personal information. If you decide to provide any personal information directly to a service provider, we recommend that you review the service provider's privacy policy.</p>
<p>We also share your personal information with third parties contracted to provide us with marketing and data reporting services who are bound by an obligation of confidentiality and with other third party marketing partners.</p>
<p>We currently contract with several online partners to help manage and optimize our Internet business and communications. We use the services of a marketing company to help us measure the effectiveness of our advertising and how visitors use our website. To do this, we use web beacons and cookies provided by our marketing company on this website. The information we collect helps us learn things like what pages are most attractive to our visitors, which of our products most interest our customers, and what kinds of offers our customers like to see. Although our marketing company logs the information coming from our website on our behalf, we control how that data may and may not be used. If you do not want to help us learn how to improve our site, products, offers and marketing strategy, you can “opt-out" of our ability to analyze such data by <a href="http://www.omniture.com/privacy/product#optout" target="_blank">clicking here</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, rest assured that unless you expressly authorize us to do so, we do not share your personal information with third-party organizations who are not involved in fulfilling the purchases you have made from us or who are not contracted by us. </p>
<div class="back_to_top"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></div>
<h3 id="emailCommunications">Email Communications You Can Expect to Receive from Viator</h3>
<p>If you opt-in to receive communications from us, you will receive information we believe that will be of use and interest to you. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>We will keep you informed about Viator deals, destination and product news, sweepstakes, programs, etc., and other special promotions that we believe that you will find valuable.</li>
<li>We will keep you updated about important site functionality changes.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a subscriber to our email marketing communications, you will occasionally receive e-mail updates from us about product and destination sales in your area, special offers and new Viator Services and other noteworthy items. We believe that you will find Viator updates interesting and informative. </p>
<p>With the exception of emails confirming registration, emails that include Viator account information, and emails relating directly to a booking made on our website, Viator will not send any emails unless you elect to receive email communications from us. Please note that emails related to your Viator.com registration and transactions include emails to allow you to review your booking and tour experiences with us, administrative messages, and surveys related to either your Viator.com account or to your transactions on Viator.com. If you are no longer interested in receiving email marketing communications from Viator, you have several choices for opting out of future mailings:</p>
<ul>
<li>You may unsubscribe at any time by following the directions and link included in each email marketing message we send.</li>
<li>When you register as a Viator.com member, you may click on "My Account" at the top of any page of our website and update your "Account Settings"</li>
<li>You may email <a href="mailto:privacy@viator.com">privacy@viator.com</a> and request to be unsubscribed by including your name, email address, and the words "unsubscribe" in the subject or message body.</li>
</ul>
<div class="back_to_top"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></div>
<h3 id="distPartners">Our Distribution Partners and Suppliers</h3>
<p>Our products are made available through our distribution partners. This Privacy Policy should be read in conjunction with the privacy policies of our distribution partners, which may differ from Viator's Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>You should also be aware that some product or tour suppliers and some of our distribution partners may need other personal information (such as health or physical fitness information) to determine whether you can participate in an activity. You should read and rely upon the relevant supplier's or partner's Privacy Policy only, if Viator does not collect this information from you directly.</p>
<p>Some suppliers or distribution partners may operate in countries or states that do not have laws or regulation for the protection and safeguarding of personal information. Viator does what it can to persuade all its suppliers and distribution partners to adopt and adhere to privacy policies that are substantially the same as this one. However, please be aware that Viator is not in a position to force adherence, so we will rely on you and our other Customers to inform us if your privacy is not being adequately protected by our suppliers or distribution partners. Viator will then do what it lawfully can do (including severing its relationship with offending suppliers or distribution partners) to prevent other occurrences.</p>
<div class="back_to_top"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></div>
<h3 id="securityStorage">Our Security and Storage Measures</h3>
<p>At Viator we are committed to maintaining the integrity and security of your personal information.</p>
<p>We use industry-standard encryption protocols when receiving and transferring your personal information. In fact, when you send personal information to us over the Internet, we first require that a "secure session" be established using Secure Socket Layer (SSL).</p>
<p>Your personal information is stored in secure operating environments that are not accessible to the general public. We have security measures in place at our physical facilities to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of your personal information by our employees or third parties.</p>
<p>However, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot give an absolute assurance that the information you provide to us will be secure at all times. Viator will not be held responsible for events arising from unauthorized access to your personal information.Viator will rely on you telling us if you experience any unusual events that may indicate a breach in your information security. We will then investigate whether the security breach was related to the data transmissions from or to Viator and let you know what steps can be taken and have been taken to rectify the problem. Further action, such as reporting incidents to the police or other proper authorities, may also be required.</p>
<div class="back_to_top"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></div>
<h3 id="changes">Changes to Our Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>We know that our business will continue to evolve as we introduce new products and as such from time to time our Privacy Policy may be reviewed and revised.</p>
<p>Viator reserves the right to change its Privacy Policy and post the changes on its website. We will only use your personal information in accordance with the Privacy Policy in effect at the time we collected your personal information.</p>
<div class="back_to_top"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></div>
<h3 id="contact">Contacting Us</h3>
<p>For some Viator services you can access and update your registration and personal information online.</p>
<p>To correct or update any other personal information, or if you have questions about Viator's Privacy Policy, please email our Privacy Officer at <a href="mailto:privacy@viator.com">privacy@viator.com</a>.</p>
<div class="back_to_top"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></div>
<h3 id="furtherInfo">Further Information About Privacy Laws</h3>
<p>There is no single global entity that regulates personal information online. Instead, Viator has made a conscious choice to follow the privacy guidelines as established by law in the major markets where we operate and where we have offices. In Australia that means being guided by the <a href="http://www.privacy.gov.au/publications/nppgl_01.html" target="_blank">Australian National Privacy Principles</a>. In the United States that means adhering to the <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/privacy/" target="_blank">Federal Trade Commission's</a> privacy guidelines. In Europe the regulations are based on <a href="http://www.cdt.org/privacy/eudirective/EU_Directive_.html" target="_blank">EC Directive 95/46/EC</a>.</p>
