### Who We Are

Viator, Inc. (doing business as both "Viator" and "TripAdvisor Experiences" and referred to in these terms as "Viator", "we", "our", "us") is a Delaware corporation, with offices located at 360 Third Street, 4th Floor, San Francisco, California, 94107, USA. Viator operates a service that enables users to research, find, and book travel experiences worldwide. Viator's services are made available through Viator.com (and related domains and our affiliated websites around the world as well as Applications and telephone services.

  *  **Viator.com**  (together with other Viator-branded websites) is our flagship website, where we make available our complete range of products and services directly to consumers.
  * At Viator we also work with hundreds of  **affiliates**  who distribute our products and services to consumers through their individual websites and via a Viator widget imbedded on their third party websites. We typically host our affiliates' product-information and booking pages, and manage payment and credit card information.
  * We also work with  **distributors**  (as discussed below) who manage the hosting, purchase and payment for our suppliers' products and services.



If you provide personal data directly to our affiliates, distributors or suppliers, the terms of their respective privacy policies will apply to such disclosures. You should carefully review the privacy policies of the affiliate partner, distributor or supplier prior to providing personal data to such third parties.

### Collection of your personal data

In the course of our business, we collect and process personal data in different ways. We may collect personal data you give us directly but we also collect data by logging how you interact with our services, for example by using cookies on this website. We may also receive personal data from third parties. 

The personal data we collect about you may include, but is not limited to: your name, email address, postal address, phone number, billing information, survey responses, reservation details and other information you may provide about yourself to our site, your IP address and web browser software. 

You can choose not to provide personal data to us, but in general some personal data about you is required in order for you to receive relevant offerings from Viator and its partners, and to enjoy benefits of being a registered member. 

  * **Information that you provide to us:** We receive and store any personal data you enter on our websites or give us in any other way, including your contributions. For example, in order to purchase products or services, it is necessary for you to disclose personal data, including your name, address (partial or whole), email address, phone number, credit card details and other personally identifying information. If you do not provide personal data when purchasing one of our supplier's products or services, we cannot confirm your purchase or facilitate your booking. In some instances we may also ask for travel documentation, such as passports, demographic data, including your country of residence, gender, age, travel habits, etc.
  *  **Information about others:** You may have the opportunity to provide contact and travel-related information for other people through our websites. If you "Refer a Friend" or if you purchase products or services for someone else through Viator, you will need to submit that individual's personal data. You must obtain the consent of other individuals prior to providing us with their personal data. 
  * **Information from Other Sources:** We also may periodically obtain personal data about you from affiliated entities, business partners and other independent third-party sources and add it to other information about you. For example, if you visit Viator by "clicking through" from a site operated by one of our business partners, and you have registered with that partner, then personal data about you that you have provided to that partner may be shared with us, such as contact information and demographic information. As another example, if you access third party services, such as social media services, through our website or before coming to our website, we may collect information such as your user name and other information made available to us through those services. We will work with our existing partners and potential future partners to improve and personalize your use of our website in accordance with the practices outlined in this Privacy Policy.
  *  **Automatic Information:** We automatically collect certain information from your computer or mobile device when you visit Viator.com or any of our affiliates' web pages that are hosted by us. For example, we collect your IP address, web browser software, and referring website. To help us analyze the usage of our websites and related services, and to send more relevant communications to you, we also collect and keep track of your online activity, such as content viewed, pages visited, and searches and/or reservations facilitated or made. 
  * **Location Information and Other Information from Devices:** When you use an Application on a mobile device, we will collect and use information about you in generally similar ways and for similar purposes as when you use the Viator website. In addition, we may collect information about your location with your consent if your Device has been configured to send such information to the Application via the privacy settings on that Device, or if you have uploaded photos tagged with location information. For example, we may use your location to show you tours or excursions near you when you are travelling. You can change the privacy settings of your Device at any time in order to turn off the functionality to share location information with the Application and/or the functionality to tag your photos with location information. Please note that turning off location sharing may affect certain features of our Application. If you have any queries about the privacy settings of your Device, we suggest you contact the manufacturer of your Device or your mobile service provider for help.

  * **Social Media Services** If you connect to Viator using Facebook, we may show you reviews, photos and tours that your Facebook friends have posted, shared, saved or purchased on Viator. Note that, if you have Facebook friends who are using Viator, they may also share personal data about you with us through Facebook. If you wish to prevent that sharing, please review your Facebook privacy settings. You can also choose to access third-party social media websites and services through Viator (such as Facebook and Twitter). When you do so, you are sharing personal data with those sites, and the personal data you share is governed by their privacy policies. You may also be able to modify your privacy settings with these third party social media websites.
  *  **Service Providers** Some of the personal data we collect is shared with our service providers (e.g. tour operators) who are directly involved in fulfilling the purchases you have made from us. We only provide our service providers with the necessary information (e.g., your hotel name for pick-ups and drop-offs, your local phone number, your mobile phone number, your email address, etc.). We recommend that you review the service provider's privacy policy to determine how such service provider may use or disclose your personal data.
  *  **Third Party Vendors** We also share your personal data with third party vendors who provide services or functions on our behalf, including business analytics, payment processing, customer service, marketing, public relations, distribution of surveys or sweepstakes programs, and fraud prevention. We may also authorize third-party vendors to collect personal data on our behalf, including, for example, as necessary to operate features of our websites or Applications or to facilitate the delivery of online advertising tailored to your interests. Third-party vendors have access to and may collect personal data only as needed to perform their functions and are not permitted to share or use the personal data for any other purpose. We currently contract with several third-party online partners to help manage and optimize our internet business and communications. We use the services of third-party marketing companies to help us measure the effectiveness of our advertising and how visitors use our website. 
  * **Referring Websites** If you were referred to Viator from another website, we may share your registration information, such as your name, email address, mailing address, telephone number and travel preferences, about you with that referring website. We have not placed limitations on the referring websites' use of personal data and we encourage you to review the privacy policies of any website that referred you to Viator.
  *  **Companies within our Corporate Family** We may share your personal data within the Viator group of companies as well as our parent company, TripAdvisor, LLC, and our domestic and international corporate affiliate companies and websites. This sharing enables us to provide you with information about products and services, both travel-related and other, which might interest you. To the extent that our parent company and corporate affiliates have access to your personal data, they will follow practices that are at least as restrictive as the practices described in this Privacy Policy. They also will comply with applicable laws governing the transmission of promotional communications and, at a minimum, give you an opportunity in any commercial email they send to choose not to receive such email messages in the future.



We may also share or disclose personal data if we believe, at our sole discretion, this to be necessary:

  * to comply with legitimate and enforceable subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law. In such cases we reserve the right to raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us;
  * to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal or suspected illegal activities; to protect and defend the rights, property, or safety of Viator, our users, or others; and in connection with our Terms of Use or other agreements, including with our partners or suppliers; 
  * following a corporate transaction, such as divestiture, merger, acquisition, consolidation or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy; 
  * with law enforcement agencies and other governmental bodies (if we are legally obliged to do so).



We also may share aggregate or anonymous information with third parties, including advertisers and investors. For example, we may tell our advertisers the number of visitors our website receives or the most popular excursions or tours. This information does not contain any personal data and is used to develop content and services we hope you will find of interest.

You should also be aware that some product or tour suppliers and some of our affiliates and distributors may need additional personal data or other information (such as health or physical fitness information) to determine whether you can participate in an activity. You should read and rely upon the Privacy Policy of the relevant supplier, affiliate or distributor (and not Viator's Privacy Policy), if Viator does not collect this information from you directly.
