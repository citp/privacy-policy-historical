              program that allows other websites to earn money by directing people 
              (through links) to our website. If you sign up as an affiliate, 
              your contact information (website address and related information, 
              email address, mailing and payment addresses, and contact information) 
              is sent to a third party who activates your affiliate status and 
              pays you based on the sales you generate for Vitacost.com, Inc. 
              The third-party affiliate manager (LinkShare) has its own privacy 
              policy. http://www.linkshare.com/privacy.html</font>

          <p><font face="Verdana,Helvetica,Arial" size="2"><b>Our affiliates may have access to transaction-level data.</b> Our third-party affiliate program offers a feature that may allow a small number of selected affiliates to gain access to individual user transaction information that originates from links on their websites. These affiliates generally include, but are not limited to, rebate sites, member sites, charity fund-raising sites, school fund-raising sites, and association sites. To properly track and credit the customer's transaction, these sites may give each of their members a unique code, which will uniquely identify the member or the member's organization. This code is activated only when the customer links directly from the affiliate site to Vitacost.com, Inc. Any transactions made at Vitacost.com, Inc. while the code is active will be reported back to the affiliate. Vitacost.com, Inc. never passes on personal data as part of this feature. We will provide only the date of the transaction, the amount of the transaction, and the product purchased. To further protect the privacy of our customers, we require all affiliates requesting this feature to sign a statement promising to inform users beforehand of any such data collection, and to guarantee that any data collected will be used solely to reward users (or their selected charities) for their purchases. If you are concerned about having your purchase tracked in this manner, you may avoid it by visiting Vitacost.com, Inc. directly (without linking from an affiliate site). If the affiliate site has not made its tracking procedures clear to you, please notify us by e-mail at <a href="mailto:cs@vitacost.com">cs@vitacost.com</a>. </font></p>
