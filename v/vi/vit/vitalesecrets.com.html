		<p>OUR PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES FROM TIME TO TIME. PLEASE CHECK BACK FREQUENTLY</p>

	
		<p>We realize the sensitive nature of the information you provide to us. This Privacy Policy describes how Vitale Secrets ("Company" or "we") collects, uses and disseminates information about users ("you") of this website ("website" or "site") that we collect online. By using this website, you agree to accept the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not use this site. THE COMPANY RESERVES THE RIGHT TO UPDATE FROM TIME TO TIME, SO YOU SHOULD REVIEW THIS POLICY FREQUENTLY. Your use of this site following any changes means that you accept those changes. </p>

		<p><strong>COLLECTION AND USE OF INFORMATION</strong></p>
		<p>1.1 Survey Information. The Company collects information about you when you voluntarily complete a Company survey, order form, registration page or other online request form, (collectively, a "Survey"). In Surveys, the Company or third-party partners may ask you to provide personally identifiable information to the Company, which may include your name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, employment information, personal and online interests, and such other information as may be requested from time to time (together, "Survey Information"). You may receive incentives from the Company or third-party partners in exchange for providing Survey Information to the Company. If a login or password is generated, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login and password information. </p>
		<p>1.2 Third-Party Partner List Information. The Company may obtain information about you when if you provide information to a third-party partner, and the Company subsequently purchases, licenses, or otherwise acquires that information from the third-party partner ("Third-Party Partner Seller"). Such purchased information may include, but is not limited to, Survey information ("Third-Party Partner Survey Information"). Third-Party Partner Survey Information is included in Survey Information.</p>
		<p>1.3 Cookies, Web bugs, and Other Technology. The Company currently uses cookie and web beacon technology to associate certain Internet-related information about an individual with information about you with Survey Information in our database. This internet-related information includes but is not limited to your IP address, the date and time you access the site, the URL that you just came from, which URL you go to next, which browser you are using and which operating system you are using. Additionally, the Company may use other new and evolving sources of information in the future (together, "Technology Information"). As a result, Company strongly encourages you to revisit this policy for any updates regarding its use of technology. </p>
		<p class="lgMargL">(a) Cookies. A cookie is a small amount of data stored on the hard drive of your computer that allows the Company to associate your computer with your corresponding Survey Information that resides in Company's database. We may use cookie technology to improve your experience, remember your preferences, customize the content you see, or authenticate our access to your Survey Information. If you do not accept cookies and use our site, you may be unable to use all of the features and functionality of our site.</p>
		<p class="lgMargL">(b) Web bugs. A web bug, web beacon, or action tag is programming code that can be used to display an image on a web page, but can also be used to transfer your unique user identification (often in the form of a cookie) to a database and associate your information with previously acquired information about you in another database. The Company currently contracts with online partners to help manage and optimize its Internet business and communications. It uses the services of a marketing company to help us measure the effectiveness of its advertising and how you use our site. To do this, it uses web beacons and cookie provided by its marketing company on this site. The type of information it collects includes the frequency, duration, and pages viewed by you, and the time you spend on a page, your operating system, browser size, type, version and connection speed. By supplementing our record with this information, we learn about the pages that are most attractive to our visitors, which of our products most interest our customer, and what kinds of offers our customers like to see. Although the marketing company logs the information coming from its site on its behalf, the Company controls how that data may and may not be used. If you do not want to help the Company learn how to improve its site, product, offers and marketing strategy, you can "opt-out" of the website analysis tool by emailing <a href="mailto:privacy@vitalesecrets.com">privacy@vitalesecrets.com</a> We may also use web bugs in email messages or newsletters.1.4 Individual Information.
