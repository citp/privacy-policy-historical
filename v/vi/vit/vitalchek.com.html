<p><strong>4. Disclosure of Your Information</strong><br>

      </ul>
      <p>to process the information for us based on our instructions and  in compliance with this privacy policy and any other appropriate  confidentiality and security measures.</p>
      <p>We also may share your personal information with our affiliates  and with sponsors, joint venture partners and other non-affiliated third  parties, including entities for which we are acting as an agent, licensee or  publisher, that wish to send you information about their products and services  that may be of interest to you, as determined by your choices and  communications preferences.</p>

      <p>We  also may disclose your personal information: </p>

        <li>To (i) respond to or  comply with any law, regulation, subpoena, court order or other legal  obligation; (ii) detect, investigate and help prevent security threats, fraud  or other malicious activity; (iii) enforce and protect our rights and  properties; or (iv) protect the rights, property or safety of our users, employees  and others; and </li>
      </ul>
      <ul type="disc">

      </ul>
      <p>The  Service may let you post and share personal information, comments, materials  and other content. Any information you post or disclose publicly may be  collected and used by others, may be indexable by search engines, and might not  be able to be removed. Please be careful when disclosing personal information  in these public areas. </p>
      <p><strong>5. Children’s Privacy<br>
      </strong>We do not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13 or  target the Service to children under 13.</p>
<p><strong>6. Your Choices and Communications Preferences</strong><br>
  You can manage your communications preferences when you register with  the Service, by updating your account preferences, by using the “opt-out” or  unsubscribe mechanism or other means provided within the communications that  you receive, or by contacting us. We reserve the right to notify you of changes  or updates to the Service whenever necessary.</p>
<p><strong>7. Access to and Accuracy of Your Information</strong><br>
  The Service may allow registered users to directly access the  account information they provided and make corrections or updates to that  information upon login at any time. The accuracy of such information is solely  the responsibility of the user.</p>
<p>You may also request access to and correction of other personal  information about you that you have directly provided to us through the  Service. You may also request to review, delete and correct any of that  personal information which is stored and readily accessible for such review  and/or correction, subject to the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.lexisnexis.com/privacy">LexisNexis  consumer choice policies</a>&nbsp;and applicable law. For instance, information you provide  for making a payment to a government agency or requesting a vital record may be  transmitted to the appropriate government agency in real time rather than being  stored, and therefore not readily accessible for review or correction. </p>
<p>To protect your privacy and security, we may require you to verify  your identity. The personal information you directly provide us for the  purposes of verifying your identity is typically not stored, but transmitted to  the appropriate government agency directly to process your request, and  therefore not readily accessible for review or correction. We will respond to  your access or deletion request within a reasonable timeframe.</p>
<p>If you request to deactivate your account or delete your personal  information, we will endeavor to fulfill your request in accordance with our  policies but some personal information may persist in backup copies for a  certain period of time and may be retained as necessary for legitimate business  purposes or to comply with our legal obligations.</p>
<p>Access to or correction of personal information that LexisNexis  may gather from public records and other sources is subject to applicable laws  and our&nbsp;<a href="http://www.lexisnexis.com/privacy/for-consumers">consumer choice policies</a>.</p>
<p><strong>8. Data Security</strong><br>
  We use a variety of generally accepted administrative, physical and  technical security measures intended to safeguard your personal information.  When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our  order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure  socket layer technology (SSL) or an industry equivalent.Â&nbsp; If you have any questions  about the security of your personal information, you can contact us at vcn_helpdesk@vitalchek.com.  &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>9. Cross-Border Transfer of Personal  Information</strong><br>
  Only as necessary to process your request or facilitate other purposes  described in this privacy policy, your personal information may be transferred  to and stored and processed in countries outside of your country of residence,  which may have different personal data protection rules than in your country.  By using the Service you consent to the transfer, storage and processing of  your personal information to and within facilities located in the United States  and other countries.</p>
<p><strong>10.</strong><strong>Changes</strong><br>
  We may change this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes  will be posted on this page with an updated revision date.Â&nbsp; If we make  any material changes we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address  specified in your account) or by means of a notice on this website prior to the  change becoming effective. We encourage you to periodically review this page  for the latest information on our privacy practices. </p>
