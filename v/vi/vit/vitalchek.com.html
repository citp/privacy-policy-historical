        <a name="children" id="children"></a><strong>5. Children's Privacy</strong><br>

<p>
  <a name="choice" id="choice"></a><strong>6. Your Communications Preferences</strong><br>
        You can manage your communications preferences when you  register with the Service by updating your account preferences by using the  "opt-out" or unsubscribe mechanism or other means provided within the  communications that you receive or by contacting us.

   </p>
<p>
  <a name="access" id="access"></a><strong>7. Access to and Accuracy of Your  Personal Information</strong><br>
      The Service may allow registered users to directly access  their account information and make corrections or updates upon login at any  time. The accuracy of such information is solely the responsibility of the  user.</p>
<p>You also may request access to other personal information  about you that you have provided to us through the Service. You may also  request to review, delete and correct any of that personal information which is  stored and readily accessible for such review and/or correction, subject to the <a href="http://www.lexisnexis.com/privacy">LexisNexis  consumer choice policies</a> and applicable  law. For instance, information you provide for making a payment to a government  agency or requesting a vital record may be transmitted to the appropriate  government agency in real time rather than being stored, and therefore not  readily accessible for review or correction. We will respond to your access or  deletion request within a reasonable timeframe.</p>
<p>To protect your privacy and security, we may require you to  verify your identity. The personal information you directly provide us for the  purposes of verifying your identity is typically not stored, but transmitted to  the appropriate government agency directly to process your request, and  therefore not readily accessible for review or correction. <br>
        We will retain your information for as long as your account  is active or as needed to provide you services. We will retain and use your  information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve  disputes, and enforce our agreements and for other legitimate business purposes.<br>

<p>
  <a name="security" id="security"></a><strong>8. Data Security</strong><br>
        We use a variety of generally accepted administrative,  physical and technical security measures intended to safeguard your personal  information. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card  number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information  using secure socket layer technology (SSL).<br>

<p>
  <a name="change" id="change"></a><a name="cross" id="cross"></a><strong>9. Cross-Border  Transfer</strong><br>
      Only as necessary to process your request or facilitate  other purposes described in this privacy policy, your personal information may  be transferred to and stored and processed in countries outside of your country  of residence, which may have different personal data protection rules than in  your country. By using the Service you consent to the transfer, storage and  processing of your personal information to and within facilities located in the  United States and other countries.<br>
