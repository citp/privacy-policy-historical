The operator’s contact details can be found in the website’s required legal notice.</p><p><strong>How do we collect your data?</strong></p><p>Some data are collected when you provide it to us. This could, for example, be data you enter on a contact form.</p><p>Other data are collected automatically by our IT systems when you visit the website. These data are primarily technical data such as the browser and operating system you are using or when you accessed the page. These data are collected automatically as soon as you enter our website.</p><p><strong>What do we use your data for?</strong></p><p>Part of the data is collected to ensure the proper functioning of the website. Other data can be used to analyze how visitors use the site.</p><p><strong>What rights do you have regarding your data?</strong></p><p>You always have the right to request information about your stored data, its origin, its recipients, and the purpose of its collection at no charge. You also have the right to request that it be corrected, blocked, or deleted. You can contact us at any time using the address given in the legal notice if you have further questions about the issue of privacy and data protection. You may also, of course, file a complaint with the competent regulatory authorities.</p><h3>Analytics and third-party tools</h3><p>When visiting our website, statistical analyses may be made of your surfing behavior. This happens primarily using cookies and analytics. The analysis of your surfing behavior is usually anonymous, i.e. we will not be able to identify you from this data. You can object to this analysis or prevent it by not using certain tools. Detailed information can be found in the following privacy policy.</p><p>You can object to this analysis. We will inform you below about how to exercise your options in this regard.</p><h2>2. General information and mandatory information</h2><h3>Data protection</h3><p>The operators of this website take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We treat your personal data as confidential and in accordance with the statutory data protection regulations and this privacy policy.</p><p>If you use this website, various pieces of personal data will be collected. Personal information is any data with which you could be personally identified. This privacy policy explains what information we collect and what we use it for. It also explains how and for what purpose this happens.</p><p>Please note that data transmitted via the internet (e.g. via email communication) may be subject to security breaches. Complete protection of your data from third-party access is not possible.</p><h3>Notice concerning the party responsible for this website</h3><p>The party responsible for processing data on this website is:</p><p>Till Brehm<br> Im Dorfe 10<br> 21400 Reinstorf</p><p>Telephone: +49-4137-8139751<br> Email: info@vitux.com</p><p>The responsible party is the natural or legal person who alone or jointly with others decides on the purposes and means of processing personal data (names, email addresses, etc.).</p><h3>Revocation of your consent to the processing of your data</h3><p>Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You may revoke your consent at any time with future effect. An informal email making this request is sufficient. The data processed before we receive your request may still be legally processed.</p><h3>Right to file complaints with regulatory authorities</h3><p>If there has been a breach of data protection legislation, the person affected may file a complaint with the competent regulatory authorities. The competent regulatory authority for matters related to data protection legislation is the data protection officer of the German state in which our company is headquartered. A list of data protection officers and their contact details can be found at the following link: <a href="https://www.bfdi.bund.de/DE/Infothek/Anschriften_Links/anschriften_links-node.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.bfdi.bund.de/DE/Infothek/Anschriften_Links/anschriften_links-node.html</a>.</p><h3>SSL or TLS encryption</h3><p>This site uses SSL or TLS encryption for security reasons and for the protection of the transmission of confidential content, such as the inquiries you send to us as the site operator. You can recognize an encrypted connection in your browser’s address line when it changes from “http://” to “https://” and the lock icon is displayed in your browser’s address bar.</p><p>If SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transfer to us cannot be read by third parties.</p><h3>Information, blocking, deletion</h3><p>As permitted by law, you have the right to be provided at any time with information free of charge about any of your personal data that is stored as well as its origin, the recipient and the purpose for which it has been processed. You also have the right to have this data corrected, blocked or deleted. You can contact us at any time using the address given in our legal notice if you have further questions on the topic of personal data.</p><h2>3. Data collection on our website</h2><h3>Cookies</h3><p>Some of our web pages use cookies. Cookies do not harm your computer and do not contain any viruses. Cookies help make our website more user-friendly, efficient, and secure. Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer and saved by your browser.</p><p>Most of the cookies we use are so-called “session cookies.” They are automatically deleted after your visit. Other cookies remain in your device’s memory until you delete them. These cookies make it possible to recognize your browser when you next visit the site.</p><p>You can configure your browser to inform you about the use of cookies so that you can decide on a case-by-case basis whether to accept or reject a cookie. Alternatively, your browser can be configured to automatically accept cookies under certain conditions or to always reject them, or to automatically delete cookies when closing your browser. Disabling cookies may limit the functionality of this website.</p><p>Cookies which are necessary to allow electronic communications or to provide certain functions you wish to use (such as the shopping cart) are stored pursuant to Art. 6 paragraph 1, letter f of DSGVO. The website operator has a legitimate interest in the storage of cookies to ensure an optimized service provided free of technical errors. If other cookies (such as those used to analyze your surfing behavior) are also stored, they will be treated separately in this privacy policy.</p><h3>Server log files</h3><p>The website provider automatically collects and stores information that your browser automatically transmits to us in “server log files”. These are:</p><ul><li>Browser type and browser version</li><li>Operating system used</li><li>Referrer URL</li><li>Host name of the accessing computer</li><li>Time of the server request</li><li>IP address</li></ul><p>These data will not be combined with data from other sources.</p><p>The basis for data processing is Art. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO, which allows the processing of data to fulfill a contract or for measures preliminary to a contract.</p><h3>Leaving comments on this website</h3><p>If you use the comment function on this site, the time at which you created the comment and your email address will be stored along with your comment, as well as your username, unless you are posting anonymously.</p><p><strong>Storage of the IP address</strong></p><p>Our comment function stores the IP addresses of those users who post comments. Since we do not check comments on our site before they go live, we need this information to be able to pursue action for illegal or slanderous content.</p><p><strong>How long comments are stored</strong></p><p>The comments and the associated data (e.g. IP address) are stored and remain on our website until the content commented upon has been completely deleted or the comments are required to be removed for legal reasons (slander, etc.).</p><p><strong>Legal basis</strong></p><p>The comments are stored based on your consent per Art. 6 (1) (a) DSGVO. You may revoke your consent at any time with future effect. An informal email making this request is sufficient. The data processed before we receive your request may still be legally processed.</p><h2>4. Analytics and advertising</h2><h3>Google Analytics</h3><p>This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service. It is operated by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.</p><p>Google Analytics uses so-called “cookies”. These are text files that are stored on your computer and that allow an analysis of the use of the website by you. The information generated by the cookie about your use of this website is usually transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there.</p><p>Google Analytics cookies are stored based on Art. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO. The website operator has a legitimate interest in analyzing user behavior to optimize both its website and its advertising.</p><p><strong>IP anonymization</strong></p><p>We have activated the IP anonymization feature on this website. Your IP address will be shortened by Google within the European Union or other parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area prior to transmission to the United States. Only in exceptional cases is the full IP address sent to a Google server in the US and shortened there. Google will use this information on behalf of the operator of this website to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on website activity, and to provide other services regarding website activity and Internet usage for the website operator. The IP address transmitted by your browser as part of Google Analytics will not be merged with any other data held by Google.</p><p><strong>Browser plugin</strong></p><p>You can prevent these cookies being stored by selecting the appropriate settings in your browser. However, we wish to point out that doing so may mean you will not be able to enjoy the full functionality of this website. You can also prevent the data generated by cookies about your use of the website (incl. your IP address) from being passed to Google, and the processing of these data by Google, by downloading and installing the browser plugin available at the following link: <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en</a>.</p><p><strong>Objecting to the collection of data</strong></p><p>You can prevent the collection of your data by Google Analytics by clicking on the following link. An opt-out cookie will be set to prevent your data from being collected on future visits to this site: [hoops name=”disable-ga”].</p><p>For more information about how Google Analytics handles user data, see Google’s privacy policy: <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=en</a>.</p><h2>5. Plugins and tools</h2><h3>Google Web Fonts</h3><p>For uniform representation of fonts, this page uses web fonts provided by Google. When you open a page, your browser loads the required web fonts into your browser cache to display texts and fonts correctly.</p><p>For this purpose your browser has to establish a direct connection to Google servers. Google thus becomes aware that our web page was accessed via your IP address. The use of Google Web fonts is done in the interest of a uniform and attractive presentation of our website. This constitutes a justified interest pursuant to Art. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO.</p><p>If your browser does not support web fonts, a standard font is used by your computer.</p><p>Further information about handling user data, can be found at <a href="https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq</a> and in Google’s privacy policy at <a
