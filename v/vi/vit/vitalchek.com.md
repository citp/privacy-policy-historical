**5\. Children's Privacy**  
We do not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13 or target our Web sites to children under 13.  


**6\. Your Communications Preferences**  
You can manage your communications preferences when you register with the Service by updating your account preferences by using the "opt-out" or unsubscribe mechanism or other means provided within the communications that you receive or by contacting us. We reserve the right to notify you of changes or updates to the Service whenever necessary.  


**7\. Access to and Accuracy of Your Personal Information**  
The Service may allow registered users to directly access their account information and make corrections or updates upon login at any time. The accuracy of such information is solely the responsibility of the user.

You also may request access to other personal information about you that you have provided to us through the Service. You may also request to review, delete and correct any of that personal information which is stored and readily accessible for such review and/or correction, subject to the [LexisNexis consumer choice policies](http://www.lexisnexis.com/privacy) and applicable law. For instance, information you provide for making a payment to a government agency or requesting a vital record may be transmitted to the appropriate government agency in real time rather than being stored, and therefore not readily accessible for review or correction. We will respond to your access or deletion request within a reasonable timeframe.

To protect your privacy and security, we may require you to verify your identity. The personal information you directly provide us for the purposes of verifying your identity is typically not stored, but transmitted to the appropriate government agency directly to process your request, and therefore not readily accessible for review or correction.   
We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements and for other legitimate business purposes.  


**8\. Data Security**  
We use a variety of generally accepted administrative, physical and technical security measures intended to safeguard your personal information. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).  


**9\. Cross-Border Transfer**  
Only as necessary to process your request or facilitate other purposes described in this privacy policy, your personal information may be transferred to and stored and processed in countries outside of your country of residence, which may have different personal data protection rules than in your country.
