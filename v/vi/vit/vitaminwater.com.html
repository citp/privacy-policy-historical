glacéau("Company") knows that privacy is important to you. We want you to know
that we are looking out for you, our customer. We don't solicit from or
knowingly gather information on anyone under the age of 13. Other information
about how we gather and share data collected through this website is noted
below. <br>
<br>
Company has created this privacy statement (this "Privacy Statement")
in order to demonstrate its firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses
Company's information gathering, use and dissemination practices for the
information collected through the site from which you are accessing this
Privacy Statement (the "Site"). <br>
This Site is controlled and operated by Company from the United States, and is
not intended to subject Company to the laws or jurisdiction of any state,
country or territory other than that of the United States. <br>
<br>
Other U.S. sites or, from time to time, certain activities on U.S. sites might
be governed by different privacy practices from those set forth below. We
encourage you to check the privacy practices of each U.S. site that you visit.
This Privacy Statement does not govern our collection of information through
any web site, or by any other means, other than through the Site; nor does this
Privacy Statement govern the collection of information by third parties. <br>
<br>
<b>I. COMPANY'S COLLECTION OF INFORMATION </b><br>
<br>
We gather two basic types of information through the Site: "Personally
Identifiable Information" (or "PII") and "Non-Personally
Identifiable Information" (or "Non-PII"). Personally
Identifiable Information is information that identifies you as an individual.
Non-Personally Identifiable Information is aggregated information, demographic
information, IP Address and any other information that does not reveal specific
identifying information about you.<br>
<br>
<b>A. Personally Identifiable Information</b><br>
We collect PII from you when you provide it to us while on the Site, such as:
your name, screen name, address, telephone numbers, email address, account and
credit card numbers when you set up an account, redeem an award, sign up for
newsletters, contact customer service, or otherwise interact with this Site.
Further, we may operate sweepstakes, contests and other promotions
(collectively, "Promotions") through the Site, and may conduct
surveys or polls through the Site or ask for your responses to questionnaires
that we make available through the Site (these surveys, polls and
questionnaires, collectively, "Surveys"). We typically ask you for
certain PII when you enter and, if applicable, win a Promotion, and when you
participate in a Survey.<br>
<br>
</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:normal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">We may share your personally
identifiable information with our parent company, The Coca-Cola Company, or
affiliated entities ("Affiliated Entities") for purposes of sending
you information about the programs of The Coca-Cola Company or our Affiliated
Entities and, occasionally, sending you advertising/promotional material from
some of their advertising and strategic partners.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
color:#333333"><br>
The PII you provide to this Site may be combined with information you provide
to Company on other U.S. sites, with demographic and other information that is
publicly available, or with other information about you that Company may
otherwise obtain online or offline. <br>
<br>
<b>B. Non-Personally Identifiable Information</b><br>
When you visit and interact with the Site, Company and third parties with whom Company
has contracted to provide services to Company may collect Non-PII (for example,
a catalog of the Site pages you visit). Non-PII is generally collected from
cookies, referrers, IP addresses, environmental variables, pixel tags and
similar technologies and information you voluntarily provide.<br>
<br>
a. <u>Cookies</u>. Company and our service providers may use encrypted or
non-encrypted cookies in connection with this Site. Cookies are pieces of
information that a web site places in a file on your computer associated with
your browser that may be used to deliver content specific to your interests and
for other purposes, such as security and other account administrative
functions, and which may track PII. This information is processed passively by
your browser as you surf through this Site. Cookies do not cause damage to your
computer systems or files. If you do not want information collected through the
use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to
automatically decline cookies, or to be given the choice of declining or
accepting the transfer of a particular cookie, or cookies from a particular web
site, to your computer. For example, cookies allow you to easily log into the
Site by remembering your email address. <br>
<br>
b. <u>Referrers; IP Addresses; Environmental Variables</u>. Company and our
service providers may also collect "referrers" information, IP
addresses and various environmental variables. <br>
</span></p><ul>
<li>A "referrer" is information the Web browser passes along to our web
servers that references the URL from which you came.</li>
<li>The "IP address" is a number used by computers on the network to
identify your computer so that data can be transmitted to you.</li>
<li>"Environmental variables" include, among other things, the domain
from which you access the Internet, the time you accessed this Site, type of
Web browser and operating system or platform used, the Internet address of the
web site you left to visit this Site, the names of the pages you visit while at
this site, and the Internet address of the web site you then visit.</li>
</ul>

<br>
c. <u>Pixel Tags</u>. Company and our service providers may also use so-called
"pixel tags," "web beacons," "clear GIFs" or
similar means (collectively, "Pixel Tags") in connection with some
Site pages and HTML-formatted email messages to, among other things, compile
aggregate statistics about Site usage, response rates and the effectiveness of
advertising campaigns. A Pixel Tag is an electronic image, often a single pixel
(1x1), that is ordinarily not visible to Site visitors and may be associated
with cookies on the visitors hard drives. Pixel Tags allow us to count users
who have visited certain pages of the Site, to deliver branded services, and to
help determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns. When
used in HTML-formatted email messages, Pixel Tags can tell the sender whether
and when the email has been opened. <br>
<br>
d. <u>Information You Voluntarily Provide</u>. We may also collect demographic
data, such as your date of birth, gender and zip code. When such data is not
combined with any PII, such information is considered to be Non-PII, as it does
not personally identify you or any other user. Additionally, we may aggregate
PII in a manner such that the end-product does not personally identify you or
any other user of the Site, for example, by using PII to display content
according to your zip code. Such aggregate information is considered Non-PII
for purposes of this Privacy Statement. <br>
This Site is not directed to individuals under the age of thirteen (13), and we
request that such individuals not provide PII through this Site. <br>
<br>
<b>II. COMPANY'S USE OF INFORMATION</b><br>
<br>
<b>A. Personally Identifiable Information</b><br>
PII is used by us to respond to your requests, to process your transactions, for
administrative purposes, and to process rewards and prizes. We may also use PII
for internal business purposes, such as analyzing and managing our businesses,
for example, to study the effectiveness of advertising campaigns, improving our
website or our products, to tailor the Site experience and content based on
your past activities on the Site, and to gauge customer satisfaction. In
addition, we may also use PII to send you information about Company's programs,
to send invitations to you to participate in special programs, to re-contact
you if we have not heard from you in a while and, occasionally, to send you
advertising/promotional material from some of our affiliates, advertising and
strategic partners. You may opt-out from receiving certain future electronic
marketing communications (see the "Opt-Out/Choice" section below). <br>
<br>
In addition to the uses listed above, we reserve the right to use PII that we
collect in connection with Promotions and Surveys for the purpose for which it
is provided (e.g., to permit you to participate in the applicable Promotion)
and otherwise in accordance with the rules (if any) applicable to a Promotion
or Survey. You should carefully review the rules, if any, of each Promotion and
Survey in which you participate through the Site, as they may contain
additional important information about Company's use of PII about you. To the
extent that the terms and conditions of the rules concerning the treatment of
PII about you conflict with this Policy, the terms and conditions of the rules
shall control.<br>
<br>
<b>B. Non-Personally Identifiable Information</b><br>
Because Non-PII does not personally identify you, we may use such information
for any purpose. For example, we may use this information for Company's
internal use such as to enhance web site security, to detect broad demographic
trends, to assist The Coca Cola Company in providing content tailored to your
interests, and to otherwise enhance your experience on this Site. This
information may also be shared with third parties on an aggregate and
non-personally identifiable basis. Please note we may link Non-PII to PII about
you that we have previously collected. Such combined information will be
treated as PII as long as it is so combined. <br>
<br>
<b>III. DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES</b><br>
<br>
<b>A. Affiliated Entities </b><p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">We
may share any information, including personally identifiable information that
you provide on the Site, with our parent, The Coca-Cola Company and affiliates
for the purposes described in Section I(A).</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal"><b><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
color:#333333">B. Strategic Partners</span></b><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;color:#333333"><br>
From time to time, we may enter into a special relationship with another
company that is not owned by or affiliated with Company. We may share your
name, email address and zip code with such third-party strategic partners;
however, we will provide you with the opportunity to either opt into or opt out
of such sharing when you set up an account and when you log in after we add a
new strategic partner. Because these third parties will use your PII in
accordance with their own privacy practices, you should check their web sites
for information regarding their privacy practices. <br>
<br>
<b>C. Service Providers</b><br>
We may use third party service providers to help us operate our business and
this Site or administer activities on our behalf, such as financial
institutions or credit card companies to authorize and process credit card
transactions, and other companies for email delivery, order fulfillment and
delivery, customer service and sweepstakes administration, among other
services. We may share your PII with these third parties for those limited
purposes. For instance, if you participate in a sweepstakes, game, or loyalty
program resulting in a prize or reward, we will share your PII with our games
management and merchandise fulfillment agencies. <br>
<br>
<b>D. Promotions and Surveys</b><br>
We reserve the right to share PII that we collect in connection with Promotions
and Surveys with third-party sponsors or facilitators of these Promotions and
Surveys (irrespective of whether the Promotions and Surveys are hosted by us),
or otherwise in accordance with the rules applicable to a Promotion or Survey.
You should carefully review the rules, if any, of each Promotion and Survey in
which you participate through the Site, as they may contain additional
important information about Company's, a sponsor's or other third parties use
of PII about you. To the extent that the terms and conditions of the rules
concerning the treatment of PII about you conflict with this Policy, the terms
and conditions of the rules shall control.<br>
<br>
<b>E. Forums</b><br>
We may make available through the Site services (for example, message boards,
forums, comment functionality and chat functionality, among other services) to
which you are able to post information and materials. Please note that any
information you disclose through these services becomes public information, and
may be available to visitors to the Site and to the general public. In
addition, when you choose to make a posting on these services, certain
information (for example, your screen name and your location); will be available
for other users to view. We urge you to exercise discretion and caution when
deciding to disclose PII, or any other information, on the Site. WE ARE NOT
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE USE OF ANY PII YOU VOLUNTARILY DISCLOSE THROUGH THE SITE.<br>

<br>
<b>IV. LINKS AND THIRD PARTIES' PRIVACY PRACTICES</b><br>
<br>
This Site may contain links to other sites which are not operated by Company. COMPANY
IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PRIVACY PRACTICES OR THE CONTENT OF SUCH OTHER WEB
SITES. Company recommends that you review the privacy policy of third party web
sites arrived at from links on this Site. PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS POLICY DOES NOT
ADDRESS THE PRIVACY OR INFORMATION PRACTICES OF ANY THIRD PARTIES. <br>
<br>
<b>V. SECURITY</b><br>
<br>
This Site has security measures in place to help protect against the loss,
misuse and alteration of the PII under its control. Company employs security
measures consistent with standard industry practice to help protect against
public access to personal and account activity information collected on and
used by Company at this Site. For instance, all access to our databases that
contain PII is logged for security purposes and access is limited to individuals
with a business need to have access. Certain specific activities (i.e., during
registration, while editing your demographic profile, and when requesting
password help) are protected using a secure communications encryption
technology called SSL. SSL (stands for Secure Sockets Layer) is a method for
hiding information to prevent others from intercepting and reading the data
sent between the client (your computer) and the server (this Site). All PII and
account activity are also protected through the use of user names and
passwords. In order to help maintain the security of your information, you
should protect the confidentiality of your user name and password.
Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or data storage system
can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, although we strive to protect
your PII, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you
transmit to us through or in connection with this Site or that is stored by us.
You acknowledge and agree that any information you transmit through the Site is
so transmitted at your own risk. If you have reason to believe that your
interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the
security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), you must
immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us in accordance with
Contacting Company, below (note that physical mail notification will delay the
time it takes for us to respond to the problem). <br>
<br>
<b>VI. ADVERTISING-RELATED VENDORS</b><br>
<br>
Please note that our online and email advertising-related vendors may use
cookies and Pixel Tags in connection with the Site to help manage our online
and email advertising campaigns and strengthen the effectiveness of such
campaigns. For example, if a vendor has placed a unique cookie on your
computer, the vendor may use Pixel Tags to recognize the cookie during your
visit to the Site and to learn which online advertisements of Company may have
brought you to our Site, and the vendor may provide us with such non-PII for
our use. Please note we may link such non-PII provided to us by our vendors to
PII about you that we have previously collected. Such combined information will
be treated as PII hereunder as long as it is so combined. <br>
<br>
<b>VII. OTHER INFORMATION</b><br>
<br>
Company does not represent or warrant that this Site or any part thereof is
appropriate or available for use in any particular jurisdiction other than the
United States. Those who choose to access this Site do so on their own
initiative and at their own risk, and are responsible for complying with all
local laws, rules and regulations. You are also subject to United States export
controls in connection with your use of this Site and/or Site -related
services, and are responsible for any violations of such controls, including
without limitation any United States embargoes or other federal rules and
regulations restricting exports. We may limit this Site's availability, in
whole or in part, to any person, geographic area or jurisdiction we choose, at
any time and in our sole discretion. <br>
