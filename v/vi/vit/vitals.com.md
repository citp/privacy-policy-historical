# Vitals - Privacy Policy.

Vitals recognizes that Your privacy and the protection of Your Personal Information is important to you, and therefore, has adopted this VitalsSM privacy policy. This VitalsSM privacy policy describes our privacy practices and how we treat the Personal Information that we collect from You when You use products and services of Vitals, including any Personal Information we collected from You when You created Your VitalsSM account. The VitalsSM privacy policy applies to all of the products, services, and websites offered by Vitals or our related, affiliated and/or subsidiary companies (collectively, the "Products and Services"). 

For the purposes of this VitalsSM privacy policy, "Personal Information" is information that (i) You provide to Vitals and (ii) personally identifies You. Such information includes your name, email or other address, billing information or other data that can be reasonably linked by Vitals to personally identify You. The Personal information may also include "Sensitive Personal Information." The Sensitive Personal Information is Personal Information that (i) is related to confidential medical information, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs and/or sexuality, and (ii) Vitals has actual knowledge thereof. 

To protect Your privacy, Vitals does not associate Your website navigation activities to given Healthcare Providers and/or medical conditions, and excludes from the Personal Information certain information that otherwise would be Personal Information. This "Excluded Information" is information that (i) is obtained via Your queries, searches or other interaction with Vitals, and (ii) relates to Healthcare Providers and/or medical conditions. The Excluded Information, however, may be used for the purpose of generating "Aggregated Non-Personal Information," as described below.
