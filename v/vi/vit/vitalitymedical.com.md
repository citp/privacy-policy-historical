# Privacy Policy

Vitality Medical recognizes and respects the importance of customers' privacy and security. To guarantee our customers a safe and confidential shopping experience, Vitality Medical uses McAfee Secure to safeguard their personal information. More specifically, McAfee Secure actively employs Secure Sockets Layer, SSL, technology on the credit card and personal information pages of our website. SSL technology functions by managing server and client authentication, and encrypting both server and client communication. This means that McAfee Secure encrypts your credit card information and keeps it safe by routing payment only to Vitality Medical. Your credit card information is never stored or visible to Vitality Medical when you purchase online. Due to this safety feature, each time you place an order online, you will need to provide your credit card information.

To check or verify the security of your connection, please click on the McAfee Secure logo found at the lower right-hand side of our home page. By clicking on McAfee's logo, it will take you to their website and instantly detect malware, phishing and SSL activation. If McAfee Secure detects "no malware or malicious links found," "no phishing detected," and "valid SSL certificate detected," that means your connection is secure and you can place your order online without worry or apprehension. To further ensure a secure connection, when you access the "checkout" page (where sensitive information is entered), you will notice the first characters of the URL, uniform resource locator (web address), will change from "http" to "https." The change in the address denotes a secure IP address.

Some browsers and firewalls do not permit communication through secure servers. If you access Vitality Medical through an insecure connection you will not be able to place an order online. If you cannot access our shopping cart, please print out our order form and place your order by phone at 1-800-397-5899.

### How does Vitality Medical use my information?

When you make a purchase from Vitality Medical, we use the information you provide to us (name, address, phone, etc.) to process your order. We do not share or sell this information to third parties. All information is considered private and confidential, and is only used to help us better serve you and improve your shopping experience while online with Vitality Medical. All credit card numbers are routed through McAfee Secure and are never visible to Vitality Medical for online purchases.

### Use of Cookies:

Vitality Medical uses a browser feature known as a cookie. A cookie is a simple file that stores your personalized information on your hard drive so you don't have to re-enter it a second time when revisiting our website. Cookies help to improve and personalize your shopping experience by increasing our web pages responsiveness and decreasing time between downloading as you browse or surf through our website.

### About Credit Card Transactions

**_Can I safely transmit information such as credit card numbers?_**

You can enter your credit card number on a secure (https) form and transmit the form over the Internet to a secure server without risk of an intermediary obtaining your credit card information. The security features offered by your web browser technology protects commercial transactions, as well as all other communications, from misappropriation and fraud that could otherwise occur as information passes through the internet.

Furthermore, with SSL implemented on both the client and server, your internet communications are transmitted in an encrypted form. Information you send can be trusted to arrive privately and unaltered to the server you specify (and no other).

SSL uses authentication and encryption technology. For example, your browsers export implementation of SSL (U.S. government approved) uses a high-grade, 128-bit key size. The encryption established between you and a server remains valid over multiple connections, yet the effort expended to defeat the encryption of one message cannot be leveraged to defeat the next message.

Your browser and secure servers deliver server authentication using signed digital certificates issued by trusted third parties known as certificate authorities, via McAfee Secure. A digital certificate verifies the connection between a server's public key and the server's identification (just as a driver's license verifies the connection between your photograph and your personal identification.) Cryptographic checks, using digital signatures, ensure that information within a certificate can be trusted.

If you have any questions concerning our privacy and security policy, we can be reached by email at [**question@vitalitymedical.com**](mailto:question@vitalitymedical.com) or by telephone at: 1-800-397-5899 (outside USA 801-733-4449 or 801-733-5758).
