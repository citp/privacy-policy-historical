# VitalSource Technologies, Inc. - Privacy

Protecting your privacy is important to us. The following statement will help you understand how VitalSource Technologies, Inc. collects, uses, and safeguards the personal information you provide on any of our web sites.

## Information Collection 

When you browse any VitalSource web site, you do not do so anonymously. Personal information is collected. Your IP address (the Internet address of your computer) and domain are logged to give us an idea of which parts of our web site you are visiting and how long you are spending there. We do not link your IP address to anything personally identifiable. The only other information automatically provided to us is the type of computer and operating system you are using. This information is supplied to us by your browser.

When you log-in to any service or forum run or offered by VitalSource, you may have to identify yourself to use that service. When you registered for that service we asked for information such as your name, email address, birth date, gender, zip code, occupation, industry, and personal interests. For some financial products and services we may also ask for other information. Once you register with VitalSource and sign in to our services, you are no longer anonymous to us.

##  Information Use

The information may be used to improve the content of our overall Internet site. If you provide us with your email address, or have done so in the past, we may upon occasion send you email. For example, we may use information you have given us to provide a service, measure consumer interest in our various services, or inform you about new products and services. These offers may be based on information you provided in your initial transaction with us, in surveys, or from information that may indicate purchasing preferences and lifestyle.

You should be aware that when you are on any VitalSource site, you may be directed to other sites operated by our customers or other third-party providers that are beyond our control. Some of these sites will have their own separate membership process and privacy policies. VitalSource Technologies, Inc. does not control sites that are operated by others and cannot be responsible for the information practices of these sites, but it is your responsibility to be aware of where you are on the web. It is always a good idea to check the privacy policy and terms of use of any site before offering any of your personal information.

##  Security

VitalSource Technologies, Inc. will use diligent efforts to protect the security and integrity of the information you provide to us once it is received on our systems. Unfortunately, when you submit information about yourself over the Internet, the information may travel over many systems that are not under the control of Vital Source Technologies, Inc. The Internet is not 100 percent secure, and others may intercept the information that you are sending.

##  Your Acceptance of These Terms

By using this site, you signify your assent to the VitalSource Technologies, Inc. Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this policy, do not use our site. We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions from this policy at any time. Please check this page periodically for changes. Your continued use of the Vital Source site following the posting of changes to these terms means you accept these changes.
