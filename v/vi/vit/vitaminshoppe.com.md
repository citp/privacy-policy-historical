When you use the Online Services, you may be asked to provide certain personal information. For example, if you subscribe to a mailing list; live chat with us, search for a local store near you, participate in special offers, sweepstakes or other promotions; join our loyalty program; send questions or comments to us via email; post User Content on the Online Services, our Facebook page or other social media sites; purchase products via the Online Services; or otherwise submit information to us through our Online Services, we will collect personal information which may be used to fulfill your order and for other purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy. 

In order to use some features provided through the Online Services, you may submit personal information about other individuals. For example, emailing an article from the Online Services or providing product information to a friend requires an email address, and completing a purchase sent directly to a friend requires a name and address. The Vitamin Shoppe will use and store this information for such purposes as to fulfill your request or order, marketing, and other purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy. 

**Information We Obtain from Job Applicants**   
In connection with a job inquiry or application on our careers pages, you may provide login credentials; information regarding your work authorization status and citizenship, education history, employment history and professional designations; and other information about your qualifications and work-related skills. We also may obtain information regarding your political contributions, and government-issued identification numbers. In addition, where legally permissible, you may provide information regarding your gender, race and ethnicity, and your veteran and disability status. 

By submitting job application to us online, you are sending your personal data to the United States, where the data will be subject to the protections afforded under United States, which may be different from the laws in your country and may be considered not sufficient in your country. If you do not agree that your job application be governed under the laws of United States, we cannot accept your application. 

**Information We Obtain from Social Media and Other Third Parties**  
If you register for an account with or otherwise use the Online Services through Facebook Connect or another social media website or mobile app, or use the third-party social media features through the Online Services (such as apps, tools, payment services, widgets and plug-ins) we also may receive certain personal information from these social media platforms, such as social media handles, content and other data provided. 

We may collect or purchase demographic information (such as gender or age) or information about your interests and preferences from third parties. If we link any demographic or preferences information to the personal information you provide us, we will treat such linked information as personal information under this Privacy Policy. 

**Information We Obtain by Automated Means**  
Online Activity Information. We may collect your IP address, Internet service provider, browser type and language, referring and exit pages and URLs, date and time, amount of time spent on particular pages and sections of the Online Services, number of links you click while using the Online Services, search terms, operating system, website traffic and related statistics, keywords and other data about your device and use of our Online Services.

In order to provide certain Online Services, we may, with your consent, collect information about precise geolocation from your mobile device, wireless carrier or third-party service providers. Your mobile device also may permit you to turn off the location services. Please note that if you decline to allow the Online Services to collect your precise geolocation, you may not be able to use all of the Online Services’ features or the offers available through the Online Services. 

Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies. When you use the Online Services, cookies or other tracking technologies may be placed on your devices. A “cookie” is a small amount of information that a web server sends to your device to uniquely identify your browser. We may use cookies to collect information about your account, preferences and use of the Online Services. Cookies allow us to recognize you when you return to use the Online Services and track and target your interests in order to provide a customized experience. They also help us to detect certain kinds of fraud. We use cookies to store preferences; record session information; record user-specific information on what pages are accessed or visited; alert you to new areas and features of the Online Services; customize web page content, services and advertisements based on browser type or other information that the tracking technologies provide; and for other purposes described in this Privacy Policy. 

"Session" cookies are temporary cookies used for various reasons, such as managing page views and your shopping cart. Typically, your browser will erase session cookies once you exit the browser. "Persistent" cookies are more permanent cookies that are stored on your computer or mobile device after you exit the browser. Persistent cookies allow us to retrieve certain information that you have previously provided to us (e.g., your user ID if you ask to be remembered). The Online Services may use both session and persistent cookies. 

The Online Services may also use "tracer tags," which are tiny graphic images placed on the Online Services or in our emails that allow us to determine whether you have performed certain actions. When you access these pages or open email messages, the tags generate a notice of that action to us or our service providers. These tools allow us to measure response to our communications and improve our web pages and promotions. 

Vitamin Shoppe has relationships with third party advertising companies to place advertisements on this website and other websites, and to perform tracking and reporting functions for this website and other websites.

However, these collections are independent from Vitamin Shoppe and are covered by these companies’ own privacy policy. We do not give any Personal Data to them as part of this process. This Privacy Policy does not cover the collection methods or use of the data collected by these third party advertising companies. For more information about third party advertising, please visit the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) at [www.networkadvertising.org](http://www.networkadvertising.org/). 

You may manage, block or delete cookies and other tracking technologies by adjusting your browser's security and privacy settings but, if you do so, you may not be able to use particular features of the Online Services.
