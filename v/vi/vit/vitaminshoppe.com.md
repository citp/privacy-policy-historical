However, The Vitamin Shoppe will share a list of customers who have purchased merchandise through our catalog (and possibly also through our website and/or retail stores) with third parties who may wish to offer you their goods and services.

### VI. Credit Card Security

The Internet is a vast network of computers. Because the data passes from computer to computer, some Internet shoppers worry that unauthorized persons may intercept the data and gain access to credit card numbers. Taking the steps below will lower the chances of interception of your credit card number: 

  * Limit your online shopping to Internet merchants, such as The Vitamin Shoppe, with sites equipped with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. SSL prevents unauthorized people from intercepting your data. 
  * Use a browser, such as Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer, that supports SSL. These browsers show a symbol in the status bar, such as a key or lock, when you are on a site that uses SSL. 



Credit card information collected by The Vitamin Shoppe is encrypted through Secure Sockets Layer before it is transmitted over the Internet.
