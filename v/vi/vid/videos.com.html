<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>At Videos.com, we recognize that privacy is important. This Privacy Policy 
applies to all of the services offered by Videos.com. In addition, where more 
detailed information is needed to explain our privacy practices, we post 
supplementary privacy notices to describe how particular services process 
personal information. These notices can be found where an addendum or 
modification is required, and will be made available at the time you are gaining 
access to that service or information.</p>
<h3>Information We Collect and How We Use It</h3>
<p>We primarily offer a search engine for videos that does not require you to 
provide any personally identifiable information (name, address, etc.). We do 
collect information as detailed below, to help us provide top quality search 
results and related services. In order to provide our full range of services, we 
may collect the following types of information:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Information you provide - When you sign up for a playlist account, we ask 
  you for your email address and an account password. If the password is lost or 
  forgotten, then it can be emailed to you at the email address you provide. We 
  may combine the information you submit under your account with information 
  from other Videos.com services or third parties in order to provide you with a 
  better experience and to improve the quality of our services. For certain 
  services, we may give you the opportunity to opt out of combining such 
  information. </li>
  <li>Cookies - When you visit Videos.com, we send one or more cookies (a small 
  file containing a string of characters) to your computer or other browsing 
  device that uniquely identifies your browser. We use cookies to improve the 
  quality of our service, including storage of user preferences, improving 
  search results and ad selection, and tracking user trends, such as how people 
  search. Videos.com also uses cookies in its advertising services to help 
  advertisers and publishers serve and manage ads across the web. We may set one 
  or more cookies in your browser when you visit a website, including Videos.com 
  sites that use our advertising cookies, and when you view or click on an ad 
  supported by Videos.com advertising services. </li>
  <li>Log information - When you access Videos.com services, our servers 
  automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a 
  website. These server logs may include information such as your web request, 
  Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time 
  of your request and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your 
  browser. </li>
  <li>User communications - When you send email or other communications to 
  Videos.com, we may retain those communications in order to process your 
  inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our services. </li>
  <li>Affiliated Videos.com Services on other sites - We offer some of our 
  services on or through other web sites. Personal information that you provide 
  to those sites may be sent to Videos.com in order to deliver the service. We 
  process such information under this Privacy Policy. The affiliated sites 
  through which our services are offered may have different privacy practices 
  and we encourage you to read their privacy policies. </li>
  <li>Applications and Plugins - Videos.com may make available third party 
  applications through its services. The information collected by Videos.com 
  when you enable an application or other plugin is processed under this Privacy 
  Policy. Information collected by the application or plugin provider is 
  governed by their privacy policies.</li>
  <li>Location data - Videos.com may receive information about your actual 
  location (such as GPS signals sent by a mobile device) or information that can 
  be used to approximate a location (such as a cell ID). </li>
  <li>Links - Videos.com may present links in a format that enables us to keep 
  track of whether these links have been followed. We use this information to 
  improve the quality of our search technology, customized content and 
  advertising. </li>
  <li>Other sites - This Privacy Policy applies to Videos.com services only. We 
  do not exercise control over the sites displayed as search results, sites that 
  include Videos.com applications, products or services, or links from within 
  our various services. These other sites may place their own cookies or other 
  files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Videos.com only processes personal information for the purposes described in 
this Privacy Policy and/or the supplementary privacy notices for specific 
services. In addition to the above, such purposes include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Providing our services, including the display of customized content and 
  advertising</li>
  <li>Auditing, research and analysis in order to maintain, protect and improve 
  our services</li>
  <li>Ensuring the technical functioning of our network</li>
  <li>Protecting the rights or property of Videos.com or our users</li>
  <li>Developing new services. </li>
</ul>
<p>You can find more information about how we process personal information by 
referring to the supplementary privacy notices for particular services. <br>
Videos.com processes personal information on our servers in the United States of 
America and in other countries. In some cases, we process personal information 
on a server outside your own country. We may process personal information to 
provide our own services. In some cases, we may process personal information on 
behalf of and according to the instructions of a third party, such as our 
advertising partners.</p>
<h3>Choices for Personal Information</h3>
<p>When you sign up for a particular service that requires registration, we ask 
you to provide personal information. If we use this information in a manner 
different than the purpose for which it was collected, then we will ask for your 
consent prior to such use.</p>
<p>If we propose to use personal information for any purposes other than those 
described in this Privacy Policy and/or in the specific service privacy notices, 
we will offer you an effective way to opt out of the use of personal information 
for those other purposes. We will not collect or use sensitive information for 
purposes other than those described in this Privacy Policy and/or in the 
supplementary service privacy notices, unless we have obtained your prior 
consent.</p>
<p>Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your 
browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. 
However, some Videos.com features and services may not function properly if your 
cookies are disabled.</p>
<p>You can decline to submit personal information to any of our services, in 
which case Videos.com may not be able to provide those services to you.</p>
<h3>Information Sharing</h3>
<p>Videos.com only shares personal information with other companies or 
individuals outside of Videos.com in the following limited circumstances:</p>
<ul>
  <li>We have your consent. We require opt-in consent for the sharing of any 
  sensitive personal information. </li>
  <li>We provide such information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies or 
  other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of processing personal 
  information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to process such 
  information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy 
  Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. </li>
  <li>We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure 
  of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, 
  regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce 
  applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations 
  thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or 
  technical issues, or (d) protect against harm to the rights, property or 
  safety of Videos.com, its users or the public as required or permitted by law.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>If Videos.com becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale 
of some or all of its assets, we will ensure the confidentiality of any personal 
information involved in such transactions and provide notice before personal 
information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
<br>
We may share with third parties certain pieces of aggregated, non-personal 
information, such as the number of users who searched for a particular term, for 
example, or how many users clicked on a particular advertisement. Such 
information does not identify you individually.</p>
<h3>Information Security</h3>
<p>We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access 
to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include 
internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and 
security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against 
unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data.</p>
<p>We restrict access to personal information to Videos.com employees, 
contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, 
develop or improve our services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality 
obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal 
prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.</p>
<h3>Data Integrity</h3>
<p>Videos.com processes personal information only for the purposes for which it 
was collected and in accordance with this Privacy Policy or any applicable 
service-specific privacy notice. We review our data collection, storage and 
processing practices to ensure that we only collect, store and process the 
personal information needed to provide or improve our services or as otherwise 
permitted under this Policy. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the 
personal information we process is accurate, complete, and current, but we 
depend on our users to update or correct their personal information whenever 
necessary.</p>
<h3>Accessing and Updating Personal Information</h3>
<p>When you use Videos.com services, we make good faith efforts to provide you 
with access to your personal information that will permit you to either&nbsp; 
correct the data if it is inaccurate, or to delete such data at your request if 
it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business 
purposes. We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information 
requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, 
and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or 
systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of 
others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning 
information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise 
required. In any case where we provide information access and correction, we 
perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a 
disproportionate effort. Some of our services have different procedures to 
access, correct or delete users' personal information. We provide the details 
for these procedures in the specific privacy notices or FAQs for these services.</p>
<h3>Enforcement</h3>
<p>Videos.com regularly reviews its compliance with this Privacy Policy. Please 
feel free to direct any questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy or 
Videos.com's treatment of personal information by contact us through this web 
site.</p>
<p>When we receive formal written complaints at this address, it is Videos.com's 
policy to contact the complaining user regarding his or her concerns. We will 
cooperate with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data 
protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of 
personal data that cannot be resolved between Videos.com and an individual.</p>
<h3>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will 
not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent, 
and we expect most such changes will be minor. Regardless, we will post any 
Privacy Policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will 
provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email 
notification of Privacy Policy changes).</p>
<p>If you have any additional questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, 
please feel free to contact us any time through this website.</p>
