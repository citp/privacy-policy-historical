**OUR COMMITMENT TO PRIVACY**

Our Privacy Policy has been developed as an extension of our commitment to combine quality products and services with integrity in dealing with users. The Policy is designed to assist you in the understanding of how we collect, use and protect the personal information provided to us.

**THE** **INFORMATION WE COLLECT**

When you visit our site, we collect two types of information: personal information you actively choose to disclose (“Active Information”) and information not visible to you that arises out of your browsing of our site (“Passive Information”). Please note that passive Information is collected on an aggregate and anonymous basis.

Personally Identifiable Information is information that identifies and is reasonably linked to you.

When you register to become an authorized reseller of our products or services, we will collect Personally Identifiable Information (such as name, address, email address, and telephone number). This Personally Identifiable Information is securely stored and may be accessed on our website. You are assigned an identification number and select your own password – both are needed to enter the Site and to access your Contact Information.  Please safeguard your password in a secure location as we are not responsible for breaches into the system when access is willingly provided.

  1. **Ordering**



When you place an order for products or services, we collect Personally Identifiable Information (such as name, contact and billing information, credit card, and other transactional information).

Occasionally, you may voluntarily provide Personally Identifiable Information to complete surveys and questionnaires or to participate in user polls.
