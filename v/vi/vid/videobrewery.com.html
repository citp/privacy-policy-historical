                <li><strong>Automatically Collected Information. </strong>Some information is automatically

                    may include some or all of the following items: the name of the domain and host
                    from which you access the Internet, including the Internet Protocol (IP) address
                    of the computer you are using and the IP address of your Internet Service Provider;
                    the type and version of Internet browser software you use and your operating system;
                    the date and time you access our site, the length of your stay and the specific
                    pages, images, video or forms that you access while visiting the site; the Internet
                    address of the website from which you linked directly to our Website, and if applicable,
                    the search engine that referred you and any search strings or phrases that you entered

                    the country of origin of your computer and the language(s) used by it. We use this
                    information to monitor the usage of our Website, assess its performance, ensure
                    technological compatibility with your computer, and understand the relative importance
                    of the information provided on our Website. We may also use this data to conduct
                    statistical analyses on visitors’ usage patterns and other aggregated data<a>.</a>
                </li>
                <li value="2"><strong>Information Collected via Cookies. </strong>“Cookies”
                    are small files or records that are placed on your computer’s hard drive to
                    distinguish you from other visitors to our Website. The use of cookies is a standard
                    practice among websites to collect or track information about your activities while
                    using our Website.
                    <p>A cookie may enable the website owner to track how a visitor navigates through its
                        website and the areas in which they show interest. This is similar to a traffic
                        report: it tracks trends and behaviors, but does not identify individuals. Information
                        gathered may include date and time of visits, pages viewed, time spent at the site,
                        and the website visited just before and just after a visit to our Website.</p>
                    <p>Cookies can be set to expire: (1) on a specified date; (2) after a specific period
                        of time; (3) when a transaction has been completed; or (4) when a user turns off
                        his/her Internet browser. A cookie that is erased from memory when a visitor’s
                        Internet browser closes is called a “session” cookie. Cookies that expire
                        based on a time set by the Web server are called “persistent” cookies.</p>
                    <p>Our Website may use both “session cookies” and “permanent cookies.”
                        Most people do not know that cookies are being placed on their computers when they
                        visit our Website or most websites because browsers are typically set to accept
                        cookies. You can choose to have your browser warn you every time a cookie is being
                        sent to you or you can turn off cookie placements. If you refuse cookies, there
                        may be parts of our Website that may not function properly<a>.</a></p>

                <li value="3"><strong>Information You May Actively Submit Through Our Website. </strong>
                    For most of the browsing on our Website, we neither require nor collect “User
                    Information.” User Information is information that could personally identify
                    you, for example, your name, address, phone number, e-mail address, and credit card
                    information. You can browse our Website and take as much time as you want to review
                    our services without having to submit such User Information. In the following instances,
                    however, we do need you to actively submit User Information when: (1) you want to
                    contact us via electronic means or website submission; (2) you utilize online ordering;
                    (3) you enter a contest or sweepstakes; or (4) you join our customer loyalty programs
                    and/or email lists. E-mail or other forms of electronic communication, including
                    website submission, are not secure and/or confidential means of communication<a>.</a>
                </li>

        </li>
        <li value="3"><strong>Security. </strong>We strive to maintain internal controls and
            procedures to ensure that the Information (as defined below) you share with us is
            handled in a safe, secure and responsible manner. We have security measures to help
            protect against loss, unauthorized access and alteration of the information in our
            control. We will only disclose such Information to employees and authorized service
            providers who require such information for the purposes described in this Policy.
            Our databases are protected by physical, technical, and procedural measures that
            restrict access to authorized person in accordance with this Policy. Although no
            data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed 100% secure, and we cannot
            ensure against any loss, misuse, unauthorized disclosure, alteration, or destruction
            of data, we take reasonable precautions to prevent such unfortunate occurrences.
            Our information systems are maintained behind a firewall to isolate them from access
            by other networks connected to the Internet, and access to Information is granted
            only to employees who need the information to perform a specific job.
            <p>Because your credit card security is a high priority, we have taken numerous steps
                to ensure your payment information is processed confidentially. Our Website use
                is secured during transmission using industry standard e-commerce security technology
                such as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology. We use SSL technology
                to prevent such information from being intercepted and read as it is transmitted
                over the Internet. Once this User Information is received by us and/or our third
                party processing merchants, it is stored format is masked and/or encrypted.</p>

        <li value="4"><strong>Personal Information About Children. </strong>Our Website is targeted
            primarily for use by adults. We do not currently market to or create special areas
            for use by children. Accordingly, we do not knowingly collect age identifying information,
            nor do we knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age
            of 13 years. However, we hereby advise all visitors to our site under the age of
            13 not to disclose or provide any personally identifiable information on our Website.
            In the event that we discover that a child under the age of 13 has provided personally
            identifiable information to us, in accordance with the Children’s Online Privacy
            Protection Act (please see the Federal Trade Commission’s website at http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/tech/tec08.shtm
            for more information about this Act), we will delete the child’s personally
            identifiable information from our files to the extent technologically possible<a>.</a>

        <li value="5"><strong>E-Mail Communications. </strong>When you send an email to us,
            or provide your email address to us, you are communicating with us electronically
            and consent to receive communication from us electronically. We may retain the content

            We may use the data that you provide to send you email or correspondence via other
            means. </li>
        <li value="6"><strong>How We Use and Share User Information. </strong>Our view on using
            User Information is simple. We do not rent or sell your personal or User Information
            (collectively, “Information”). We may use your Information that you
            actively submit to better assist you when you visit or call us again and to send
            you special offers that may be of interest to you. We do this by general marketing
            communications for our services, including by regular mail and e-mail, (collectively,
            “Marketing Communications”). Unless you “opt-out” through
            opportunities available to you through our Marketing Communications, we may send
            you Marketing Communications. You may also “opt-out” of future Marketing
            Communications by following the instructions provided in this Privacy Policy under
            the “Access to and Managing Your Information” section of this Privacy
            Policy. Except where we otherwise obtain your express permission, we share your
            Information with third parties only under the limited circumstances stated below:
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                <li>Information is subject to disclosure in response to judicial or other governmental
                    subpoenas, warrants and court orders served on us in accordance with their terms,
                    as otherwise required by applicable law, or in response to requests by law enforcement;
                </li>
                <li value="2">Information is subject to disclosure to protect our rights or property,
                    protect its legitimate business interests, to enforce the provisions of our Privacy
                    Policy and Terms of Use, and/or to prevent harm to you or others; </li>
                <li value="3">Information may be disclosed to carefully selected third-party service
                    providers in order to provide services to you, such as to complete orders (U.S.
                    Postal Service, Canada Post, or other delivery companies we or you select); provide
                    customer service; send or email Marketing Communications; maintain our customer
                    loyalty program and database and other programs; monitor the activity of our Website;
                    conduct surveys; and administer contests or sweepstakes. We will share your Information
                    with our carefully selected third-party services providers on a confidential basis.
                    These service providers are prohibited from using your Information for any purpose
                    other than providing our services. </li>
                <li value="4">Information may be disclosed to process credit card transactions. In this
                    case these transactions are handled by established third party banking, processing
                    agents and distribution institutions. They receive the information needed to verify
                    and authorize your credit card or other payment information and to process your
                    order. In addition, we may disclose Information to third parties to verify the authenticity
                    of any financial transaction involving our company or its subsidiaries. </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li value="7"><strong>Linking to Third-Party Website. </strong>When you click on links
            on our Website that take you to third-party websites, you will be subject to the
            third parties’ privacy policies. While we support the protection of privacy
            on the Internet, we cannot be responsible for the actions of any third-party websites.
            We encourage you to read the posted privacy policies of any and every website you
            visit, whether you are linking from our Website or browsing on your own. </li>
        <li value="8"><strong>Access to and Managing Your Information. </strong>We believe it
            is important for you to be able to: (1) find out what Information you have provided
            to us through our Website; (2) update your Information; and (3) “opt out”
            of receiving future Marketing Communications. To inquire about your Information,
            update your Information, or “opt” out of receiving future Marketing
            Communications, please do one of the following:
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                <li>Send an e-mail with your request and current contact information to support@videobrewery.com;

                <li value="2">Send a request in writing with your current contact information to: Demo
                    Duck, Inc. 1033 South Blvd. Suite 222, Oak Park, IL 60302. </li>
                <li value="3">If you send an e-mail or letter request, please be sure to include your
                    full name, address, phone number and e-mail address and indicate the specific nature
                    of your request. If you want to “opt in” or “opt out” of
                    receiving Marketing Communications, specifically what type of Marketing Communication
                    (e.g., e-mail or direct mail) you wish to receive or stop receiving. This will ensure
                    we identify you correctly in our systems and accurately process your request. We
                    will take appropriate steps to implement your request, but due to production, mailing
                    and system timelines, it may take up to: 10 business days for e-mails or 30 calendar
                    days for mail. Until that change takes effect, you may still receive or not receive
                    Marketing Communications from us. </li>
                <li value="4">Also, please note that even though you may have “opted out”
                    of receiving Marketing Communications, you may still receive business-related communications.
                    Please be aware that “opting-out” of certain third party use may prevent
                    us from providing certain services that you request<a>.</a> </li>

            have several options when deciding how you can best protect your Information. One
            option is simply not to volunteer it. As stated above, this approach would allow
            you to still visit our Website, although it will prevent you, for example, from
            ordering on-line or providing us with your comments or questions relating to our
            services. The Federal Trade Commission’s website, www.ftc.gov, also offers
