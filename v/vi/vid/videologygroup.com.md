###  What this privacy policy covers 

This policy covers how Videology, acting as data controller, treats information that Videology collects and receives through our services, which include Videology’s digital media and ad targeting solutions and any other technology, products and/or services offered by Videology (collectively referred to as the “Services”), including your past use of, or interaction with, the Services. For more information about our Products and Services, please [click here](http://www.videologygroup.com/products/). 

This policy does not apply to information about you collected by third party advertisers and publishers who use Videology’s Services, or other third parties linked to or otherwise accessible via the Services. The information collected or received by any such providers and third parties is subject to their own privacy policies. 

###  Collection and Use of Information 

####  Personal Information 

Videology offers its Services to other commercial businesses, not consumers. Videology does not require consumers to provide personal information when viewing or interacting with ads received through our customers to provide personal information when viewing or interacting with ads received through our customers' use of Services. Personal information is information  relating to you, such as name, street address and email address collected by Videology or otherwise received by Videology. However, on some pages of Videology’s corporate web site, you may choose to provide personal information to Videology for a specific purpose, such as when submitting a request for information, submitting a specific question to Videology about our Services or related to privacy, or requesting that Videology contact you. Additionally, if you enter into a business relationship with Videology, we may require that you provide us with personal information for administrative purposes, such as maintaining account information, preparing invoices and issuing payment. If you do provide us with personal information, your information shall only be used for the purpose for which it is submitted. 

####  IP Address 

Videology receives IP addresses from most users who view ads we deliver because, in most cases, this information is automatically sent to us by the internet browser software (e.g., Microsoft Explorer, Mozilla FireFox and Google Chrome) of those users each time we receive an ad request from our web site partners to deliver an ad to a site on which the users are viewing content. We use IP address to assist us to both deliver the ad and to select the most appropriate advertising based on geographic area or other information derived from the IP address of the web browser from whom we received an ad request, such as ISP provider. Aggregate information derived from IP addresses, such as the number of ad impressions delivered to a geographic region, may also be reported to our advertising clients. Finally, we may use IP address to help identify and combat potentially fraudulent activity. 

####  Non-Personally Identifiable Information 

When you visit a web site or view content on other Internet-enabled devices (e.g., smart/connected TV, gaming consoles, set-top boxes) that use our Services and view an ad that we’ve sent to that site or device, Videology may use cookies and other technologies (such as pixels or web beacons, if supported by the device) to record and store non-personally identifiable information about your interaction with the Services, most commonly known as “click-stream data” or “impression logs”. Click-stream data is associated with your device’s Internet browser/content delivery software (e.g., Microsoft Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome or a smart/connected TV or gaming console's browser) and can include information such as device type (e.g., computer, tablet, smart/connected TV), date/time of visit, browser type, web pages visited when viewing an ad we’ve sent in response to an ad request we received, and information on your interaction with the Services when viewing content on your device’s Internet browser, including whether you interacted with the ad (e.g., viewed the ad to completion or clicked on the ad), and what ad content you viewed (i.e., which ad we delivered to you). For more detailed information on cookies and web beacons, please see our [FAQs](http://www.videologygroup.com/faqs). 

In order to optimize the effectiveness of the Services for our clients (e.g. assist them with reaching their desired audience through targeted advertising), we use cookies and our servers to store non-personally identifiable behavioral and demographic profile data we receive from third party data providers, publishers and other partners we work with. This data may include such things as zip code, age, gender and income range, but cannot be tied to an individual and is stored in an encrypted format (e.g., random numbers, letters and symbols) within our cookies and/or on our servers. To learn more about third party data providers we work with, please [click here](http://www.videologygroup.com/third-party-data-partners/). 

In the case of mobile devices (e.g., mobile phones, tablets, etc.), some mobile inventory suppliers and third party service providers that we work with may provide us with the mobile advertising ID assigned to your device (i.e., a Google AdID for Android devices or an Apple IDFA for Apple devices) and, in some cases, additional non-personally identifiable demographic and behavioral data so that our advertising clients can use our platform technology to deliver more relevant advertising to you when you are using applications on your mobile device. Our third party service providers can also, in some instances, associate mobile advertising IDs with our cookies so that our advertising clients can use non-personally identifiable behavioral and demographic profile data associated with our cookies to deliver more relevant ads to you when you are using mobile apps on your mobile device. If you opt-out of Videology’s interest-based advertising by implementing our opt-out cookie on your browser (See “Access To and Choices About Your Information – Opting Out and Reviewing Your Ad Preferences“ below), we will no longer associate your mobile advertising ID with our cookies. Depending on the type of mobile device you use and the options provided by the mobile operating system (“mobile OS”) on your mobile device (in many cases, Google Android or Apple iOS), you may have the option within the settings on your mobile device to choose or limit how your mobile OS uses and/or shares the mobile advertising ID associated with the mobile OS on your mobile device. We ask that mobile inventory suppliers and third party service providers we work with to only provide us with mobile advertising IDs that they have obtained the necessary rights to share with us for the purpose of delivering more relevant advertising. For more information on how to select advertising options available within the Apple iOS and Google Android, please visit our opt-out page by[ clicking here](http://videologygroup.com/en/learn-about-interest-based-ads-opt-out). 

Additionally, our advertiser clients may request that we provide them with a web beacon (sometimes referred to as a clear GIF or 1x1 pixel) to place on their web page in order to identify Internet users, using non-personally identifiable information, who have visited their web page so that they may target ads to those users about the advertiser’s products/services based the visitor’s interest in those products/services. If an advertiser places our web beacon on their web page and you visit that web page, we may use cookies to identify that you visited that advertiser web page. These cookies use non-personally identifiable information to build an “audience” for the advertising client that is interested in the advertiser’s products/services based on your visit and interaction on their web page. At the advertising client’s request, we may target ads for that advertiser’s products/services to you based on your prior visit to their web page. This use of non-personally identifiable data to target ads for a particular advertiser is more commonly known as “retargeting” as the advertiser is looking to retarget a user that has already shown an interest in their products/services as evidenced by the user’s visit to the advertiser’s web page. 

####  Use and Disclosure 

Videology uses non-personal information it receives and collects to customize, target, and measure the effectiveness of the ads we deliver to you via the Service (including targeted advertising based on demographic characteristics, viewing preferences and behaviors), to prevent showing you the same ads repeatedly, for reporting on campaign delivery to both advertisers and digital media inventory partners, for general reporting purposes (such as the total number of ads delivered by Videology in a given month), and to predict the characteristics and preferences of the audience on sites that use our video advertising Services in order to assist (a) advertisers in targeting their campaigns to the most relevant audience, and (b) digital media inventory providers (such as web site owners) to better understand the make-up (types of users) who visit their site(s) so they can more effectively assist advertisers in finding the desired audience for their ad campaign(s). 

Videology uses personal information you provide to us to communicate with and respond to your inquiries, to conduct research about use of the Services; to fulfill your requests for products and services; to help offer you other products, services or offerings that may be of interest to you; and to provide anonymous internal and external reporting. Videology does not offer email marketing as part of the Services we provide to our customers, nor do we maintain email marketing lists for purposes of delivering targeted advertising to consumers via email. If, however, you choose to provide us with personal information including your email address (generally because you've chosen to contact through our corporate web site or are a customer of Videology), we will not use your email address to send commercial or marketing messages without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in and then to opt-out in the event you change your mind. We may, however, use your email address without further consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of important changes to the Services or for customer service purposes). 

Videology will not rent, sell or share information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies, except to provide the Services, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances: 

  * We will provide your information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with Videology under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal information to help Videology fulfill a transaction you requested or communicate with you about offers from Videology and our marketing partners. However, unless you have granted permission, these companies do not have any independent right to share or use this information for other purposes.
  * We work with third party vendors, partners, advertisers, publishers, demographic and behavioral data providers and other service and content providers. In order to optimize our Services and to better target advertisements, we may share non-personally identifiable information about you with them, including statistical and demographic data about our users and their interaction with the Services. We will not authorize these third party providers to share or use your information other than as necessary to provide the Services and to enhance user experience through targeting of ads.
  * If Videology, or part(s) of Videology, is acquired or merged with another company we will transfer information about you to the acquiring company.
  * Finally, Videology may share information on individuals it deems necessary to comply with a subpoena or court order, to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims, or to cooperate with government and law enforcement officials.



###  Third Party Service Providers 

Videology and its advertisers may use third party digital advertising and media companies, service providers and technology providers to help present advertisements to you via the Services. These third party providers may also use cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies on your device to collect click-stream data.
