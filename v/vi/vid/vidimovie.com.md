## Third Party Cookies

### Google Analytics

This site utilises Google Analytics, a popular web traffic analysis package provided by Google Inc. ("Google"). Google utilizes the Data collected to track and examine the use of this Application, to prepare reports on its activities and share them with other Google services. Google may use the Data collected to contextualize and personalize the ads of its own advertising network.

Google Analytics does not collect any personal information about website users. Read the [Google Analytics privacy](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245) document for more details.

For complete information on the cookie Google Analytics sets and which information it collects, please refer directly to the [cookie usage](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/cookie-usage) section on the Google Developers website.

### CloudFlare

CloudFlare is a traffic optimization and distribution service provided by CloudFlare Inc. The way CloudFlare is integrated means that it filters all the traffic through this Application, i.e. communication between this Application and the User's browser, while also allowing analytical data from this Application to be collected.

We use Cloudflare for our DNS and they set the __cfduid cookie which is used to override any security restrictions based on the IP address the visitor is coming from. For example, if the visitor is in a coffee shop where there are a bunch of infected machines, but the visitor's machine is known trusted, then the cookie can override the security setting. It does not correspond to any user id in the web application, nor does the cookie store any personally identifiable information.

This cookie is strictly necessary for site security operations and cannot be turned off.

Full details can be found in the CloudFlare [security policy](https://www.cloudflare.com/security-policy) article.
