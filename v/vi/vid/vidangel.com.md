Effective Date: October 12, 2013

In this Privacy Policy (“Policy”), we describe the information that we collect from users of our Site.  This Policy applies to our website, [www.](http://www.vidangel.com/)[VidAngel](http://www.vidangel.com/)[.com](http://www.vidangel.com/) and mobile applications (the “Site”) and the Products, Services, Subscriptions or Memberships (“Product(s)”) that you can purchase on the Site or offers we make available through the Site.

**What Information Do We Collect About You and Why?**

The information we collect from you enables us to fulfill your request for our Products – namely, to send you bad breath and oral care supplies that you order and receive through our Site – to send you information or content in which you may be interested, and keep you abreast of any updates related to our Site.  We also use this information to personalize and continually improve our Site and Products.  Here are the types of information we gather:

Information We Collect Directly From You.  You may browse our Site without registering.  If you would like to place an order or request information from us, then we require you to register with us and become a member on our Site so that we can fulfill your request.  To register with us, we request your name and email address.  As a part of the registration process, we may ask you to select a password.  In certain circumstances, such as when making a purchase, we will request that you provide your credit or debit card information and your billing and shipping address.

Information that We Collect About You from Facebook, Twitter, Yahoo, or Google.  You may also log-in to our Site using your Facebook, Twitter, Yahoo, or Google account.  These services control the information collected from you during the log-in process; VidAngel does not control the information that the above mentioned services collect from you.

If you log-in to our Site using Facebook, Twitter, Yahoo, or Google, you must enter your respective login ID and password for that particular service.  We will also ask that you grant us permission to (i) access and collect your basic information (this includes your name, profile picture, gender, networks, user IDs, list of friends, date of birth, email address, and any other information you have you have set to public on your account); (ii) send you email; (iii) post to your Wall; (iv) access posts in your news feed; and (v) access your Facebook, Twitter, Yahoo, or Google data at any time even if you are not using these services.  Please note, if you allow VidAngel to have access to this information, then VidAngel will have access to this information even if you have chosen not to make that information public.

For information about how Facebook, Twitter, Yahoo, or Google may disclose your information, including any information you make public, please consult the each service’s Privacy Policy.  We have no control over how Facebook, Twitter, Yahoo, or Google uses or discloses the personal information you provide to it.  We store the information that we receive from Facebook, Twitter, Yahoo, or Google along with other information that we collect from you or receive about you.

Information We Collect Automatically.  On our Site, we may use cookies, web beacons, and other automated devices to collect information about you when you visit our Site and register for the Site.  Specifically, we may collect the following information about your use of the Site via these technologies:  your domain name; your browser type and operating system; web pages you view; links you click; your IP address; length of time you visit our Site; and the referring URL, or the webpage that led you to our Site.  Please see the section “What About Cookies and Other Tracking Mechanisms?” below for more information about our use of cookies and other tracking mechanisms.

We may also use automated devices and applications, such as Google Analytics and Facebook Insights, to track usage of our Site.  We may use the information gathered through these methods in anonymous or aggregated form to analyze ways to improve our Site.  This information may also be associated with your username or email address and may be combined with other information, including personally identifiable information that we collect about you.

**What About Cookies and Other Tracking Mechanisms?**

We use cookies or other tracking mechanisms to track information, as described above, about your use of our Site.  Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your web browser for record-keeping purposes. Some cookies allow us to make it easier for you to navigate our Site, while other cookies are used to enable a faster log-in process or to allow us to track your activities at the Site.  There are two types of cookies: session-based and persistent-based cookies. We also allow vendors to use cookies on our Site.

Session Cookies.  Session cookies exist only during an online session.  They disappear from your computer when you close your browser or turn off your computer.  We use session cookies to allow our systems to uniquely identify you during a session or while you are logged in to the Site.  This allows us to process your online transactions and requests and verify your identity, after you have logged in, as you move through our Site.

Persistent cookies.  Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you have closed your browser or turned off your computer.  We use persistent cookies to track aggregate and statistical information about user activity, which may be combined with other user information.

Third Party Cookies. We may also engage third parties to track and analyze non-personally and personally identifiable Site data.  We use the data collected by such third parties to help us administer and improve the quality of the Site and to analyze Site usage.  Such third parties may combine the information that we provide about you with other information that they have collected.  This Policy does not cover such third parties’ use of the data.

Disabling Cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in the future.  The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Visitors to our Site who disable their web browsers’ ability to accept cookies will be able to browse the Site; however, some Site features may not function if you disable cookies.

Local Storage Objects.  We may use Flash Local Storage Objects (“Flash LSOs”) in order to store your Site preferences and to personalize your visit.  Flash LSOs are different from browser cookies because of the amount and type of data stored.  In addition, you cannot control, delete, or disable the acceptance of Flash LSOs through your browser.  For more information on Flash LSOs, or to learn how to manage your settings for Flash cookies, go to the [Adobe Flash Player Help Page](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html), choose “[Global Storage Settings Panel](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager03.html)“ and follow the instructions.  To see the Flash LSOs currently on your computer, choose “[Website Storage Settings Panel](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html)“ and follow the instructions to review and, if you choose, to delete any specific Flash LSO.

Clear GIFs, pixel tags and other technologies.  Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer’s hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages. We may use clear GIFs (a.k.a. web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with our Site to, among other things, track the activities of Site visitors, help us manage content, and compile statistics about Site usage.  We and our third party service providers also use clear GIFs in HTML e-mails to our customers, to help us track e-mail response rates, identify when our e-mails are viewed, and track whether our e-mails are forwarded.

Site Analytics.  As noted, we may use automated devices and applications, such as Google Analytics, to evaluate usage of our Site.  We also may use other analytic means to evaluate our Site.  We use these tools to help us improve our Site, performance and user experiences.

Third-Party Ad Networks.  We may use third parties such as network advertisers to serve advertisements on our Site.  Please see the section “What About Third-Party Ad Networks?” below for additional information about our practices and your choices with regard to receiving such advertisements.

**What About Third-Party Ad Networks?**

We may display advertisements on our Site, participate in third party ad networks and make available to our Site users specific offers from third-party companies.  We use third parties such as network advertisers to serve advertisements on our Sites.  Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements based on your visits to our Sites and other websites you have visited.  This enables us and these third parties to target advertisements to you for products and services in which you might be interested.  Third party ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you.  These third party cookies and other technologies are governed by each third party’s specific privacy policy, not this one.  We may provide these third-party advertisers with information about your usage of our Site and our services, as well as aggregate or non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our Site and users of our service.  However, we will not disclose personally identifiable information to these network advertisers.
