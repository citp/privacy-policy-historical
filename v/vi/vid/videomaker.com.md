# Privacy Policy | Videomaker.com

**Videomaker Magazine** has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for the website. Videomaker Online is located at http://www.videomaker.com. 

We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our web site. Your IP address is used to help identify you as you navigate through the web site and may be used to track banner ad impressions and click-through data. 

Our site uses a cookie to keep track of your identity as you visit areas of the site open only to registered members. This cookie contains your email address and lasts for one year. Another cookie is used to remember your password at Club Vid. This cookie lasts only 32 days. We also use cookies to keep track of data for server log information. 

Our site's registration form requires users to give us contact information (like their name and email address). This contact information may be used to provide visitors with product news and other non-commercial information. Visitors to the web site may opt-out of receiving future mailings: see the choice/opt-out section below. **Videomaker Magazine** does not sell or share its email addresses with any others, but does sell or share names and postal addresses of visitors with others. 

This site contains links to other sites. **Videomaker Magazine** is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. 

## Transaction Security

We electronically verify each transaction with the credit company, processing only those orders if the credit company so authorizes it. In the case of a suspicious or declined transaction, our company may contact you to confirm the validity and ensure your identity or cancel that order with full notification.

We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input at 128-bit strength. This is often symbolized on most web-browsers by a small padlock appearing on the bottom bar of the window and the address of the window changing from http:// to https://, meaning a secure connection. In the event that an order cannot be completed, please contact our Customer Service. If our website cannot establish a secure connection, we will not risk your confidential information (it will not be transmitted).

## Choice/Opt-Out Section

Our site provides users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from us at the point where we request information about the visitor. Users may request that information be deleted from our database by sending email to [customerservice@videomaker.com](mailto:customerservice@videomaker.com).
