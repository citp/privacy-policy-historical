<p> Video Marketing Queen, Inc. (hereinafter  “Company”) has  established this Online Privacy Policy so that you can understand the  care with which we intend to treat your Personal Information.</p>
<p> Personal Information means any information that may be  used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a  first and last name, a home or other physical address and an email  address or other contact information, whether at work or at home.

<p> COMPANY strives to comply with all applicable laws  around the globe that are designed to protect your privacy. Although  legal requirements may vary from country to country, COMPANY intends  to adhere to the principles set forth in this Online Privacy Policy  even if, in connection with the above, we transfer your Personal  Information from your country to countries that may not require an  “adequate” level of protection for your Personal Information. In  other words, our goal is to provide protection for your Personal  Information no matter where that Personal Information is collected,  transferred, or retained.</p>
<p> <strong>Cookies and Other  Tracking Technologies</strong></p>
