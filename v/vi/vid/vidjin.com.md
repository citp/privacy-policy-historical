### **BACKGROUND**

Rock Sol, Inc. ("Rock Sol","we", "us", "our") provides a website located at http://www.vidjin.com/ and any other websites owned or operated by Rock Sol(collectively, the "Website") for users of the Website ("Member(s)", "User(s)", "you"). This Privacy Policy explains our policies regarding information you provide and we collect and how we may use or disclose that information. We value your privacy and provide this Privacy Policy to help you make informed decisions about your use of the Website.

The Privacy Policy is part of and subject to the Website's Terms of Use. By becoming a Member or using any part of the Website or its resources, features, functionality or services (hereafter referred to as the 'Service'), you agree that you and any personally identifiable information provided are subject to the Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy.

  


### **INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT**

We do not collect personally-identifiable information about you unless you provide us with such information via registration as a member ("Member") or participation in or use of the Service, Member services or otherwise, including without limitation when you choose to connect or sign on to the Website through a third-party service, upload photos, post comments, collect and disclose videos, or take part in any promotions. We also may require you to provide additional personally-identifiable information when utilizing Member services, registration, or features, such as name, email address, your phone number, billing, shipping and other credit card or payment processing information. Without intending to be exhaustive but by way of example of provided information: 

As part of registration, you are required to give contact information such as name, address, email address and date of birth. We request and use this information for various Member-related purposes, including determining your eligibility to use the Website, maintaining and monitoring an account associated with your membership, and determining eligibility for and/or availability of features or services.

As part of features or services involving merchandise or goods, we also use and may share or disclose certain personally identifiable information to address fulfillment requirements including billing, payment, and shipping. For example, to send you a good, we may use a third-party shipper and, in turn will provide that shipper with the necessary information to have them deliver the good(s) to you. Any credit card or other method of payment made by you will be through a third-party payment processor which will determine the information it needs from you and will be responsible for obtaining and maintaining that information from you under its own terms and policies, including whether any of that information is shared with us and, if so, under what conditions. Under no circumstances do we permanently store credit card information either on or outside the Website.

You may invite others to become members. If you do, we will ask you for your friend's email address. We automatically will send your friend an email inviting her or him to visit the Website and join. Rock Sol will not resend this invitation unless you specifically request that we do so. Rock Sol stores the email information you have provided for the sole purposes of sending this email and assessing elements of the invitation program. If your friend wishes to have this information removed from our database, your friend may contact us from our contact us page to request this action.

You may voluntarily upload photos or images that contain your likeness and/or that of others, post or share comments or reviews that may contain or disclose personally identifiable information, or disclose or collect video content that contains personally identifiable information. In doing so, you acknowledge and agree that all such information you post, collect, or otherwise make available on or through the Website or Service becomes a Submission under the Terms of Use and published content that (1) no longer constitutes personally identifiable information subject to the Privacy Policy and (2) becomes publicly available such that it can be collected, viewed, redistributed, and used by others, including without limitation, on the Website and, more broadly, through the Internet and other media channels. 

In addition to information you provide and we maintain, we may collect certain information by automatically recording your IP address, placing "cookies" on your computer (see below for more details), and/or creating log files or mechanisms to help us recognize your browser, enable your use of certain Website functionality, diagnose problems with our server, administer and improve our Website, understand your preferences, tailor advertising or other information for you based on information derived from your IP address, 'cookies' or log files, and generally enhance your overall experience on the Website and/or with the Service.

We gather broad demographic information about our Members as well as specific information associated with your use of the Service or particular Website features (e.g. frequency of use and purchase and viewing history) and any other information you provide to us directly or via your use of the Website. We use your information (personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable) to personalize your experience and support your use and access to information regarding the Website and the Service (including in connection with Website-related maintenance, performance, design, backup and analysis, service updates, and your membership), analyze usage, respond to inquiries from you, notify or update you about features and promotions, fulfill your orders, provide customer service, address or prevent potentially prohibited and/or illegal activities, and determine compliance with and enforce the Terms of Use, including this Privacy Policy. 

We also may share, disclose, or otherwise use your personally-identifiable information or likeness with your consent or authorization, including without limitation, such information collected through a third-party service which you have chosen to provide us by using that service to connect or sign on to the Website. We do not, however, share your personally identifiable information with third-party companies for their commercial or marketing use without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you have an ability to opt-in or opt-out using a commercially reasonable means.

Cookies—When you visit the Website, we may send one or more cookies - a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters - to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. We use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the website. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser help file directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser.

You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to notify you when a cookie is being sent so that you can accept or refuse it. However, please note that some features of the Website may not function properly or as intended if the ability to accept cookies is disabled. Also, if you change your computer, change your internet browser (e.g. from Internet Explorer to Firefox), or delete all your cookies, you will need to renew your preferences.

In addition, we may also use clear GIFs in HTML-based emails sent to you to track which emails are opened by recipients.

  


### **CHILDREN'S PRIVACY**

Pursuant to the terms of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), we do not knowingly collect personally–identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen (13). The Website and the Service are not directed at children under the age of thirteen (13), and by using the Website or Service and/or registering as a Member, you represent that you are not under the age of thirteen (13). Parents or legal guardians may not agree to the Terms of Use, this Privacy Policy, or the disclosure of such child's personally–identifiable information on such child's behalf. If we learn that personally identifiable information of persons less than thirteen (13) years of age, then we will take appropriate steps to delete this information.

  


### **SECURITY AND CONFIDENTIALITY**

The security of your personally-identifiable information is important to us, and so we take commercially reasonable steps to maintain the security of that information. Without being exhaustive, some of those steps include: When you want to make a payment to us, we do not take the payment processing information but instead direct you to a third party payment processor that encrypts that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL); we use measures to monitor and review account activity and behavior in an effort to detect fraudulent activity or other anomalies; we also allow you to choose privacy settings for certain social networking or other portions of the Website. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is perfect or100% secure. Nor can we control the actions of other users or members with whom you share your information. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee or warrant the security of any information you provide through your use of this Website, including without limitation, no guarantee that only authorized people will view your information and that the information may not be disclosed, accessed, altered, become publicly available, or even destroyed. You agree that you provide information at your own risk and specifically release us from any liability related in any way to such information or breach of security. Likewise, we are not responsible for any third party violations or efforts to circumvent any privacy settings or security measures on the Website. Any user identification names or passwords you use (whether provided by you or us) shall be maintained by you as confidential and should not be shared with anyone not authorized to have access to your personally–identifiable information. You are responsible for and should take steps to reduce the risk of disclosure of such identification names or passwords, including, without limitation, using different passwords than you use elsewhere, using strong passwords, and updating your antivirus software on a regular basis. You acknowledge and agree that any information posted by you or provided to us to be posted on publicly accessible portions of the Website may be read or utilized by any person with access to such portions of the Website.

Creating your own social network can be fun and rewarding, but remember to be mindful about information and images you post and with whom you choose to connect or share information. We suggest you avoid posting or sharing information, photos, videos or other content that you do not want to become public, would not share with a stranger (or that you wouldn't want a co-worker, parent or future employer to view) and/or that provide personal information about you or where you live or work. Keep in mind that there is no guarantee that a Member or user is who they say they are, and that you should be cautious about connecting with people (on or away from the Website) you "meet" via the Website, but don't otherwise know personally.

Finally, we reserve the right to take any action with respect to information posted on the Website, including, but not limited to, taking down information or other materials and terminating your Membership and rights of use, but we cannot, nor do we, review, edit and/or control the information provided by any Member or content provider which is made available through the Website.

Members are responsible for the contents of and activities in the account associated with their membership. We also use the account information to determine eligibility for or make certain features or services available to members. Therefore, if there are errors in the account information or your personally identifiable information changes or needs to be updated, you are responsible for making the needed corrections or updates and should do so through the My Account section of the Website.

If you have any questions about information security or confidentiality on the Website, please contact us on our contact us page.

An advertiser also may use information (but not any personally identifiable information) regarding your use of the Website, such as the number of times you viewed an ad, to determine which additional ads to deliver to you.
