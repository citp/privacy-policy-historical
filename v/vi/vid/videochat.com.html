				We know you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate 
				your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly. This notice describes our 
				privacy policy. <strong>By visiting VideoChat.com, you are accepting the practices 
				described in this Privacy Notice.</strong>
		
				<br><br>
		
		
				<h3>What Personal Information About Customers Does VideoChat.com Gather?</h3>
			
				The information we learn from customers helps us personalize and continually improve 
				your experience at VideoChat.com. Here are the types of information we gather.
		
				<br><br>
		
				<ul><li><strong>Information You Give Us</strong></li></ul>
				
					<p style="margin-left: 40px;">We receive and store any information you enter on our Web site or give us in 
					any other way.  You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might 
					not be able to take advantage of many of our features. We use the information that 
					you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing future 
					visits for you, improving our services, and communicating with you.</p>
				
					<p style="margin-left: 40px;">You provide most such information when you buy, or participate in a contest or 
					questionnaire, or communicate with customer service. For example, you provide 
					information when you purchase a product; join a site; provide information to customer 
					support regarding an account (you might have more than one if you have used more than 
					one e-mail address, user name, or credit card when shopping with us); communicate 
					with us by phone, e-mail, or otherwise; or complete a questionnaire or a contest 
					entry form. As a result of those actions, you might supply us with such information 
					as your name, address, and phone number; credit card information; e-mail addresses; 
					birth date and content of e-mails to us.</p>
						
				
				<ul><li><strong>Automatic Information</strong></li></ul>
				
					<p style="margin-left: 40px;">We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For 
					example, like many Web sites, we use "cookies," and we obtain certain types of information 
					when your Web browser accesses VideoChat.com.  A number of companies offer utilities 
					designed to help you visit Web sites anonymously. Due to the sensitive issues involving 
					access to adult content by children, we do not permit access to our sites from 
					these anonymous services.</p>
			
					<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Examples of the information we collect and analyze include the Internet protocol 
					(IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet; login name; e-mail 
					address; password; computer and connection information such as browser type and 
					version, operating system, and platform; purchase history; the full Uniform 
					Resource Locators (URL) clickstream to, through, and from our Web site, including 
					date and time; cookie number; products you viewed; services you visited; your 
					customer service history, and phone number used to call our 800 number.</p>
						
			
				<ul><li><strong>E-mail Communications</strong></li></ul>
				
					<p style="margin-left: 40px;">To help us make e-mails more useful and interesting, we often receive a confirmation 
					when you open e-mail from VideoChat.com. We also compare our customer list to lists 
					received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages 
					to our customers. If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, 
					simply send email to <a href="mailto:confirm@videochat.com">confirm@videochat.com</a>.</p>
				
			
				
					
				<h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">What About Cookies?</h3>
				
				<ul>
				
					<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard 
					drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser 
					and to provide features such as "What's New".</li>
					
					<li>The "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent 
					your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when 
					you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. However, cookies 
					allow you to take full advantage of some of VideoSecrets' coolest services, and 
					we recommend that you leave them turned on. </li>
			
				</ul>
					
			
		
				<h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">Does VideoChat.com Share the Information It Receives?</h3>
					
				Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in 
				the business of selling it to others. We share customer information only with the 
				subsidiaries VideoChat.com, controls and as described below.
				
				<br><br>
			
				<ul><li><strong>Agents:</strong></li></ul>
				
					<p style="margin-left: 40px;">We employ other companies and individuals 
					to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include processing credit card payments 
					in real time, sending e-mail notifications or updates, and providing customer 
					service. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, 
					but they do not have our authorization to use it for other purposes.</p>
					
				
				<ul><li><strong>Promotional Offers:</strong></li></ul>
				
					<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Sometimes we send offers to 
					selected groups of VideoSecrets customers on behalf of other businesses. When we do 
					this, we do not give that business your name and address. If you do not want to 
					receive such offers, please send email 
					to <a href="mailto:confirm@vs.com">confirm@vs.com</a></p>
					
				
				<ul><li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong></li></ul>
				
					<p style="margin-left: 40px;">As we continue to develop our 
					business, we might sell or buy sites or assets. In such transactions, customer 
					information may be one of the transferred business assets. Also, in the unlikely 
					event that VideoSecrets, or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer 
					information will of course be one of the transferred assets.</p>
					
					
				<ul><li><strong>Protection of VideoChat.com and Others:</strong></li></ul>
				
					<p style="margin-left: 40px;">We release account and other personal information when 
					we believe release is appropriate to comply with law; enforce or apply our Terms and 
					Conditions and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of 
					VideoChat.com, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with 
					other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</p>
					
			
				<ul><li><strong>With Your Consent:</strong></li></ul>
				
					<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Other than as set out above, you 
					will receive notice when information about you might go to third parties, and you will 
					have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.</p>
			

			
		
				<h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">How Secure Is Information About Me?</h3>
				
				<ul>
				
					<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using 
					Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input.</li>
			
					<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">We reveal only the last eight digits of your credit card numbers when confirming 
					an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate 
					credit card company during order processing.</li>
					
					<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your account 
					passwords and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared 
					computer.</li>
			
				</ul>
					
				
				
				
				<h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">What Information Can I Access?</h3>
					
				VideoChat.com gives you access to the following information about you 
				for the limited purpose of viewing and, in certain cases, updating that information. 
				This list will change as our Web site evolves.
				
				<ul>
				
					<li><a href="/my-account/?service=girls&amp;mp_code=b5xy&amp;source_code=videochat.com&amp;PHPSESSID=8hd1ql91jgu4ldprcpmedvtl47">Your Account</a></li>
				
				</ul>
				
				<br><br>
		
		
		
			
				<h3>What Choices Do I Have?</h3>
					
				<ul>
				
					<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide information, even 
					though it might be needed to make a purchase.</li>
					
					<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">You can add or update certain information on pages such as those listed in the 
					"What Information Can I Access?" section above. When you update information, we 
					usually keep a copy of the prior version for our records.</li>
					
					<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please send 
					email to <strong>confirm@videochat.com</strong> (If you 
					do not want to receive Terms and Conditions and other legal notices from us, 
					such as this Privacy Notice, those notices will still govern your use of 
					VideoChat.com, and it is your responsibility to review them 
					for changes.)</li>
					
					<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">The "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent 
					your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when 
					you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. However, you 
					will not be able to use such services as VideoChat.com and other 
					live shows if you do not use cookies.</li>
					
					<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">In addition, the Federal Trade Commission provides useful information about 
					online privacy on its own <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/online/sitesee/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Web site</a>.</li>
			
				</ul>
