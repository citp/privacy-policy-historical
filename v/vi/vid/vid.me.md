##  Privacy Policy 

Last updated: December 3, 2013 

Welcome to Vidme! We respect your privacy rights and we created this policy to help you understand what information we collect and how we use it when you use our websites, mobile applications, and other services (collectively, the “Services”). 

What information do we collect? 

In operating our Services, we may ask you to provide personally identifiable information such as your name, phone number, e-mail address, contact information of your contacts, and other contact information. 

We also get technical information when you use our products. Such information is collected via: 

1.) Automatic Collection. Our servers automatically recognize visitors' IP addresses (the number assigned to computers on the Internet), Internet service provider, browser type, computer platform, referring web site, date and time of access, links clicked through, and possibly other information as well. No personal information about you is revealed in this process. The Site may also gather anonymous "traffic data" that does not personally identify you, but that may be helpful for marketing purposes or for improving the services we offer. 

2.) Cookies. From time to time, we may use the standard "cookies" feature of major browser applications that allows us to store a small piece of data on your computer about your visit to our Site. If you create an account on our Site, we may store your email address and a unique account tracking identification code in a cookie on your computer so that the Site remembers you. Cookies also help us learn which areas of our Site are useful and which areas need improvement. Our advertisers may also use cookies on our Site. We have no access to or control over these cookies once Site advertisers have been given permission to set cookies. This Policy only covers use of cookies by the Company itself, and does not cover use of cookies by any Site advertiser. You can choose whether to accept cookies by changing the settings on your browser. However, if you choose to disable this function, your experience at our Site may be diminished and some features may not work as they were intended. We may also adopt newer technologies serving some of the same functions as cookies (including by way of example only, and not of limitation, HTML 5 local storage) from time to time. 

3.) Global Positioning System (GPS) Functionality. When you access our Site using a GPS-enabled (or equivalent "location-aware") device, we may collect this information from your device, and use it to provide certain location-based services, and you hereby consent to our collection and use of all such information. By way of example only, and not of limitation, we may use this information to display your distance from or your current location to other Members with whom you are "friends" or with whom you share a group (or equivalent). You may disable this functionality by altering your device settings so that location information is no longer made available, but if you do so this could negatively affect your experience while using or otherwise accessing the Site. 

How do we use the information we collect? 

1.) Personal Information. We will not share your personal information with any third parties without your consent, except as necessary or appropriate to provide you with our services or to comply with the law. We may use your personal information to verify your identity. We may also use your contact information to inform you of any changes to our Services, to send you additional information about the Company and/or the Site, and to offer you other products, programs or services that we believe may be of interest to you from time to time. 

2.) Anonymous Information. We use anonymous information to analyze our Site traffic, but we do not examine this information for individually identifying information. In addition, we may use anonymous IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our Site, or to display the content according to your preferences. Traffic and Site activity information may also be shared with advertisers and other third parties on an aggregate and anonymous basis. 

3.) Use of Cookies. We may use cookies (and other technologies having similar functions, such as HTML 5 local storage) to deliver content specific to your interests, to remember you when you return to the Site, or for other purposes. Promotions or advertisements displayed on our Site may also contain cookies (or technologies with similar function). We do not have access to or control over information collected by outside advertisers on our Site. 

4.) Disclosure of Personal Information. We may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on the Company or its affiliates, (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of the Company or of Site users, or (iii) act under exigent circumstances to protect the safety of Site users or the public at large. 

5.) Sale of Assets. In order to accommodate changes in our business, we may sell or buy portions of our company or other companies or assets, including the information collected through the Site. If the Company or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will be one of the assets transferred to the acquirer. 

Device and contact information 

Certain features of the Services require access to your device's native phonebook and image storage applications (e.g., to find friends or to store a message in your photo gallery). If you choose to find friends, the phone numbers in your device's native phonebook will be transmitted to our servers. Although you may decide whether or not to use these features, on Android devices you grant Vidme permission to access these features as part of the installation process. If you later decide to revoke this permission, you can do so by following the standard uninstall process and removing the Vidme mobile application from your device. Alternatively, on iOS devices, you can grant or revoke your consent at any time and prevent us from continuing to access your phonebook and image storage applications by changing the settings on your device. 

Children 

Our Services are intended for adults, and we do not direct any of our content or services at minors under 13 years of age. We understand and are committed to respecting the sensitive nature of children's privacy online. If we learn or have reason to suspect that a Site user is under 13 years of age, we will promptly take any action we may deem appropriate, including without limitation conducting further inquiry/investigation and/or deleting that user's account. 

Security 

We have security measures in place to prevent the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information that we obtain from you, but we can make no assurances regarding our ability to prevent any such loss, misuse or alteration. 

Push notifications and alerts 

We may send push notifications or alerts to your device. You can deactivate these messages at any time by changing your settings within our mobile application (Android) or by changing the notification settings on your device (iOS).

If you have any questions about this Policy, or, our practices related to our Services, please submit your questions to hello@bitkitchen.co 

Updates and changes 

We reserve the right, at any time, to add to, change, update, or modify this Policy, simply by posting such change, update, or modification on the Site and without any other notice to you. Any such change, update, or modification will be effective immediately upon posting on the Site. It is your responsibility to review this Policy from time to time to ensure that you continue to agree with all of its terms.
