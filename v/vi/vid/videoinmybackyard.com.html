VIMBY will not disclose, transfer, sell or otherwise communicate your personal information to any third party, unless you give VIMBY permission to do so, except as set forth in this privacy policy. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary, VIMBY may disclose any information you provide if required to do so by law or pursuant to a request by law enforcement or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is necessary to (1) comply with the law or with the legal process; (2) protect and defend the rights or property of VIMBY or third parties; or (3) act in an emergency to protect someone's safety or legal rights ("Mandatory Disclosures"). As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets or change our name or form of entity, and, depending upon the transaction, your personal information may be one of the transferred assets; provided, however, we will not sell or transfer personal information except subject to the terms of our privacy policy. For instance, in the event that VIMBY is acquired by another company, your persona information may be part of the assets transferred to the acquiring party. VIMBY will notify you before personal information about you becomes subject to a different privacy policy. The collected information may be provided in the aggregate to third parties, including potential business partners and advertisers, but this information is not linked to any personal information before it is disclosed unless VIMBY has obtained your consent.
